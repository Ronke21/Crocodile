<text>Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along! is a half-hour preschool children&#x27;s television series that was shown on PBS in the United States from January 13, 1992, until September 22, 1995, with reruns airing on PBS until January 4, 1998, and on KTV FAVE - KIDZ in 2019. It was created and hosted by the puppeteer Shari Lewis, and featured her puppet characters Lamb Chop, Charlie Horse, and Hush Puppy. The series was based on several home videos Lewis created throughout the 1980s, particularly the 1988 video &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Sing-Along, Play-Along&quot;. &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along!&quot; was followed by the short-lived spin-off series, &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;.

==Premise==
Lamb Chop is an anthropomorphic sheep puppet who lives with her guardian Shari Lewis and her two siblings, Charlie Horse (an anthropomorphic horse puppet) and Hush Puppy (an anthropomorphic dog puppet). In each episode, Lewis encourages the audience to participate or interact in a number of activities through several segments, including those involving crafts, songs and stories. The shows are wrapped around with a multiple-act segment known as &quot;At Home With Lamb Chop&quot;, which typically revolves around a situation involving one of the puppet characters.

==Production==
PBS commissioned the show from Shari Lewis in May 1991, and the show premiered in January 1992. This marked Lewis&#x27; return to television after about 15 years (following the BBC version of &quot;The Shari Lewis Show&quot; in 1975). &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; was shot in Canada, first in Burnaby, British Columbia and then at the CBC Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The series honored Lewis&#x27; father, college professor Abraham Hurwitz, who died in 1981. He is referred to as &quot;the official magician of New York City&quot;.

Ellensburg Daily Record said &quot;each half hour is filled with jokes, games, songs, and tricks&quot;.

==Broadcast==
WTTW jointly distributed it with Paragon Entertainment Corporation to PBS stations across the country. The rights to the show are currently owned by Universal Television on behalf of DreamWorks Classics.

==Format==
===Philosophy===
Shari Lewis explained her goal for the audience is &quot;participation, not passive observance&quot;. She said: &quot;our goal is, don&#x27;t just sit there - come play with me&quot;. She wanted to &quot;attack the shorter attention span of today&#x27;s children with a fast-paced show using colorful electronic effects&quot;. She said in an interview with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;: &quot;I know that when children watch TV, they go into a stupor. Parents think (their children) are interested, but what they really are is [bored]&quot;.

Lewis testified that making smart content for children was not that hard to produce and should be done with increasing frequency. She explained that if children are challenged, they will be productive members of society. She said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you tack a prosocial message at the end of the show. You have not done a quality show&quot;.

At the end of each show, Charlie Horse would sing &quot;The Song That Doesn&#x27;t End&quot; with Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy and the kids, much to the annoyance of the character Shari (as part of the joke).

===Opening and closing sequences===
Both the opening and closing songs were written by Broadway composer Norman Martin. Other songs were written by &quot;Square One TV&quot; songwriter, John Rodby. Two versions of the opening song with different lyrics have been used; one involves bouncing, and the other strength. The ending theme song is &quot;The Song That Doesn&#x27;t End&quot;, as sung by the children and puppets while Lewis frantically attempts to stop them. The children and puppets eventually leave at Shari&#x27;s urging, and the song fades even before beginning a sixth verse. Finally, at the end of the end credits sequence, Charlie Horse returns and tries to get to sing the song again but Lewis successfully stops him (by putting her hand over his mouth). She then orders him to go away and not let the song back in her sight again. As Charlie leaves, he slams the door before Lewis could tell him to close the door properly. Despite Charlie slamming the door, her only consolation is that everything is now silent (as a result of Charlie, the other puppets, and the singing group children &quot;gone&quot;). However, she glares at the viewers at fade-out.

An instrumental version of the show&#x27;s theme song was used for a most recent show of Mallory Lewis (daughter of the show&#x27;s host) and Lamb Chop.

<doc id="206864" wikidata="Q780191" url="?curid=206864" title="Polonius">
<text>Polonius is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He is the chief counsellor of the play&#x27;s ultimate villain, Claudius, and the father of Laertes and Ophelia. Generally regarded as wrong in every judgment he makes over the course of the play, Polonius is described by William Hazlitt as a &quot;sincere&quot; father, but also &quot;a busy-body, [who] is accordingly officious, garrulous, and impertinent&quot;. In Act II, Hamlet refers to Polonius as a &quot;tedious old fool&quot; and taunts him as a latter day &quot;Jephtha&quot;.

Polonius connives with Claudius to spy on Hamlet. Hamlet unknowingly kills Polonius, provoking Ophelia&#x27;s descent into madness, ultimately resulting in her (probable) suicide and the climax of the play: a duel between Laertes and Hamlet.

==Character==
Father of Ophelia and Laertes, and counsellor to King Claudius, he is described as a windbag by some and a rambler of wisdom by others. It has also been suggested that he only acts like a &quot;foolish prating knave&quot; to keep his position and popularity safe and to keep anyone from discovering his plots for social advancement. Throughout the play, Polonius is characterised as a typical Renaissance &quot;new man&quot;, who pays much attention to appearances and ceremonious behaviour. Some adaptations show him conspiring with Claudius in the murder of King Hamlet.

In Act 1, Scene 3, Polonius gives advice to his son Laertes, who is leaving for France, in the form of a list of sententious maxims. He finishes by giving his son his blessing, and is apparently at ease with his son&#x27;s departure. However, in Act 2, Scene 1, he orders his servant Reynaldo to travel to Paris and spy on Laertes and report if he is indulging in any local vice.

Laertes is not the only character upon whom Polonius spies. He is fearful that Hamlet&#x27;s relationship with his daughter will hurt his reputation with the king and instructs Ophelia to &quot;lock herself from [Hamlet&#x27;s] resort&quot;. He later suspects that Ophelia&#x27;s rejection of Hamlet&#x27;s attention has caused the prince to lose his wits, and informs Gertrude and Claudius of his suspicion, claiming that his reason for commanding Ophelia to reject Hamlet was that the prince was above her station. He and the king test his hypothesis by spying on and interrogating Ophelia.

In his last attempt to spy on Hamlet, Polonius hides himself behind an arras in Gertrude&#x27;s room. Hamlet deals roughly with his mother, causing her to cry for help. Polonius echoes the request for help and is heard by Hamlet, who then mistakes the voice for Claudius&#x27; and stabs through the arras and kills him.

Polonius&#x27;s death at the hands of Hamlet causes Claudius to fear for his own life, Ophelia to go mad, and Laertes to seek revenge, which leads to the duel in the final act.

==Sources==
The literary origins of the character may be traced to the King&#x27;s counsellor found in the Belleforest and William Painter versions of the Hamlet legend. However, at least since the 19th century scholars have also sought to understand the character in terms of Elizabethan court politics.

Polonius was first proposed as a parody of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s leading counsellor, Lord Treasurer, and Principal Secretary William Cecil, Lord Burghley in 1869. Israel Gollancz also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley. The theory was often finessed with supplementary arguments, but also disputed. Arden &quot;Hamlet&quot; editor Harold Jenkins, for example, criticised the idea of any direct personal satire of Burghley as &quot;unlikely&quot; and &quot;uncharacteristic of Shakespeare&quot;.

==Name==
Gollancz proposed that the source for the character&#x27;s name and sententious platitudes was &quot;De optimo senatore&quot;, a book on statesmanship by the Polish courtier Wawrzyniec GrzymaÅa GoÅlicki (known in Latin as Laurentius Grimaldius Goslicius), which was widely read after it was translated into English and published in 1598 under the title &quot;The Counsellor&quot;. &quot;Polonius&quot; is Latin for &quot;Polish&quot; or &quot;a/the Polish man.&quot; The English translation of the book refers to its author as a statesman of the &quot;polonian empyre&quot;.

In the first quarto of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Polonius is named &quot;Corambis&quot;. It has been suggested that this derives from &quot;crambe&quot; or &quot;crambo&quot;, derived from a Latin phrase meaning &quot;reheated cabbage&quot;, implying &quot;a boring old man&quot; who spouts trite rehashed ideas. Whether this was the original name of the character or not is debated. Various suggestions have been made to explain this. G. R. Hibbard argues that the name was originally &quot;Polonius&quot;, but was changed because Q1 derives from a version of the play to be performed in Oxford and Cambridge, and the original name was too close to that of Robert Polenius, founder of Oxford University. Since Polonius is a parody of a pompous pseudo-intellectual, the name might have been interpreted as a deliberate insult. The title page of Q1 specifically states that the play was recently performed in London, Oxford and Cambridge.

==Stage and film portrayals==
In most productions of the 20th century, up to about 1980, Polonius was played as a somewhat senile, garrulous man of about 75 or so, eliciting a few laughs from the audience by the depiction. More recent productions have tended to play him as a slightly younger man, and to emphasise his shiftiness rather than pompous senility, harking back to the traditional manner in which Polonius was played before the 20th century. Until the 1900s there was a tradition that the actor who plays Polonius also plays the quick-witted gravedigger in Act V. This bit suggests that the actor who played Polonius was an actor used to playing clowns much like the Fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;: not a doddering old fool, but an alive and intelligent master of illusion and misdirection. Polonius adds a new dimension to the play and is a controlling and menacing character.

One key to the portrayal is a producer&#x27;s decision to keep or remove the brief scene with his servant, Reynaldo, which comes after his scene of genial, fatherly advice to Laertes. He instructs Reynaldo to spy on his son, and even suggest that he has been gambling and consorting with prostitutes, to find out what he has really been up to. The inclusion of this scene portrays him in a much more sinister light; most productions, including Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1948 film version, choose to remove it. The respective productions starring Richard Burton and Kenneth Branagh both include it. Although Hume Cronyn plays Polonius mostly for laughs in the Burton production, Polonius is more sinister than comic in Branagh&#x27;s version.

==Famous lines==
Polonius&#x27;s most famous lines are found in Act 1 Scene 3 (&quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot;; &quot;To thine own self be true&quot;) and Act 2 Scene 2 (&quot;Brevity is the soul of wit&quot;; and &quot;Though this be madness, yet there is method in&#x27;t&quot;) while others have become paraphrased aphorisms (&quot;Clothes make the man&quot;; &quot;Old friends are the best friends&quot;). Also, the line he speaks when he is killed by Hamlet in Act 3 scene 4 (&quot;Oh, I am slain!&quot;) has been subject to parody and ridicule due to its obviousness.

==Notable portrayals==
*Hume Cronyn won a Tony Award for playing Polonius opposite Richard Burton&#x27;s Hamlet in John Gielgud&#x27;s 1964 Broadway production. No other actor has ever won an award for playing Polonius in any professional American stage version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, nor for playing him in a film version of the play. 
*In &quot;The Producer&quot;, a 1966 episode of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Polonius&#x27; &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot; speech is performed satirically, first by series regular Alan Hale Jr. as The Skipper playing the role of Polonius (with Dawn Wells as Mary Ann playing Laertes) in a musical production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; by the castaways, then by Phil Silvers guest-starring as a famous stage producer who finds himself on the island.
*Oliver Ford Davies played Polonius opposite David Tennant in a Royal Shakespeare Company production in 2008, a film version of which was later made and broadcast on television in December 2009.
*Actors who have played Polonius on film and television include Hans Junkermann, Ian Holm, Michael Redgrave, Ian Richardson, Bill Murray, and Richard Briers.

<text>AtomAge magazine was a fetish magazine published in Britain by the clothes designer John Sutcliffe in the 1970s as an offshoot of his AtomAge fetish clothing business. The magazine has been called the &quot;underground bible of leather, rubber and vinyl fetish wear throughout the 1970s&quot; and documented Britain&#x27;s S/M scene. The first AtomAge clothing catalogue was published in 1965 and it expanded into a magazine in 1972. The magazine ended in 1980.

2010 saw the publication of &quot;Dressing For Pleasure, The Best Of AtomAge 1972-1980&quot;, a comprehensive hardback book celebrating both the magazine and company.

<text>CinemaScope is an anamorphic lens series used, from 1953 to 1967, and less often later, for shooting widescreen films that, crucially, could be screened in theatres using existing equipment, albeit with a lens adapter.

Its creation in 1953 by Spyros P. Skouras, the president of 20th Century Fox, marked the beginning of the modern anamorphic format in both principal 2.55:1, almost twice as wide as the previously common Academy format&#x27;s 1.37:1 ratio. Although the technology behind the CinemaScope lens system was made obsolete by later developments, primarily advanced by Panavision, CinemaScope&#x27;s anamorphic format has continued to this day. In film-industry jargon, the shortened form, &#x27;Scope, is still widely used by both filmmakers and projectionists, although today it generally refers to any 2.35:1, 2.39:1, 2.40:1, or 2.55:1 presentation or, sometimes, the use of anamorphic lensing or projection in general. Bausch &amp; Lomb won a 1954 Oscar for its development of the CinemaScope lens.

==Origins==
French inventor Henri ChrÃ©tien developed and patented a new film process that he called &quot;Anamorphoscope&quot; in 1926. It was that process which later formed the basis of CinemaScope. ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s process used lenses that employed an optical trick, which produced an image twice as wide as those that were being produced with conventional lenses. That was done using an optical system called &quot;Hypergonar&quot;, which compressed the image laterally when the film was being shot, and dilated it when the film was projected. ChrÃ©tien attempted to interest the motion picture industry in his invention but, at that time, the industry was not sufficiently impressed.

By 1950, however, cinema attendance seriously declined with the advent of a new competitive rival: television. Yet Cinerama and the early 3D films, both launched in 1952, succeeded in defying that trend, which in turn persuaded Spyros Skouras, the head of 20th Century-Fox, that technical innovation could help to meet the television challenge. Skouras tasked Earl Sponable, head of Fox&#x27;s research department, with devising a new, impressive, projection system, but something that, unlike Cinerama, could be retrofitted to existing theatres at a relatively modest cost. Herbert Brag, Sponable&#x27;s assistant, remembered ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s hypergonar lens.

The optical company Bausch &amp; Lomb was asked to produce a prototype &quot;anamorphoser&quot; (later shortened to anamorphic) lens. Meanwhile, Sponable tracked down Professor ChrÃ©tien, whose patent for the process had expired, so Fox purchased his existing Hypergonars, and the lenses were flown to Fox&#x27;s studios in Hollywood. Test footage shot with the lenses was screened for Skouras, who gave the go-ahead for development of a widescreen process, based on ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s invention, which was to be known as CinemaScope.

20th Century-Fox&#x27;s pre-production of &quot;The Robe&quot;, originally committed to Technicolor three-strip origination, was halted so that the film could be changed to a CinemaScope production (using Eastmancolor, but processed by Technicolor). The use of the CinemaScope technology became a key feature of the film&#x27;s marketing campaign. Two other CinemaScope productions were also planned: &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Beneath the Twelve-Mile Reef.&quot; So that production of the first CinemaScope films could proceed without delay, shooting started using the best three of ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s Hypergonars, while Bausch &amp; Lomb continued working on their own versions. The introduction of CinemaScope enabled Fox and other studios to respond to the challenge from television by providing a key point of difference.

ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s Hypergonars proved to have significant optical and operational defects, primarily loss-of-squeeze at close camera-to-subject distances, plus the requirement of two camera assistants. Bausch &amp; Lomb, Fox&#x27;s prime contractor for the production of the lenses, initially produced an improved ChrÃ©tien-formula adapter lens design (CinemaScope Adapter Type I), and subsequently produced a dramatically improved and patented Bausch &amp; Lomb formula adapter lens design (CinemaScope Adapter Type II).

Ultimately, Bausch &amp; Lomb formula combined lens designs incorporated both the prime lens and the anamorphic lens in one unit (initially in 35, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 152Â mm focal lengths, later including a 25Â mm focal length). The combined lenses continue to be used to this day, particularly in special effects units. Other manufacturers&#x27; lenses are often preferred for so-called production applications that benefit from significantly lighter weight or lower distortion, or a combination of both characteristics.

==Early implementation==

CinemaScope was developed to use a separate film for sound (see Audio below), thus enabling the full silent 1.33:1 aperture to be available for the picture, with a 2:1 anamorphic squeeze applied that would allow an aspect ratio of 2.66:1. When, however, developers found that magnetic stripes could be added to the film to produce a composite picture/sound print, the ratio of the image was reduced to 2.55:1. This reduction was kept to a minimum by reducing the width of the normal KS perforations so that they were nearly square, but of DH height. This was the CinemaScope, or CS, perforation, known colloquially as fox-holes. Later still an optical soundtrack was added, further reducing the aspect ratio to 2.35:1 (1678:715). This change also meant a shift in the optical center of the projected image. All of Fox&#x27;s CinemaScope films were made using a silent/full aperture for the negatives, as was this studio&#x27;s practice for all films, whether anamorphic or not.

In order to better hide so-called negative assembly splices, the ratio of the image was later changed by others to 2.39:1 (1024:429). All professional cameras are capable of shooting 2.55:1 (special &#x27;Scope aperture plate) or 2.66:1 (standard Full/Silent aperture plate, preferred by many producers and all optical houses), and 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 or 2.40:1 is simply a hard-matted version of the others.

Fox selected &quot;The Robe&quot; as the first film to start production in CinemaScope, a project chosen because of its epic nature. During its production, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot; also went into CinemaScope production. &quot;Millionaire&quot; finished production first, before &quot;The Robe&quot;, but because of its importance, &quot;The Robe&quot; was released first.

20th Century-Fox used its influential people to promote CinemaScope. With the success of &quot;The Robe&quot; and &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire,&quot; the process enjoyed success in Hollywood. Fox licensed the process to many of the major American film studios.

Walt Disney Productions was one of the first companies to license the CinemaScope process from Fox. Among the features and shorts they filmed with it, they created the live-action epic &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,&quot; considered one of the best examples of early CinemaScope productions. Walt Disney Productions&#x27; &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot;, which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) in 1953, was the first cartoon produced in CinemaScope. The first animated feature film to use CinemaScope was &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), also from Walt Disney Productions.

Due to initial uncertainty about whether the process would be adopted widely, a number of films were shot simultaneously with anamorphic and regular lenses. Despite early success with the process, Fox did not shoot every production by this process. They reserved CinemaScope as a trade name for their A productions, while B productions in black and white were begun in 1956 at Fox under the trade name, RegalScope. The latter used the very same optics as CinemaScope, but, usually, a different camera system (such as Mitchell BNCs at TCF-TV studios for RegalScope rather than Fox Studio Cameras at Fox Hills studios for CinemaScope).

==Audio==
Fox officials were keen that the sound of their new widescreen film format should be as impressive as the picture, and that meant it should include true stereophonic sound.

Previously, stereo sound in the commercial cinema had always employed separate sound films; Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 release &quot;Fantasia&quot;, the first film with stereophonic sound, had used Disney&#x27;s Fantasound system, which utilized a three-channel soundtrack played from separate optical film. Early post-war stereo systems used with Cinerama and some 3-D films had used multichannel audio played from a separate magnetic film. Fox had initially intended to use three-channel stereo from magnetic film for CinemaScope.

However, Hazard E. Reeves&#x27; sound company had devised a method of coating 35 mm stock with magnetic stripes and designed a three-channel (left, center, right) system based on three stripes, one on each edge of the film outside the perforations, and one between the picture and the perforations in approximately the position of a standard optical soundtrack. Later it was found possible to add a narrower stripe between the picture and perforations on the other side of the film; this fourth track was used for a surround channel, also sometimes known at the time as an effects channel. In order to avoid hiss on the surround/effects channel from distracting the audience the surround speakers were switched on by a 12Â kHz tone recorded on the surround track only while wanted surround program material was present.

This four-track magnetic sound system was also used for some non-CinemaScope films; for example &quot;Fantasia&quot; was re-released in 1956, 1963, and 1969 with the original Fantasound track transferred to four-track magnetic.

==Rival processes==
CinemaScope itself was a response to early realism processes Cinerama and 3-D. Cinerama was relatively unaffected by CinemaScope, as it was a quality-controlled process that played in select venues, similar to the IMAX films of later years. 3-D was hurt, however, by studio advertising surrounding CinemaScope&#x27;s promise that it was the &quot;miracle you see without glasses.&quot; Technical difficulties in presentation spelled the true end for 3-D, but studio hype was quick to hail it a victory for CinemaScope.

In April 1953, a technique simply now known as wide-screen appeared and was soon adopted as a standard by all flat film productions in the US. In this process, a fully exposed 1.37:1 Academy ratio-area is cropped in the projector to a wide-screen aspect ratio by the use of an aperture plate, also known as a soft matte. Most films shot today use this technique, cropping the top and bottom of a 1.37:1 image to produce one at a ratio of 1.85:1.

Aware of Fox&#x27;s upcoming CinemaScope productions, Paramount introduced this technique in March&#x27;s release of &quot;Shane&quot; with the 1.66:1 aspect ratio, although the film was not shot with this ratio originally in mind. Universal-International followed suit in May with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio for &quot;Thunder Bay&quot;. By summer of 1953, other major studios Paramount, Universal, MGM, UA, Columbia, Warner Bros., RKO, Republic, Allied Artists, Disney, Belarusfilm, Rank, and even Fox&#x27;s B-unit contractors, under the banner of Panoramic Productions had switched from filming flat shows in a 1.37:1 format, and used variable flat wide-screen aspect ratios in their filming, which would become the standard of that time.

By this time ChrÃ©tien&#x27;s 1926 patent on the Hypergonar lens had expired while the fundamental technique that CinemaScope utilised was not patentable because the anamorphoscope had been known for centuries. Anamorphosis had been used in visual media such as Hans Holbein&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1533). Some studios thus sought to develop their own systems rather than pay Fox.

In response to the demands for a higher visual resolution spherical widescreen process, Paramount created an optical process, VistaVision, which shot horizontally on the 35Â mm film roll, and then printed down to standard four-perforation vertical 35Â mm. Thus, a negative with a finer grain was created and release prints had less grain. The first Paramount film in VistaVision was &quot;White Christmas&quot;. VistaVision died out for feature production in the late 1950s with the introduction of faster film stocks, but was revived by Industrial Light &amp; Magic in 1975 to create high quality visual effects for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and ILM&#x27;s subsequent film projects.

RKO used the Superscope process in which the standard 35Â mm image was cropped and then optically squeezed in post-production to create an anamorphic image on film. Today&#x27;s Super 35 is a variation of this process.

Another process called Techniscope was developed by Technicolor Inc. in the early 1960s, using normal 35Â mm cameras modified for two perforations per (half) frame instead of the regular four and later converted into an anamorphic print. Techniscope was mostly used in Europe, especially with low-budget films.

Many European countries and studios used the standard anamorphic process for their wide-screen films, identical in technical specifications to CinemaScope, and renamed to avoid the trademarks of Fox. Some of these include Euroscope, Franscope, and Naturama (the latter used by Republic Pictures). In 1953, Warner Bros. also planned to develop an identical anamorphic process called Warnerscope but, after the premiere of CinemaScope, Warner Bros. decided to license it from Fox instead.

==Technical difficulties==

Although CinemaScope was capable of producing a 2.66:1 image, the addition of magnetic sound tracks for multi-channel sound reduced this to 2.55:1.

The fact that the image was expanded horizontally when projected meant that there could be visible graininess and brightness problems. To combat this, larger film formats were developed (initially a too-costly 55Â mm for &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;) and then abandoned (both films were eventually reduction printed at 35Â mm, although the aspect ratio was kept at 2.55:1). Later Fox re-released &quot;The King and I&quot; in the 65/70Â mm format. The initial problems with grain and brightness were eventually reduced thanks to improvements in film stock and lenses.

The CinemaScope lenses were optically flawed, however, by the fixed anamorphic element, which caused the anamorphic effect to gradually drop off as objects approached the lens. The effect was that close-ups would slightly overstretch an actor&#x27;s face, a problem that was soon referred to as &quot;the mumps&quot;. This problem was avoided at first by composing wider shots, but as anamorphic technology lost its novelty, directors and cinematographers sought compositional freedom from these limitations. Issues with the lenses also made it difficult to photograph animation using the CinemaScope process. Nevertheless, many animated short films and a few features were filmed in CinemaScope during the 1950s, including Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955).

==CinemaScope 55==
CinemaScope 55 was a large-format version of CinemaScope introduced by Twentieth Century Fox in 1955, which used a film width of 55.625Â mm.

Fox had introduced the original 35Â mm version of CinemaScope in 1953 and it had proved to be commercially successful. But the additional image enlargement needed to fill the new wider screens, which had been installed in theatres for CinemaScope, resulted in visible film grain. A larger film was used to reduce the need for such enlargement. CinemaScope 55 was developed to satisfy this need and was one of three high-definition film systems introduced in the mid-1950s, the other two being Paramount&#x27;s VistaVision and the Todd-AO 70 mm film system.

Fox determined that a system that produced a frame area approximately 4 times that of the 35mm CinemaScope frame would be the optimal trade-off between performance and cost, and it chose the 55.625Â mm film width as satisfying that. Camera negative film had larger grain than the film stocks used for prints, so there was a consistent approach in using a larger frame on the film negative than on prints. While the image area of a print has to allow for a soundtrack, a camera negative does not. CinemaScope 55 had different frame dimensions for the camera negative and struck prints.

The negative film had the perforations (of the CS Fox-hole type) close to the edge of the film and the camera aperture was 1.824&quot; by 1.430&quot; (approx. 46Â mm x 36Â mm), giving an image area of 2.61 sq. inch. This compares to the 0.866&quot; by 0.732&quot; (approx. 22Â mm x 18.6Â mm) frame of a modern anamorphic 35Â mm negative, which provides a frame area of 0.64 sq. inch. On the print film, however, there was a smaller frame size of approximately 1.34&quot; x 1.06&quot; (34Â mm x 27Â mm) to allow space for the 6 magnetic soundtracks. Four of these soundtracks (two each side) were outside the perforations, which were further from the edges of the print film than in the negative film; the other two soundtracks were between the perforations and the image. The pull-down for the negative was 8 perforations, while for the smaller frame on the print film, it was 6 perforations. In both cases, however, the frame had an aspect ratio of 1.275:1, which when expanded by a 2:1 anamorphic lens resulted in an image of 2.55:1.

A camera originally built for the obsolete Fox 70 mm Grandeur film format more than 20 years before was modified to work with the new 55Â mm film. Bausch &amp; Lomb, the firm that created the original anamorphic CinemaScope lenses, was contracted by Fox to build new Super CinemaScope lenses that could cover the larger film frame.

Fox shot two of their Rodgers and Hammerstein musical series in CinemaScopeÂ 55: &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;. But it did not make 55Â mm release prints for either film; both were released in conventional 35Â mm CinemaScope with a limited release of &quot;The King and I&quot; being shown in 70Â mm.

The company substituted Todd-AO for its wide-gauge production process, having acquired a financial interest in the process from the Mike Todd estate.

Subsequent to the abandonment of CinemaScope 55, Century, which had made the 55/35mm dual-gauge projector for Fox (50 sets were delivered), redesigned this projector head into the present day 70/35mm Model JJ, and Ampex, which had made the 55/35mm dual gauge penthouse magnetic sound reproducer head specifically for CinemaScope 55, abandoned this product (but six-channel Ampex theater systems persisted, these being re-purposed from 55/35mm to 70mm Todd-AO/35mm CinemaScope).

Although commercial 55Â mm prints were not made, some 55Â mm prints were produced. Samples of these prints reside in the Earl I. Sponable Collection at Columbia University. Several 55/35mm projectors and at least one 55/35mm reproducer are in the hands of collectors.

Cinemascope 55 was originally intended to have a six-track stereo soundtrack. The premiere engagement of &quot;Carousel&quot; in New York did use one, recorded on magnetic film interlocked with the visual image, as with Cinerama. This proved too impractical, and all other engagements of &quot;Carousel&quot; had the standard four-track stereo soundtrack (sounded on the actual film) as was then used in all CinemaScope releases.

In 2005, both CinemaScope 55 films were restored from the original 55Â mm negatives.

==Decline==

Lens manufacturer Panavision was initially founded in late 1953 as a manufacturer of anamorphic lens adapters for movie projectors screening CinemaScope films, capitalizing on the success of the new anamorphic format and filling in the gap created by Bausch and Lomb&#x27;s inability to mass-produce the needed adapters for movie theaters fast enough. Looking to expand beyond projector lenses, Panavision founder Robert Gottschalk soon improved upon the anamorphic camera lenses by creating a new lens set that included dual rotating anamorphic elements which were interlocked with the lens focus gearing. This innovation allowed the Panavision lenses to keep the plane of focus at a constant anamorphic ratio of 2x, thus avoiding the horizontally-overstretched mumps effect that afflicted many CinemaScope films. After screening a demo reel comparing the two systems, many U.S. studios adopted the Panavision anamorphic lenses. The Panavision technique was also considered more attractive to the industry because it was more affordable than CinemaScope and was not owned or licensed-out by a rival studio. Confusingly, some studios, particularly MGM, continued to use the CinemaScope credit even though they had switched to Panavision lenses. Virtually all MGM CinemaScope films after 1958 are actually in Panavision.

By 1967, even Fox had begun to abandon CinemaScope for Panavision (famously at the demand of Frank Sinatra for &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot;), although a significant amount of the principal photography was actually filmed using CinemaScope lenses. Fox eventually capitulated completely to third-party lenses. &quot;In Like Flint&quot; with James Coburn and &quot;Caprice&quot; with Doris Day, were Fox&#x27;s final films in CinemaScope.

Fox originally intended CinemaScope films to use magnetic stereo sound only, and although in certain areas, such as Los Angeles and New York City, the vast majority of theaters were equipped for four-track magnetic sound (four-track magnetic sound achieving nearly 90 percent penetration of theaters in the greater Los Angeles area) the owners of many smaller theaters were dissatisfied with contractually having to install expensive three- or four-track magnetic stereo, and because of the technical nature of sound installations, drive-in theaters had trouble presenting stereophonic sound at all. Due to these conflicts, and because other studios were starting to release anamorphic prints with standard optical soundtracks, Fox revoked their policy of stereo-only presentations in 1957, and added a half-width optical soundtrack, while keeping the magnetic tracks for those theaters that were able to present their films with stereophonic sound. These so-called &quot;mag-optical&quot; prints provided a somewhat sub-standard optical sound and were also expensive to produce. It made little economic sense to supply those theaters which had only mono sound systems with an expensive striped print. Eventually Fox, and others, elected to supply the majority of their prints in standard mono optical sound form, with magnetic striped prints reserved for those theaters capable of playing them.

Magnetic-striped prints were expensive to produce; each print cost at least twice as much as a print with a standard optical soundtrack only. Furthermore, these striped prints wore out faster than optical prints and caused more problems in use, such as flakes of oxide clogging the replay heads. Due to these problems, and also because many cinemas never installed the necessary playback equipment, magnetic-sound prints started to be made in small quantities for roadshow screenings only, with the main release using standard mono optical-sound prints. As time went by roadshow screenings were increasingly made using 70Â mmÂ film, and the use of striped 35Â mm prints declined further. Many CinemaScope films from the 1960s and 1970s were never released in stereo at all. Finally, the 1976 introduction of Dolby Stereo â which provided similar performance to striped magnetic prints albeit more reliable and at a far lower cost â caused the four-track magnetic system to become totally obsolete.

==Modern references==

The song &quot;Stereophonic Sound&quot; written by Cole Porter for the 1955 Broadway musical &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; mentions CinemaScope in the lyrics. The first verse is: &quot;Today to get the public to attend the picture show/ It&#x27;s not enough to advertise a famous star they know/ If you wanna get the crowds to come around/ You gotta have glorious Technicolor/ Breathtaking CinemaScope and stereophonic sound.&quot; The musical was adapted for film in 1957 and was indeed filmed in CinemaScope. (Although the song refers to Technicolor, the film was actually made in Metrocolor.)

While the lens system has been retired for decades, Fox has used the trademark in recent years for a few films films: &quot;Down with Love&quot;, which was shot with Panavision optics but used the credit as a throwback to the films it references, the Don Bluth films &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; at Bluth&#x27;s insistence. However these films are not in true CinemaScope because they use modern lenses. CinemaScope&#x27;s association with anamorphic projection is still so embedded in mass consciousness that all anamorphic prints are now referred to generically as &#x27;Scope prints.

Similarly, the 2016 release &quot;La La Land&quot; was shot on film (not digitally) with Panavision equipment in a 2.55:1 widescreen format, but not true CinemaScope. However, the film&#x27;s opening credits do say &quot;Presented in CinemaScope&quot; (&quot;presented&quot;, not &quot;shot&quot;) as a tribute to 1950s musicals in that format. This credit appears initially in black-and-white and in a narrow format. It then widens to widescreen and dissolves to the old-fashioned CinemaScope logo, in color.

In the 1963 Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;Contempt&quot; (&quot;Le Mepris&quot;), filmmaker Fritz Lang makes a disparaging comment about CinemaScope: &quot;Oh, it wasn&#x27;t meant for human beings. Just for snakes â and funerals.&quot; Ironically, &quot;Contempt&quot; was shot in Franscope, a process with a similar format to CinemaScope.

During the production of 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Giant,&quot; director Brad Bird wanted to advertise the film with the CinemaScope name and logo, but Fox would not allow its use. A reference to CinemaScope was included during the end credits of the 2015 &quot;Signature Edition&quot; re-release.

In the 1988 film &quot;Hairspray&quot; and the 2007 remake, there are references to CinemaScope. In both instances, they are comments made in regard to Tracy Turnblad&#x27;s weight, implying that she&#x27;s too big to be seen on a television screen. In the 1988 version, a comment was said in dialogue by one of the current &quot;coolest kids in town&quot; during Tracy&#x27;s audition. In the remake of 2007, also during Tracy&#x27;s audition, it was a lyric sung by Amber von Tussle, singing, &quot;This show isn&#x27;t broadcast in CinemaScope!&quot; in the song &quot;(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs&quot;.

<text>Carfax is the junction of St Aldate&#x27;s (south), Cornmarket Street (north), Queen Street (west) and the High Street (east) in Oxford, England. It is considered to be the centre of the city. The name &quot;Carfax&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;quadrifurcus&quot; via the French &quot;carrefour&quot;, both of which mean &quot;crossroads&quot;. The Carfax Tower, also known as St Martin&#x27;s Tower (the remaining part of the City Church of St Martin of Tours) is a prominent landmark and provides a look-out over the town.

==Tower==

St Martin&#x27;s Tower, popularly called &quot;Carfax Tower&quot;, is on the northwest corner of Carfax. It is all that remains of the 12th-century St Martin&#x27;s Church and is now owned by Oxford City Council. It was the official City Church of Oxford, where the Mayor and Corporation were expected to worship, between about 1122 and 1896, when the main part of the church was demolished to make more room for road traffic and All Saints&#x27; Church in the High Street became the City Church for 75 years. All Saints then became the library of Lincoln College, and St Michael at the North Gate became the City Church.

The tower is tall, and the City Council stipulates that no building in central Oxford may be built higher than it (a rule broken by the Blavatnik School of Government). It is a Grade II listed building.

The tower still has a ring of six bells: five recast from the original ring by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1676 and one cast by Keene two years later. They are rung on special occasions by the Oxford Society of Change Ringers.

There is a clock that chimes the quarter hours on a pair of bells cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough in 1898. The clock&#x27;s current dial and surroundings were designed by Sir TG Jackson and installed in 1898. In 1938â39 the clock mechanism was replaced with an electric one made by Gents&#x27; of Leicester.

One can climb to the top of the tower for a view of the Oxford skyline. The tower is open NovemberFebruary: 10:0015:00, March: 10:0016:00, AprilSeptember: 10:0017:00 and October: 10:0016:00.

==Events==

The St Scholastica Day riot of 1355 began with an altercation in the Swindlestock Tavern (now the site of the Santander Bank on the southwest corner of Carfax, between St Aldate&#x27;s and Queen Street) between two students and the taverner.

In 1865 William Henry Butler, who had been Mayor of Oxford in 1836, was buried in St Martin&#x27;s churchyard in the grave of his first wife Elizabeth Briggs and their two infant daughters. In 1900 the church was demolished to make way for road improvements and as a consequence the grave and tombstone were forgotten. It is probable the tombstone was made by either John Gibbs of Oxford (father of Butler&#x27;s second wife) or one of Gibbs&#x27;s employees. The tombstone is still &quot;in situ&quot; and can be seen behind the tower. There is a campaign to protect the tombstone for posterity.

==University regulations==
Comparable to St Mary the Great for the University of Cambridge, Carfax plays a role in the disciplinary regulations of the University of Oxford. For example, the university requires some students to reside within of Carfax.

<doc id="206872" wikidata="Q5171875" url="?curid=206872" title="Cornmarket Street">
<text>Cornmarket Street (colloquially referred to as Cornmarket or historically The Corn) is a major shopping street and pedestrian precinct in Oxford, England that runs north to south between Magdalen Street and Carfax Tower.

To the east is the Golden Cross arcade of small jewellery and craft shops in a courtyard, leading to the Covered Market. To the west is the indoor Clarendon Shopping Centre that connects in an L-shape to Queen Street.

Cornmarket was semi-pedestrianised and made a limited-access street in 1999. Cycling is allowed 6pm to 10am. In 2002, it was voted Britain&#x27;s second worst street in a poll of listeners to the &quot;Today&quot; programme. The rating was largely due to a failed attempt to repave the street in 2001. The granite setts, which had been laid extensively, cracked and the contractor went into liquidation. In 2003, it was repaved again and new benches installed, amidst reports of budgetary problems.

==History of shops==

26â28 Cornmarket on the corner of Ship Street is a 14th-century timber-framed building. It is the surviving half of a building completed in about 1386 as the New Inn. It belongs to Jesus College and was investigated and restored in 1983.

Boswells of Oxford established what was the largest department store in Oxford at 50 Cornmarket Street in 1738. In 1928, the shop opened a new main entrance on Broad Street, but it still retained an entrance on Cornmarket Street. The store closed in 2020.

The Victorian photographer Henry Taunt set up a shop at 33 Cornmarket Street in 1869. It was a small shop and in 1874 he moved to larger premises in Broad Street.

Zac&#x27;s was a waterproof clothing manufacturing and retail firm based at 26â27 Cornmarket, established in the 1880s and closed in 1983.

Woolworth&#x27;s bought the Clarendon Hotel on the west side of the street in 1939 with the intention of demolishing it for the construction of a new store on the site. In earlier centuries, the Clarendon had been the Star Inn. It was a complex of 16th- and 17th-century buildings, one of which had a vaulted Norman cellar dating from the second half of the 12th century: possibly the oldest vaulted structure in Oxford. Thomas Sharp, in &quot;Oxford Replanned&quot; (1948) a report commissioned by Oxford City Council, warned that Oxford was already short of quality hotel accommodation and the Clarendon&#x27;s demolition would be a mistake. Notwithstanding Sharp&#x27;s conclusions, Woolworth&#x27;s demolished the hotel in 1954â55. After demolition of all the buildings above the surface, parts of the 12th-century vault were destroyed to make way for one of the columns of Clarendon House built in its place.

Clarendon House was designed by William Holford and built in 1956â57. The faÃ§ade is of coursed and squared rubble masonry with panels of blue-green slate, and Nikolaus Pevsner commended the building as tactful and elegant. The building is now part of the Clarendon Shopping Centre.

==St Michael at the North Gate==
The tower of the Church of England parish church of St Michael at the North Gate is the oldest building in Oxford. It is Saxon and dates from about 1000â1050. The church is named after the medieval gate of Oxford&#x27;s city walls that spanned the north end of Cornmarket.

Near this church was the Bocardo Prison, where the Oxford Martyrs were imprisoned in 1555â56 before being burnt at the stake outside the town wall in what is now Broad Street nearby.

<doc id="206874" wikidata="Q17022739" url="?curid=206874" title="YWCA USA">
<text>YWCA USA is a nonprofit organization and the American division of the YWCA. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and focuses on women&#x27;s empowerment. The organization additionally aims for the promotion of peace, justice, freedom, and dignity.

== Structure ==
YWCA is an organization with 215 local associations across the United States. At YWCA&#x27;s annual meeting in May 2012, a transition from the prior regional structure to a national federated structure was approved, followed by the adoption of new bylaws in November 2012.

YWCAâs Local Associations are separate and independent 501 (c)(3) organizations with their own Board of Directors, staffing and budget.

== Services ==
Today, YWCA and its Local Associations combine programming and advocacy to generate institutional change in three key areas:

â Racial justice and civil rights

â Empowerment and economic advancement of women and girls

â Health and safety of women and girls

YWCA is a national organization (incorporated in NY) with nearly 200 Local Associations around the United States in a federated model. YWCA USA provides a range of technical assistance and capacity-building services to local YWCAs, maintains the YWCA brand, and advances the organizationâs strong national presence from their headquarters in Washington, DC. YWCA USA is also a part of World YWCA, which is a global movement working for womenâs empowerment, leadership, and rights in more than 120 countries.

Each year, YWCAs help more than 535,000 women with safety services, which include sexual assault programs, domestic violence services such as emergency shelter, crisis hotlines, counseling and court assistance, and other community safety programs. We also help more than 122,000 women with economic empowerment programs, and more than 160,000 individuals participate each year in racial justice education and training programs.

== YWCA USA Partnership with Impact Shares ==

In Aug. of 2018, YWCA partnered with nonprofit investment manager and exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Impact Shares to launch the first of its kind ETF focused on companies empowering women in the workforce. The Impact Shares YWCA Womenâs Empowerment ETF, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker WOMN, is designed to promote gender diversity and empower women in the workforce by holding shares of companies who score highest in their sector on 19 gender equity criteria as determined by Equileap, an independent, specialized data provider with a broad scope of diversity &amp; inclusion and gender equality metrics. The criteria include a companyâs: 

â Gender balance in leadership and the workforce which includes an examination of a companyâs non-executive board, executives, senior management, overall workforce and its promotion and career development opportunities; 

â Equal compensation &amp; work life balance which includes an examination of whether a company has fair remuneration, equal pay, parental leave and flexible work options;

â Policies promoting gender equality including its training and career development and recruitment strategy; whether employees have freedom from violence, abuse and sexual harassment; whether employees are safe at work and enjoy basic human rights; its social supply chain and supplier diversity; and overall employee protection; and 
â Commitment, transparency, and accountability including its overall commitment to womenâs empowerment and whether it has undertaken a gender audit from a recognized entity.

As the impact partner for the WOMN ETF, Impact Shares is committed to donating the net advisory fees from the fund to support YWCAâs work to empower women and eliminate racism. Additionally, the WOMN ETF provides YWCA with a platform to engage and educate investors, corporate America and the general public on the policies and procedures that can empower women in the workplace. By shining a light on companies that champion these values, it encourages others to follow suit and, as more investors allocate their funds to socially responsible investments like the WOMN ETF, companies are incentivized to improve their gender diversity and equality initiatives, driving positive change within corporate cultures.

== History ==
YWCA USA was founded as the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association in New York City in 1858.

In 1905, the Harlem YWCA hired the first Black woman general secretary of a local YWCA branch, Eva del Vakia Bowles. Bowles joined the national association as the head of &quot;colored programs&quot; in 1913 and remained in that capacity until 1932.
Prior to the Civil Rights Movement, some YWCA facilities were segregated or operated as separate organizations. Advocates like Helen L. Seaborg in Washington, D.C., worked successfully to mediate mergers between the segregated groups. 

YWCA USA used the classic &quot;blue triangle&quot; logo from its foundation until 1988, when it unveiled a new logo and identity designed by the renowned graphic designer Saul Bass. This was subsequently replaced with a new logo, designed by Landor Associates, in 2004.

YWCA USA changed its corporate name from &quot;Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association of the United States of America, Inc.&quot; to &quot;YWCA USA, Inc.&quot; in December 2015.

== YWCA of The City of New York ==
The YWCA of The City of New York, the oldest of all of the YWCAs in the United States, was founded in 1858. It is unique in that the organization is guided purely by human service-oriented programs rather than physical services. Such programs include their Early Learning Centers, Family Resource Center, Out-of-School Programs, Professional Development Programming, and Women&#x27;s Employment Programming to name a few, and are still guided by the YW mission of eliminating racism and empowering women. YWCA of The City of New York services are a major component of the non-profit community in New York City.

The YWCA of The City of New York produces several fundraising events annually including the Salute to Women Leaders Luncheon, the YWCA-NYC Theatre Benefit (featuring the Broadway hit &quot;The Color Purple&quot; in 2005 and the revival of Michael Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; in 2006).

During their annual Summer SoirÃ©e (held at the W Hotel in 2005 and Cipriani 23rd Street in 2006) they present their &quot;W&quot; award. This award is presented to a woman who is a visionary, an innovator, trend-setter, a woman who gives back to her community and helps those the YW serves daily: the women, girls and families of New York City. In 2005, this award was given to Marian McEvoy, and in 2006 to Star Jones-Reynolds.

== YWCA Metropolitan Chicago ==

YWCA Metropolitan Chicago is the oldest and largest women&#x27;s organization in the region, with a mission to eliminate racism and empower women. For more than 140 years, YWCA Metropolitan Chicago has been committed to serving the evolving needs of women and families.

The Monroe Gallery at the YWCA started in 1961. Originally located at the YWCA Loop Center at 59 E. Monroe St. until 1969. It then moved to the new YWCA location 37 S. Wabash Ave. Members include Diana Solis, Diana Avila, Malu Ortega y Alberro, Salima Rivera, Eleanor Boyer, Karen Peugh, and Judith Arcana.

The Women&#x27;s Video Project at the YWCA was initially created to complete video projects related to the Loop YWCA&#x27;s Lay Advocacy program, provide support to other YWCA groups and individuals to use, and teach video equipment usage and guiding video projects. Judy Hoffman made equipment recommendations early on, and by 1974 the first grant assistance had come in. At that time seven women led by video maker Eleanor Boyer went to work setting the equipment up, creating tapes, and providing support to other YWCA members. Countless tapes were made documenting workshops and lectures; workshops were given to provide hands-on experience in making small-format video, including planning, shooting, and editing; and YWCA members created their own tapes. Boyer herself created more than a dozen tapes with the program, including Street Interviews on Rape (1974) documenting attitudes and beliefs about rape held by men and women, Getting Strong: Self Defense for Women (1976) discussing the dimensions and politics of self-defense for women, Breast Cancer Tapes (1977) opening up the subject of breast cancer from the point of view of women who had undergone treatment, and Bonne Bell: 10,000 Meter Race for Women (1978) documenting Chicago&#x27;s first 6.2-mile race for women which was organized and hosted by the YWCA. As technology shifted, the Women&#x27;s Video Project at the YWCA started to seek out newer equipment that was lighter, was easier to use, and recorded in color. The members of the Video Project wrote letters of support for the newly founded and artist-run Chicago Editing Center, which later became known as the Center for New Television, and moved much of their work there.

<text>Anotia (&quot;no ear&quot;) describes a rare congenital deformity that involves the complete absence of the auricle, the outer projected portion of the ear, and narrowing or absence of the ear canal. This contrasts with microtia, in which a small part of the auricle is present. Anotia and microtia may occur unilaterally (only one ear affected) or bilaterally (both ears affected). This deformity results in conductive hearing loss, deafness.

== Ear development ==
Ear development begins in about the third week of human embryonic development, beginning with the formation of the otic placodes, an extension of the early hind brain. By the fourth week of development, the otic placodes invaginate, or sink inward forming pits which close themselves off for the outer surface ectoderm and begin forming the inner ear labyrinthe on the inside. 
Outer ear development begins in about the fifth week of human embryonic development. Upon the pharyngeal arches, auricle hillocks begin to form. By the seventh week, the three pairs of hillocks have enlarged differentiated and fused together to start forming the auricle, or outer portion of the ear. Throughout fetal development, the hillocks will move from the sides of the neck to the sides of the head. Simultaneously, in the seventh week of development, the auditory tube begins to form out of the tympanic membrane.

=== Processing sound ===

The human ear is divided into three sections. Each section has its own specialized function.
#The outer ear acts like a funnel and takes in the sound.
#The middle ear holds the tympanic membrane, or ear drum and several little bones that are moved by the sound waves that have entered the ear via the canal. These movements are very small, like vibrations and are transmitted to the inner ear.
#The inner ear contains a structure called the cochlea, which contains small hair- like cells that respond to sound information and transmits it via nerve impulses down the auditory nerve and to the brain, where they are processed.

=== Defects of the ear: anotia/microtia ===

The isolated cause, a cause not associated with a syndrome, of anotia or microtia is not known, though it is believed to be of genetic basis.
Developmentally, anotia/microtia occurs when certain tissues associated with the auricle do not develop. This rare defect may occur as part of a syndrome or as an isolated abnormality.

Type I: External portion of the ear is small in size; auricle structure is normal

Type II: The auricle is in a hook or &#x27;S&#x27; shape; external ear is only moderately abnormal.

Type III: Small amount of basic, soft tissue ear structure lacking cartilage; auricle is abnormal in appearance. 
Type IV: Most severe type, anotia; all external structures of the ears are absent. 
Defects affecting the external ear such as the auricle results from malformation or suppression of the auricular hillocks, which are small swellings on the embryonic visceral arches or the beginnings of the external ears; the small swellings are derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches. 
Because the ears and the kidneys develop simultaneously, children with ear defects are often checked for kidney defects at birth.

== Related syndromes ==
&quot;20% to 40% of children with microtia/anotia will have additional defects that could suggest a syndrome.&quot;

Treacher-Collins syndrome: (TCS) A congenital disorder caused by a defective protein known as treacle, and is characterized by craniofacial deformities; malformed or absent ears are also seen in this syndrome. The effects may be mild, undiagnosed to severe, leading to death. Because the ear defects are much different in this disorder and not only affect the outer ear, but the middle ear as well, reconstructive surgery may not help with the child&#x27;s hearing and in this case a bone-anchored hearing aid would be best. BAHA will only work, however if the inner ear and nerve are intact.

Goldenhar syndrome: A rare congenital birth defect that causes abnormalities of facial development. Also known as oculoauricular dysplasia. The facial anomalies include underdeveloped, asymmetric half of the face. The defect is capable of affecting tissue, muscle, and the underlying bone structure of the side of the face with the abnormality.

Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome : (AMS) A rare genetic disorder characterized by various physical anomalies which affect the craniofacial area, the skin, the fingers, and the genitals.

==Treatment==
The treatment will vary with the different grades, but the most common is a surgical repair. The surgical option is cosmetic reconstruction of the external ear&#x27;s normal shape and repair of the ear canal. In less severe cases, the reconstruction will be sufficient to restore hearing. In grades of anotia/microtia that affect the middle ear, the surgery with the use of a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) will likely restore the hearing. The BAHA may be surgically implanted onto the skull which would allow for some hearing repair by conduction through the skull bone. &quot;This allows sound vibrations to travel through bones in the head to the inner ear.&quot;

BAHA: An implantable hearing device. It is the only hearing aid device that works via direct bone conduction.

<text>A fetish magazine is a type of magazine originating in the late 1940s which is devoted to sexual fetishism. The content is generally aimed at being erotic rather than pornographic. Fetish magazines are usually devoted to a specific fetish, such as leather fetishism, rubber and PVC fetishism, cross-dressing, bondage, sadomasochism, female domination, sexual roleplay, corporal punishment, etc. Much of the content in fetish magazines is baffling to people who do not share the particular fetishes discussed and depicted.

The most well-known early examples are &quot;Bizarre&quot; (1946â1959) published by John Willie and Leonard Burtman&#x27;s &quot;Exotique, Masque, Connoisseur, Bizarre Life, High Heels, Unique World&quot;, and &quot;Corporal&quot;.

An early study, &quot;The Undergrowth of Literature&quot; by Gillian Freeman (1967), concluded that such magazines provide a catharsis for those whose sexual needs are otherwise unsatisfied: she identified rubberwear magazines as the most popular at the time.

<text>East Riddlesden Hall is a 17th-century manor house in Keighley, West Yorkshire, England, now owned by the National Trust.

==History==
The hall was built in 1642 by a wealthy Halifax clothier, James Murgatroyd. The hall is a Grade I listed building. There is a medieval tithebarn in the grounds.

East Riddlesden Hall perches on a small plateau overlooking a bend in the River Aire on its way downstream from the town of Keighley. Interesting features include well-restored living accommodation on two floors, two Yorkshire Rose windows, walled garden, the ruined Starkie wing and several ghosts (reputedly).

The property was extended and re-built by James Murgatroyd and his wife Hannah, using local Yorkshire stone, in 1648. He also built other stone manor houses throughout the West Riding of Yorkshire. In the great hall, a small fireplace can be seen above the main fireplace, where the floor for the first floor accommodation was not built. James Murgatroyd was a Royalist and this can be seen in royalist symbols and graffiti on and in the building. For example, the Bothy (now the tea room and shop) has the heads of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France carved in the topmost stone work.

According to a National Operatic and Dramatic Association news feature in 2007, the Murgatroyd family are reputed to have been the inspiration for the Murgatroyd Baronets in the comic opera &quot;Ruddigore&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan, and the opera has been performed at the Hall. W. S. Gilbert is supposed to have often stayed at the Hall. The feature comments that the Murgatroyds became notorious &quot;for their profanity and debauchery&quot;. A legend arose that the River Aire changed its course in shame, in order to flow further away from the hall and its occupants (the river sweeps into a wide U-bend to skirt the meadow, as though giving the building a wide berth). The feature continues &quot;Members of the family were fined, imprisoned and excommunicated&quot;. It asserts that the character of Sir Despard Murgatroyd in &quot;Ruddigore&quot; is based on James Murgatroyd.

== Filming location ==
East Riddlesden Hall has been used as a filming location for the 1992 film &quot;Emily BrontÃ«&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; and for the 2009 TV adaptation. It was also used in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Justice&quot; episode from the Sharpe TV series in 1997. The BBC Television series &#x27;Gunpowder&#x27; (2017) used East Riddlesden Hall as a location.

<text>The Chapman Stick is an electric musical instrument devised by Emmett Chapman in the early 1970s. A member of the guitar family, the Chapman Stick usually has ten or twelve individually tuned strings and is used to play bass lines, melody lines, chords, or textures. Designed as a fully polyphonic chordal instrument, it can also cover several of these musical parts simultaneously.

The Stick is available with passive or active pickup modules that are plugged into a separate instrument amplifier. With a special synthesizer pickup, it can be used to trigger synthesizers and send MIDI messages to electronic instruments.

==Description and playing position==

A Stick physically resembles the fretboard of an electric guitarâit is, however, considerably longer and wider and is strung with 8, 10, or 12 strings. Unlike the electric guitar, it is usually played by tapping or fretting the strings, rather than plucking them. Instead of one hand fretting and the other hand plucking, both hands sound notes by striking the strings against the fingerboard &quot;behind&quot; (in guitar parlance, this means a short distance towards the tuning machines) or on the appropriate frets for the desired notes. For this reason, it can sound many more notes at once than some other stringed instruments, making it more comparable to a keyboard instrument than to other stringed instruments. This arrangement lends itself to playing many lines at once, and many Stick players have mastered performing bass, chords, and melody lines simultaneously.

Typically, the Chapman Stick is held via a belt-hook and a shoulder strap. The player hooks the instrument onto the belt and places the head and dominant arm through the shoulder strap. The instrument then settles into a position approximately 30 to 40 degrees from vertical, which allows both of the player&#x27;s hands to naturally and comfortably address the fretboard. The player then hammers onto the strings with the fingertips in the same way that one would strike a piano key. The technique is very similar to that of the piano inasmuch as the player covers both bass and melody notes together with both hands, and each note is struck with one finger of one hand. Typically, one hand plays the melody on the treble strings and the other plays rhythm on the bass strings.

A seated playing position (which keeps the Stick in a similar playing position relative to the player as the standing position) is also popular, wherein a cross-member is laid upon the knees of the seated player and the stick&#x27;s belthook rests upon the crossmember.

==Origins, history, and popular profile==
In 1969, jazz guitarist Emmett Chapman developed the two-handed tapping technique (in which both hands play parallel to the frets) and applied it to his playing. At the time, Chapman was playing a 9-string long-scale guitar, but decided to develop a new instrument for use with &quot;free hands&quot; to use the method&#x27;s full potential. The Chapman Stick took five years to develop, during which Chapman also opted to set up a business to sell it. The first production model of the Stick was launched in 1974. On October 10 of the same year, Chapman brought his instrument to public attention by demonstrating it on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Former Weather Report bassist Alphonso Johnson was among the first musicians to introduce the Chapman Stick to the public. Session player Tony Levin was also an early user and was playing the instrument from the mid-1970s: he would bring it to sessions and tours with Peter Gabriel, and featured it in his work as a member of King Crimson from 1981 onwards. He would also use it with Liquid Tension Experiment and in sessions for bands including Pink Floyd and Yes. Levin formed the band Stick Men, consisting of one drummer and two Stick players.

Recordings that have been influential on Stick players, because of the prominent role the Stick plays, include the 1981 King Crimson album &quot;Discipline&quot; (played by Tony Levin) and Emmett Chapman&#x27;s own album &quot;Parallel Galaxy&quot;. Amy Grant&#x27;s hit single &quot;Angels&quot; also featured a Stick solo (played by Andy Widders-Ellis).

The Stick made a disguised appearance in David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Dune&quot; as Gurney Halleck&#x27;s baliset, although the scene where Halleck (played by Patrick Stewart) plays the instrument was removed from the theatrical version and can only be seen in the extended versions. The piece being played in the scene is from Emmett Chapman&#x27;s recording of his original song &quot;Back Yard&quot; from a cassette recording.

Wayne Lytle, creator of Animusic, commented that on his piece &quot;Stick Figures&quot;, his inspiration for the semi-anthropomorphic bass guitar was the Chapman Stick.

==Technical details==
===Construction===
Chapman Sticks have been made from many materials. The first were made from hardwoods, most from ironwood, but some from ebony and other exotic woods, until the early 1980s. The next group was made from an injection-molded polycarbonate resin through 1989. These were followed by one-piece hardwood structures with an adjustable truss rod, and for a time from 2001 to the mid-to-late 2000s (although not currently available), the &quot;Stick XG&quot; (Extended Graphite) was made of structural graphite, continuous strand carbon fiber. Today, they are made from laminated hardwoods (including padauk, Indian rosewood, tarara, maple, wenge, and mahogany), and laminated bamboo, as well as graphite.

In contrast to the guitar or bass, the Stick is set up with very little relief in the fretboard. It is very flat compared to a guitar, which has a slight bow. Combined with a long scale length, stainless steel pyramidal fret rails, very low string action, and very sensitive pickups, this setup is advantageous to the tapping style of play. The rear surface of the instrument is not curved like a guitar neck, but has deep-beveled edges (also a design trademark of the Stick).

===Tuning===

The original (now called &quot;Classic&quot;) tuning consists of five bass strings (six on the Grand Sticks), tuned upwards in all-fifths tuning, with the low string in the middle of the fretboard, and five melody strings (6 on Grand Stick), tuned upwards (this means from lowest-pitched string to highest-pitched string) in all-fourths tuning, again with the low string in the middle of the fretboard.

The hardware is fully adjustable to accommodate any gauge string at any position. On the 36&quot;-scale instrument, notes can range from low C (above B on a 5-string bass) to high D (a whole step below the high E string on guitar). On the two guitar-scale models (Alto Stick and Stick Guitar), the notes range from F below guitar low E to F# above guitar high E.

Tuning configurations may change depending on the player&#x27;s style: a player playing as a lead instrument will choose an overall higher pitch tuning, with more separation or overlap between the melody and bass courses.

The stringing/tuning configuration of the Chapman Stick is advantageous to the player who wishes to play large, fully voiced chords with close inner-note relationships. In contrast to a standard guitar, where one tends to &quot;run out of options&quot; within a particular fingering, the Stick tuning results in up to four or even five octaves of note choices under each hand&#x27;s fretting position.

The classic tuning shows another advantage as well: The regular tunings in fourths and fifths remain consistent in each of the two parts of the instrument; regular tunings facilitate learning by beginners, as well as transposition and improvisation by advanced players. Also, the bass/melody division allows microtonal tunings.

The manufacturer&#x27;s website has more detailed information on tunings.

===Electronics===
The Stick is available with passive or active pickup modules. Customized Roland GK-3 pickups are available for the treble or bass side of the instrument, allowing the instrument to trigger or control one or two guitar synthesizers such as the Roland GR-20 or Axon AX-100, and also to drive other MIDI instruments or sequencers chained to the guitar synthesizer. The hammer-on style of playing produces a rising waveform transient that is easily tracked by this type of device.

Standard output is two-channel, through a TRS 1/4&quot; phone connector, with bass and melody courses output separately. There are separate volume controls for bass and melody. The ACTV-2 and PASV-4 pickup modules also have mono operation modes.

The Stick can be plugged into any standard guitar amp or bass amplifier, to good effect. However, because of the very high impedance of the passive pickups, an instrument preamp is often employed, especially for full-range amplification systems (PA system, keyboard amps, etc.).

British musician Nick Beggs uses a Grand Stick, fully MIDI-capable of triggering from both bass and melody strings. He has named this modified instrument the &quot;Virtual Stick&quot;.

===Models===
Currently, there are eight models of the Chapman Stick. Some string configurations are mentioned below, but current production models offer any tuning within physical limitations of stringing:

* The Stick (10 strings, 5 melody &amp; 5 bass/6 melody &amp; 4 bass, other custom tunings and set-ups, 36&quot; scale length)
* The Railboard (10 strings, a 1-piece CNC-cut thru-neck aluminum beam with 9 pieces bolted-on including headstock, bridge, new R-Block pickup module, 34&quot; scale)
* Grand Stick (12 strings, 6 melody &amp; 6 bass/7 melody &amp; 5 bass, other custom tunings and set-ups, 36&quot; scale length)
* 10-String Grand Stick (10 strings installed on a wooden or laminated bamboo &quot;blanks&quot; for the Grand Stick 12-string model, thus creating a wider fretboard &amp; string spacing for a 10-string Stick. Center-to-center string spacing is 0.350&quot; as opposed to 0.315&quot; on standard 10-string Sticks. The space between the &quot;melody&quot; &amp; &quot;bass&quot; groups of strings is also wider, at 0.500&quot; instead of the standard 0.430&quot;. Same 5 melody &amp; 5 bass/6 melody &amp; 4 bass, custom tunings and set-ups &amp; 36&quot; scale length as the standard 10-string Stick)
* Stick Bass (SB8) (8 strings, undivided &quot;straight 4ths&quot; B-Bb bass guitar or B-A electric guitar intervals tuning, standard Stick 4 melody &amp; 4 bass, other custom tunings and set-ups, 36&quot; scale length)
* NS/Stick (8 strings set up for plucking, strumming, or tapping in standard bass or guitar intervals, standard Stick 5 melody &amp; 5 bass, other custom tunings and set-ups; co-invented by Chapman &amp; Ned Steinberger, 34&quot; scale length)
* Alto Stick (10 strings, 5 melody + 5 accompaniment, with shorter scale length for a more guitar-like range, 26.5&quot; scale length)
* Stick Guitar (12 strings, 2 groups of 6, with shorter scale length for a more guitar-like range, 26.5&quot; scale length)

Currently, the Stick, Grand Stick, and Stick Bass are 36&quot;-scale, but the older production models were 34&quot; scale.
Stick Enterprises has also manufactured some custom and limited-run instruments:
* SB7 Stick Bass â Original &quot;Stick Bass&quot; model with string-spacing close to the current 10-string Chapman Stick, which is narrower than the SB8 8-string Stick Bass. 2 Bartolini bass pickups (1 &quot;Soapbar&quot; &amp; 1 &quot;Single Coil&quot;-sized: only 1 selectable at a time) with mono-only output as opposed to virtually all the previously built and current to the original &amp; upgraded over time passive &quot;Stickup&quot;, newer active EMG &quot;ACTV-2&quot; Block, passive Villex &quot;PASV-4&quot; and &quot;R-Block&quot; railboard pickup modules, all of which have stereo-or-mono output. Only one production run completed in 1996â97 until replaced by the more Stick-like SB8 in March 1998. Only one Production Run of this particular Stick model was built before being replaced by the SB8 Stick Bass.

* The Acoustick â an acoustic version of the Chapman Stick made for Bob Culbertson.
* StickXBL â A prototype Stick with body construction by BassLab using a hollow &quot;tunable composite&quot; material. Only a small number of these prototypes exist.

<text>The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a statistical tool used in project management, which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project.

PERT was originally developed by Charles E. Clark for the United States Navy in 1958; it is commonly used in conjunction with the Critical Path Method (CPM), which was also introduced in 1958.

== Overview ==
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and durations of all the activities. It is more event-oriented than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more for projects where time is the major constraint rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure projects, as well as R&amp;D projects.

PERT offers a management tool, which relies &quot;on arrow and node diagrams of &quot;activities&quot; and &quot;events&quot;: arrows represent the &quot;activities&quot; or work necessary to reach the &quot;events&quot; or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project.&quot;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because &quot;CPM employs one time estimation and one cost estimation for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling.&quot;

==History==
PERT was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed by the United States Navy Special Projects Office, Lockheed Aircraft, and Booz Allen Hamilton to support the Navy&#x27;s Polaris missile project. It found applications throughout industry. An early example is the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble which used PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games. This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for the scientific management of Frederick Taylor and later refined by Henry Ford (Fordism). DuPont&#x27;s CPM was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.
Initially PERT stood for &quot;Program Evaluation Research Task,&quot; but by 1959 was renamed. It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled &quot;Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.&quot; and &quot;Phase 2.&quot; both primarily written by Charles F. Clark. In a 1959 article in &quot;The American Statistician&quot;, Willard Fazar, Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of PERT. He explained:


Ten years after the introduction of PERT, the American librarian Maribeth Brennan compiled a selected bibliography with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, all published between 1958 and 1968.

For the subdivision of work units in PERT another tool was developed: the Work Breakdown Structure. The Work Breakdown Structure provides &quot;a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/CPM.&quot;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the &quot;event&quot;, with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* &quot;PERT event&quot;: a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not &quot;reached&quot; (does not occur) until &quot;all&quot; of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* &quot;predecessor event&quot;: an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* &quot;successor event&quot;: an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also tracks activities and sub-activities:
* &quot;PERT activity&quot;: the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* &quot;PERT sub-activity&quot;: a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

=== Time ===
PERT defines four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* &quot;optimistic time&quot;: the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* &quot;pessimistic time&quot;: the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* &quot;most likely time&quot;: the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* &quot;expected time&quot;: the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don&#x27;t always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: formula_1
:::formula_2
* &quot;standard deviation of time&quot; : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (Ïte) or a path (ÏTE)
::: formula_3

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* &quot;float or slack&quot; is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (&quot;free float&quot;) or the whole project (&quot;total float&quot;). Positive slack would indicate &quot;ahead of schedule&quot;; negative slack would indicate &quot;behind schedule&quot;; and zero slack would indicate &quot;on schedule&quot;.
* &quot;critical path&quot;: the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* &quot;critical activity&quot;: An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero free float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* &quot; time&quot;: the time by which a &quot;predecessor event&quot; must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* &quot;lag time&quot;: the earliest time by which a &quot;successor event&quot; can follow a specific PERT event.
* &quot;fast tracking&quot;: performing more critical activities in parallel
* &quot;crashing critical path&quot;: Shortening duration of critical activities

== Implementation ==
The first step for scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed. The order may be easy to record for some tasks (e.g., when building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one). Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time. Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled &quot;A&quot; through &quot;G&quot;. Some tasks can be done concurrently (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (&quot;C&quot; cannot begin until &quot;A&quot; is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (&quot;o&quot;), the most likely or normal time estimate (&quot;m&quot;), and the pessimistic time estimate (&quot;p&quot;). The expected time (&quot;te&quot;) is computed using the formula (&quot;o&quot; + 4&quot;m&quot; + &quot;p&quot;) Ã· 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.
:

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software. There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow (AOA) and activity on node (AON). Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret. To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named &quot;start&quot;. This &quot;activity&quot; has a duration of zero (0). Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node. Next, since both &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; list &quot;a&quot; as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from &quot;a&quot;. Activity &quot;e&quot; is listed with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; as predecessor activities, so node &quot;e&quot; is drawn with arrows coming from both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, signifying that &quot;e&quot; cannot begin until both &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; have been completed. Activity &quot;f&quot; has &quot;d&quot; as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities. Likewise, an arrow is drawn from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;g&quot;. Since there are no activities that come after &quot;f&quot; or &quot;g&quot;, it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled &quot;finish&quot;.


By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information. The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The slack

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given. The first step is to determine the ES and EF. The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0). The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for &quot;start&quot; is zero since it is the first activity. Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero. This EF is used as the ES for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.
*The ES for &quot;a&quot; is zero. The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four. This EF is used as the ES for &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;.
*The ES for &quot;b&quot; is zero. The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for &quot;c&quot; is four. The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for &quot;d&quot; is four. The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33. This EF is used as the ES for &quot;f&quot;.
*The ES for &quot;e&quot; is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (&quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;). Since &quot;b&quot; has an EF of 5.33 and &quot;c&quot; has an EF of 9.17, the ES of &quot;e&quot; is 9.17. The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34. This EF is used as the ES for &quot;g&quot;.
*The ES for &quot;f&quot; is 10.33. The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for &quot;g&quot; is 14.34. The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for &quot;finish&quot; is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (&quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;). Since &quot;f&quot; has an EF of 14.83 and &quot;g&quot; has an EF of 19.51, the ES of &quot;finish&quot; is 19.51. &quot;Finish&quot; is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any unforeseen events, the project should take 19.51 work days to complete. The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity. This will eventually show if there are activities that have slack. The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF. The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF â duration).

*The LF for &quot;finish&quot; is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project. Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days. This will be used as the LF for &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.
*The LF for &quot;g&quot; is 19.51 work days. The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days. This will be used as the LF for &quot;e&quot;.
*The LF for &quot;f&quot; is 19.51 work days. The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days. This will be used as the LF for &quot;d&quot;.
*The LF for &quot;e&quot; is 14.34 work days. The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days. This will be used as the LF for &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.
*The LF for &quot;d&quot; is 15.01 work days. The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for &quot;c&quot; is 9.17 work days. The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for &quot;b&quot; is 9.17 work days. The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for &quot;a&quot; is the minimum LS of its successor activities. Since &quot;c&quot; has an LS of 4 work days and &quot;d&quot; has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for &quot;a&quot; is 4 work days. The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for &quot;start&quot; is the minimum LS of its successor activities. Since &quot;a&quot; has an LS of 0 work days and &quot;b&quot; has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the critical path and if any activities have slack. The critical path is the path that takes the longest to complete. To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths. Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project. Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF â EF &quot;or&quot; slack = LS â ES. Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path &quot;adf&quot; is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path &quot;aceg&quot; is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path &quot;beg&quot; is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is &quot;aceg&quot; and the critical time is 19.51 work days. It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change. For example, let&#x27;s say that activities &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot; take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (TE) times. The critical path is now &quot;adf&quot; and the critical time is 22 work days. On the other hand, if activity &quot;c&quot; can be reduced to one work day, the path time for &quot;aceg&quot; is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, &quot;beg&quot; (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*&quot;Start&quot; and &quot;finish&quot; are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LFa â EFa = 4 â 4 = 0
** LFc â EFc = 9.17 â 9.17 = 0
** LFe â EFe = 14.34 â 14.34 = 0
** LFg â EFg = 19.51 â 19.51 = 0
*Activity &quot;b&quot; has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity &quot;d&quot; has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity &quot;f&quot; has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity &quot;b&quot; can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project. Likewise, activity &quot;d&quot; or activity &quot;f&quot; can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot; can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

=== Avoiding loops ===
Depending upon the capabilities of the data input phase of the critical path algorithm, it may be possible to create a loop, such as A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A. This can cause simple algorithms to loop indefinitely. Although it is possible to &quot;mark&quot; nodes that have been visited, then clear the &quot;marks&quot; upon completion of the process, a far simpler mechanism involves computing the total of all activity durations. If an EF of more than the total is found, the computation should be terminated. It is worth saving the identities of the most recently visited dozen or so nodes to help identify the problem link.

== As project scheduling tool ==
=== Advantages ===
* PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible dependencies (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly WBS) elements.
* PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
* PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
* PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easy to scale down for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, &quot;e.g.&quot;, specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===
During project execution a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb disruptions. This is called &quot;proactive scheduling&quot;, however, allowing for every possible disruption would be very slow and couldn&#x27;t be accommodated by the baseline schedule. A second approach, termed &quot;reactive scheduling&quot;, defines a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

<text>Photographic plates preceded photographic film as a capture medium in photography. The light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was coated on a glass plate, typically thinner than common window glass. They were heavily used in the late 19th century. With the spread of photographic film, the use of plates declined through the 20th. They were still used in some communities, particularly in science and medicine, until the late 20th century. 

==History==

Glass plates were far superior to film for research-quality imaging because they were stable and less likely to bend or distort, especially in large-format frames for wide-field imaging. Early plates used the wet collodion process. The wet plate process was replaced late in the 19th century by gelatin dry plates. 

A view camera nicknamed &quot;The Mammoth&quot; weighing was built by George R. Lawrence in 1899, specifically to photograph &quot;The Alton Limited&quot; train owned by the Chicago &amp; Alton Railway. It took photographs on glass plates measuring Ã .

Glass plate photographic material largely faded from the consumer market in the early years of the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were increasingly adopted. However, photographic plates were reportedly still being used by one photography business in London until the 1970s, and by one in Bradford called the Belle Vue Studio that closed in 1975. They were in wide use by the professional astronomical community as late as the 1990s. Workshops on the use of glass plate photography as an alternative medium or for artistic use are still being conducted. 
== Scientific uses ==

=== Astronomy ===

Many famous astronomical surveys were taken using photographic plates, including the first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) of the 1950s, the follow-up POSS-II survey of the 1990s, and the UK Schmidt Telescope survey of southern declinations. A number of observatories, including Harvard College and Sonneberg, maintain large archives of photographic plates, which are used primarily for historical research on variable stars.

Many solar system objects were discovered by using photographic plates, superseding earlier visual methods. Discovery of minor planets using photographic plates was pioneered by Max Wolf beginning with his discovery of 323 Brucia in 1891. The first natural satellite discovered using photographic plates was Phoebe in 1898. Pluto was discovered using photographic plates in a blink comparator; its moon Charon was discovered 48 years later in 1978 by U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer James W. Christy by carefully examining a bulge in Pluto&#x27;s image on a photographic plate.
Glass-backed plates, rather than film, were generally used in astronomy because they do not shrink or deform noticeably in the development process or under environmental changes. Several important applications of astrophotography, including astronomical spectroscopy and astrometry, continued using plates until digital imaging improved to the point where it could outmatch photographic results. Kodak and other manufacturers discontinued production of most kinds of plates as the market for them dwindled between 1980 and 2000, terminating most remaining astronomical use, including for sky surveys.

=== Physics ===
Photographic plates were also an important tool in early high-energy physics, as they are blackened by ionizing radiation. Ernest Rutherford was one of the first to study the absorption, in various materials, of the rays produced in radioactive decay, by using photographic plates to measure the intensity of the rays. Development of particle detection optimised nuclear emulsions in the 1930s and 1940s, first in physics laboratories, then by commercial manufacturers, enabled the discovery and measurement of both the pi-meson and K-meson, in 1947 and 1949, initiating a flood of new particle discoveries in the second half of the 20th century.

=== Electron microscopy ===
Photographic emulsions were originally coated on thin glass plates for imaging with electron microscopes, which provided a more rigid, stable and flatter plane compared to plastic films. Beginning in the 1970s, high-contrast, fine grain emulsions coated on thicker plastic films manufactured by Kodak, Ilford and DuPont replaced glass plates. These films have largely been replaced by digital imaging technologies.

== Medical imaging ==

The sensitivity of certain types of photographic plates to ionizing radiation (usually X-rays) is also useful in medical imaging and material science applications, although they have been largely replaced with reusable and computer readable image plate detectors and other types of X-ray detectors.

== Decline ==

The earliest flexible films of the late 1880s were sold for amateur use in medium-format cameras. The plastic was not of very high optical quality and tended to curl and otherwise not provide as desirably flat a support surface as a sheet of glass. Initially, a transparent plastic base was more expensive to produce than glass. Quality was eventually improved, manufacturing costs came down, and most amateurs gladly abandoned plates for films. After large-format high quality cut films for professional photographers were introduced in the late 1910s, the use of plates for ordinary photography of any kind became increasingly rare.

The persistent use of plates in astronomical and other scientific applications started to decline in the early 1980s as they were gradually replaced by charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which also provide outstanding dimensional stability. CCD cameras have several advantages over glass plates, including high efficiency, linear light response, and simplified image acquisition and processing. However, even the largest CCD formats (e.g., 8192 Ã 8192 pixels) still do not have the detecting area and resolution of most photographic plates, which has forced modern survey cameras to use large CCD arrays to obtain the same coverage.

The manufacture of photographic plates has been discontinued by Kodak, Agfa and other widely known traditional makers. Eastern European sources have subsequently catered to the minimal remaining demand, practically all of it for use in holography, which requires a recording medium with a large surface area and a submicroscopic level of resolution that currently (2014) available electronic image sensors cannot provide. In the realm of traditional photography, a small number of historical process enthusiasts make their own wet or dry plates from raw materials and use them in vintage large-format cameras.

== Preservation ==
Several institutions have established archives to preserve photographic plates and prevent their valuable historical information from being lost. The emulsion on the plate can deteriorate. In addition, the glass plate medium is fragile and prone to cracking if not stored correctly.

=== Historical archives===
The United States Library of Congress has a large collection of both wet and dry plate photographic negatives, dating from 1855 through 1900, over 7,500 of which have been digitized from the period 1861 to 1865.
The George Eastman Museum holds an extensive collection of photographic plates. In 1955, wet plate negatives measuring Ã were reported to have been discovered in 1951 as part of the Holtermann Collection. These purportedly were the largest glass negatives discovered at that time. These images were taken in 1875 by Charles Bayliss and formed the &quot;Shore Tower&quot; panorama of Sydney Harbour. Albumen contact prints made from these negatives are in the holdings of the Holtermann Collection, the negatives are listed among the current holdings of the Collection.

=== Scientific archives ===
Preservation of photographic plates is a particular need in astronomy, where changes often occur slowly and the plates represent irreplaceable records of the sky and astronomical objects that extend back over 100 years. The method of digitization of astronomical plates enables free and easy access to those unique astronomical data and it is one of the most popular approaches to preserve them. This approach was applied at the Baldone Astrophysical Observatory where about 22,000 glass and film plates of the Schmidt Telescope were scanned and cataloged. Another example of an astronomical plate archive is the Astronomical Photographic Data Archive (APDA) at the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI). APDA was created in response to recommendations of a group of international scientists who gathered in 2007 to discuss how to best preserve astronomical plates (see the Osborn and Robbins reference listed under Further reading). The discussions revealed that some observatories no longer could maintain their plate collections and needed a place to archive them. APDA is dedicated to housing and cataloging unwanted plates, with the goal to eventually catalog the plates and create a database of images that can be accessed via the Internet by the global community of scientists, researchers, and students. APDA now has a collection of more than 404,000 photographic images from over 40 observatories that are housed in a secure building with environmental control. The facility possesses several plate scanners, including two high-precision ones, GAMMA I and GAMMA II, built for NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and used by a team under the leadership of the late Barry Lasker to develop the Guide Star Catalog and Digitized Sky Survey that are used to guide and direct the Hubble Space Telescope. APDA&#x27;s networked storage system can store and analyze more than 100 terabytes of data.

A historical collection of photographic plates from Mt. Wilson observatory is available at the Carnegie Observatories. Metadata is available via a searchable database, while a portion of the plates has been digitized.

<doc id="206908" wikidata="Q895162" url="?curid=206908" title="Bounds Green tube station">
<text>Bounds Green is a London Underground station. It is located at the junction of Bounds Green Road and Brownlow Road in Bounds Green in the London Borough of Haringey, North London. The station is on the Piccadilly line between Wood Green and Arnos Grove stations, and is on the boundary between Zone 3 and Zone 4.

==History==
Like all stations on the Cockfosters extension, Bounds Green, which opened on 19 September 1932, set new aesthetic standards not previously seen on London&#x27;s Underground. During the planning period of the extension to Cockfosters, alternate names for this station, &quot;Wood Green North&quot; and &quot;Brownlow Road&quot; were considered but rejected.

===Second World War===
The station was used as an air-raid shelter and people slept on the stairs between the escalators here as well as on the platforms. On the night of 13 October 1940, during The Blitz, a lone German aircraft dropped a single bomb on houses to the north of the station. The destruction of the houses caused the north end of the westbound platform tunnel to collapse, killing and injuring many people amongst those sheltering from the air raid. The train service was disrupted for two months.
A memorial plaque (placed in the station in 1994, at the north end of the westbound platform) erroneously commemorates &quot;sixteen Belgian refugees and ... three British citizens who died&quot; in the attack. The records of the civilian deaths held by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission indicate that in fact sixteen people in total died at the scene â of whom three were Belgian refugees â with a seventeenth person dying of injuries in hospital the following day. Approximately twenty people were injured, but survived.

==Design==

Architecturally, this tube station, designed in the typical &quot;Box-style&quot; of the architect Charles Holden by his colleague C. H. James, is a well-preserved example of the modernist house style of London Transport in the 1930s. The eight-sided frontage is flanked by a ventilation tower. The ticket hall is lit by four large windows with an imposing lattice of concrete beams in the ceiling; large London Underground roundels; and original bronze signs, ventilation grilles and information panel frames. The sub-surface areas of the station are finished in biscuit-coloured tiles lined with red friezes. Holden&#x27;s designs emphasised functionality combined with balanced geometry and the use of modern materials, especially glass and reinforced concrete. The historical significance of the station is emphasised by its involvement in the World War II blitz.

Unlike others on this extension, the station was not previously nationally listed as of special architectural interest, but in August 2008 an application was made to English Heritage for a listing recommendation and in January 2010 the station was listed as Grade II.

==Layout==
Two escalators and a central fixed stairway connect the ticket hall with the platforms. The escalators were installed in 1989 and 1991, replacing the 1932 originals. The current escalators are Otis MH-B type of vertical rise.

The station&#x27;s platform tunnels have, in common with those of Southgate, a diameter of 21 feet (6.4Â metres). In contrast, the much busier Wood Green, Turnpike Lane and Manor House have 23-foot (7-metre) diameter platform tunnels. The construction of &quot;suicide pits&quot; between the rails was also innovative; these were built in connection with a system of passageways under the platforms to give access to the track.

==Improvements==
The station was refurbished in 2007 as part of Transport for London&#x27;s Â£10Â billion Investment Programme. The works were carried out at night and in a series of weekend closures. This work involved the restoration of heritage features and included the upgrading of CCTV cameras, retiling and decorating the station, repairs to the roof and exterior, platform resurfacing and the installation of Help Points. New train indicators were installed. The station was restored to its original condition, complete with red tiled borders. The cable trays above the frieze level are grey. The ticket hall has been retiled light and dark grey with wooden doors to station accommodation revarnished.

==Services and connections==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2â5 minutes between 06:53 and 00:59 eastbound, and between 05:27 and 00:09 westbound.

The station is served by London Bus routes 102, 184, 221 and 299, and also by night route N91.

<text>Collingwood College is one of the constituent colleges of Durham University. Founded in 1972, it was the first Durham college that was purposely mixed-sex. It has over 1500 undergraduate students and just under 290 graduate students as of the year 2023/24, making it the largest college in Durham.

The college is the first to break off centuries of Durham traditions, as it is the first college to never police corridors and to never make the use of gown compulsory. The college also developed a reputation for its unrivalled supremacy in sports, having won the intercollegiate sports trophy for 11 years in a row.

The college was named after the mathematician Sir Edward Collingwood (1900â1970), who was a former Chair of the Council of Durham University.

==History==

Plans for Collingwood began in 1960, as part of a programme of expansion that included both Van Mildert College and Trevelyan College. By 1962 it was determined that the new college was to be built on the site of Oswald House, with Richard Sheppard (architect of Churchill College, Cambridge) being appointed the following year. The remnants of the Oswald House estate can be seen in the landscaped grounds and mature trees that surround the college. Over the following years a series of funding issues and debates over the student composition of the new college meant that building on the site did not begin until August 1971. It was determined that the new college should be called Collingwood College, a name chosen from a shortlist of three (the others being Cromwell College and Lumley College). With building not being complete until 1973, Collingwood&#x27;s first 66 freshers were housed in Van Mildert from October 1972.

==Buildings and facilities==
The college is located to the south of Durham city centre, on South Road. The steep incline of this road leads to Collingwood and the surrounding colleges being commonly referred to as &#x27;Hill&#x27; colleges. Extended in 1994, Collingwood now has over a thousand students allocated to it, and up to 565 bed spaces within the college. Accommodation is provided within three main wings: the original Durham and Northumbria wings and the newer, en-suite Cumbria wing. A separate block, York, is located away from the others and consists of flats used by fellows of the College and of the Institute of Advanced Study. Not all students live in college during their time at the university, but all students in their first year and the majority of those in their final year are allocated a place.

Although most Durham colleges are not used for teaching purposes, the college is equipped with a moderate library, music practice rooms and public computing facilities. Other welfare and entertainment facilities exist, including a bar, student-run shop, gym, television room, several common rooms, various sports facilities and a toastie and coffee shop - The Wood&#x27;n&#x27;Spoon. (Collingwood being the only Durham college to have one). During the summer of 2006, the music rooms were converted into a recording studio, with a new JCR officer position being created to run it.

The college is also a popular venue for academic conferences and other commercial events, often arranged and marketed by Event Durham. The income from these is used by the Colleges&#x27; Division to maintain and enhance college bedrooms and other facilities.

In June 2011 contractors began building work on a new gymnasium on the college campus, known as the Mark Hillery Gym. It opened in October 2012.

In 2017, the first in a series of renovations was unveiled. Collingwood now sports its own Multi-Use Games Area (MUGA), informally referred to by students as the &quot;Collingwood Crumb&quot;. This can be booked for college sports training sessions, or for casual kickabouts when not in use by one of Collingwood&#x27;s many teams.

In November 2018, after almost 18 monthsâ worth of building work, the facilities were completed. These include an expansion and equipment refresh of the Mark Hillery Gym and the replacement of the Bayley Room with the purpose-built Mark Hillery Performing Arts Centre. This performing arts space has a 150-person seated capacity.

The common room was also fully renovated; it is now equipped with a cinema room, pool tables, multiple televisions, as well as a relocated and fully refitted coffee shop. The college&#x27;s central social hub, The Stag&#x27;s Head college bar, was also renovated, bringing a dedicated darts area, conservatory and revamped bar terrace. Each year, a large music festival is organised by the college bar. The green space on the college grounds has also been drastically landscaped with fresh flowers and plants planted across the site. Collingwood has also recently invested in a media suite, and its latest addition is Mark Hillery Music Studios, completed opened in 2023. The building houses 2 practice rooms, and features a purpose built recording studio with control room, live room, vocal booth and drum booth. The control room boasts the region&#x27;s only Dolby Atmos system with 13 PMC monitors, and the centerpiece is an SSL AWS 948 Delta mixing console.

==Organisation and administration==

The Head of College is the Principal. The incumbent Principal is Joe Elliott.

===List of Principals===
* Peter C. Bayley (1972â1978)
* Anthony Tuck FRHistS (1978â1987)
* Gerald Blake (1987â2001)
* Jane Taylor (2001â2007)
* F. Edward Corrigan, FRS (2008â2011)
* Joe Elliott (2011 â &quot;present&quot;)

==Student life==

As with all colleges in Durham, the students organise and democratise themselves by creating and running a body known as the Junior Common Room, or more commonly JCR. All students of the college are JCR members unless they specifically request otherwise. The JCR is led by the Exec Committee, which consists of thirteen elected positions. Two of these positions, those of JCR President and Bar Steward, are sabbatical. 
There is also a Middle Common Room for mostly Postgraduates, who are usually members of the JCR as well.

The college has a number of sports clubs and societies, for example:
*The Woodplayers (Collingwood&#x27;s Drama Society)
*Collingwood College Arts Society
*Collingwood College Music Society
*Collingwood Choir
*Collingwood College Fashion Show
* Collingwood College Boat Club
*Collingwood College Rugby Football Club
*Collingwood College Cricket Club
*Collingwood College Association Football Club
*Collingwood College Dance Society
*Collingwood College Darts Club
Collingwood has non-gowned formals, at the end of which energetic renditions of &quot;Country Roads&quot; are common. It has always been the norm for students and staff to speak to each other informally, using first names rather than titles.

<doc id="206915" wikidata="Q537702" url="?curid=206915" title="New Zealand wren">
<text>The New Zealand wrens are a family (Acanthisittidae) of tiny passerines endemic to New Zealand. They were represented by seven Holocene species in four or five genera, although only two species in two genera survive today. They are understood to form a distinct lineage within the passerines, but authorities differ on their assignment to the oscines or suboscines (the two suborders that between them make up the Passeriformes). More recent studies suggest that they form a third, most ancient, suborder Acanthisitti and have no living close relatives at all. They are called &quot;wrens&quot; because of similarities in appearance and behaviour to the true wrens (Troglodytidae) but are not members of that family.

New Zealand wrens are mostly insectivorous foragers of New Zealand&#x27;s forests, with one species, the New Zealand rock wren, being restricted to alpine areas. Both the remaining species are poor fliers and four of the five extinct species are known or suspected to have been flightless. Along with the long-legged bunting from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, they are the only passerines known to have lost the ability to fly. Of the species for which the plumage is known, they are drab-coloured birds with brown-green plumage. They form monogamous pair bonds to raise their young, laying their eggs in small nests in trees or amongst rocks. They are diurnal and like all New Zealand passerines, are, for the most part, are sedentary.

Like many New Zealand birds, New Zealand wrens suffered several extinctions after the arrival of humans in New Zealand. Of the seven Holocene species, only two survive today. The South Island stout-legged wren, North Island stout-legged wren, and long-billed wren became extinct after the arrival of the MÄori and the Polynesian rat. They are known to science only from subfossil remains. At the same time, Lyall&#x27;s wren became extinct on the main islands and survived only as a relict population on Stephens Island in the Cook Strait. Lyall&#x27;s wren and the bushwren became extinct after the arrival of Europeans in 1895 and 1972 respectively. Of the two remaining species, the rifleman is still common in both the North and South Islands. The New Zealand rock wren is restricted to the alpine areas of the South Island and is considered vulnerable.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The taxonomy of the New Zealand wrens has been a subject of considerable debate since their discovery, although they have long been known to be an unusual family. In the 1880s, Forbes assigned the New Zealand wrens to the suboscines related to the cotingas and the pittas (and gave the family the name Xenicidae). Later, they were thought to be closer to the ovenbirds and antbirds. Sibley&#x27;s 1970 study comparing egg-white proteins moved them to the oscines, but later studies, including the 1982 DNA-DNA hybridization study, suggested the family was a sister taxon to the suboscines and the oscines. This theory has proven most robust since then and the New Zealand wrens might be the survivors of a lineage of passerines that was isolated when New Zealand broke away from Gondwana 82â85 million years ago (Mya), though a pre-Paleogene origin of passerines is highly disputed and tends to be rejected in more recent studies.

As no evidence indicates passerines were flightless when they arrived on New Zealand (that apomorphy is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the Mesozoic. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from Australia some 55 million years ago, the acanthisittids&#x27; ancestors likely arrived in the Late Paleocene from Australia or the then-temperate Antarctic coasts. Plate tectonics indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly at that time. New Zealand&#x27;s minimum distance from Australia is a bit more today â some â whereas it is now at least from Antarctica.

The extant species are closely related and thought to be descendants of birds that survived a genetic bottleneck caused by the marine transgression during the Oligocene, when most of New Zealand was under water. The earliest known fossil is &quot;Kuiornis indicator&quot; from the Early Miocene St Bathans fauna. &quot;Kuiornis&quot; is thought to be more closely related to &quot;Acanthisitta&quot; than to other Acanthisittids.

The relationships between genera and species were formerly poorly understood. The extant genus &quot;Acanthisitta&quot; has one species, the rifleman, and the other surviving genus, &quot;Xenicus&quot;, includes the New Zealand rock wren and the recently extinct bushwren. Some authorities have retained Lyall&#x27;s wren in &quot;Xenicus&quot; as well, but it is often afforded its own monotypic genus, &quot;Traversia&quot;. The stout-legged wren (genus &quot;Pachyplichas&quot;) was originally split into two species, but more recent research disputes this. The final genus was &quot;Dendroscansor&quot;, which had one species, the long-billed wren. A mitochondrial DNA study in 2016 resolved much of the phylogeny, though the placement of &quot;Dendroscansor&quot; was unresolved due to lack of DNA testing due to the rarity of its remains. It was found that &quot;Xenicus&quot; was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Pachyplichas&quot;, and that the stout legged wrens must have evolved from a gracile-legged ancestor, and the paper suggested placing the &quot;Pachyplichas&quot; species within &quot;Xenicus.&quot; It was also found that the split between Lyall&#x27;s wren and other acanthisittids probably took place during the Oligocene, over 30 million years ago, so acanthisittids must have survived the Oligocene drowning. A cladogram is given below:

==Description==

New Zealand wrens are tiny birds; the rifleman is the smallest of New Zealand&#x27;s birds. Their length ranges from 7 to 10Â cm and their weight ranges from as little as 5â7 g for the rifleman, to an estimated 50 g for the extinct stout-legged wren. The New Zealand rock wren (and probably the bushwren) weighs between 14 and 22 g and the extinct long-billed wren weighed around 30 g.

The plumage of the New Zealand wrens is only known for the four species seen by European scientists. All these species have dull green and brown plumage and all except Lyall&#x27;s wren have a prominent supercilium above the eye. The plumage of males and females were alike in Lyall&#x27;s wren and the bushwren; the New Zealand rock wren shows slight sexual dimorphism in its plumage and differences between the plumage of riflemen are pronounced, with the male having bright green upperparts and the female being duller and browner.

Both the New Zealand rock wren and the rifleman also show sexual dimorphism in size; unusually for passerines, the female is larger than the male. The female rifleman also exhibits other differences from the male, having a slightly more upturned bill than the male and a larger hind claw.

The New Zealand wrens evolved in the absence of mammals for many millions of years and the family was losing the ability to fly. Three species are thought to have lost the power of flight: the stout-legged wren, the long-billed wren and Lyall&#x27;s wren. The skeletons of these species have massively reduced keels in the sternum and the flight feathers of Lyall&#x27;s wren also indicate flightlessness. Contemporary accounts of the Lyall&#x27;s wrens on Stephens Island describe the species as scurrying on the ground rather than flying.

==Distribution and habitat==
The New Zealand wrens are endemic and restricted to the main and offshore islands of New Zealand; they have not been found on any of the outer islands such as the Chatham Islands or the Kermadec Islands. Prior to the arrival of humans in New Zealand (about 1280 CE), they had a widespread distribution across both the North and South Islands and on Stewart Island/Rakiura. The range of the rifleman and bushwren included southern beech forest and podocarp-broadleaf forest, with the range of the bushwren also including coastal forest and scrub, particularly the Stewart Island subspecies. Currently, the New Zealand rock wren is confined to alpine and subalpine zones (900â2500 m altitude) on the South Island. It is possible that the species was once present in the North Island, although this has never been proven. Lyall&#x27;s wren was once thought to have been restricted to the tiny Stephens Island in Cook Strait, but fossil evidence has shown the species was once widespread in both the North and South Islands. The stout-legged wren was similarly found on both islands, but fossils of the long-billed wren have only been found in the South Island. Fossils of the long-billed wren are far less common than those of the other species, in fact, its bones are the rarest fossil finds in New Zealand.

After the wave of extinctions and range contractions caused by the arrival of mammals in New Zealand, the New Zealand wrens have a much reduced range. The New Zealand rock wren is now restricted to the South Island and is declining in numbers. The range of the rifleman initially contracted with the felling of forests for agriculture, but it has also expanded its range of habitats by moving into plantations of introduced exotic pines, principally the Monterey pine. It also enters other human-modified habitat when it adjoins native forest.

Like all New Zealand passerines, the New Zealand wrens are sedentary and are not thought to undertake any migrations. It is not known if the extinct species migrated, but it is considered highly unlikely, as three of the extinct species were flightless. The situation with the New Zealand rock wren is an ornithological mystery, as they are thought to live above the snow line where obtaining food during the winter would be extremely difficult. Searches have found no evidence that they move altitudinally during the winter, but they are also absent from their normal territories. They may enter a state of torpor (like the hummingbirds of the Americas or a number of Australian passerines) during at least part of the winter, but this has not yet been proved.

<doc id="206917" wikidata="Q5316566" url="?curid=206917" title="Durham Students' Union">
<text>Durham Students&#x27; Union, operating as Durham SU, is the students&#x27; union of Durham University in Durham, England. It is an organisation, originally set up as the Durham Colleges Studentsâ Representative Council in 1899 and renamed in 1969, with the intention of representing and providing welfare and services for the students of the University of Durham.

==Location==
The Students&#x27; Union occupies and manages Dunelm House, a university-owned building in the centre of Durham where a wide variety of student activities take place. Designed by the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership, the Brutalist, angular concrete building was completed in 1966 under the supervision of architect Sir Ove Arup, whose Kingsgate Bridge, adjacent, opened two years earlier. Built into the steeply sloping bank of the River Wear, Dunelm House is notable internally for the fact that the main staircase linking all five levels of the building runs in an entirely straight line. This was intended by the building&#x27;s architects to create the feeling of an interior street.

In 1968 Dunelm House won a Civic Trust award, and a RIBA award in 1987, though it has been described by students as &quot;The ugliest building in Durham&quot;. On the other hand, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, the noted architecture historian, considered the building, &quot;Brutalist by tradition but not brutal to the landscape ... the elements, though bold, [are] sensitively composed.&quot; Durham City Council&#x27;s Local Plan notes that the &quot;powerful&quot; building, together with Kingsgate Bridge, &quot;provides an exhilarating pedestrian route ... out into open space over the river gorge&quot;. Following a four-year campaign by the Twentieth Century Society, the building was listed at Grade II in 2021 as &quot;the foremost studentsâ union building of the post-war era in England&quot;.

==Structure and decision making==
Durham SU is a registered charity. The Student&#x27;s Union is run by full-time sabbatical student officers, part-time officers, a board of trustee&#x27;s and a student assembly. 

The full-time sabbatical student officers are elected by Durham Student&#x27;s Union membership and they lead the political direction of the Union. For the 2024/25 Academic year, the sabbatical student officers are:
* President, Dan Lonsdale
* Education Officer, Catherine Howells
* Communities Officer, Moitreyo Ganguli

Starting in the 2024 academic year, the 3 full-time sabbatical officers will be supported by 12 part-time student officers, the part-time officers are: 

* One Faculty President for each Faculty of Durham University, Madeleine Grogan (Arts and Humanities), Oliver Cunnell (Business), Cassia Pearce (Science), Ella Thomas (Social Sciences and Health) â¯â¯ 
* The International Students Officer, Shing Wei Ng
* The Postgraduate Research Students Officer, Qiandong Zhou
* The Societies Officer, 
* The Welfare Officer, Joe Henley
* The Liberation Officer, Elisha Wharton
* The Sustainability Officer, Liumeng Hong
* One member of JCR Presidents Committee, Dan Mercerâ¯ 
* One member of MCR Presidents Committee, â¯â¯

The students&#x27; union president and a postgraduate student nominated by the students&#x27; union sit on the Council of Durham University, the governing body of the university.

The full-time and part-time officers are organised into the officer committee and the following sub-committees:

* Education Committee - chaired by the Education Officer and focusing on the academic experience. 
* Communities Committee - chaired by the Communities Officer, focusing on improving the aspects of the non-academic experience. 

The board of trustees is the governing body of the Union, it ensures it continues to meet its aims and operates within to boundaries of charity law. The board of trustees consists of 4 lay trustees, the 3 sabbatical student officers, and an additional 4 elected student trustees.

Assembly holds the sabbatical student officers to account, and also helps to shape the policy of the Union. Assembly consists of student officers, representatives of Junior Common Rooms from each Durham College, and representatives from Durham SU associations. 

Durham SU is also supported by a team of paid staff.

==Services==
The Durham SU acts an umbrella organisation for approximately 200 student clubs and organisations, which span academic, arts, culture and faith, hobbies and games, outdoors, politics, law and music interests. It also acts as am umbrella organisation for eight &#x27;associations&#x27;, which exist to allow for those who self-define into any of the associations to campaign on issues that effect their student experience, as well as to provide them with a safe space to discuss their problems.

It also runs the Kingsgate Bar and CafÃ© within the Dunelm House building. DurhamSU also provides room booking services at Dunelm House, used by both student groups, external groups, and the wider university. It also organises the Fresher&#x27;s Fair at the start of the academic year and runs campaigns and lobbies for student interests with the university and wider community. Kingsgate Bar and CafÃ© was closed for the 2024 academic year due to monetary issues.

DUCK (Durham University Charities Committee) is the fundraising arm of the DSU charitable organisation. DUCK runs events on a university and college level, including expeditions (fundraising to travel abroad), challenges (extreme events), endurance challenges, RAG raids (mass fundraising on city streets) and general events.

==Relation to colleges==
Durham University is a collegiate university and therefore the role of the central students&#x27; union is different from most other universities. Each of Durham&#x27;s colleges has its own student representative body, known in most colleges as the Junior Common Room, which provides services and organises events within the college; while many decisions within the central Students&#x27; Union are made with the involvement of JCR SU Representatives. However, some of the JCRs have opted to disaffiliate from the students&#x27; union - including University College and Hild Bede - following the controversial 2020 officer and trustee elections.

==Controversies==
===NUS Affiliation===
On a number of occasions, some have suggested have that Durham SU might disaffiliate from the NUS, however until 2009 none of those opposed to affiliation had pushed the issue to a full student debate and vote. In 2009 however, a referendum took place proposing that Durham SU should stay affiliated to the NUS. Students voted convincingly in favour of affiliation with 80% (2564) of students who voted voting to stay affiliated and 20% (624) voting to disaffiliate.

Shortly after this, controversy arose regarding a planned debate, &quot;Multiculturalism in Britain&quot;, at the Durham Union Society, which was to involve a recently elected BNP MEP, and which was subsequently cancelled over alleged fears for student safety, reopened the issue of NUS affiliation. A petition for a second referendum was put before the Union and on 12 March 2010, the referendum concluded with a majority of voting students voting to disaffiliate from the NUS, meaning that Durham Students&#x27; Union disaffiliated from the NUS after the end of the 2009-2010 academic year.

A third referendum on NUS affiliation was held in January 2011 with 60% of students voting to reaffiliate with NUS.

In 2015, another referendum reaffirmed NUS affiliation (61% supported affiliation), with an 11% voter turnout. The SU currently remains affiliated with the NUS.

=== 2020 sabbatical student officer elections ===
In 2020, there was a controversy surrounding the results of the 2020 election, with 58% of votes for Re-Open Nominations being cast aside as a result of alleged rule breaches by the Re-Open Nominations campaign. The Re-Open Nominations campaign faced accusations of racism and after the election has been cited as the cause of a spike in racist online abuse. Several college Common Rooms have chosen to &#x27;disaffiliate&#x27;, &#x27;disassociate&#x27; or &#x27;disengage&#x27; from the Students Union citing the decision to dismiss Re-Open Nominations.

This led to Durham SU to conduct a democracy review, with the aim of reviewing the unions democracy processes and to suggest improvements. Multiple issues were identified, including the need for better communication and a less binary voting system. 

=== Palatinate Independence Debate ===
In 2022, Durham university&#x27;s student newspaper Palatinate&#x27;s editorial board voted 97% in favour of becoming an independent newspaper, and leaving Durham Students Union.

The call for independence was supported by multiple former editors at Palatinate, including Jeremy Vine. The Mail on Sunday also promised to provide palatinate Â£20,000 to help &#x27;secure their independence&#x27; whilst claiming this would not effect their &#x27;editorial independence&#x27;. Whilst Palatinate claimed they had not accepted or rejected the money, Jack Ballingham, opportunities officer at the time, called the push for independence &#x27;unprovoked&#x27; and claimed Palatinate went to the Daily Mail for &#x27;extra firepower&#x27; against Durham SU. 

==Notable former officers==
A number of notable figures have been involved in Durham Students&#x27; Union in the past. These include:
* Andrew McFarlane (judge), former President
* Michael Izza, former President 
* Mo Mowlam, former Deputy President (Education and Welfare)
* Jeremy Vine, former Editor of Palatinate
* George Alagiah, former Editor of Palatinate

<text>Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasar host galaxies. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation that are outside of our own galaxy) with very high surface brightnesses whose spectra reveal strong, high-ionisation emission lines, but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable.

Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies and are some of the most intensely studied objects in astronomy, as they are thought to be powered by the same phenomena that occur in quasars, although they are closer and less luminous than quasars. These galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers which are surrounded by accretion discs of in-falling material. The accretion discs are believed to be the source of the observed ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet emission and absorption lines provide the best diagnostics for the composition of the surrounding material.

Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, it becomes clear that the luminosity of their cores is of comparable intensity to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.

Seyfert galaxies are named after Carl Seyfert, who first described this class in 1943.

== Discovery ==
Seyfert galaxies were first detected in 1908 by Edward A. Fath and Vesto Slipher, who were using the Lick Observatory to look at the spectra of astronomical objects that were thought to be &quot;spiral nebulae&quot;. They noticed that NGC 1068 showed six bright emission lines, which was considered unusual as most objects observed showed an absorption spectrum corresponding to stars.

In 1926, Edwin Hubble looked at the emission lines of NGC 1068 and two other such &quot;nebulae&quot; and classified them as extragalactic objects. In 1943, Carl Keenan Seyfert discovered more galaxies similar to NGC 1068 and reported that these galaxies have very bright stellar-like nuclei that produce broad emission lines. In 1944 Cygnus A was detected at 160Â MHz, and detection was confirmed in 1948 when it was established that it was a discrete source. Its double radio structure became apparent with the use of interferometry. In the next few years, other radio sources such as supernova remnants were discovered. By the end of the 1950s, more important characteristics of Seyfert galaxies were discovered, including the fact that their nuclei are extremely compact (&lt;Â 100 pc, i.e. &quot;unresolved&quot;), have high mass (â109Â±1 solar masses), and the duration of peak nuclear emissions is relatively short (&gt;Â 108 years).

In the 1960s and 1970s, research to further understand the properties of Seyfert galaxies was carried out. A few direct measurements of the actual sizes of Seyfert nuclei were taken, and it was established that the emission lines in NGC 1068 were produced in a region over a thousand light years in diameter. Controversy existed over whether Seyfert redshifts were of cosmological origin. Confirming estimates of the distance to Seyfert galaxies and their age were limited since their nuclei vary in brightness over a time scale of a few years; therefore arguments involving distance to such galaxies and the constant speed of light cannot always be used to determine their age. In the same time period, research had been undertaken to survey, identify and catalogue galaxies, including Seyferts. Beginning in 1967, Benjamin Markarian published lists containing a few hundred galaxies distinguished by their very strong ultraviolet emission, with measurements on the position of some of them being improved in 1973 by other researchers. At the time, it was believed that 1% of spiral galaxies are Seyferts. By 1977, it was found that very few Seyfert galaxies are ellipticals, most of them being spiral or barred spiral galaxies. During the same time period, efforts have been made to gather spectrophotometric data for Seyfert galaxies. It became obvious that not all spectra from Seyfert galaxies look the same, so they have been subclassified according to the characteristics of their emission spectra. A simple division into types I and II has been devised, with the classes depending on the relative width of their emission lines. It has been later noticed that some Seyfert nuclei show intermediate properties, resulting in their being further subclassified into types 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9 (see #Classification). Early surveys for Seyfert galaxies were biased in counting only the brightest representatives of this group. More recent surveys that count galaxies with low-luminosity and obscured Seyfert nuclei suggest that the Seyfert phenomenon is actually quite common, occurring in 16%Â Â±Â 5% of galaxies; indeed, several dozen galaxies exhibiting the Seyfert phenomenon exist in the close vicinity (â27 Mpc) of our own galaxy. Seyfert galaxies form a substantial fraction of the galaxies appearing in the Markarian Catalogue, a list of galaxies displaying an ultraviolet excess in their nuclei.

== Characteristics ==
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a higher than normal luminosity over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. A galaxy having an active nucleus is called an active galaxy. Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe, and their evolution puts constraints on cosmological models. Depending on the type, their luminosity varies over a timescale from a few hours to a few years. The two largest subclasses of active galaxies are quasars and Seyfert galaxies, the main difference between the two being the amount of radiation they emit. In a typical Seyfert galaxy, the nuclear source emits at visible wavelengths an amount of radiation comparable to that of the whole galaxy&#x27;s constituent stars, while in a quasar, the nuclear source is brighter than the constituent stars by at least a factor of 100. Seyfert galaxies have extremely bright nuclei, with luminosities ranging between 108 and 1011 solar luminosities. Only about 5% of them are radio bright; their emissions are moderate in gamma rays and bright in X-rays. Their visible and infrared spectra show very bright emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. These emission lines exhibit strong Doppler broadening, which implies velocities from , and are believed to originate near an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole.

=== Eddington luminosity ===

A lower limit to the mass of the central black hole can be calculated using the Eddington luminosity. This limit arises because light exhibits radiation pressure. Assume that a black hole is surrounded by a disc of luminous gas. Both the attractive gravitational force acting on electron-ion pairs in the disc and the repulsive force exerted by radiation pressure follow an inverse-square law. If the gravitational force exerted by the black hole is less than the repulsive force due to radiation pressure, the disc will be blown away by radiation pressure.

=== Emissions ===
The emission lines seen on the spectrum of a Seyfert galaxy may come from the surface of the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.

The narrow lines are believed to originate from the outer part of the active galactic nucleus, where velocities are lower, while the broad lines originate closer to the black hole. This is confirmed by the fact that the narrow lines do not vary detectably, which implies that the emitting region is large, contrary to the broad lines which can vary on relatively short timescales. Reverberation mapping is a technique which uses this variability to try to determine the location and morphology of the emitting region. This technique measures the structure and kinematics of the broad line emitting region by observing the changes in the emitted lines as a response to changes in the continuum. The use of reverberation mapping requires the assumption that the continuum originates in a single central source. For 35 AGN, reverberation mapping has been used to calculate the mass of the central black holes and the size of the broad line regions.

In the few radio-loud Seyfert galaxies that have been observed, the radio emission is believed to represent synchrotron emission from the jet. The infrared emission is due to radiation in other bands being reprocessed by dust near the nucleus. The highest energy photons are believed to be created by inverse Compton scattering by a high-temperature corona near the black hole.

== Classification ==
Seyferts were first classified as TypeÂ I or II, depending on the emission lines shown by their spectra. The spectra of TypeÂ I Seyfert galaxies show broad lines that include both allowed lines, like HÂ I, HeÂ I or HeÂ II and narrower forbidden lines, like OÂ III. They show some narrower allowed lines as well, but even these narrow lines are much broader than the lines shown by normal galaxies. However, the spectra of TypeÂ II Seyfert galaxies show only narrow lines, both permitted and forbidden. Forbidden lines are spectral lines that occur due to electron transitions not normally allowed by the selection rules of quantum mechanics, but that still have a small probability of spontaneously occurring. The term &quot;forbidden&quot; is slightly misleading, as the electron transitions causing them are not forbidden but highly improbable.

In some cases, the spectra show both broad and narrow permitted lines, which is why they are classified as an intermediate type between Type IÂ and TypeÂ II, such as TypeÂ 1.5 Seyfert. The spectra of some of these galaxies have changed from TypeÂ 1.5 to TypeÂ II in a matter of a few years. However, the characteristic broad HÎ± emission line has rarely, if ever, disappeared. The origin of the differences between TypeÂ I and TypeÂ II Seyfert galaxies is not known yet. There are a few cases where galaxies have been identified as TypeÂ II only because the broad components of the spectral lines have been very hard to detect. It is believed by some that all TypeÂ II Seyferts are in fact TypeÂ I, where the broad components of the lines are impossible to detect because of the angle we are at with respect to the galaxy. Specifically, in TypeÂ I Seyfert galaxies, we observe the central compact source more or less directly, therefore sampling the high velocity clouds in the broad line emission region moving around the supermassive black hole thought to be at the center of the galaxy. By contrast, in TypeÂ II Seyfert galaxies, the active nuclei are obscured and only the colder outer regions located further away from the clouds&#x27; broad line emission region are seen. This theory is known as the &quot;Unification scheme&quot; of Seyfert galaxies. However, it is not yet clear if this hypothesis can explain all the observed differences between the two types.

=== Type I Seyfert galaxies ===

TypeÂ I Seyferts are very bright sources of ultraviolet light and X-rays in addition to the visible light coming from their cores. They have two sets of emission lines on their spectra: narrow lines with widths (measured in velocity units) of several hundred km/s, and broad lines with widths up to 104 km/s. The broad lines originate above the accretion disc of the supermassive black hole thought to power the galaxy, while the narrow lines occur beyond the broad line region of the accretion disc. Both emissions are caused by heavily ionised gas. The broad line emission arises in a region 0.1â1 parsec across. The broad line emission region, RBLR, can be estimated from the time delay corresponding to the time taken by light to travel from the continuum source to the line-emitting gas.

=== Type II Seyfert galaxies ===

Type II Seyfert galaxies have the characteristic bright core, as well as appearing bright when viewed at infrared wavelengths. Their spectra contain narrow lines associated with forbidden transitions, and broader lines associated with allowed strong dipole or intercombination transitions. NGC 3147 is considered the best candidate to be a true TypeÂ II Seyfert galaxy. In some TypeÂ II Seyfert galaxies, analysis with a technique called spectro-polarimetry (spectroscopy of polarised light component) revealed obscured TypeÂ I regions. In the case of NGC 1068, nuclear light reflected off a dust cloud was measured, which led scientists to believe in the presence of an obscuring dust torus around a bright continuum and broad emission line nucleus. When the galaxy is viewed from the side, the nucleus is indirectly observed through reflection by gas and dust above and below the torus. This reflection causes the polarisation.

=== Type 1.2, 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9 Seyfert galaxies ===
In 1981, Donald Osterbrock introduced the notations TypeÂ 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9, where the subclasses are based on the optical appearance of the spectrum, with the numerically larger subclasses having weaker broad-line components relative to the narrow lines. For example, TypeÂ 1.9 only shows a broad component in the HÎ± line, and not in higher order Balmer lines. In TypeÂ 1.8, very weak broad lines can be detected in the HÎ² lines as well as HÎ±, even if they are very weak compared to the HÎ±. In TypeÂ 1.5, the strength of the HÎ± and HÎ² lines are comparable.

=== Other Seyfert-like galaxies ===
In addition to the Seyfert progression from TypeÂ I to TypeÂ II (including TypeÂ 1.2 to TypeÂ 1.9), there are other types of galaxies that are very similar to Seyferts or that can be considered as subclasses of them. Very similar to Seyferts are the low-ionisation narrow-line-emission radio galaxies (LINER), discovered in 1980. These galaxies have strong emission lines from weakly ionised or neutral atoms, while the emission lines from strongly ionised atoms are relatively weak by comparison. LINERs share a large amount of traits with low-luminosity Seyferts. In fact, when seen in visible light, the global characteristics of their host galaxies are indistinguishable. Also, they both show a broad-line emission region, but the line-emitting region in LINERs has a lower density than in Seyferts. An example of such a galaxy is M104 in the Virgo constellation, also known as the Sombrero Galaxy. A galaxy that is both a LINER and a TypeÂ I Seyfert is NGC 7213, a galaxy that is relatively close compared to other AGNs. Another very interesting subclass are the narrow-line TypeÂ I galaxies (NLSy1), which have been subject to extensive research in recent years. They have much narrower lines than the broad lines from classic TypeÂ I galaxies, steep hard and soft X-ray spectra and strong Fe[II] emission. Their properties suggest that NLSy1 galaxies are young AGNs with high accretion rates, suggesting a relatively small but growing central black hole mass. There are theories suggesting that NLSy1s are galaxies in an early stage of evolution, and links between them and ultraluminous infrared galaxies or TypeÂ II galaxies have been proposed.

== Evolution ==
The majority of active galaxies are very distant and show large Doppler shifts. This suggests that active galaxies occurred in the early Universe and, due to cosmic expansion, are receding away from the Milky Way at very high speeds. Quasars are the furthest active galaxies, some of them being observed at distances 12 billion light years away. Seyfert galaxies are much closer than quasars. Because light has a finite speed, looking across large distances in the Universe is equivalent to looking back in time. Therefore, the observation of active galactic nuclei at large distances and their scarcity in the nearby Universe suggests that they were much more common in the early Universe, implying that active galactic nuclei could be early stages of galactic evolution. This leads to the question about what would be the local (modern-day) counterparts of AGNs found at large redshifts. It has been proposed that NLSy1s could be the small redshift counterparts of quasars found at large redshifts The two have many similar properties, for example: high metallicities or similar pattern of emission lines (strong Fe [II], weak O [III]). Some observations suggest that AGN emission from the nucleus is not spherically symmetric and that the nucleus often shows axial symmetry, with radiation escaping in a conical region. Based on these observations, models have been devised to explain the different classes of AGNs as due to their different orientations with respect to the observational line of sight. Such models are called unified models. Unified models explain the difference between TypeÂ I and TypeÂ II galaxies as being the result of TypeÂ II galaxies being surrounded by obscuring toruses which prevent telescopes from seeing the broad line region. Quasars and blazars can be fit quite easily in this model. The main problem of such a unification scheme is trying to explain why some AGN are radio loud while others are radio quiet. It has been suggested that these differences may be due to differences in the spin of the central black hole.

<doc id="206924" wikidata="Q312611" url="?curid=206924" title="Youssef Chahine">
<text>Youssef Chahine ( ; 25 January 1926 â 27 July 2008) was an Egyptian film director. He was active in the Egyptian film industry from 1950 until his death. He directed twelve films included in a list of Top 100 Egyptian films published by the Cairo International Film Festival. A winner of the Cannes 50th Anniversary Award (for lifetime achievement), Chahine was credited with launching the career of actor Omar Sharif. A well-regarded director with critics, he was often present at film festivals during the earlier decades of his work. Chahine gained his largest international audience as one of the co-directors of &quot;11&#x27;9&quot;01 September 11&quot; (2002).

==Childhood and early life==
Chahine (Fr. pronounced Shaaheen) was born in Alexandria, Egypt to an Egyptian Coptic family. His father was an Egyptian Lebanese and was a supporter of the Egyptian nationalist Wafd Party. His mother, Claire Bastorous was of Greek descent. She worked as a tailor. Although Chahine was raised Catholic, he was not a believer in organized religion. If asked of his religion, he would state, &quot;Egyptian&quot;. At home, the Chahines spoke five languages, which was common in cosmopolitan Alexandria at the time.

Chahine had affectionate parents and had a strong relationship with both of them- even though his mother and father had distinct personalities. At a young age, he knew what he wanted to become. Chahine would stay under his bed and in his room for hours, picturing himself in the industry- whether in a projection theater, a cinema hall or a production company.

When asked about his childhood and early interest in cinema, Chahine said:&quot;At the age of Eight, I discovered that 9.5mm films and projectors were being sold in stores. I saved from allowances enough to buy the projector and then became a regular for the Rabbani Bibi films. I used to gather the children of the neighborhood to show them these films. Some of them didnât care for cinema and would come up with excuses not to attend. So I had no choice but to form a gang to beat up those who were late coming to the show.&quot;

In the following years, two concepts raged Chahine and gagged his interest: indulging in sexual fantasies and cinema. A few years later, Chahine dealt with the death of his brother Alfred, who was only two years older than him. Chahine always remembered Alfred&#x27;s eyes, which influenced his work. Most his male actors had eyes that resembled Alfred&#x27;s.

According to Chahine, his father was honest, which seeped into his values and was a trait he appreciated having. Along with honesty, Chahine&#x27;s father ignited his love for books. Being a lawyer, Chahine&#x27;s father could not keep up with the tuition bills, so he closed up his law office and took a job in the legal department in the Alexandria municipality so he could send Chahine to &quot;Victoria College&quot;. Another memory Chahine was fond of, was how his father took him to the desert, and taught him how to look for landmarks and find his way back home. Scouting for film locations often brought back these memories. Their home was aristocratic, even though they were not rich. They had to be well mannered, and mistakes had punishments(which usually meant having dinner alone in the kitchen rather than outside on the family table.) Despite them being tight on money, they would still have guests over for dinner and lived without paying much attention to bank statements.

==Education==
Fascinated by the performing arts from an early age, young Chahine began to create shows at home for his family. Chahine began his education at a FrÃ¨res&#x27; school CollÃ¨ge Saint Marc. Growing up, he attended Alexandria&#x27;s elite Victoria College. After graduating from Victoria college in 1944, he was determined to go abroad to fulfill his passions. His parents refused, and tried to talk him out of it. They enrolled him in the college of Engineering at the University of Alexandria, but Chahine refused and later said that he had to &quot;blackmail them, and almost jump out of the window.&quot; He was later able to get what he wanted, and enrolled in the Pasadena Playhouse in California where he studied theater and television, but not film. Out of the 200 students that attended, only thirteen took the final examination, and only four passed, with Chahine ranking first.

After returning from Pasadena, Chahine didn&#x27;t work in Egyptian theater or film. Instead, he worked in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s publicity department, where he worked with Gianni Vernuccio and Alvise Orfanelli. During this time, a producer turned to Chahine to finish a film after the director had left following a quarrel, but Chahine refused to complete someone else&#x27;s work. On another occasion, Chahine was offered the position of Assistant Director, which he also refused, stating that he was working on Hollywood theaters beforehand and an Assistant Director role was not for him.

==Starting as a director==
After returning to Egypt, he turned his attention to directing. Cinematographer Alvise Orfanelli helped Chahine into the film business. Chahine directed his first feature film in 1950, Baba Amin (Daddy Amin) at the age of 23, two years before the Egyptian revolution of 1952 that saw the overthrow of the monarchy and the rise of the charismatic leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. One year later, with &quot;Nile Boy&quot; (1951) he was first invited to the Cannes Film Festival. Sira&#x27; fi-l-Wadi (&quot;Struggle in the Valley&quot;) introduced Omar Sharif to the cinematic screen. In 1970 he was awarded a Golden Tanit at the Carthage Film Festival for al-Ikhtiyar (The Choice). With &quot;The Sparrow&quot; (1973), in which he showed his political opinions after the Six-Day War with Israel, he directed the first EgyptâAlgeria co-production.

He won the Silver Bear â Special Jury Priz at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Alexandria... Why?&quot; (1978), the first instalment in what would prove to be an autobiographic quartet, completed with &quot;An Egyptian Story&quot; (1982), &quot;Alexandria, Again and Again&quot; (1990), and &quot;Alexandria...New York&quot; (2004). The producer Humbert Balsan went to Cannes in 2004 with &quot;Alexandria... New York&quot;, his ninth film with the Egyptian director since 1985&#x27;s &quot;Adieu, Bonaparte&quot;. In one of his films &quot;The Sixth Day&quot; Ø§ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØ³Ø§Ø¯Ø³, an adaptation of a novel written in French by Lebanese writer AndrÃ© Chedid, the famous Egyptian singer Dalida was the protagonist in the role of a poor Egyptian woman.

About his work, Chahine has said, &quot;I make my films first for myself. Then for my family. Then for Alexandria. Then for Egypt,&quot; Chahine once famously said. &quot;If the Arab world likes them, ahlan wa sahlan (welcome). If the foreign audience likes them, they are doubly welcome.&quot;

==Significant films==
During his long career Chahine produced different movies, including Aly Badrakhan&#x27;s &quot;Chafika et Metwal&quot; (1979). His early films in Egypt included &quot;The Blazing Sun&quot; (1954), which begun while Farouk was still King and dealing with a peasant farmer&#x27;s challenge to a feudal landlord. In 1992 Jacques Lassalle approached him to stage a piece of his choice for ComÃ©die-FranÃ§aise. Chahine agreed and chose to adapt Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;Caligula.&quot; The same year he started writing &quot;The Emigrant&quot; (1994), a story inspired by the Biblical character of Joseph, son of Jacob.

This had been an intended project for some years and he was finally able to film it in 1994. This film created a controversy in Egypt between liberals and fundamentalists who opposed the depiction of religious characters in films. In 1997, 46 years later, his work was acknowledged at the Cannes Film Festival with the lifetime achievement award. Chahine is credited for directing five films starring Salah Zulfikar including significant productions such as &quot;Saladin the Victorious&quot; (1963), &quot;The Nile and the Life&quot; (1968) and &quot;Those People of the Nile&quot; (1972) and also credited for discovering Omar Sharif, whose first starring role was in &quot;The Blazing Sun&quot; (1954). He also provided Hind Rostom with a role early on in her career in &quot;Cairo Station&quot; (1958).

Chahine produced his four autobiographical films starting 1978 and up till 2004. These films tell Yehia&#x27;s life, which reflects Chahine&#x27;s own. In this quartet, he explores his sexuality, personality, and family issues. The autobiographical films all take place between World War One and World War Two.

Released in 1979, and set in the 1940s, &quot;Alexandria... Why? S&quot;parked controversy and censorship from the government- it examines Egypt&#x27;s social and political issues. &quot;An Egyptian Story&quot;, released later in 1982, Chahine looks at his own journey as an auteur and a director.

In 1989, Chahine released his third autobiographical film &quot;Alexandria Again and Forever.&quot; This film follows a strike that the actors and actresses, as well as production workers in the Egyptian film industry participate in. The film is a political commentary on censorship in Egypt. Chahine uses many directorial styles: &quot;veritÃ©,&quot; normal narrative and formalism.

The fourth and final film to the autobiographical film is &quot;Alexandria ... New York&quot; (2004). The film draws a parallel between Chahine&#x27;s life and the narrative he tells: it explores the relationship between the United States and Egypt.

===&quot;Cairo Station&quot; (&quot;Bab al-Hadid&quot;, 1958)===

The film is set in Cairo train station and features mainly Kinawi (played by Youssef Chahine), a mentally unstable newspaper seller that is madly in love with Hanouma, who works as an illegal cold drinks vendor at the same station. Kinawi cuts pictures of women from magazines for the little cabin that he lives in, and has a psychosexual obsession with Hanouma (played by the acknowledged actress Hind Rostom), who is engaged to Abou Seri&#x27; (Farid Shawki), porter and trade union organiser. In a turn of events, Kinawi attacks Halawithom, Hanouma&#x27;s friend.

===&quot;Jamila al-Jaza&#x27;iriyya&quot; (&quot;Jamila, The Algerian&quot;, 1958)===

Jamila Bouhired, often known as Jamila. was an Algerian and Arab symbol of resistance. Jamila sees the French Army arrest her friend. She then volunteers to join the National Liberation Front. After a while, she is promoted to an organizer because of her intelligence. Eventually she is arrested and tortured in prison. She is put on trial in a military court and they try to accidentally kill him, as they have disposed of many witnesses. Luckily, the lawyer survives but the court still gives her the death penalty. The resistance movements rile up and Jamila is a symbol of inspiration and resistance to the Arab world.

It premiered at the Moscow Film Festival in 1959, with the French government&#x27;s dismay. The film gained high critical recognition in the festival specially for Salah Zulfikar and Ahmed Mazhar, the lead actors in the film. However it was not shown on Egyptian television for many years. According to Magda, the lead actress and producer of the film, Egypt had banned the screening in order to not harm political relations with France.

===&quot;Saladin&quot; (original title: &quot;El Nasser Salah Ed-Din&quot; (&quot;Saladin, The Victorious&quot;, 1963)===

Chahine made an epic, three-hour film in widescreen named after the 12th century Ayyubid sultan who, as the film begins, is preparing to liberate Jerusalem from its Crusader occupiers. It was scripted by Ezz El-Dine Zulficar, Naguib Mahfouz and the poet and progressive writer, Abderrahman Cherkaoui.

A parallel between Saladin and President Nasser, a champion of pan-Arabism, is easily drawn. Saladin is portrayed as an educated and peaceful manâat one point he is asked to give clandestine medical help to Richard the Lion Heart, who was shot by an arrow. Saladin later tells him: &quot;Religion is Godâs and the Earth is for all ... I guarantee to all Christians in Jerusalem the same rights as are enjoyed by Muslims.&quot;

Chahine was well aware of the propaganda dimension that implicitly painted President Nasser as a modern-era Saladin, stating &quot;My own sympathies were with pan-Arabism, which I still believe in.&quot; The main reason he made the film was to prove that an epic film with a small budget, by global cinema standards, was feasible. From then on, he only produced colour films.

===&quot;Al Ard&quot; (&quot;The Earth&quot;, 1968)===
A novel by Cherkaoui, serialised, formed the basis of &quot;The Earth&quot; ,and is noted particularly for its image of the peasant farmer â &quot;eternal &#x27;damned of the earth&#x27;&quot; â which broke with &quot;the ridiculous image the cinema had (hitherto) given him&quot; (Khaled Osman). There followed a further collaboration with Mahfouz on &quot;The Choice.&quot;

===&quot;Al Ikhtiyar&quot; (&quot;The Choice&quot;, 1970)===

The protagonist of the film is schizophrenic, a fact that the audience discovers well into the film. The film mainly follows the police as they try to solve the murder of Mahmoud, who is believed to be the unidentified corpse in the beginning of the film. The older detectives believe that Sayyid, Mahmoud&#x27;s twin brother killed him. While a young assistant questions whether this is self-deception and not even a real crime.

===&quot;Al Usfur&quot; (&quot;The Sparrow&quot;, 1972)===

The film deals with the aftermath of the Six Day War and Nasser&#x27;s announcement of the defeat and his subsequent resignation.

Bahiyya, the main character runs into the street, followed by a growing crowd, shouting &quot;No! we must fight. We wonât accept defeat!&quot;âan iconic scene in Egyptian cinema.

===&quot;Iskinderiya.. leh?&quot; (&quot;Alexandria, Why?&quot;, 1978)===

Yehia, a young Victoria College student, is obsessed with Hollywood and dreams of cinema. It is 1942, the Germans are about to enter Alexandria, a thought that is preferable to the presence of the British in Egypt.

===&quot;Hadduta Masriya&quot; (&quot;An Egyptian Story&quot;, 1982)===
As a result of a heart operation, he reviews his life: moments of Chahine&#x27;s own films are replayed against their autobiographical and social historical context.

Memory is very important to Chahine&#x27;s most recent work âwhether of the &quot;city of my childhood, Alexandria, between the two world wars tolerant, secular, open to Muslims, Christians and Jews&quot; or of a more distant past: such as evoked in Adieu Bonaparte (1985), based on the cultural aspect of Bonaparte&#x27;s expedition into Egypt (1798). &quot;Out of this marvelous confrontation there was a rebirth of Egyptian consciousness, of its past ... which belongs to humanity.&quot;

===&quot;Al-Massir&quot; (&quot;Destiny&quot;, 1997)===

Set in Andalusia in the 12th century, &quot;Destiny&quot; is a historical drama about Ibn Rushd, a prominent Muslim thinker known for his debates with Muslim theologians and treatises on Aristotle. The film portrays his friendship with a group of intellectuals and artists, including a singer played by Mohamed Mounir, who come under attack from a rising movement of militant fundamentalists backed by the region&#x27;s ruler, Caliph al-Mansour. The film incorporates political themes and songs that can be seen as allegorical, since it was produced and released during a period when Egypt was experiencing a series of Islamist terrorist attacks.

==Controversies==
Despite being internationally renowned, and successful in Egypt, Chahine has often been the center of controversies due to his liberal views, portrayal of sexuality and political critique.

&quot;Cairo Station&quot;, albeit a classic of Egyptian cinema, shocked viewers both by the sympathy with which a &quot;fallen woman&quot; is depicted and by the violence with which another is killed. It was also a style that Egyptian audiences were not used to, hence it was rejected by the public, but still received appraisal from critics.

&quot;The Sparrow&quot; attacked Egyptian corruption and blamed it for the defeat in the Six Day War, which gained backlash from government supporters.

During the several following years, Chahine found himself increasingly in conflict with the government-backed film industry of Egypt and its heavy political restrictions in filmmaking. In 1964, after filming (1965, Dawn of a New Day), he traveled to Lebanon, where he shot two musicals: Bayya al-Khawatim (1965, Ring Seller) and Rimal al-Dhahab (1967, Sands of Gold). Ring Seller became one of the best musicals of Arab cinema, bringing success to Youssef Chahine, whereas Sands of Gold, due to delays in shooting and its box-office failure, forced him to quit his work in Lebanon and return to Egypt.

In 1994, with the release of &quot;Al Mohaguer (The Emigrant),&quot; Chahine ran into trouble with fundamentalists. The film tells the story of Joseph, and Islam does not condone the drawing, or acting out the role of a prophet. The film was initially banned awaiting a lawsuit that Chahine eventually won, however, it was still not screened. Chahine criticized the increasing influence of Islamic fundamentalism on Egyptian culture under the government of Hosni Mubarak, saying &quot;The Egyptian has always been a very religious person, but at the same time he is also a lover of life and art and music and theater.&quot; He also blamed the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and particularly Saudi Arabia, for their influence.

He again found himself at conflict with fundamentalists after the release of &quot;Al Masir (Destiny)&quot; which tells the story of Andalucian Arab philosopher, Abu al-Walid ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd (known in the west as Averroes). The film&#x27;s goal was to initiate religious tolerance, however, it was seen as disrespectful to Ibn Rushd.

Upon the release of &quot;Al Akhar (The Other)&quot; in 1999, the film caused some public controversy. The film features a mother who exposes a woman&#x27;s scam after she and her son had fallen in love and planned to marry. We later discover in the film that the mother&#x27;s relationship to her son was somewhat sexual. The film was not banned, and screened normally in theaters and on televisions.

==Gay-bisexual themes in his work==
Chahine frequently included gay or bisexual themes in his work. &quot;Alexandria... Why?&quot; tells the story of two young menâone Egyptian, the other Europeanâwho fall in love during World War II. Yehia&#x27;s cousin is gay and &#x27;buys&#x27; drunken British soldiers. 
In &quot;An Egyptian Story&quot; (1982) Yehia is a film-maker, going to London (as Chahine had earlier) for open-heart surgery. He has a brief affair with a taxi driver.

==Illness and death==
Chahine was hospitalised at El Shorouq hospital in Cairo, having fallen into a coma following an apparent cerebral haemorrhage, on Sunday, 15 June 2008. On Monday, 16 June 2008, Chahine was flown to Paris on an emergency flight and admitted to the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, west of Paris, where his niece told AFP his condition was &quot;critical but stable.&quot;

Youssef Chahine died in his Cairo home on Sunday, 27 July 2008. He was survived by his wife, Colette.

==Tribute==
In 2008, he was honored by BAFTA for his contribution to film.

On 25 January 2015, Google Doodle commemorated his 89th birthday.

<doc id="206928" wikidata="Q1853598" url="?curid=206928" title="List of birds of New Zealand">
<text>This is the list of the [[birds of New Zealand]]. The common name of the bird in New Zealand English is given first, and its MÄori-language name, if different, is also noted.

The North Island and South Island are the two largest islands of New Zealand. Stewart Island is the largest of the smaller islands. New Zealand proper also includes outlying islands such as the Chatham Islands, Kermadec Islands, and New Zealand Subantarctic Islands. Only New Zealand proper is represented on this list, not the Realm of New Zealand. For birds in the associated states or dependent territories, see List of birds of the Cook Islands, List of birds of Niue, List of birds of Tokelau, and List of birds of Antarctica.

Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below occur regularly in New Zealand as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The species marked extinct became extinct subsequent to human arrival in New Zealand. About two thirds of the extinctions occurred after the arrival of MÄori but before the arrival of PÄkehÄ (European New Zealanders) and the rest since PÄkehÄ arrived.

The following codes are used to denote other categories of species:

* (B) Breeding â confirmed nesting records in New Zealand or a portion thereof, excluding introduced species.
* (I) Introduced â a species introduced to New Zealand by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly
* (X) Extinct â a species that became extinct after human arrival in New Zealand
* (ex) Extirpated â a species no longer found in New Zealand or a portion thereof but existing elsewhere
* (P) Regularly occurring in New Zealand or a portion thereof. The species occurs on an annual or mostly annual basis but does not nest in New Zealand.
* (V) Vagrant â a species rarely occurring in New Zealand or a portion thereof.

The list&#x27;s taxonomic treatment and nomenclature (common and scientific names) mainly follows the conventions of &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition. Some supplemental referencing is that of the Avibase &quot;Bird Checklists of the World&quot; as of 2022, and the 4th edition of the &quot;Checklist of the Birds of New Zealand&quot;, published in 2010 by Te Papa Press in association with the Ornithological Society of New Zealand, which is an authoritative list of the birds of New Zealand.

==Kiwi==
Order: ApterygiformesFamily: Apterygidae

Kiwi are flightless birds all native to New Zealand. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest ratites.


==Giant moa==
Order: DinornithiformesFamily: Dinornithidae

The giant moa (&quot;Dinornis&quot;) is an extinct genus of birds belonging to the moa family. As with other moa, it was a member of the order Dinornithiformes. It was endemic to New Zealand. Two species of &quot;Dinornis&quot; are considered valid, the North Island giant moa (&quot;Dinornis novaezealandiae&quot;) and the South Island giant moa (&quot;Dinornis robustus&quot;). In addition, two further species (new lineage A and lineage B) have been suggested based on distinct DNA lineages.


== Lesser moa ==
Order: DinornithiformesFamily: Emeidae

The lesser moa (family Emeidae) were a family of moa. The moa were ratites from New Zealand. About two-thirds of all moa species are in the lesser moa family.
== Upland moa ==
Order: DinornithiformesFamily: Megalapterygidae

The upland moa (&quot;Megalapteryx didinus&quot;) was a species of moa endemic to New Zealand. It was a ratite, a grouping of flightless birds with no keel on the sternum. It was the last moa species to become extinct, vanishing in 1445 CE, and was predominantly found in alpine and sub-alpine environments.
==Ducks, geese, and swans==
Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae

The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. The Cape Barren goose is also recorded as an escape from captivity in New Zealand which has bred, as well as being a vagrant from Australia as set out in the table below.


==Guineafowl==
Order: GalliformesFamily: Numididae

The guineafowl are a family of birds native to Africa. They typically eat insects and seeds, are ground-nesting, and resemble partridges, except with featherless heads.

==New World quail==
Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae

The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.


== Megapodes ==
Order: GalliformesFamily: Megapodiidae

The megapodes are stocky, medium-large, chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet. Their name literally means &quot;large foot&quot; and is a reference to the heavy legs and feet typical of these terrestrial birds. All are browsers, and all but the malleefowl occupy wooded habitats.
==Pheasants and allies==
Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae

Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.


==Grebes==
Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae

Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

==Pigeons and doves==
Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae

Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.

==Cuckoos==
Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae

==Adzebills==
Order: GruiformesFamily: Aptornithidae

The adzebills, genus &quot;Aptornis&quot;, were two closely related bird species of the extinct family Aptornithidae.


==Rails==
Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.


==Cranes==
Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae

Cranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or &quot;dances&quot;.

The Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

==Pratincoles and coursers==
Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae

Pratincoles have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.

==Skuas==
Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae

They are in general medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws.

==Darters==
Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae

Anhingas or darters are frequently referred to as &quot;snake-birds&quot; because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged.
The males have black and dark brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have a much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet, and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.

==Cormorants and shags==
Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae

The Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium-to-large coastal, fish-eating sea-birds that includes cormorants and shags.

Characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. In size they range from to in length. Old World parrots are found from Africa east across south and southeast Asia and Oceania to Australia and New Zealand.

==New Zealand wrens==
Order: PasseriformesFamily: Acanthisittidae

The New Zealand wrens are a family (Acanthisittidae) of tiny passerines endemic to New Zealand. They were represented by six known species in four or five genera, although only two species survive in two genera today. They are understood to form a distinct lineage within the passerines, but authorities differ on their assignment to the oscines or suboscines (the two suborders that between them make up the Passeriformes).

==Honeyeaters==

==Stitchbird==
Order: PasseriformesFamily: Notiomystidae

The stitchbird or hihi (&quot;Notiomystis cincta&quot;) is a honeyeater-like bird endemic to the North Island and adjacent offshore islands of New Zealand. Its evolutionary relationships have long puzzled ornithologists, but it is now classed as the only member of its own family, the Notiomystidae.

==Australasian robins==
Order: PasseriformesFamily: Petroicidae

The bird family Petroicidae includes 49 species in 19 genera. All are endemic to Australasia: New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand and numerous Pacific Islands as far east as Samoa. For want of an accurate common name, the family is often called the Australasian robins. Within the family the species are known not only as robins but as scrub-robins and flyrobins. They are, however, only distantly related to the Old World family Muscicapidae (to which other species with such names belong) and the monarch flycatchers (Monarchidae).

==Larks==

<doc id="206931" wikidata="Q2252580" url="?curid=206931" title="Hither Green">
<text>Hither Green is a district in south-east London, England, in the London Borough of Lewisham. It forms the southern part of Lewisham, 6.6Â miles (10.6Â km) south-east of Charing Cross, and on the Prime Meridian.

Growing extensively with the arrival of the railways, Hither Green is characterised by late 19th and early 20th century Victorian and Edwardian domestic architecture, most notably the Corbett Estate. The railway runs through the centre of the area, which divides Hither Green into an &quot;east side&quot; focused on Staplehurst Road, and a &quot;west side&quot; focused on Hither Green Lane and Springbank Road. The lane dates back to Roman times and runs between the Quaggy and Ravensbourne rivers.

From 1978 to 1998 Hither Green was the name of the electoral ward that covered the areaÂ â then since 2002 the local ward that covered most of Hither Green was Lewisham Central. In 2020 a new Hither Green ward was created. The parliamentary constituency is Lewisham East.

The area is known for the 1967 Hither Green rail crash, in which 49 people were killed.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Hither Green acquired its name as it was closer to Lewisham than Further Green located on Verdant Lane. The original Hither Green was located where the present day George Lane intersects with Hither Green Lane. The area now occupied by Hither Green is thought to have originally been a hamlet called Romborough, which was wiped out in the Black Death.

===Origins===
Hither Green had remained a largely wooded area through the medieval times but by the 18th century most of the trees had been felled, and the first houses were built. Additional houses appeared through the 19th century, many of them quite substantial residences.

===Development===
====Mountsfield Park====
Mountsfield Park opened in August 1905 and has grown through several acquisitions since then. The location of the original park included the substantial residence called Mountsfield, home of noted entomologist Henry Tibbats Stainton. The house was demolished but remnants of the garden remain.

Additional acres were bought from the School Board for London and six allotments from Trinity College. And when Charlton Athletic football club gave up the football ground at the bottom of the hill in 1923 the park had grown to 28 acres.

Bombing damage to a terrace of houses along the south side of George Lane saw this also added to the park. The final addition came in 1994 when a large majority of the Catford Boys School playing field was added.

Other nearby parks include Manor House Gardens and Manor Park to the east.

====Park Fever Hospital====
The Park Fever Hospital (latterly Hither Green Hospital) was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1897 for the treatment of infectious diseases such as scarlet fever or diphtheria. The hospital was designed by Edwin T. Hall, the architect behind London&#x27;s Liberty &amp; Co. department store. The hospital and local area suffered extensive bombing damage during the Second World War. All that remains of the hospital is the water tower with its large clock faces (now the emblem of Hither Green) which is illuminated at night, and several of the hospital&#x27;s outbuildings. In 1997 the hospital closed and site was developed as a housing estate called &quot;Meridian South&quot;.

====Corbett Estate====

Much of the Victorian terraced housing dates from the late 19th century when social reformer and Scottish Member of Parliament (MP) Archibald Cameron Corbett built numerous houses on 278 acres of land he purchased from North Park Farm, this was to become known as the Corbett Estate.

A booking hall was added to the east side of Hither Green Station to cater for people living on this new estate. Many of the road names are of Scottish origin, as Corbett was a Scot. Due to his Quaker origins, the area was devoid of a public house and remains so. He gave the land for St Andrew&#x27;s Church, dedicated to Scotland&#x27;s patron saint.

====St. Swithun&#x27;s Church====
In November 1888, the new parish of St. Swithun&#x27;s was created. Designed by Ernest Newton the foundation stone was laid in July 1892 and the church, built of red Wrotham brick with Bath stone windows, was completed in 1904. Its organ previously came from Blenheim Palace.

====Wesleyan Church, Hither Green Lane====
The large non-conformist Wesleyan Church, designed by Josiah Gunton, standing in the angle of Hither Green Lane and Wellmeadow Road, was completed in 1900 to accommodate 700 people. It was built by C. Castle &amp; Son of Lower Clapton of red brick with a nave, two aisles, a transept, chancel, organ chamber and galleries on three sides, along with a tall pinnacled tower.

On the night of 11â12 September 1940, the church was destroyed in the Blitz. What was left of the church was torn down and the site was subsequently occupied by council-built flats.

====Hither Green TMD====
Hither Green TMD was opened by the Southern Railway in 1933. It remains in use in a reduced capacity as a DB Cargo UK depot.

==Nearby areas==
==Transport==
===Rail===
Hither Green railway station serves the area with services to London Charing Cross and to London Cannon Street both via Lewisham and as part of a loop service via both Sidcup and Woolwich Arsenal. There are also services to Orpington, Sevenoaks via Orpington and to Gravesend via Sidcup. Hither Green railway station also lies upon the Prime Meridian.

<doc id="206932" wikidata="Q215010" url="?curid=206932" title="Japanese battleship Yamato">
<text>was the lead ship of her class of battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) shortly before World War II. She and her sister ship, , were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing nearly at full load and armed with nine Type 94 main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.

&quot;Yamato&quot; was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the United States, Japan&#x27;s main rival in the Pacific. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and in June 1942 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto directed the fleet from her bridge during the Battle of Midway, a disastrous defeat for Japan. &quot;Musashi&quot; took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and &quot;Yamato&quot; spent the rest of the year moving between the major Japanese naval bases of Truk and Kure in response to American threats. In December 1943, &quot;Yamato&quot; was torpedoed by an American submarine which necessitated repairs at Kure, where she was refitted with additional anti-aircraft guns and radar in early 1944. Although present at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, she played no part in the battle.

The only time &quot;Yamato&quot; fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. While threatening to sink American troop transports, they encountered a light escort carrier group of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77, &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, in the Battle off Samar, sinking or helping to sink the escort carrier and the destroyers and . The Japanese turned back after American air attacks convinced them they were engaging a powerful U.S. carrier fleet.

During 1944, the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945 its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, &quot;Yamato&quot; was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed, thus protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by U.S. submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.

==Design and construction==

During the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an ultranationalist militancy with a view to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000-ton vessels of the &quot;Yamato&quot; class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.

The keel of &quot;Yamato&quot;, the lead ship of the class, was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937 in a dockyard that had to be adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the dry dock to screen the ship from view. &quot;Yamato&quot; was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command.

===Armament===

&quot;Yamato&quot;â³s main battery consisted of nine 45-caliber Type 94 gunsâthe largest ever fitted to a warship, although the shells were not as heavy as those fired by the British 18-inch naval guns of . Each gun was long, weighed , and was capable of firing high-explosive or armor-piercing shells . Her secondary battery comprised twelve  guns mounted in four triple turrets (one forward, one aft, two amidships), and twelve  guns in six twin mounts (three on each side amidships). These turrets had been taken off the s when those vessels were converted to a main armament of  guns. In addition, &quot;Yamato&quot; carried twenty-four  anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships. When refitted in 1944 and 1945 for naval engagements in the South Pacific, the secondary battery configuration was changed to six 155Â mm guns and twenty-four 127Â mm guns, and the number of 25Â mm anti-aircraft guns was increased to 162.

===Trials and initial operations===

During October or November 1941 &quot;Yamato&quot; underwent sea trials, reaching her maximum possible speed of . As war loomed, priority was given to accelerating military construction. On 16 December, months ahead of schedule, the battleship was formally commissioned at Kure, in a ceremony more austere than usual, as the Japanese were still intent on concealing the ship&#x27;s characteristics. The same day, under Captain (later Vice Admiral) Gihachi Takayanagi, she joined fellow battleships and in the 1st Battleship Division.

On 12 February 1942, &quot;Yamato&quot; became the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s Combined Fleet. A veteran of Japan&#x27;s crushing victory over Russia at the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War, the Pearl Harbor victor was planning a decisive engagement with the United States Navy at Midway Island. After participating in war games &quot;Yamato&quot; departed Hiroshima Bay on 27 May for duty with Yamamoto&#x27;s main battleship group. U.S. codebreakers were aware of Yamamoto&#x27;s intentions, and the Battle of Midway proved disastrous for Japan&#x27;s carrier force, with four fleet carriers and 332 aircraft lost. Yamamoto exercised overall command from &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s bridge, but his battle plan had widely dispersed his forces to lure the Americans into a trap, and the battleship group was too far away to take part in the engagement. On 5 June, Yamamoto ordered the remaining ships to return to Japan, so &quot;Yamato&quot; withdrew with the main battleship force to Hashirajima, before making her way back to Kure.

&quot;Yamato&quot; left Kure for Truk on 17 August 1942. After 11 days at sea, she was sighted by the American submarine , which fired four torpedoes, all of which missed; &quot;Yamato&quot; arrived safely at Truk later that day. She remained there throughout the Guadalcanal campaign because of a lack of 46Â cm ammunition suitable for shore bombardment, uncharted seas around Guadalcanal, and her high fuel consumption. Before the year&#x27;s end, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Chiaki Matsuda was assigned to command &quot;Yamato&quot;.

On 11 February 1943, &quot;Yamato&quot; was replaced by her sister ship &quot;Musashi&quot; as flagship of the Combined Fleet. &quot;Yamato&quot; spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943. On that day, she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure, arriving on 14 May. She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs, and after sailing to Japan&#x27;s western Inland Sea she was again dry-docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades. On 16 August, &quot;Yamato&quot; began her return to Truk, where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the Tarawa and Makin atolls. She sortied in late September with &quot;Nagato&quot;, three carriers, and smaller warships to intercept U.S. Task Force 15, and again a month later with six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers. Intelligence had reported that Naval Station Pearl Harbor was nearly empty of ships, which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike at Wake Island. But there were no radar contacts for six days, and the fleet returned to Truk, arriving on 26 October.

&quot;Yamato&quot; escorted Transport Operation BO-1 from Truk to Yokosuka during 12â17 December. Subsequently, because of their extensive storage capacity and thick armor protection, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; were pressed into service as transport vessels. On 25 December, while ferrying troops and equipmentâwhich were wanted as reinforcements for the garrisons at Kavieng and the Admiralty Islandsâfrom Yokosuka to Truk, &quot;Yamato&quot; and her task group were intercepted by the American submarine about out at sea. &quot;Skate&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes at &quot;Yamato&quot;; one struck the battleship&#x27;s starboard side toward the stern. A hole below the top of her anti-torpedo bulge and measuring some across was ripped open in the hull, and a joint between the upper and lower armored belts failed, causing the rear turret&#x27;s upper magazine to flood. &quot;Yamato&quot; took on about 3,000Â tons of water but reached Truk later that day. The repair ship effected temporary repairs, and &quot;Yamato&quot; departed on 10 January 1944 for Kure.
On 16 January &quot;Yamato&quot; arrived at Kure for repairs of the torpedo damage and was dry-docked until 3 February. During this time, armor plate sloped at Â° was fitted in the area of damage to her hull. It had been proposed that of steel be used to bolster the ship&#x27;s defense against flooding from torpedo hits outside the armored citadel, but this was rejected out of hand because the additional weight would have increased &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s displacement and draft too much. While &quot;Yamato&quot; was dry-docked, Captain Nobuei Morishitaâformer captain of the battleship âassumed command. On 25 February, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; were reassigned from the 1st Battleship Division to the Second Fleet.

&quot;Yamato&quot; was again dry-docked at Kure for further upgrades to all her radar and anti-aircraft systems from 25 February to 18 March 1944. Each of the two beam-mounted 6.1 inch (155-mm) triple turrets was removed and replaced by three pairs of 5-inch (127-mm) AA guns in double mounts. In addition, 8 triple and 26 single 25mm AA mounts were added, increasing the total number of 127Â mm and 25Â mm anti-aircraft guns to 24 and 162, respectively. Shelters were also added on the upper deck for the increased AA crews. A Type 13 air search and Type 22, Mod 4, surface search/gunnery control radar were installed, and the main mast was altered. Her radar suite was also upgraded to include infrared identification systems and aircraft search and gunnery control radars. She left the dry dock on 18 March and went through several trials beginning on 11 April. &quot;Yamato&quot; left Kure on 21 April and embarked soldiers and materiel the following day at Okinoshima for a mission to Manila, reaching the Philippines on 28 April. She then moved on to Malaya to join Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet at Lingga; this force arrived at Tawi-Tawi on 14 May.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===

In early June 1944, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; were again requisitioned as troop transports, this time to reinforce the garrison and naval defenses of the island of Biak as part of Operation Kon. The mission was cancelled when word reached Ozawa&#x27;s headquarters of American carrier attacks on the Mariana Islands. Instead, the Imperial Japanese Navy reorganized, concentrating the majority of its remaining fighting strength in the hope of achieving a decisive success against the Americans. By this time though, the entire Japanese navy was inferior in numbers and experience to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Between June 19 and June 23, &quot;Yamato&quot; escorted forces of Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, dubbed by American pilots &quot;The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. The Japanese lost three aircraft carriers and 426 aircraft; &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s only significant contribution was mistakenly opening fire on returning Japanese aircraft.

Following the battle, &quot;Yamato&quot; withdrew with the Mobile Fleet to the Hashirajima staging area near Kure to refuel and re-arm. With &quot;Musashi&quot; she left the fleet on 24 June for the short journey to Kure, where she received five more triple 25Â mm anti-aircraft mounts. The opportunity was taken to put in place &quot;emergency buoyancy keeping procedures&quot;. These resulted in the removal of almost every flammable item from the battleship, including linoleum, bedding, and mattresses. In place of the latter, men slept on planks which could be used to repair damage. Flammable paints received a silicone-based overcoat, and additional portable pumps and fire fighting apparatuses were installed. Leaving Japan on 8 July, &quot;Yamato&quot;âaccompanied by the battleships &quot;Musashi&quot;, , &quot;Nagato&quot;, and 11 cruisers and destroyersâsailed south. &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; headed for the Lingga Islands, arriving on 16â17 July. By this stage of the war, Japan&#x27;s tanker fleet had been much reduced by marauding American submarines, so major fleet units were stationed in the East Indies to be near the source of their fuel supply. The battleships remained at the islands for the next three months.

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===
Between 22 and 25 October 1944, as part of Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force (also known as Force A or First Striking Force), &quot;Yamato&quot; took part in one of the largest naval engagements in historyâthe Battle of Leyte Gulf. In response to the American invasion of the Philippines, Operation ShÅ-GÅ called for a number of Japanese groups to converge on the island of Leyte, where American troops were landing. On 18 October, &quot;Yamato&quot; was given a coating of black camouflage in preparation for her nighttime transit of the San Bernardino Strait; the main ingredient was soot taken from her smokestack. While en route to Leyte, the force was attacked in the Palawan Passage on 23 October by the submarines and , which sank two heavy cruisers including Kurita&#x27;s flagship, , and damaged a third. Kurita survived the loss of &quot;Atago&quot; and transferred his flag to &quot;Yamato&quot;.

====Battle of the Sibuyan Sea====
The following day the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea hurt the Center Force badly with the loss of one more heavy cruiser, eliminating a substantial part of the fleet&#x27;s anti-aircraft defence. During the course of the day, American carrier aircraft sortied 259 times. Aircraft from the struck &quot;Yamato&quot; with two armor-piercing bombs and scored one near miss; &quot;Yamato&quot; suffered moderate damage and took on about of water but remained battleworthy. However, her sister ship &quot;Musashi&quot; became the focus of the American attacks and eventually sank after being hit with 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes.

=== Battle off Samar ===
Unknown to Kurita, the main American battle group under the command of Admiral William Halsey Jr., departed the Leyte Gulf area on the evening of 24 October. Convinced that Kurita&#x27;s Center Force had been turned back, Halsey took his powerful Task Force 38 in pursuit of the Japanese Northern Force, a decoy group composed of one fleet aircraft carrier (), three light carriers, two hybrid battleship-carriers, and their escorts. The deception was a success, drawing away five fleet carriers and five light carriers with more than 600 aircraft among them, six fast battleships, eight cruisers, and over 40 destroyers.

During the hours of darkness, Kurita&#x27;s force navigated the San Bernardino Strait, and shortly after dawn attacked an American formation that had remained in the area to provide close support for the invading troops. Known as &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, this small group comprised six escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. At 6:57, from a distance of 35,000 yards, &quot;Yamato&quot; fired frontal salvos against the American warships, her first and only surface action against enemy vessels. However, Kurita mistook the escort carriers for full-sized fleet carriers, and ordered his ships to fire armor-piercing ammunition that would over penetrate the small ship&#x27;s unarmored hulls without exploding. Despite this, &quot;Yamato&quot; scored the first damage of the battle. Immediately on her 3rd salvo from 34,500 yards, a single 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell exploded mere feet underneath the keel of the escort carrier , knocking out a boiler and electrical power for three minutes. The near miss damaged her hull so badly, &quot;White Plains&quot; never saw frontline service again and was demoted to an aircraft ferry.

At 7:30, &quot;Yamato&quot; spotted a US &quot;cruiser&quot; and prepared to rain fire. The &quot;cruiser&quot; in question was actually the destroyer , which had just finished a torpedo charge which blew off the bow of the heavy cruiser without being hit by a single Japanese shell. From a distance of 20,300 yards, &quot;Yamato&quot; fired a full broadside, gouging &quot;Johnston&quot; with three direct 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell hits. &quot;Yamato&quot; then fired off her secondary guns, hitting &quot;Johnston&quot; with an additional three 6.1-inch (155Â mm) shells. With the crippled &quot;Johnston&quot; disappearing behind a rain squall, Yamato recorded the &quot;cruiser&quot; as sunk, though her AP shells allowed &quot;Johnston&quot; to survive for a time being. Still, the damage inflicted was devastating as &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s 6.1-inch (155Â mm) shells mostly landed on her superstructure. One hit amidships, taking out an anti-aircraft fire director, while the remaining two hit forward, destroying her torpedo director and shredding her bridge, injuring Commander Ernest E. Evans by blowing off two of his fingers and his entire shirt, and killing much of his command staff. Meanwhile, two 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shells hit amidships, cutting &quot;Johnston&quot;â³s speed to 17 knots, while the third 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell hit aft, disabling three of &quot;Johnston&quot;â³s five 5-inch (127 mm) guns. According to the state of her wreck, &quot;Johnston&quot; later split in two where she was hit by an 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot; while under fire from Japanese destroyers.

&quot;Yamato&quot; resumed firing on the escort carriers, but due to the extreme range failed to score any hits for the time being. Around 7:50, the Japanese battleships were attacked by the destroyers and . Both ships opened fire, with &quot;Hoel&quot; hitting &quot;Yamato&quot; with two 5-inch (127Â mm) shells, though neither caused any notable damage. By 7:54, both destroyers launched their torpedoes, which missed their intended target, the battleship , but headed towards &quot;Yamato&quot;. Turning to evade them, she was caught in between both spreads, and forced to steam out of the battle for around 10 minutes. While earlier accounts of the battle by US sailors state &quot;Yamato&quot; was forced out of the battle permanently by this point, Japanese records firmly disprove this. Once the torpedoes ran out of fuel she turned around and raced back to the battle, making contact with Taffy 3 again at around 8:10, immediately training her guns on the escort carrier .

From 22,000 yards, &quot;Yamato&quot; fired her main guns, immediately hitting &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; on her first salvo with an 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell that smashed through her hangar bay. Meanwhile, the heavy cruiser landed hits to &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;â³s flight deck that started a large fire visible in several photographs of the ship under attack. At 8:20, &quot;Yamato&quot; scored what is commonly attributed as the most fatal hit to the flat top as an 18.1-inch (46Â cm) shell hit &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;â³s engine room below the waterline, immediately cutting her speed to 10 knots as she gradually slowed until dead in the water, with &quot;Yamato&quot; following up with another hit at 8:23. By 8:30, American destroyers covered &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, leading to a number of Japanese warships switching fire from the carrier to said destroyers. However, &quot;Yamato&quot; continued to pound &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; with her main battery, and observed her listing more and more to port. Meanwhile, her 6.1-inch (155Â mm) secondary guns reengaged &quot;Hoel&quot;. After &quot;Hoel&quot; had been scorched by gunfire from &quot;Yamato&quot;, the battleship and the heavy cruiser , &quot;Yamato&quot; scored a critical hit that disabled &quot;Hoel&quot;â³s last boiler, with further gunfire from the three ships finishing her off by 8:50. Meanwhile, by 9:07, &quot;Yamato&quot; observed &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; capsizing and sinking under her sustained gunfire.

The Japanese ships were taking a toll on Taffy 3, sinking four ships, with &quot;Yamato&quot; either sinking or helping to sink all besides the destroyer escort . However, relentless air attacks sank three Japanese heavy cruisers. &#x27;s torpedoes were detonated, and her propellers were blown off from bomb hits, while was hit by a bomb down the stack that destroyed her engines, leading to both cruisers being scuttled. Finally, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was outright sunk by American torpedo bombers. With Kurita concluding he had sunk at least two fleet carriers, two cruisers, and two destroyers, and under fear of follow up air attacks causing more losses, he ordered the Japanese ships, &quot;Yamato&quot; included, to retreat from the battle, meaning the Japanese&#x27;s primary objectives, the American troop convoys, remained untouched by Japanese surface forces. In the aftermath of the battle, &quot;Yamato&quot; was attacked by aircraft from and damaged by two more bomb hits, one destroying some crew quarters and the other impacting on her turret 1, rounding out her engagement in the battle.

Following the engagement, &quot;Yamato&quot; and the remnants of Kurita&#x27;s force returned to Brunei. On 15 November 1944, the 1st Battleship Division was disbanded, and &quot;Yamato&quot; became the flagship of the Second Fleet. On 21 November, while transiting the East China Sea in a withdrawal to Kure Naval Base, &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s battle group was attacked by the submarine . The battleship &quot;KongÅ&quot; and destroyer were lost. &quot;Yamato&quot; was immediately dry docked for repairs and anti-aircraft upgrades on reaching Kure, where several of the battleship&#x27;s older anti-aircraft guns were replaced. On 25 November, Captain Aruga KÅsaku was named &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s commander.

===Operation Ten-Go===


On 1 January 1945, &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Nagato&quot; were transferred to the newly reactivated 1st Battleship Division. &quot;Yamato&quot; left dry dock two days later for Japan&#x27;s Inland Sea. This reassignment was brief; the 1st Battleship Division was deactivated once again on 10 February, and &quot;Yamato&quot; was allotted to the 1st Carrier Division. On 19 March, American carrier aircraft from TG 58.1 attacked Kure Harbour. Although 16 warships were hit, &quot;Yamato&quot; sustained only minor damage from several near misses and from one bomb that struck her bridge. The intervention of a squadron of Kawanishi N1K1 &quot;Shiden&quot; fighters (named &quot;George&quot; by the Allies) flown by veteran Japanese fighter instructors prevented the raid from doing too much damage to the base and assembled ships, while &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s ability to maneuver â albeit slowly â in the Nasami Channel benefited her.

As the final step before their planned invasion of the Japanese mainland, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April. The Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s response was to organise a mission codenamed Operation Ten-Go that would commit much of Japan&#x27;s remaining surface strength. &quot;Yamato&quot; and nine escorts (the cruiser and eight destroyers) would sail to Okinawa and, in concert with &quot;kamikaze&quot; and Okinawa-based army units, attack the Allied forces assembled on and around Okinawa. &quot;Yamato&quot; would then be beached to act as an unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed. In preparation for the mission, &quot;Yamato&quot; had taken on a full stock of ammunition on 29 March. According to the Japanese plan, the ships were supposed to take aboard only enough fuel for a one way voyage to Okinawa, but additional fuel amounting to 60% of capacity was issued on the authority of local base commanders. Designated the &quot;Surface Special Attack Force&quot;, the ships left Tokuyama at 15:20 on 6 April.

However, the Allies had intercepted and decoded their radio transmissions, learning the particulars of Operation Ten-Go. Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the Bungo Strait, was spotted by the American submarines and . Both reported &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s position to the main American carrier strike force, but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships â â and their extreme zigzagging.

The Allied forces around Okinawa braced for an assault. Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in the sector to prepare for surface action against &quot;Yamato&quot;. These orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s aircraft carriers, but as a contingency the battleships together with 7 cruisers and 21 destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force before it could reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft.

&quot;Yamato&quot;â³s crew were at general quarters and ready for anti-aircraft action by dawn on 7 April. The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two flying boats arrived soon thereafter, and for the next five hours, &quot;Yamato&quot; fired &quot;Common Type 3 or &quot;beehive&quot;&quot; (&quot;3 Shiki tsÃ»jÃ´dan&quot;) shells at the Allied seaplanes but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. &quot;Yamato&quot; obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.

At about 12:30, 280 bomber and torpedo bomber aircraft arrived over the Japanese force. , which had fallen out of formation with engine trouble, was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from . The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to , and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling &quot;Yamato&quot;. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. &quot;Yahagi&quot; turned and raced away at in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number.

&quot;Yamato&quot; was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25Â mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127Â mm mount. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck &quot;Yamato&quot; far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. These had only minor effects, but no detailed information about this hit survived the battle. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155Â mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived.

Shortly afterward, two or three more torpedoes struck &quot;Yamato&quot;: two impacts, on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable, as it explains the flooding reported in &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship listing Â° to port; deliberately counterflooding flooding compartments on the other side of the ship reduced the list to just Â°. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s unprotected 25Â mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.

The second attack started just before 13:00. In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s main guns were loaded with &quot;beehive&quot; shells fused to explode one second after firing â a mere from the ship â but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side, and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fire room that had already been hit, one impacted a different fire room, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth hit, unconfirmed, may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location. This attack left &quot;Yamato&quot; in a perilous position, listing Â° to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to Â°, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant the main battery was unable to fire, and her speed was limited to .

The third and most damaging attack began around 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship&#x27;s superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25Â mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.
At 14:02, the order was belatedly given to abandon ship. By this time, &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s speed had dropped to and her list was increasing. Fires raged out of control, and alarms on the bridge warned of critical temperatures in the forward main battery magazines. Protocol called for flooding the magazines to prevent explosion, but the pumping stations had been knocked out.

At 14:05, &quot;Yahagi&quot; sank, the victim of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes. At the same time, a final flight of torpedo bombers attacked &quot;Yamato&quot; from her starboard side. Her list was such that the torpedoes â set to a depth of â struck the bottom of her hull. The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port. By 14:20, the power went out, and her remaining 25Â mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later, &quot;Yamato&quot; capsized. Her main 46Â cm turrets fell off, and as she rolled suction was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship. When the roll reached approximately Â°, one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion. The resulting mushroom cloud â over high â was seen away on KyÅ«shÅ«. &quot;Yamato&quot; sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including fleet commander Vice Admiral Seiichi ItÅ and Captain Aruga both of whom chose to go down with the ship. The few survivors were recovered by the four surviving destroyers, which withdrew to Japan.

From the first attack at 12:37 to the explosion at 14:23, &quot;Yamato&quot; had been hit by at least 11 torpedoes and 6 bombs. There may have been two more torpedo and bomb hits, but that is not confirmed. The experience of the sinking of the ship was described by a Japanese survivor (Yoshida Matsuro) in &quot;Senkan Yamato no Saigo&quot;, translated into English as &quot;Requiem for Battleship Yamato&quot;.

==Wreck discovery==
Because of often confused circumstances and incomplete information regarding their sinkings, it took until 2019 to discover and identify most wrecks of Japanese capital ships lost in World War II. Drawing on U.S. wartime records, an expedition to the East China Sea in 1982 produced some results, but the wreckage discovered could not be clearly identified. A second expedition returned to the site two years later, and the team&#x27;s photographic and video records were later confirmed by one of the battleship&#x27;s designers, Shigeru Makino, to show the &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s last resting place. The wreck lies southwest of Kyushu under of water in two main pieces; a bow section comprising the front one third of the ship, and a separate stern section.

On 16 July 2015, a group of Japanese Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers began meetings to study the feasibility of raising the ship from the ocean floor and recovering the remains of crewmembers entombed in the wreckage. The group said it plans to request government funds to research the technical feasibility of recovering the ship. In May 2016, the wreckage was surveyed using digital technology, giving a more detailed view and confirming the earlier identification. The resulting video revealed many details such as the Imperial chrysanthemum on the bow, the massive propeller, and the detached main gun turret. A nine-minute video of this survey is shown at the &quot;Yamato&quot; Museum in Kure.

==Cultural significance==

From the time of their construction, &quot;Yamato&quot; and her sister &quot;Musashi&quot; carried significant weight in Japanese culture. The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan&#x27;s determination and readiness to defend its interests against the Western Powers and the United States in particular. Shigeru Fukudome, chief of the Operations Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, described the ships as &quot;symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.&quot; &quot;Yamato&quot;â³s symbolic might was such that some Japanese citizens held the belief that their country could never fall as long as the ship was able to fight.

Decades after the war, &quot;Yamato&quot; was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese. Historically, the word &quot;Yamato&quot; was used as a poetic name for Japan; thus, her name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire. In April 1968, a memorial tower was erected at Cape Inutabu on Tokunoshima, an island in the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture, to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten-Go. In October 1974, Leiji Matsumoto created a television series, &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning eight feature films and four more TV series, the most recent of which was released in 2017. The series popularised the space opera. As post-war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives, &quot;Yamato&quot; became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country&#x27;s defeat in the war. Brought to the United States as &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market. The motif in &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; was repeated in &quot;Silent Service&quot;, a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the JapanâU.S. relationship. It tells the story of a nuclear-powered super submarine whose crew mutinies and renames the vessel &quot;Yamato&quot;, in allusion to the World War II battleship and the ideals she symbolises.

In 2005, the &quot;Yamato&quot; Museum was opened near the site of the former Kure shipyards. Although intended to educate on the maritime history of post Meiji era Japan, the museum gives special attention to its namesake; the battleship is a common theme among several of its exhibits, which includes a section dedicated to Matsumoto&#x27;s animated series. The centrepiece of the museum, occupying a large section of the ground floor, is a long model of &quot;Yamato&quot; (1:10 scale).

In 2005, Toei released a 143-minute movie, &quot;Yamato&quot;, based on a book by Jun Henmi, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II; Tamiya released special editions of scale models of the battleship in conjunction with the film&#x27;s release. The film is a tale about the sailors aboard the doomed battleship and the concepts of honour and duty. The film was shown on more than 290Â screens across the country and was a commercial success, taking in a record 5.11Â billion yen at the domestic box office.

<text>London Luton Airport is an international airport located in Luton, England, situated east of the town centre, and is the fourth-busiest airport serving London. The airport is owned by London Luton Airport Limited, a company wholly owned by Luton Borough Council, and operated by London Luton Airport Operations Limited (LLAOL).

An airport was opened on the site on 16 July 1938. During the Second World War, the airport was used by fighters of the Royal Air Force. Commercial activity and general aviation flight training at Luton resumed during 1952. By the 1960s, Luton Airport was playing a key role in the development of the package holiday business; by 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport. From the mid-1960s, executive aircraft have been based at the airport. During the late 1970s, an expansion plan was initiated at Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year, although the airport experienced a reduction in passenger numbers in the 1980s. In 1990, the airport was renamed &quot;London Luton Airport&quot; to try and emphasise the airport&#x27;s proximity to the capital.

The arrival of new operators at Luton during the 1990s, such as charter operator MyTravel Group and new low-cost scheduled flights from Debonair and EasyJet, contributed to a rapid increase in passenger numbers that made it the fastest growing major airport in the UK. In August 1997, to fund an Â£80million extension of the airport, a 30-year concession contract was issued to a public-private partnership consortium, &quot;London Luton Airport Operations Limited&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, Â£30million was invested in Luton&#x27;s infrastructure and facilities. In November 1999, a new Â£40million terminal was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip; the new building houses 60 check-in desks, baggage and flight information systems and a range of commercial outlets. During 2004/5, the departure and arrivals lounges and other facilities were redeveloped at a cost of Â£38million.

In 2018, over 16.5 million passengers passed through the airport, a record total for Luton making it the fifth 
busiest airport in the UK. It is the fourth-largest airport serving the London area after Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, and is one of London&#x27;s six international airports along with London City and Southend. The airport serves as a base for easyJet, TUI Airways, Ryanair and Wizz Air and previously served as a base for Monarch Airlines until it ceased operations in October 2017. The vast majority of the routes served are within Europe, although there are some charter and scheduled routes to destinations in Northern Africa and Asia.

==History==

===Early history===

Luton Municipal Airport was opened on the site on 16 July 1938 by the Secretary of State for Air, Kingsley Wood. Situated where the valley of the River Lea cuts its way through the north-east end of the Chiltern Hills, the airport occupies a hill-top location, with a roughly drop-off at the western end of the runway. The airport, which was owned by the Borough of Luton, was considered to be the northern terminal for neighbouring London.

During the Second World War, the airport was used by the Royal Air Force, fighters of No. 264 Squadron being based there. Following the end of the conflict, the site was returned to the local council. In 1952 activity at the airport resumed on a commercial basis, a new control tower being opened around this time.

British aviation company Percival Aircraft had its factory at the airport until the early 1960s. Since the mid-1960s, executive aircraft have been based at the airport, initially operated by McAlpine Aviation. These activities have grown and several executive jet operators and maintenance companies are currently based at Luton.

In the 1960s, Luton Airport played a key role in the development of the package holiday business, in which the popularity of the foreign holiday rose substantially, as the launch of new services had allowed greater numbers of people to travel abroad for the first time. Luton became the operating base for several charter airlines, such as Autair (which went on to become Court Line), Euravia (now TUI Airways, following Euravia&#x27;s change of name to Britannia Airways and subsequent merger with First Choice Airways and TUI rebrand) and Dan-Air.

By 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport; during 1972, Luton Airport was the most profitable airport in the country. However, Luton suffered a severe setback in August 1974 when major package holiday operator Clarksons and its in-house airline Court Line (which also operated coach links) ceased operations and were liquidated. Nevertheless, by 1978, the airport&#x27;s management initiated an expansion plan as to allow Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year.

===1980s and 1990s===
During the 1980s, the airport experienced a decline in customer numbers; this was due to lack of reinvestment while the nearby London Stansted Airport, which was also located north of London, was growing. The council responded to lobbying and focused again on developing the airport. In 1985, a new international terminal building was opened by the then Prince of Wales (now Charles III). Further updates and changes over the following 15 years were made, including the opening of a new international terminal and automated baggage handling facility, a new control tower with updated air traffic control systems, a new cargo centre and runway upgrades. In 1987, Luton Airport became a limited company, of which Luton Borough Council was the sole shareholder; this reorganisation was taken as it was felt that the airport ought to be operated at arm&#x27;s length via an independent management team.

While developing the basic infrastructure, various business partners were courted and business models were considered. The process envisaged a cargo centre, an airport railway station, and people mover from station to airport terminal (hence the unused underpass parallel to the road as one approaches the terminal). During 1991, an attempt was made to sell Luton Airport, but it was unsuccessful; instead, a new management team was appointed to turn around the business, stem the losses, and improve passenger numbers. Over the following five years, Â£30million was invested in Luton&#x27;s infrastructure and facilities.

Originally, the airport&#x27;s runways had been grass tracks 18/36 and 06/24, and then a concrete runway 08/26. By the end of the 1980s, there was only one runway, 08/26. The 18/36 grass runway had disappeared under a landfill, while 06/24 had effectively become a taxiway. For Luton to maintain viability, it was necessary to update airfield services, and achieve CAT III status. This meant updating the instrument landing system (ILS); glidepath and localiser and removing the hump in the runway; even a six-foot person could not see one end of the runway from the other. The hump was removed by building up layers at the end of the runway; this was done over 72 successive nights between October 1988 and February 1989, with the height being raised 90Â mm on one particular night. During the course of this work, the airport would re-open for flights during the day.

In 1990, the airport was renamed &quot;London Luton Airport&quot; to re-emphasise the airport&#x27;s proximity to the UK capital. In 1991, another setback occurred when Ryanair, which had flown from the airport to Ireland for a number of years, transferred its London operating base from Luton to rival Stansted. A decline in passenger numbers at Luton was attributed to this move. Later in the 1990s, Airtours began charter flights from the airport, using the &quot;Airtours International Airways&quot; brand and new low-cost scheduled flights from Debonair and easyJet, the latter making Luton its base. The arrival of these new operators marked a rapid increase in passenger numbers; during 1997/1998, 3.4 million people travelled via the airport, while 4.4 million travellers were recording during the following year, making Luton Airport the fastest growing major airport in the UK.

In August 1997, to fund an Â£80million extension of the airport, the council issued a 30-year concession contract to a public-private partnership consortium, London Luton Airport Operations Limited, a partnership of Airport Group International (AGI) and Barclays Private Equity. AGI was a specialist airport management and development company once owned by Lockheed Martin. In 1999, AGI was sold to TBI plc; in 2001, Barclays also sold its shares in Luton to TBI plc.

On 25 November 1999, a new Â£40 million terminal designed by Foster + Partners was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. This terminal houses 60 check-in desks, baggage and flight information systems and a wide range of shops, restaurants and bars. The airport&#x27;s railway station, Luton Airport Parkway was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on the same day and was built at a cost of Â£23million. By train, journey times to the airport from central London would be reduced to less than 30 minutes.

===Development since 2000===
In September 2004, Luton Airport embarked on a 10-month project to develop the departure and arrivals lounges and other facilities at a cost of Â£38million; this work included a area featuring a spectacular vaulted ceiling was completed with the new terminal, but intended to lie unused until required. On 1 July 2005, the new departure hall opened on schedule, featuring a boarding pier extending out between the airport&#x27;s north and east aprons and relocated security, customs and immigration facilities, as well as an expanded number of boarding gates from the previous number of 19 to 26.

In 2004, the airport management announced that they supported the government plans to expand the facilities, which included a full-length runway and a new terminal. However, local campaign groups, including Luton and District Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (LADACAN) and Stop Luton Airport Plan (SLAP) opposed the new expansion plans, for reasons including noise pollution and traffic concerns; LADACAN also claimed that various sites, including Someries Castle, a Scheduled Monument, would be threatened by the expansion. On 6 July 2007, it was announced that the owners of London Luton Airport had decided to scrap plans to build a second runway and new terminal for financial reasons. In order for the airport to expand further, the Department for Transport (DfT) advised the airport authority to use the airport site more efficiently. The DfT supports plans to extend the runway from its current length to and increase the length of the taxiway. A full-length runway would increase airlines&#x27; operational flexibility by enabling the use of aircraft that have a greater payload capacity and longer range than is currently possible. A longer taxiway would maximise runway use by reducing the need for taxiing aircraft to cross or move along the runway.

In January 2005, London Luton Airport Operations Limited was acquired by Airport Concessions Development Limited, a company owned by Abertis Infraestructuras (90%) and Aena Internacional (10%), both Spanish companies. In November 2013, ownership of London Luton Airport Operations Ltd passed to Aena and Ardian. In April 2018, AMP Capital acquired Ardian&#x27;s 49% stake in the business.

By 2006, the last flight training operator had ceased training from the airport.

From 2006 to 2008, Silverjet operated long-haul flights to Newark and Dubai from a dedicated terminal, but ceased operations due to the Great Recession.

In September 2016, La Compagnie announced it would cease operating its Luton to Newark service citing economic reasons. Therefore, Luton lost its only long-haul service. In February 2017, Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air announced it would to open its first British base at Luton Airport inaugurating three new routes to Tel Aviv, Pristina and Kutaisi in addition to more than a dozen already served ones from other bases.

In December 2018, a three-year redevelopment of the airport commenced. Costing roughly Â£160million, the airport management stated that the upgrade, which included new shops, a new boarding pier, and more boarding gates, would increase overall capacity by 50%, enabling the site to accommodate 18 million passengers by 2020. Campaigners from local pressure groups such as LADACAN have complained that the airport had failed to incorporate noise reduction measures into the plan, while an airport spokesman stated &quot;Our noise control measures are some of the most stringent of any major UK airport&quot;, noting that it had applied for additional flight restrictions. In addition, earlier that year, work had commenced on the construction of the Luton DART, an automated guided people mover which will travel between Luton Airport Parkway station and the airport. With costs estimated at Â£200million, DART eliminated the need for shuttle buses since its opening on 27 March 2023.

==Ownership==
The airport remains in municipal ownership, owned by Luton Borough Council but managed by the private sector London Luton Airport Operations Limited (LLAOL). London Luton Airport has a Civil Aviation Authority Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P835) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. An indicator of the importance of the airport to the economy of Luton is that Luton is reported to have the highest number of taxicabs per head of population in the United Kingdom.

==Facilities==


===Terminal===
Luton Airport has a single, two-storey passenger terminal building which has been expanded and rearranged several times. The ground floor has a main hall equipped with 62 check-in desks (&quot;1-62&quot;), a separate security screening hall, as well as some shops, service counters and the arrivals facilities. After the security screening hall, stairs lead to the departures lounge on the upper floor, where several more stores, restaurants and all 30 departure gates in three side piers (&quot;1-19&quot;, &quot;20-28&quot; and &quot;30-43&quot;) can be found. One airport lounge is located inside the terminal.

===Runway and aprons===
The airport possesses a single runway, running roughly east to west (07/25), with a length of at an elevation of . The runway is equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS) rated to Category IIIB, allowing the airport to continue operating in conditions of poor visibility.

All the airport facilities lie to the north of the runway. The terminal and aprons have an unconventional layout for a commercial airport, with terminal drop-off, bus stands, taxi ranks and short-term car parks being accessed facing south towards the runway, being connected by a road. This road tunnels under a taxiway which connects the western apron area to the runway&#x27;s taxiway network. There are approximately 60 stands available for aircraft, with 28 dedicated gates, which are all hardstands. All of these stands are located on the northern side of the terminal building, away from the runway and connected to it by a U-shaped set of taxiways and aprons that together encircle the terminal; recently, an accident caused by a vehicle fire in the Terminal 1 Car Park has left the car park destroyed.

The northern side of the U-shaped apron is ringed by a continuous line of hangars and other buildings, emphasising the fact that Luton is a major maintenance base for several airlines including TUI Airways, EasyJet, and previously Monarch Airlines. By contrast to the heavily built up apron area, the airport&#x27;s southern boundary is entirely rural with only a few isolated farm buildings and houses close to the airport boundary.

===Expansion plans===
====New terminal====
In February 2019, London Luton Airport Limited announced plans to expand the airport by building a second terminal. The expansion would increase airport capacity to handle 32 million passengers per year 2039. The enlarged airport would continue to operate using the existing single runway. LLAL have outlined several options for the site of the new Terminal 2. Most of the proposals involve a development that will encroach upon Wigmore Valley Park, a designated County Wildlife Site; an alternative site to the east would encroach upon the London Green Belt, and a further option proposes siting a new terminal to the south of the runway.

====DART expansion====
A public consultation in October 2019 included plans for a third stop on the Luton DART transit, which has been completed in 2023, transporting passengers from Luton Airport Parkway station to the concourse of the airport.

===Other tenants===
EasyJet&#x27;s head office is Hangar 89 (H89), a building located on the grounds of London Luton Airport; the hangar, a former Britannia Airways/TUI facility, is located from the former site of EasyLand, the previous headquarters of EasyJet. Hangar 89, built in 1974, has of office space and can house two aircraft the size of an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 at one time. When EasyJet received H89, it had a 1970s style office setup. EasyJet modernised the building and painted it orange.

In addition, TUI Airways head office is at the airport, and previously Monarch Airlines, along with that of Monarch Group, was in Prospect House, on the grounds of the airport.

===Road===
The airport lies a few miles away from the M1 motorway, which runs southwards to the M25 motorway and London, and northwards to Milton Keynes, the Midlands and the north of England. The airport is linked to M1&#x27;s Junction 10 by the dual-carriageway A1081 road. There is a short stay car park adjacent to the terminal, together with medium and long term on airport car parks to the west and east of the terminal respectively and linked to the terminal by shuttle buses. Pre-booked off airport parking is also available from several independent operators.

===Rail===

Luton Airport Parkway has served the airport since 1999. It is on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras, between which, journeys take as little as 22 minutes on East Midlands Railway services.

*Thameslink is the primary operator, with services running from the station to Bedford, St Albans, London, Rainham, Gatwick Airport and Brighton.
*East Midlands Railway operate semi-fast services calling at the station twice hourly. These trains run south directly to London St Pancras and north to Corby via Bedford, Wellingborough and Kettering. Limited services to Nottingham and Sheffield call at the station at peak times.

In 2016, Luton Airport commissioned a study, with the support of the CBI, easyJet, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the Bedfordshire and the Hertfordshire Chambers of Commerce (among others) which sought to explore opportunities to expand rail services to and from the airport. The study found four fast trains per hour from central London was possible.

Negotiations are underway with the Department for Transport to extend the validity of the Oyster card contactless ticketing system to the airport. Contactless bank cards (but not Oyster cards) became valid for journeys to and from London from October 2019.

===Airport transit===
A light rail/automated guided people mover, Luton DART, provides a connection between the airport terminal and the railway station. The transit was officially opened by King Charles III in December 2022. It opened to passengers on 10 March 2023 operating a limited service for four hours per day, with the 24-hour service coming into effect around the end of the month. Shortly after, the DART transit replaced the shuttle bus service.

The single fare for the DART is Â£4.90. Rail tickets marked &quot;Luton Airport&quot; include the price of the DART transit. Concessions are given to Luton residents, and free travel is provided for holders of concessionary travel passes and disabled blue badge holders, and for airport workers.

===Buses===
Local buses connect Luton Airport with Luton town centre and other nearby places.

The airport is served by the Route A of the Luton to Dunstable Busway, a bus rapid transit route which connects the airport with Luton Town Centre and the neighbouring towns of Dunstable, Houghton Regis and Milton Keynes. The buses, operated by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, run on a segregated guided busway track between Luton and Dunstable.

Conventional bus services also operate, connecting the airport with towns and cities in the region and parts of north London, including the 100, operated by Arriva, which offers an hourly daytime connection to the nearby towns of Hitchin and Stevenage; Metroline service 84A; Courtney Buses coach service to Bracknell.

Direct coach services to London include Green Line route 757 operated by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex and the A1 operated by National Express which operate competing services to and from Victoria Coach Station. EasyBus services operate towards Liverpool Street station. A range of longer distance National Express services linking Stansted, Heathrow and Gatwick Airports as well as destinations in the Midlands and North of England.

There are also three services around the airport operated by APCOA Parking which operate 24 hours a day serving the terminal, mid stay, long stay, and staff car parks. The service that serves the staff car park also serves the car hire centre and rental companies and all stops in between including the Holiday Inn Express, the TUI Airways HQ And the ID Unit. A new fleet of six Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses were purchased for these operations during 2014.

A range of other bus services operated by off-site parking companies also serve the airport. These include Airparks, Paige Airport Parking, Centrebus and Coach Hire 4 U. The latter two operators provide staff shuttle buses on behalf of TUI and EasyJet.

A former airport shuttle bus linking the airport and Luton Airport Parkway railway station has been replaced by the Luton DART rail transit, which came into service in March 2023.

==In popular culture==
* Luton Airport appeared in two fly-on-the-wall television documentaries, &quot;Airline&quot; (1998) and &quot;Luton Airport&quot; (2005). &quot;Airline&quot; followed the staff of EasyJet at Luton and the airline&#x27;s other bases across the country whilst the 2005 series followed the life of employees in a similar format to the show &quot;Airport&quot;, set in Heathrow Airport.
* The airport was mentioned in a 1977 television advert for Campari featuring Lorraine Chase, with the punch line &quot;Were you truly wafted here from paradise?&quot; â &quot;Nah, Luton Airport&quot;. This advert was the inspiration for the 1979 UK hit song &quot;Luton Airport&quot; by Cats UK.
* In the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; TV skit for &quot;The Chicken Song&quot;, Luton Airport appears for a brief few seconds at the beginning. 
* The first episode of the second series of the BBC sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; is entitled &quot;In Luton Airport No-One Can Hear You Scream&quot;.
* Luton Airport was mentioned in the Piranha Brothers sketch from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, as being the place where one of the brothers, Dinsdale, thinks that a giant hedgehog named Spiny Norman sleeps.
* In 2011, the airport featured in an episode of the series &quot;Supersize Grime&quot; which focused on the cleaning of an Airbus A321 at the Monarch Aircraft Engineering hangar 127.
* In 2022, YouTuber Max Fosh put up a giant text sign near Gatwick Airport saying &quot;WELCOME TO LUTON&quot; as a prank, causing passengers to believe that they had landed at Luton Airport instead.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 4 November 1949: A Hawker Tempest single-engined piston fighter being operated by Napier Aircraft on a test flight crashed at the airport, killing the test pilot.
* 23 December 1967: A Hawker Siddeley HS 125 (registration: G-AVGW) of Court Line crashed shortly after taking off from Luton Airport, killing both pilots. The aircraft had been on a training flight. The crash occurred when the crew simulated an engine failure on takeoff. The HS 125 lost height rapidly and hit the roof of a nearby factory. This resulted in a post-crash fire.
* 3 March 1974: A Douglas DC-7C/F (registration: EI-AWG) operating an Aer Turas Teo charter flight from Dublin landed on runway 08 just after midnight but failed to achieve reverse thrust. Normal braking application also appeared to the crew to be ineffective and the emergency pneumatic brakes were applied. All main wheel tyres burst. The aircraft overran the runway and continued over the steep bank at the eastern perimeter finally coming to rest in soft ground 90 metres beyond. The situation had also been made worse by an inadvertent application of forward thrust by the crew in trying to achieve reverse thrust. Three of the six passengers and two of the four crew were injured. The aircraft was badly damaged and deemed a write-off.
* 18 April 1974: A BAC One-Eleven 518FG (registration: G-AXMJ) operating Court Line Flight 95 was involved in a ground collision with Piper PA-23 Aztec (registration: G-AYDE) after the Aztec entered the active runway without clearance. The pilot of the Aztec was killed and his passenger was injured. All 91 people on board the One-Eleven successfully evacuated after take-off was aborted.
* 21 June 1974: A Boeing 727-46 (registration: G-BAEF) operating a Dan-Air charter flight to Corfu hit the localiser antenna while taking off, thereby rendering the runway&#x27;s ILS inoperative. After being told by Luton air traffic control about the incident, the crew flying the aircraft elected to divert to London Gatwick where it landed safely without harming its 134 occupants (eight crew members and 126 passengers). The subsequent investigation revealed that the aircraft only just became airborne at the end of the runway, and as the ground fell away to the Lea valley below, the aircraft actually followed a downsloping course until finally gaining positive climb. The report concluded that there had been a cumulative effect of three factors â erosion of take-off run available; delay in starting rotation; and a very slow rate of rotation â as a result of the flightdeck crew&#x27;s miscalculation of the aircraft&#x27;s takeoff weight (too high), a wrong pressure ratio for two of the aircraft&#x27;s three engines (too low) and a sub-optimal choice of runway based on the use of outdated wind information that omitted the latest update&#x27;s tailwind component.
* 29 March 1981: A Lockheed JetStar 1329 (registration: N267L) operating an inbound flight from Nigeria overran runway 08 and came to rest down the embankment beyond the eastern perimeter fence. The accident was caused because the pilot landed well past the touchdown zone in poor visibility at night. At the time runway 08 did not have an ILS. The co-pilot suffered severe spinal injuries but the commanding pilot and seven passengers escaped with only minor injuries.
* 15 January 1994: A Bell 206B JetRanger helicopter (registration: G-BODW) rolled over on takeoff. One of the rotor blades sliced into the cabin, killing the pilot. The aircraft was badly damaged and deemed a write-off.
* 18 July 2022: During the 2022 United Kingdom heat wave, and with air temperatures close to 40Â Â°C (104Â Â°F) the runway melted and flights were forced to be diverted to Stansted, Bristol and other nearby airports. This led to severe delays for flights to and from the airport. The issue was rectified on the same day with flights resuming by the evening.
* 10 October 2023: At around 9pm, a large fire broke out in Terminal Car Park 2, causing the partial collapse of the car park building. According to Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, it was caused accidentally, by a diesel car fire that spread to other vehicles. Four firefighters and a member of airport staff were taken to hospital by the ambulance service. As a result of the fire, the airport suspended all flights until 3pm the following day. It was reported that up to 1,500 cars in the car park were unsalvageable.

<text>Johan Vilhelm Snellman (; 12 May 1806 â 4 July 1881) was an influential Fennoman philosopher and Finnish , ennobled in 1866. He was one of the most important &#x27;awakeners&#x27; or promoters of Finnish nationalism, alongside Elias LÃ¶nnrot and J. L. Runeberg.

==Life and career==
Snellman was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of Kristian Henrik Snellman, a ship&#x27;s captain. After the Russian conquest of Finland in 1808â09, and the promising establishment of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, his family moved there in 1813, to the Ostrobothnian coastal town of Kokkola. His mother Maria Magdalena Snellman died there only a year later.

Snellman was educated at the Royal Academy of Turku from 1822, where he studied theology as well as history, Greek, Latin and world literature, as well as a little bit of physics and other natural sciences. While studying at the academy, Snellman also received permanent national romantic influences, but he differed from the romantics in that he was interested in the future and the spiritual activity of nations instead of history.

He settled in Helsinki in 1828 when the university was moved there, after the Great Fire of Turku earlier that year. In 1835, after academic work amongst followers of Hegel, Snellman was appointed lecturer at the University of Helsinki, where he belonged to the famous circle of Cygnaeus, LÃ¶nnrot, and Runeberg comprising the brightest of their generation. Snellman&#x27;s lectures quickly became popular with the students, but in November 1838 his lectureship was temporarily recalled after a judicial proceeding that ultimately aimed to establish firm governmental control of new and oppositional thought among the academics.

As a consequence, Snellman exiled himself to Sweden and Germany, more or less voluntarily, from 1839 to 1842. By the time he returned to Helsinki, his popularity had increased further, but the political juncture did not allow the university to employ him. Instead, he took up the position as headmaster for a school in distant Kuopio and published starkly polemical periodicals, including the paper &quot;Saima&quot; in Swedish, which advocated the duty of the educated classes to take up the language of the then circa 85% majority of Finns, and develop Finnish into a language of the civilized world, useful for academic works, fine arts, state craft, and nation building.
&quot;Saima&quot; was suppressed by the government in 1846. In 1848â49, Snellman was again rebuffed when applying for the position of professor at Finland&#x27;s University in Helsinki. After having contemplated a renewed exile in Sweden, this time possibly definitive, Snellman in 1850 gave up the position in Kuopio and moved to Helsinki, where he and his family lived under economically awkward conditions until the death of Emperor Nicholas in 1855. Then it again became possible for Snellman to publish periodical papers on political issues.

He had married Johanna Lovisa Wennberg in 1845, and they had five children before her death in 1857.
In 1856, Snellman was finally appointed professor, which was met with great satisfaction among politically interested Finns. However, Snellman&#x27;s unparalleled popularity could not remain. He was a generation older than the most active political opposition, and now backed a government which had the brightest expectations for Finland under the rule of Emperor Alexander II. The language strife in Finland, of which he was the chief initiator, contributed also to substantial opposition against him and his views. Finally and not least, his stance against the Polish rebels of the January Uprising of 1863 was seen by many as the ultimate sign of unprincipled ingratiation.

In 1863 Snellman was called to a cabinet post in the Senate of Finland, in effect as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he became an energetic and valued senator. He accomplished a &quot;language decree&quot; from the Emperor that would gradually give Finns a position equal to that of the Swedish within the Finnish government. In practical terms it meant the re-establishment of the Parliament, which had remained inhibited since the Russian conquest. 

A separate Finnish currency, the Markka, was introduced in 1860, and Snellman managed to tie it to silver instead of to the ruble. The Markka came to be of the utmost value for Finland. Snellman&#x27;s tenure as Finance Minister would be tainted by the Finnish famine of 1866â1868, aggravated by the government&#x27;s strict fiscal policy, but Snellman worked to get aid while trying to protect the new currency.

Snellman&#x27;s inflexibility and high profile position in the political debate would however, together with his old reputation as radical agitator of the 1830sâ1840s, accumulate too much resistance and aversion to his person and his policies. In 1868 he was forced to resign from the senate.

For the remainder of his life, he continued to participate in the political debate, and now ennobled he belonged to the Nobles&#x27; Chamber of the parliament. Snellman never lost his popularity among his Fennoman followers, but he had become a highly divisive symbol in Finland&#x27;s political landscape.
== Honors ==

Johan Vilhelm Snellman first appeared on a 1960 coin, commemorating the introduction of the markka denomination in 1860. He was recently selected as the main motif for another commemorative coin, the â¬10 Johan Vilhelm Snellman commemorative coin, minted in 2006 celebrating the 200th anniversary of his birth. The obverse depicts J.V. Snellman. It also depicts the logo of the Europe Coins Programme. The reverse design features represent the dawn of Finnish culture.

A park in Kuopio called the Snellman Park (&quot;Snellmaninpuisto&quot;) has been named after J. V. Snellman; it was formerly known as the former location of the Kuopio Market Square. In the middle of the park, a bust of J. V. Snellman sculpted by Johannes Takanen was unveiled on July 3, 1886.

Snellman&#x27;s birthday on May 12 is dedicated to him and it has become one of Finland&#x27;s flag days, known as the &quot;Day of Finnish Identity&quot; or the &quot;Finnish Heritage Day&quot;.

== Works ==
In 1842 Snellman published his foremost work &quot;LÃ¤ran om staten&quot; (&quot;Study of the State&quot;).

<text>An ice storm, also known as a glaze event or a silver storm, is a type of winter storm characterized by freezing rain. The U.S. National Weather Service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least of ice on exposed surfaces. They are generally not violent storms but instead are commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below freezing.

==Formation==
The formation of ice begins with a layer of above-freezing air above a layer of sub-freezing temperatures closer to the surface. Frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer, and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below. If the precipitate refreezes while still in the air, it will land on the ground as sleet. Alternatively, the liquid droplets can continue to fall without freezing, passing through the cold air just above the surface. This thin layer of air then cools the rain to a temperature below freezing (). However, the drops themselves do not freeze, a phenomenon called supercooling (or forming &quot;supercooled drops&quot;). When the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below (e.g. power lines, tree branches, aircraft), a layer of ice accumulates as the cold water drips off, forming a slowly thickening film of ice, hence freezing rain.

While meteorologists can predict when and where an ice storm will occur, some storms still occur with little or no warning. In the United States, most ice storms occur in the northeastern region, but damaging storms have occurred farther south; an ice storm in February 1994 resulted in tremendous ice accumulation as far south as Mississippi, and caused reported damage in nine states. 

==Effect==
The freezing rain from an ice storm covers everything with heavy, smooth glaze ice. In addition to hazardous driving or walking conditions, branches or even whole trees may break from the weight of ice. Falling branches can block roads, tear down power and telephone lines, and cause other damage. Even without falling trees and tree branches, the weight of the ice itself can easily snap power lines and also break and bring down power/utility poles; even electricity pylons with steel frames. This can leave people without power for anywhere from several days to a month. According to most meteorologists, just of ice accumulation can add about of weight per line span. Damage from ice storms is easily capable of shutting down entire metropolitan areas.

Additionally, the loss of power during ice storms has indirectly caused numerous illnesses and deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. At lower levels, CO poisoning causes symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and headache, but high levels can cause unconsciousness, heart failure, and death. The relatively high incidence of CO poisoning during ice storms occurs due to the use of alternative methods of heating and cooking during prolonged power outages, common after severe ice storms. Gas generators, charcoal and propane barbecues, and kerosene heaters contribute to CO poisoning when they operate in confined locations. CO is produced when appliances burn fuel without enough oxygen present, such as basements and other indoor locations.

Loss of electricity during ice storms can indirectly lead to hypothermia and result in death. It can also lead to ruptured pipes due to water freezing inside the pipes.

<doc id="206947" wikidata="Q11282" url="?curid=206947" title="H II region">
<text>An HÂ II region or HII region is a region of interstellar atomic hydrogen that is ionized. It is typically in a molecular cloud of partially ionized gas in which star formation has recently taken place, with a size ranging from one to hundreds of light years, and density from a few to about a million particles per cubic centimetre. The Orion Nebula, now known to be an HÂ II region, was observed in 1610 by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc by telescope, the first such object discovered.

The regions may be of any shape because the distribution of the stars and gas inside them is irregular. The short-lived blue stars created in these regions emit copious amounts of ultraviolet light that ionize the surrounding gas. HÂ II regionsâsometimes several hundred light-years acrossâare often associated with giant molecular clouds. They often appear clumpy and filamentary, sometimes showing intricate shapes such as the Horsehead Nebula. HÂ II regions may give birth to thousands of stars over a period of several million years. In the end, supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars in the resulting star cluster disperse the gases of the HÂ II region, leaving a cluster of stars which have formed.

HÂ II regions can be observed at considerable distances in the universe, and the study of extragalactic HÂ II regions is important in determining the distances and chemical composition of galaxies. Spiral and irregular galaxies contain many HÂ II regions, while elliptical galaxies are almost devoid of them. In spiral galaxies, including our Milky Way, HÂ II regions are concentrated in the spiral arms, while in irregular galaxies they are distributed chaotically. Some galaxies contain huge HÂ II regions, which may contain tens of thousands of stars. Examples include the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 604 in the Triangulum Galaxy.

==Terminology==
The term HÂ II is pronounced &quot;H two&quot; by astronomers. &quot;H&quot; is the chemical symbol for hydrogen, and &quot;II&quot; is the Roman numeral for 2. It is customary in astronomy to use the Roman numeral I for neutral atoms, II for singly-ionisedâHÂ II is H+ in other sciencesâIII for doubly-ionised, e.g. OÂ III is O2+, etc. HÂ II, or H+, consists of free protons. An HÂ I region consists of neutral atomic hydrogen, and a molecular cloud of molecular hydrogen, H2. In spoken discussion with non-astronomers there is sometimes confusion between the identical spoken forms of &quot;HÂ II&quot; and &quot;H2&quot;.

== Observations ==
A few of the brightest HÂ II regions are visible to the naked eye. However, none seem to have been noticed before the advent of the telescope in the early 17th century. Even Galileo did not notice the Orion Nebula when he first observed the star cluster within it (previously cataloged as a single star, Î¸ Orionis, by Johann Bayer). The French observer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc is credited with the discovery of the Orion Nebula in 1610. Since that early observation large numbers of HÂ II regions have been discovered in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

William Herschel observed the Orion Nebula in 1774, and described it later as &quot;an unformed fiery mist, the chaotic material of future suns&quot;. In early days astronomers distinguished between &quot;diffuse nebulae&quot; (now known to be HÂ II regions), which retained their fuzzy appearance under magnification through a large telescope, and nebulae that could be resolved into stars, now known to be galaxies external to our own.

Confirmation of Herschel&#x27;s hypothesis of star formation had to wait another hundred years, when William Huggins together with his wife Mary Huggins turned his spectroscope on various nebulae. Some, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra quite similar to those of stars, but turned out to be galaxies consisting of hundreds of millions of individual stars. Others looked very different. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Orion Nebula and other similar objects showed only a small number of emission lines. In planetary nebulae, the brightest of these spectral lines was at a wavelength of 500.7Â nanometres, which did not correspond with a line of any known chemical element. At first it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named nebuliumâa similar idea had led to the discovery of helium through analysis of the Sun&#x27;s spectrum in 1868. However, while helium was isolated on earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the sun, nebulium was not. In the early 20th century, Henry Norris Russell proposed that rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7Â nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.

Interstellar matter, considered dense in an astronomical context, is at high vacuum by laboratory standards. Physicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low density, electrons can populate excited metastable energy levels in atoms and ions, which at higher densities are rapidly de-excited by collisions. Electron transitions from these levels in doubly ionized oxygen give rise to the 500.7Â nm line. These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called forbidden lines. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that planetary nebulae consisted largely of extremely rarefied ionised oxygen gas (OIII).

During the 20th century, observations showed that HÂ II regions often contained hot, bright stars. These stars are many times more massive than the Sun, and are the shortest-lived stars, with total lifetimes of only a few million years (compared to stars like the Sun, which live for several billion years). Therefore, it was surmised that HÂ II regions must be regions in which new stars were forming. Over a period of several million years, a cluster of stars will form in an HÂ II region, before radiation pressure from the hot young stars causes the nebula to disperse.

== Origin and lifetime ==
The precursor to an HÂ II region is a giant molecular cloud (GMC). A GMC is a cold (10â20Â K) and dense cloud consisting mostly of molecular hydrogen. GMCs can exist in a stable state for long periods of time, but shock waves due to supernovae, collisions between clouds, and magnetic interactions can trigger its collapse. When this happens, via a process of collapse and fragmentation of the cloud, stars are born (see stellar evolution for a lengthier description).

As stars are born within a GMC, the most massive will reach temperatures hot enough to ionise the surrounding gas. Soon after the formation of an ionising radiation field, energetic photons create an ionisation front, which sweeps through the surrounding gas at supersonic speeds. At greater and greater distances from the ionising star, the ionisation front slows, while the pressure of the newly ionised gas causes the ionised volume to expand. Eventually, the ionisation front slows to subsonic speeds, and is overtaken by the shock front caused by the expansion of the material ejected from the nebula. The HÂ II region has been born.

The lifetime of an HÂ II region is of the order of a few million years. Radiation pressure from the hot young stars will eventually drive most of the gas away. In fact, the whole process tends to be very inefficient, with less than 10 percent of the gas in the HÂ II region forming into stars before the rest is blown off. Contributing to the loss of gas are the supernova explosions of the most massive stars, which will occur after only 1â2 million years.

==Destruction of stellar nurseries==
Stars form in clumps of cool molecular gas that hide the nascent stars. It is only when the radiation pressure from a star drives away its &#x27;cocoon&#x27; that it becomes visible. The hot, blue stars that are powerful enough to ionize significant amounts of hydrogen and form HÂ II regions will do this quickly, and light up the region in which they just formed. The dense regions which contain younger or less massive still-forming stars and which have not yet blown away the material from which they are forming are often seen in silhouette against the rest of the ionised nebula. Bart Bok and E. F. Reilly searched astronomical photographs in the 1940s for &quot;relatively small dark nebulae&quot;, following suggestions that stars might be formed from condensations in the interstellar medium; they found several such &quot;approximately circular or oval dark objects of small size&quot;, which they referred to as &quot;globules&quot;, since referred to as Bok globules. Bok proposed at the December 1946 Harvard Observatory Centennial Symposia that these globules were likely sites of star formation. It was confirmed in 1990 that they were indeed stellar birthplaces. The hot young stars dissipate these globules, as the radiation from the stars powering the HÂ II region drives the material away. In this sense, the stars which generate HÂ II regions act to destroy stellar nurseries. In doing so, however, one last burst of star formation may be triggered, as radiation pressure and mechanical pressure from supernova may act to squeeze globules, thereby enhancing the density within them.

The young stars in HÂ II regions show evidence for containing planetary systems. The Hubble Space Telescope has revealed hundreds of &quot;protoplanetary disks&quot; (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula. At least half the young stars in the Orion Nebula appear to be surrounded by disks of gas and dust, thought to contain many times as much matter as would be needed to create a planetary system like the Solar System.

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
HÂ II regions vary greatly in their physical properties. They range in size from so-called &quot;ultra-compact&quot; (UCHII) regions perhaps only a light-year or less across, to giant HÂ II regions several hundred light-years across. Their size is also known as the Stromgren radius and essentially depends on the intensity of the source of ionising photons and the density of the region. Their densities range from over a million particles per cm3 in the ultra-compact HÂ II regions to only a few particles per cm3 in the largest and most extended regions. This implies total masses between perhaps 100 and 105 solar masses.

There are also &quot;ultra-dense HÂ II&quot; regions (UDHII).

Depending on the size of an HÂ II region there may be several thousand stars within it. This makes HÂ II regions more complicated than planetary nebulae, which have only one central ionising source. Typically HÂ II regions reach temperatures of 10,000Â K. They are mostly ionised gases with weak magnetic fields with strengths of several nanoteslas. Nevertheless, HÂ II regions are almost always associated with a cold molecular gas, which originated from the same parent GMC. Magnetic fields are produced by these weak moving electric charges in the ionised gas, suggesting that H II regions might contain electric fields.

A number of HÂ II regions also show signs of being permeated by a plasma with temperatures exceeding 10,000,000Â K, sufficiently hot to emit X-rays. X-ray observatories such as Einstein and Chandra have noted diffuse X-ray emissions in a number of star-forming regions, notably the Orion Nebula, MessierÂ 17, and the Carina Nebula. The hot gas is likely supplied by the strong stellar winds from O-type stars, which may be heated by supersonic shock waves in the winds, through collisions between winds from different stars, or through colliding winds channeled by magnetic fields. This plasma will rapidly expand to fill available cavities in the molecular clouds due to the high speed of sound in the gas at this temperature. It will also leak out through holes in the periphery of the HÂ II region, which appears to be happening in MessierÂ 17.

Chemically, HÂ II regions consist of about 90% hydrogen. The strongest hydrogen emission line, the H-alpha line at 656.3Â nm, gives HÂ II regions their characteristic red colour. (This emission line comes from excited un-ionized hydrogen.) H-beta is also emitted, but at approximately 1/3 of the intensity of H-alpha. Most of the rest of an HÂ II region consists of helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements. Across the galaxy, it is found that the amount of heavy elements in HÂ II regions decreases with increasing distance from the galactic centre. This is because over the lifetime of the galaxy, star formation rates have been greater in the denser central regions, resulting in greater enrichment of those regions of the interstellar medium with the products of nucleosynthesis.

=== Numbers and distribution ===

HÂ II regions are found only in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and irregular galaxies. They are not seen in elliptical galaxies. In irregular galaxies, they may be dispersed throughout the galaxy, but in spirals they are most abundant within the spiral arms. A large spiral galaxy may contain thousands of HÂ II regions.

The reason HÂ II regions rarely appear in elliptical galaxies is that ellipticals are believed to form through galaxy mergers. In galaxy clusters, such mergers are frequent. When galaxies collide, individual stars almost never collide, but the GMCs and HÂ II regions in the colliding galaxies are severely agitated. Under these conditions, enormous bursts of star formation are triggered, so rapid that most of the gas is converted into stars rather than the normal rate of 10% or less.
Galaxies undergoing such rapid star formation are known as starburst galaxies. The post-merger elliptical galaxy has a very low gas content, and so HÂ II regions can no longer form. Twenty-first century observations have shown that a very small number of HÂ II regions exist outside galaxies altogether. These intergalactic HÂ II regions may be the remnants of tidal disruptions of small galaxies, and in some cases may represent a new generation of stars in a galaxy&#x27;s most recently accreted gas.

=== Morphology ===

HÂ II regions come in an enormous variety of sizes. They are usually clumpy and inhomogeneous on all scales from the smallest to largest. Each star within an HÂ II region ionises a roughly spherical regionâknown as a &quot;StrÃ¶mgren sphere&quot;âof the surrounding gas, but the combination of ionisation spheres of multiple stars within a HÂ II region and the expansion of the heated nebula into surrounding gases creates sharp density gradients that result in complex shapes. Supernova explosions may also sculpt HÂ II regions. In some cases, the formation of a large star cluster within an HÂ II region results in the region being hollowed out from within. This is the case for NGC 604, a giant HÂ II region in the Triangulum Galaxy. For a HÂ II region which cannot be resolved, some information on the spatial structure (the electron density as a function of the distance from the center, and an estimate of the clumpiness) can be inferred by performing an inverse Laplace transform on the frequency spectrum.

== Notable regions ==

Notable Galactic HÂ II regions include the Orion Nebula, the Eta Carinae Nebula, and the Berkeley 59 / Cepheus OB4 Complex. The Orion Nebula, about 500Â pc (1,500Â light-years) from Earth, is part of OMC-1, a giant molecular cloud that, if visible, would be seen to fill most of the constellation of Orion. The Horsehead Nebula and Barnard&#x27;s Loop are two other illuminated parts of this cloud of gas. The Orion Nebula is actually a thin layer of ionised gas on the outer border of the OMC-1 cloud. The stars in the Trapezium cluster, and especially Î¸1 Orionis, are responsible for this ionisation.

The Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way at about 50Â kpc (), contains a giant HÂ II region called the Tarantula Nebula. Measuring at about () across, this nebula is the most massive and the second-largest HÂ II region in the Local Group. It is much bigger than the Orion Nebula, and is forming thousands of stars, some with masses of over 100 times that of the sunâOB and Wolf-Rayet stars. If the Tarantula Nebula were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, it would shine about as brightly as the full moon in the night sky. The supernova SN 1987A occurred in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula.

Another giant HÂ II regionâNGC 604 is located in M33 spiral galaxy, which is at 817Â kpc (2.66 million light years). Measuring at approximately () across, NGCÂ 604 is the second-most-massive HÂ II region in the Local Group after the Tarantula Nebula, although it is slightly larger in size than the latter. It contains around 200 hot OB and Wolf-Rayet stars, which heat the gas inside it to millions of degrees, producing bright X-ray emissions. The total mass of the hot gas in NGCÂ 604 is about 6,000Â Solar masses.

== Current issues ==

As with planetary nebulae, estimates of the abundance of elements in HÂ II regions are subject to some uncertainty. There are two different ways of determining the abundance of metals (metals in this case are elements other than hydrogen and helium) in nebulae, which rely on different types of spectral lines, and large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. Some astronomers put this down to the presence of small temperature fluctuations within HÂ II regions; others claim that the discrepancies are too large to be explained by temperature effects, and hypothesise the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations.

The full details of massive star formation within HÂ II regions are not yet well known. Two major problems hamper research in this area. First, the distance from Earth to large HÂ II regions is considerable, with the nearest HÂ II (California Nebula) region at 300Â pc (1,000 light-years); other HÂ II regions are several times that distance from Earth. Secondly, the formation of these stars is deeply obscured by dust, and visible light observations are impossible. Radio and infrared light can penetrate the dust, but the youngest stars may not emit much light at these wavelengths.

<doc id="206948" wikidata="Q732332" url="?curid=206948" title="Weibull distribution">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the Weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution. It models a broad range of random variables, largely in the nature of a time to failure or time between events. Examples are maximum one-day rainfalls and the time a user spends on a web page.

The distribution is named after Swedish mathematician Waloddi Weibull, who described it in detail in 1939, although it was first identified by RenÃ© Maurice FrÃ©chet and first applied by to describe a particle size distribution.

==Definition==

===Standard parameterization===

The probability density function of a Weibull random variable is 

:formula_1

where &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0 is the &quot;shape parameter&quot; and Î» &gt; 0 is the &quot;scale parameter&quot; of the distribution. Its complementary cumulative distribution function is a stretched exponential function. The Weibull distribution is related to a number of other probability distributions; in particular, it interpolates between the exponential distribution (&quot;k&quot; = 1) and the Rayleigh distribution (&quot;k&quot; = 2 and formula_2).

If the quantity, &quot;x,&quot; is a &quot;time-to-failure&quot;, the Weibull distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is proportional to a power of time. The &quot;shape&quot; parameter, &quot;k&quot;, is that power plus one, and so this parameter can be interpreted directly as follows:

* A value of formula_3 indicates that the failure rate decreases over time (like in case of the Lindy effect, which however corresponds to Pareto distributions rather than Weibull distributions). This happens if there is significant &quot;infant mortality&quot;, or defective items failing early and the failure rate decreasing over time as the defective items are weeded out of the population. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means negative word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically decreasing function of the proportion of adopters; 
* A value of formula_4 indicates that the failure rate is constant over time. This might suggest random external events are causing mortality, or failure. The Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution;
* A value of formula_5 indicates that the failure rate increases with time. This happens if there is an &quot;aging&quot; process, or parts that are more likely to fail as time goes on. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means positive word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically increasing function of the proportion of adopters. The function is first convex, then concave with an inflection point at formula_6.

In the field of materials science, the shape parameter &quot;k&quot; of a distribution of strengths is known as the Weibull modulus. In the context of diffusion of innovations, the Weibull distribution is a &quot;pure&quot; imitation/rejection model.

===Alternative parameterizations===
====First alternative====
Applications in medical statistics and econometrics often adopt a different parameterization. The shape parameter &quot;k&quot; is the same as above, while the scale parameter is formula_7. In this case, for &quot;x&quot; â¥ 0, the probability density function is
:formula_8
the cumulative distribution function is 
:formula_9
the quantile function is 
:formula_10
the hazard function is
:formula_11

and the mean is 
:formula_12
====Second alternative====
A second alternative parameterization can also be found. The shape parameter &quot;k&quot; is the same as in the standard case, while the scale parameter &quot;Î»&quot; is replaced with a rate parameter &quot;Î²&quot; = 1/&quot;Î»&quot;. Then, for &quot;x&quot; â¥ 0, the probability density function is
:formula_13
the cumulative distribution function is 
:formula_14
the quantile function is 
:formula_15
and the hazard function is
:formula_16

In all three parameterizations, the hazard is decreasing for k &lt; 1, increasing for k &gt; 1 and constant for k = 1, in which case the Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution.

==Properties==

===Density function===

The form of the density function of the Weibull distribution changes drastically with the value of &quot;k&quot;. For 0 &lt; &quot;k&quot; &lt; 1, the density function tends to â as &quot;x&quot; approaches zero from above and is strictly decreasing. For &quot;k&quot; = 1, the density function tends to 1/&quot;Î»&quot; as &quot;x&quot; approaches zero from above and is strictly decreasing. For &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1, the density function tends to zero as &quot;x&quot; approaches zero from above, increases until its mode and decreases after it. The density function has infinite negative slope at &quot;x&quot; = 0 if 0 &lt; &quot;k&quot; &lt; 1, infinite positive slope at &quot;x&quot; = 0 if 1 &lt; &quot;k&quot; &lt; 2 and null slope at &quot;x&quot; = 0 if &quot;k&quot; &gt; 2. For &quot;k&quot; = 1 the density has a finite negative slope at &quot;x&quot; = 0. For &quot;k&quot; = 2 the density has a finite positive slope at &quot;x&quot; = 0. As &quot;k&quot; goes to infinity, the Weibull distribution converges to a Dirac delta distribution centered at &quot;x&quot; = Î». Moreover, the skewness and coefficient of variation depend only on the shape parameter. A generalization of the Weibull distribution is the hyperbolastic distribution of type III.

===Cumulative distribution function===

The cumulative distribution function for the Weibull distribution is

:formula_17

for &quot;x&quot; â¥ 0, and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;; &quot;k&quot;; Î») = 0 for &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0.

If &quot;x&quot; = Î» then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;; &quot;k&quot;; Î») =Â 1Â âÂ &quot;e&quot;â1 âÂ 0.632 for all values ofÂ &quot;k&quot;. Vice versa: at &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;; &quot;k&quot;; &quot;Î»&quot;) = 0.632 the value ofÂ &quot;x&quot;Â âÂ &quot;Î»&quot;.

The quantile (inverse cumulative distribution) function for the Weibull distribution is

:formula_18

for 0 â¤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; 1.

The failure rate &quot;h&quot; (or hazard function) is given by

:formula_19

The Mean time between failures &quot;MTBF&quot; is

:formula_20

===Moments===
The moment generating function of the logarithm of a Weibull distributed random variable is given by

:formula_21

where is the gamma function. Similarly, the characteristic function of log &quot;X&quot; is given by

:formula_22

In particular, the &quot;n&quot;th raw moment of &quot;X&quot; is given by

:formula_23

The mean and variance of a Weibull random variable can be expressed as

:formula_24

and

:formula_25

The skewness is given by

:formula_26

where formula_27, which may also be written as 

:formula_28

where the mean is denoted by and the standard deviation is denoted by .

The excess kurtosis is given by

:formula_29

where formula_27. The kurtosis excess may also be written as:

:formula_31

===Moment generating function===
A variety of expressions are available for the moment generating function of &quot;X&quot; itself. As a power series, since the raw moments are already known, one has

:formula_32

Alternatively, one can attempt to deal directly with the integral

:formula_33

If the parameter &quot;k&quot; is assumed to be a rational number, expressed as &quot;k&quot; = &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are integers, then this integral can be evaluated analytically. With &quot;t&quot; replaced by â&quot;t&quot;, one finds

:formula_34
where &quot;G&quot; is the Meijer G-function.

The characteristic function has also been obtained by . The characteristic function and moment generating function of 3-parameter Weibull distribution have also been derived by by a direct approach.

===Minima===
Let formula_35 be independent and identically distributed Weibull random variables with scale parameter formula_36 and shape parameter formula_37. If the minimum of these formula_38 random variables is formula_39, then the cumulative probability distribution of formula_40 is given by 

:formula_41

That is, formula_40 will also be Weibull distributed with scale parameter formula_43 and with shape parameter formula_37.

=== Reparametrization tricks ===
Fix some formula_45. Let formula_46 be nonnegative, and not all zero, and let formula_47 be independent samples of formula_48, then

* formula_49
* formula_50.

===Shannon entropy===
The information entropy is given by

:formula_51

where formula_52 is the EulerâMascheroni constant. The Weibull distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for a non-negative real random variate with a fixed expected value of &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; equal to &quot;Î»&quot;&quot;k&quot; and a fixed expected value of ln(&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) equal to ln(&quot;Î»&quot;&quot;k&quot;)Â âÂ formula_52.

=== KullbackâLeibler divergence ===
The KullbackâLeibler divergence between two Weibull distributions is given by
: formula_54

==Parameter estimation==
===Ordinary least square using Weibull plot===

The fit of a Weibull distribution to data can be visually assessed using a Weibull plot. The Weibull plot is a plot of the empirical cumulative distribution function formula_55 of data on special axes in a type of QâQ plot. The axes are formula_56 versus formula_57. The reason for this change of variables is the cumulative distribution function can be linearized:
:formula_58
which can be seen to be in the standard form of a straight line. Therefore, if the data came from a Weibull distribution then a straight line is expected on a Weibull plot.

There are various approaches to obtaining the empirical distribution function from data. One method is to obtain the vertical coordinate for each point using
:formula_59,
where formula_60 is the rank of the data point and formula_38 is the number of data points. Another common estimator is 
:formula_62.

Linear regression can also be used to numerically assess goodness of fit and estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution. The gradient informs one directly about the shape parameter formula_37 and the scale parameter formula_36 can also be inferred.

===Method of moments===
The coefficient of variation of Weibull distribution depends only on the shape parameter: 

:formula_65

Equating the sample quantities formula_66 to formula_67, the moment estimate of the shape parameter formula_37 can be read off either from a look up table or a graph of formula_69 versus formula_37. A more accurate estimate of formula_71 can be found using a root finding algorithm to solve

:formula_72

The moment estimate of the scale parameter can then be found using the first moment equation as 

:formula_73

===Maximum likelihood===
The maximum likelihood estimator for the formula_36 parameter given formula_37 is

:formula_76

The maximum likelihood estimator for formula_37 is the solution for &quot;k&quot; of the following equation
:formula_78

This equation defines formula_79 only implicitly, one must generally solve for formula_37 by numerical means.

When formula_81 are the formula_82 largest observed samples from a dataset of more than formula_82 samples, then the maximum likelihood estimator for the formula_36 parameter given formula_37 is

:formula_86

Also given that condition, the maximum likelihood estimator for formula_37 is
:formula_88

Again, this being an implicit function, one must generally solve for formula_37 by numerical means.

==Applications==
The Weibull distribution is used


* In survival analysis
* In reliability engineering and failure analysis
* In electrical engineering to represent overvoltage occurring in an electrical system
* In industrial engineering to represent manufacturing and delivery times
* In extreme value theory
* In weather forecasting and the wind power industry to describe wind speed distributions, as the natural distribution often matches the Weibull shape
* In communications systems engineering
** In radar systems to model the dispersion of the received signals level produced by some types of clutters
** To model fading channels in wireless communications, as the Weibull fading model seems to exhibit good fit to experimental fading channel measurements
* In information retrieval to model dwell times on web pages.
* In general insurance to model the size of reinsurance claims, and the cumulative development of asbestosis losses
* In forecasting technological change (also known as the Sharif-Islam model)
* In hydrology the Weibull distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges.
* In decline curve analysis to model oil production rate curve of shale oil wells.
* In describing the size of particles generated by grinding, milling and crushing operations, the 2-Parameter Weibull distribution is used, and in these applications it is sometimes known as the RosinâRammler distribution. In this context it predicts fewer fine particles than the log-normal distribution and it is generally most accurate for narrow particle size distributions. The interpretation of the cumulative distribution function is that formula_90 is the mass fraction of particles with diameter smaller than formula_91, where formula_36 is the mean particle size and formula_37 is a measure of the spread of particle sizes.
* In describing random point clouds (such as the positions of particles in an ideal gas): the probability to find the nearest-neighbor particle at a distance formula_91 from a given particle is given by a Weibull distribution with formula_95 and formula_96 equal to the density of the particles.
* In calculating the rate of radiation-induced single event effects onboard spacecraft, a four-parameter Weibull distribution is used to fit experimentally measured device cross section probability data to a particle linear energy transfer spectrum. The Weibull fit was originally used because of a belief that particle energy levels align to a statistical distribution, but this belief was later proven false and the Weibull fit continues to be used because of its many adjustable parameters, rather than a demonstrated physical basis.

==Related distributions==
* If formula_97, then the variable formula_98 is Gumbel (minimum) distributed with location parameter formula_99 and scale parameter formula_100. That is, formula_101.
* A Weibull distribution is a generalized gamma distribution with both shape parameters equal to &quot;k&quot;.
* The translated Weibull distribution (or 3-parameter Weibull) contains an additional parameter. It has the probability density function formula_102 for formula_103 and formula_104 for formula_105, where formula_106 is the shape parameter, formula_107 is the scale parameter and formula_108 is the location parameter of the distribution. formula_108 value sets an initial failure-free time before the regular Weibull process begins. When formula_110, this reduces to the 2-parameter distribution.
* The Weibull distribution can be characterized as the distribution of a random variable formula_111 such that the random variable formula_112 is the standard exponential distribution with intensity 1.
* This implies that the Weibull distribution can also be characterized in terms of a uniform distribution: if formula_113 is uniformly distributed on formula_114, then the random variable formula_115 is Weibull distributed with parameters formula_37 and formula_36. Note that formula_118 here is equivalent to formula_119 just above. This leads to an easily implemented numerical scheme for simulating a Weibull distribution.
* The Weibull distribution interpolates between the exponential distribution with intensity formula_120 when formula_121 and a Rayleigh distribution of mode formula_122 when formula_123.
* The Weibull distribution (usually sufficient in reliability engineering) is a special case of the three parameter exponentiated Weibull distribution where the additional exponent equals 1. The exponentiated Weibull distribution accommodates unimodal, bathtub shaped and monotone failure rates.
* The Weibull distribution is a special case of the generalized extreme value distribution. It was in this connection that the distribution was first identified by Maurice FrÃ©chet in 1927. The closely related FrÃ©chet distribution, named for this work, has the probability density function formula_124
* The distribution of a random variable that is defined as the minimum of several random variables, each having a different Weibull distribution, is a poly-Weibull distribution.
* The Weibull distribution was first applied by to describe particle size distributions. It is widely used in mineral processing to describe particle size distributions in comminution processes. In this context the cumulative distribution is given by formula_125 where
** formula_91 is the particle size
** formula_127 is the 80th percentile of the particle size distribution
** formula_128 is a parameter describing the spread of the distribution
* Because of its availability in spreadsheets, it is also used where the underlying behavior is actually better modeled by an Erlang distribution.
* If formula_129 then formula_130 (Exponential distribution)
* For the same values of k, the Gamma distribution takes on similar shapes, but the Weibull distribution is more platykurtic.

* From the viewpoint of the Stable count distribution, formula_131 can be regarded as LÃ©vy&#x27;s stability parameter. A Weibull distribution can be decomposed to an integral of kernel density where the kernel is either a Laplace distribution formula_132 or a Rayleigh distribution formula_133: formula_134 where formula_135 is the Stable count distribution and formula_136 is the Stable vol distribution.

<doc id="206953" wikidata="Q179983" url="?curid=206953" title="Sandgrouse">
<text>Sandgrouse is the common name for Pteroclidae , a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pterocliformes . They are traditionally placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot; and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus &quot;Pterocles&quot;. They are ground-dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs, and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern, and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East, and India through central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse even extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas&#x27;s sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.

==Description==
Sandgrouse have small, pigeon-like heads and necks and sturdy compact bodies. They range in size from in length and from in weight. The adults are sexually dimorphic with the males being slightly larger and more brightly colored than the females. They have eleven strong primary feathers and long pointed wings, giving them a fast and direct flight. The muscles of the wings are powerful and the birds are capable of rapid take off and sustained flight. In some species, the central feathers in the tail are extended into long points.

The legs are short and members of the genus &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot; have feathers growing on both the legs and toes, and no hind toes, while members of the genus &quot;Pterocles&quot; have legs feathered just at the front, no feathers on the toes, and rudimentary hind toes raised off the ground.

The plumage is cryptic, generally being in shades of sandy brown, grey and buff, and variously mottled and barred, enabling the birds to merge into the dusty landscape. There is a dense layer of under down which helps insulate the bird from extremes of heat and cold. The feathers of the belly are specially adapted for absorbing water and retaining it, allowing adults, particularly males, to carry water to chicks that may be many miles away from watering holes. The amount of water that can be carried in this way is 15 to 20Â millilitres (0.5 to 0.7Â fluid ounces).

==Distribution==

Members of the genus &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot; are found in the steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through southern Siberia, Tibet, and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas&#x27;s sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.

Members of the genus &quot;Pterocles&quot; are mainly found in the drier parts of northern, eastern, and southern Africa, though the range of some species extends into the Middle East and western Asia. The Madagascar sandgrouse is restricted to Madagascar. The black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse also occur in Spain, Portugal, and southern France. Most species are sedentary though some make local migrations, typically to lower altitudes in winter.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Diet and feeding===

Sandgrouse are principally seed eaters. Other food items eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs, and berries. Insect food such as ants and termites may also be eaten, especially during the breeding season. The diet of many sandgrouse is highly specialised, with the seeds of a small number of plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the sandgrouse. Seeds of leguminous plants are usually an important part of the diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants.

Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist, which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded sandgrouse feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua sandgrouse feed rapidly, exploring loose soil with their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.

Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in flocks of up to 100 birds. As a consequence of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk, and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak, which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to members of their own species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.

They are vulnerable to attack while watering but with a large number of birds milling about, predators find it difficult to select a target bird and are likely to have been spotted before they can get close to the flock. The choice of a watering site is influenced by the topography of the nearby ground. The sandgrouse tend to avoid sites with cover for mammalian predators and their greatest risk is usually from predatory birds.

Sandgrouse travel tens of miles to their traditional water holes and tend to disregard temporary water sources which may appear periodically. This clearly has a survival value, because a dried up water source in an arid region could result in dehydration and death. The Burchell&#x27;s sandgrouse in the Kalahari Desert sometimes travels over daily to reach a water source. Not all species need to drink every day, and the Tibetan sandgrouse does not need to travel to drink, because of the abundance of water from melting snowfields in its habitat.

===Breeding===

Sandgrouse are monogamous. The breeding season usually coincides with a crop of seeds after the local rainy season and at this time the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with a few pieces of dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. The intricately patterned, precocial downy young, and egg colouration (though not shape) closely resemble those of many Charadriiformes. Eggs are near elliptical. Incubation duties are shared; in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20â25Â days.

The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults&#x27; breasts. Chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate at first, and their parents shade them during the hottest part of the day, and brood them to keep warm at night. The chicks remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.

==Taxonomy==
The Pteroclidae was formerly included in the Galliformes due to the similarities the family shares with the true grouse. However, it was later discovered that these similarities are superficial and a result of convergent evolution. Sandgrouse were later placed near the Columbiformes largely due to their reported ability to drink by the &quot;sucking&quot; or &quot;pumping&quot; action of peristalsis of the esophagus, an unusual characteristic. More recently, it has been reported that they cannot suck up water in this way, and they are now treated separately in the order Pterocliformes. They have been considered near passerine birds, and are thought by some to be closer to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes).

In the DNA-study by Fain and Houde (2004) they were included in the Metaves, together with the Columbiformes. In the larger study by Hackett et al. (2008) they were once again positioned close to the Columbiformes, in Columbimorphae, but also with the Mesites. 

===Phylogeny===
Living Pterocliformes, based on the work by John Boyd.

=== Species ===
== Relations with humans ==
Sandgrouse have little interaction with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds as they are not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed but they have been introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, &quot;P. e. floweri&quot;, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.

<doc id="206954" wikidata="Q3355950" url="?curid=206954" title="Product breakdown structure">
<text>In project management under the PRINCE2 methodology, a product breakdown structure (PBS) is a tool for analysing, documenting and communicating the outcomes of a project, and forms part of the product based planning technique.

The PBS provides &quot;an exhaustive, hierarchical tree structure of deliverables that make up the project, arranged in whole-part relationship&quot; (Haughey, 2015).

==Comparison with the work breakdown structure==
The PBS is identical in format to the work breakdown structure (WBS), but is a separate entity and is used at a different step in the planning process. The PBS precedes the WBS and focuses on cataloguing all the desired outputs (products) needed to achieve the goal of the project. This feeds into creation of the WBS, which identifies the tasks and activities required to deliver those outputs. Supporters of product based planning suggest that this overcomes difficulties that arise from assumptions about what to do and how to do it by focusing instead on the goals and objectives of the project â an oft-quoted analogy is that &quot;PBS defines where you want to go, the WBS tells you how to get there&quot;.

==Example==

The diagrammatic representation of project outputs shown provides an example of a clear and unambiguous statement of what the project is to deliver.

<doc id="206955" wikidata="Q123053" url="?curid=206955" title="Johanna Spyri">
<text>Johanna Spyri (; ; 12 June 1827 â 7 July 1901) was a Swiss author of novels, notably children&#x27;s stories. She wrote the popular book &quot;Heidi&quot;. Born in Hirzel, a rural area in the canton of ZÃ¼rich, as a child she spent several summers near Chur in GraubÃ¼nden, the setting she later would use in her novels.

==Biography==
In 1852, Johanna Heusser married a lawyer named Bernhard Spyri. Whilst living in the city of ZÃ¼rich she began to write about life in the country. Her first story, &quot;A Leaf on Vrony&#x27;s Grave&quot;, which deals with a woman&#x27;s life of domestic violence, was published in 1873; the following years further stories for both adults and children appeared, among them the novel &quot;Heidi&quot;, which she wrote in four weeks only. &quot;Heidi&quot; tells the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps, and is famous for its vivid portrayal of the landscape.

Spyri&#x27;s husband and her only child, both named Bernhard, both died in 1884. Alone, she devoted herself to charitable causes and wrote over fifty more stories before her death in 1901. She was interred in the family plot at the Sihlfeld-A Cemetery in ZÃ¼rich. An icon in Switzerland, Spyri&#x27;s portrait was placed on a postage stamp in 1951 and on a 20 CHF commemorative coin in 2009.

==Plagiarism claim==
In April 2010 a professor searching for children&#x27;s illustrations found a book written in 1830 by a German history teacher, Hermann Adam von Kamp, that Spyri may have used as a basis for &quot;Heidi&quot;. The 1830 story is titled &quot;Adelheide - das MÃ¤dchen vom Alpengebirge&quot;âtranslated, &quot;Adelaide, the girl from the Alps&quot;. The two stories were alleged to share many similarities in plot line and imagery. Spyri biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Johanna may have been familiar with the story as she grew up in a literate household with many books. However, the professor&#x27;s claims have been examined and afterwards described as &quot;unscientific&quot;, due to &#x27;superficial coincidences&#x27; he brings up in descriptions and the many actual differences in the story, that he doesn&#x27;t, as well as the &quot;Swiss disease&quot; of homesickness already being a common trope in fiction in the eighteenth (nineteenth in the article) century (as well as, while not mentioned in the article, it being discovered before von Kamp was even born) and characters that are either drastically different or not in &quot;Adelaide&quot;, at all.

<text>Slim Shady EP is the only extended play by American rapper Eminem, released on December 10, 1997, through Web Entertainment. Unlike his debut album &quot;Infinite&quot; (1996), &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; helped Eminem gain the interest of CEO Jimmy Iovine (co-founder of Interscope Records) and West Coast hip-hop rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who subsequently signed Eminem to his Aftermath Entertainment record label, and served as executive producer on his major-label debut album &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999).

The EP introduces Eminem&#x27;s alter ego Slim Shady. Since the EP was released before he was signed to Interscope and Aftermath, original copies are now highly valued. His lyrics are a marked departure from those found on &quot;Infinite&quot;, featuring constant references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability, and over-the-top violence. Another departure was his exploration of more serious themes of dealing with poverty, his direct and self-deprecating response to criticism, and of marital and family difficulties. His flow is also noticeably different from &quot;Infinite&quot; where critics claimed he sounded too much like Nas and AZ. Eminem also began utilizing story telling on this EP. The production value of the music on the tracksâfrom previous collaborators DJ Head, the Bass Brothers, and Mr. Porterâwas also noticeably higher than on prior album efforts. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, at this point in his life Eminem had &quot;realized his musical ambitions were the only way to escape his unhappy life&quot;.

==Background and production==
In 1996, his debut album &quot;Infinite&quot;, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent label Web Entertainment. &quot;Infinite&quot; achieved little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations, such as WJLB (97.9 FM in Detroit), and in specific tracks Eminem raps explicitly about this problem, like in &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; &quot;If I Had&quot; and &quot;Low Down, Dirty&quot;. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: &quot;After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, &#x27;You&#x27;re a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don&#x27;t you go into rock &amp; roll?&#x27; All that type of shit started pissing me off.&quot; After the release of &quot;Infinite&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt: all these troubles became main themes of &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot;.

The disappointment of &quot;Infinite&quot; inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: &quot;Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it&quot;. Slim Shady served as Eminem&#x27;s vent for his frustrations, and he released the horrorcore extended play entitled &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; simultaneously on cassette, vinyl, and CD. During this time, Eminem and his wife Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, &quot;In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, &#x27;Find him. Now.&#x27;&quot; Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on his major-label debut album &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover depicts the opening intro as well as the first track, in which Slim Shady awakens Eminem and orders him to look in the mirror to see that he is &quot;nothing without him&quot;. Eminem resists and screams in the background while Slim Shady yells back and laughs at Eminem&#x27;s horror. By the second track, Eminem and Slim Shady become the same person. Eminem is also ordered by &quot;Slim Shady&quot; to look into the mirror, and the sound of glass breaking is heard, alluding once again to the cover. The art also bears a similarity to Black Flag&#x27;s 1981 debut album, &quot;Damaged&quot;.

== Release and reception==
According to an interview with Zane Lowe, Eminem made 500 copies of the EP, but sold only slightly more than 250. Though rare, reviews of the EP were generally mixed to positive. AllMusic gave the EP two and a half out of five stars without a written review. &quot;XXL&quot;, despite originally giving the EP three out of five stars &quot;L&quot; rating, listed it on their &quot;100 Most Essential Rap EPs of All Time â The Best of the Short &amp; Sweet&quot; list. Eminem was featured in the March 1998 edition of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine&#x27;s (#102), &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column. The author of the column highlighted two tracks from Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot;: &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, and &quot;Murder, Murder&quot;.

<text>The homing pigeon is a variety of domestic pigeon (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;), selectively bred for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances. Because of this skill, homing pigeons were used to carry messages, a practice referred to as &quot;pigeon post&quot;. Until the introduction of telephones, they were used commercially to deliver communication; when used during wars, they were called &quot;war pigeons&quot;.

The homing pigeon is also called a mail pigeon or messenger, and colloquially a homer. Perhaps most commonly, the homing pigeon is called a carrier pigeon; this nomenclature can be confusing, though, since it is distinct from the English carrier, an ancient breed of fancy pigeon. Modern-day homing pigeons do have English carrier blood in them because they are in part descendants of the old-style carriers.

The domestic pigeon is derived from the wild rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot; sspp.); the rock dove has an innate homing ability, meaning that it will generally return to its nest using magnetoreception. Flights as long as have been recorded by birds in competitive homing pigeon racing; birds bred for this are colloquially called racing homers. Homing pigeons&#x27; average flying speed over moderate distances is around and speeds of up to have been observed in top racers for short distances.

==History==
Homing pigeons were potentially being used for pigeon post in Ancient Egypt by 1350 BCE. Messages were tied around the legs of the pigeon, which was freed and could reach its original nest. Pliny the Elder described pigeons used in a similar fashion as military messengers around the first century CE.
By the 19th century homing pigeons were used extensively for military communications.

The sport of flying messenger pigeons was well-established as early as 3000 years ago. They were used to proclaim the winner of the Ancient Olympics.
Messenger pigeons were used as early as 1150 in Baghdad and also later by Genghis Khan. By 1167 a regular service between Baghdad and Syria had been established by Sultan Nur ad-Din. In Damietta, by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back. The Republic of Genoa equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. Tipu Sultan of Mysore (1750â1799) also used messenger pigeons; they returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque&#x27;s minarets to this day.

In 1818, a great pigeon race called the Cannonball Run took place at Brussels. In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the 1815 Battle of Waterloo has often been claimed to have been delivered to London by pigeon but there is no evidence for this, and it is very unlikely; the pigeon post was rare until the 1820s. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels.

Historically, pigeons carried messages only one way, to their home. They had to be transported manually before another flight. However, by placing their food at one location and their home at another location, pigeons have been trained to fly back and forth up to twice a day reliably, covering round-trip flights up to 160Â km (100Â mi). Their reliability has lent itself to occasional use on mail routes, such as the Great Barrier Pigeongram Service established between the Auckland, New Zealand, suburb of Newton and Great Barrier Island in November 1897, possibly the first regular air mail service in the world. The world&#x27;s first &quot;airmail&quot; stamps were issued for the Great Barrier Pigeon-Gram Service from 1898 to 1908.

In the 19th century, newspapers sometimes used carrier pigeons. To get news from Europe quicker, some New York City newspapers used carrier pigeons. The distance from Europe to Halifax, Nova Scotia, is relatively short. So reporters stationed themselves in Halifax, wrote the information received from incoming ships, and put the messages in capsules attached to the legs of homing pigeons. The birds would then fly from Halifax to New York City where the information would be published.

Homing pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in Odisha state in eastern India to provide emergency communication services following natural disasters. In March 2002, it was announced that India&#x27;s Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Odisha was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the Internet. The Taliban banned the keeping or use of pigeons, including racing pigeons, in Afghanistan in the late 1990s.

To this day, pigeons are still entered into competitions.

==Navigation==
Research has been performed with the intention of discovering how pigeons, after being transported, can find their way back from distant places they have never visited before. Most researchers believe that homing ability is based on a &quot;map and compass&quot; model, with the compass feature allowing birds to orient and the map feature allowing birds to determine their location relative to a goal site (home loft). While the compass mechanism appears to rely on the sun, the map mechanism has been highly debated.

A prominent theory is that the birds are able to detect a magnetic field to help them find their way home. Scientific research previously suggested that on top of a pigeon&#x27;s beak a large number of iron particles are found which remain aligned to Earth&#x27;s magnetic north like a natural compass, thus acting as compass which helps pigeon in determining its home. However, a 2012 study disproved this theory, putting the field back on course to search for an explanation as to how animals detect magnetic fields.

A light-mediated mechanism that involves the eyes and is lateralized has been examined somewhat, but developments have implicated the trigeminal nerve in magnetoreception. Research by Floriano Papi (Italy, early 1970s) and more recent work, largely by Hans Wallraff, suggest that pigeons also orient themselves using the spatial distribution of atmospheric odors, known as olfactory navigation.

Other research indicates that homing pigeons also navigate through visual landmarks by following familiar roads and other human-made features, making 90-degree turns and following habitual routes, much the same way that humans navigate.

Research by Jon Hagstrum of the US Geological Survey suggests that homing pigeons use low-frequency infrasound to navigate. Sound waves as low as 0.1Â Hz have been observed to disrupt or redirect pigeon navigation. The pigeon ear, being far too small to interpret such a long wave, directs pigeons to fly in a circle when first taking air, in order to mentally map such long infrasound waves.

Various experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents. Charles Walcott at Cornell University was able to demonstrate that while pigeons from one loft were confused by a magnetic anomaly in the Earth it had no effect on birds from another loft away. Other experiments have shown that altering the perceived time of day with artificial lighting or using air conditioning to eliminate odors in the pigeons&#x27; home roost affected the pigeons&#x27; ability to return home.

GPS tracing studies indicate that gravitational anomalies may play a role as well.

==Roles==

===Postal carriage===
A message may be written on thin light paper, rolled into a small tube, and attached to a messenger pigeon&#x27;s leg. They will only travel to one &quot;mentally marked&quot; point that they have identified as their home, so &quot;pigeon post&quot; can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver&#x27;s pigeons.

With training, pigeons can carry up to 75Â g (2.5Â oz) on their backs. As early as 1903, the German apothecary Julius Neubronner used carrier pigeons to both receive and deliver urgent medication. In 1977, a similar system of 30 carrier pigeons was set up for the transport of laboratory specimens between two English hospitals. Every morning a basket with pigeons was taken from Plymouth General Hospital to Devonport Hospital. The birds then delivered unbreakable vials back to Plymouth as needed. The carrier pigeons became unnecessary in 1983 because of the closure of one of the hospitals. In the 1980s a similar system existed between two French hospitals located in Granville and Avranche.

===Wartime communication===

Birds were used extensively during World War I. One homing pigeon, Cher Ami, was awarded the French Croix de guerre for his heroic service in delivering 12 important messages, despite having been very badly injured.

During World War II, the Irish Paddy, the American G.I. Joe and the English Mary of Exeter all received the Dickin Medal. They were among 32 pigeons to receive this award, for their gallantry and bravery in saving human lives with their actions. Eighty-two homing pigeons were dropped into the Netherlands with the First Airborne Division Signals as part of Operation Market Garden in World War II. The pigeons&#x27; loft was located in London, which would have required them to fly to deliver their messages. Also in World War II, hundreds of homing pigeons with the Confidential Pigeon Service were airdropped into northwest Europe to serve as intelligence vectors for local resistance agents. Birds played a vital part in the Invasion of Normandy as radios could not be used for fear of vital information being intercepted by the enemy.

During the Second World War, the use of pigeons for sending messages was highlighted in Britain by the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as Girl Guides joining other Guides sending messages to the World Chief Guide in 1943, as part of a campaign to raise money for homing pigeons.

===Computing===
The humorous IP over Avian Carriers (RFC 1149) is an Internet protocol for the transmission of messages via homing pigeon. Originally intended as an April Fools&#x27; Day RFC entry, this protocol was implemented and used, once, to transmit a message in Bergen, Norway, on 28 April 2001.

In September 2009, a South African IT company based in Durban pitted an 11-month-old bird armed with a data packed 4Â GB memory stick against the ADSL service from the country&#x27;s biggest Internet service provider, Telkom. The pigeon, Winston, took an hour and eight minutes to carry the data . In all, the data transfer took two hours, six minutes, and fifty-seven secondsâthe same amount of time it took to transfer 4% of the data over the ADSL.

===Smuggling===
Homing pigeons have been reported to be used as a smuggling technique, getting objects and narcotics across borders and into prisons. For instance, between 2009 and 2015, pigeons have been reported to carry contraband items such as mobile phones, SIM cards, phone batteries and USB cords into prisons in the Brazilian state of SÃ£o Paulo. There have also been cases where homing pigeons were used to transport drugs into prisons.

<doc id="206965" wikidata="Q1638174" url="?curid=206965" title="M4 motorway">
<text>The M4, originally the London-South Wales Motorway, is a motorway in the United Kingdom running from west London to southwest Wales. The English section to the Severn Bridge was constructed between 1961 and 1971; the Welsh element was largely complete by 1980, though a non-motorway section around Briton Ferry bridge remained until 1993. On the opening of the Second Severn Crossing in 1996, the M4 was rerouted over it.

The line of the motorway from London to Bristol runs closely in parallel with the A4. After crossing the River Severn, toll-free since 17 December 2018, the motorway follows the A48, to terminate at the Pont Abraham services in Carmarthenshire.

The M4 is the only motorway in Wales apart from its two spurs: the A48(M) and the M48. The major towns and cities along the routea distance of approximately include Slough, Reading, Swindon, Bristol, Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend, Port Talbot and Swansea.

==History==
A new road from London to South Wales was first proposed in the 1930s. In 1956 the Ministry of Transport announced the plans for the first major post-war road improvement projects.

The Chiswick flyover, a short section of elevated dual-carriageway, not originally classed as a motorway, opened in 1959 to reduce the impact of traffic travelling between central London and the west.
The Maidenhead bypass (J7-J9) opened in 1961, the section from Slough to Maidenhead (J5-J7) opened in 1963 and J1-J5 opened on 24 March 1965 incorporating the Chiswick Flyover. The stretch from J18 to the west of Newport was opened in 1966, including the Severn Bridge. The Port Talbot by-pass, also built in the 1960s and now part of the M4, was originally the A48(M) motorway, a number now allocated to a short section of motorway near Cardiff. The Ministry of Transport originally intended that the M4 would terminate at Tredegar Park west of Newport, and following the creation of the Welsh Office that the Government became committed to a high-standard dual carriageway to Carmarthenshire.

The English section of the motorway was completed on 22 December 1971 when the stretch between junctions 9 and 15 Maidenhead and Swindon) was opened to traffic. The Welsh section was largely completed between 1970 and 1980, though a non-motorway section remained across the Briton Ferry bridge until 1993, when a second motorway-only bridge opened. 

In 1996, the Second Severn Crossing opened with new link motorways on either side of the estuary to divert the M4 over the new crossing. At the same time, the original route over the Severn Bridge was redesignated the M48, and the M49 was opened to link the new crossing with the M5 at Avonmouth.
The new M49 shortened the route between South Wales and the South West, and reduced traffic at the busy M4/M5 junction at Almondsbury. 

===After completion===
In April 2005, speed checks carried out by police camera vans between junction 14 and junction 18 led to a public protest, involving a &quot;go-slow&quot; of several hundred vehicles along the affected sections of the motorway.

Between 2007 and January 2010, the section from Castleton (junction 29) to Coryton (junction 32) was widened to six lanes. The scheme was formally opened on 25 January 2010 by Ieuan Wyn Jones the Deputy First Minister for Wales.

During 2009, the Newport section of the motorway between junctions 23a and 29 was upgraded with a new concrete central barrier. In February 2010, it was proposed that the M4 in South Wales would become the first hydrogen highway with hydrogen stations provided along the route, with an aspiration for further stations to be provided along the M4 into South West England over time.

Between 2008 and 2010, junction 11 was extensively remodelled with a new four-lane junction, two new road bridges and other works. The Â£65million scheme included work on the Mereoak roundabout and part of the A33 Swallowfield Bypass near Shinfield, and also the conversion of the two existing bridges, one of which is available only to pedestrians and cyclists and the other to buses. It also involved the movement of the local Highways Agency and Fire Service offices, and the construction of a long footbridge network, a new bus lane and a new gyratory. Sound barriers for nearby residential areas were also installed. In April 2008, the decision to preserve a rare Vickers machine gun pillbox and turn it into a bat roost was announced by the developers.

===Former bridge tolls===
Tolls were charged on the Severn Bridge(s) from opening until 2018. In 1966 the toll was pre-decimal pence each-way for cars, rising to Â£1 in the late 1980s. Around 1991 the toll was doubled but charged in the westbound direction only, to reduce queuing. After 1996, the tolls were equal westbound-only on both bridges, and rose steeply after 2000 to a peak of Â£6.70 for cars in 2017, leading to protests from Welsh businesses. 
Tolls on both bridges over the River Severn were eliminated on 17 December 2018, and the former toll booths were removed in 2019.

===Timeline of construction===


=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance of the Second Severn Crossing and the of motorway in England is the responsibility of National Highways. The in Wales is the responsibility of the South Wales Trunk Road Agent.

==Features==
===Speed limits===

For the majority of its length, the national speed limit applies. Exceptions include the following:
* on the Chiswick Flyover within London in both directions.
* between junction 4 and the Chiswick Flyover, eastbound only.
* on the Port Talbot elevated section between junction 40 and junction 41. The fixed speed camera was removed in 2006 as it was believed to be causing tailbacks. In July 2014, an average speed camera system was installed; it generated around Â£500,000 in fines in the first six months.
* between junctions 24 and 28 at Newport.

=== Smart motorway ===

The first section of smart motorway on the M4, between junctions 19 (M32) and 20 (M5) north of Bristol, has variable speed limits and includes a part-time hard-shoulder. Completion was in summer 2014. Another section between junctions 24 and 29 in Newport had variable speed limits until 2021, when it was changed to a permanent limit with average speed cameras.

In 2010, it was announced that the motorway would be changed to a smart motorway between junctions 3 and 12. With a length of , on completion it became the longest smart motorway scheme in the United Kingdom. Work started in autumn 2018 and was completed ahead of schedule in December 2021 at a cost of Â£848Â million. Further conversions to smart motorways have been halted indefinitely.

===Brynglas tunnels===
The Brynglas Tunnels carry the M4 under Brynglas Hill in Newport. The tunnels are the first and only twinâbored tunnels in the UK motorway network (the Dartford Tunnel is not classified as part of the M25 motorway).
In July 2011, a lorry fire in one tunnel closed the motorway. Although there were no injuries and no deaths, the tunnel remained closed and a contraflow system was in place in the remaining tunnel for about one month, causing major travel delays.

===Bus lane===

In June 1999, the M4 bus lane was created on the third lane between junctions 2 and 3, initially as a pilot scheme and then a permanent arrangement from 2001. A lower speed limit was introduced along this section at the same time. The bus lane was on the eastbound carriageway; from the western end of the Chiswick Flyover near Brentford to junction 3 (A312), covering part of the journey between Heathrow Airport and central London. The lane which had no intermediate exits was for use by buses, coaches, motorcycles, emergency vehicles and licensed taxis but not mini-cabs.

In December 2010, the bus lane was suspended for 18 months. It was reinstated temporarily for the 2012 Summer Olympics and then permanently decommissioned.

===Porous road surface===
Near junction 35 of the M4, there is a stretch of the motorway that has a surfacing of porous asphalt that improves drainage and reduces noise. When driving in heavy rain drivers notice a reduction in road spray from other vehicles and improved visibility. This special surface was publicised in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; programme. This was the site of the first trial of the new road surface when it was laid down in 1993.

===Elevated and heated section===
The elevated section of the M4 in West London, built in the 1960s, is mostly directly above the A4 and extends over parts of Brentford&#x27;s Golden Mile. This section was designed to have a heated road surface to reduce icing in winter.

===Four-level stack interchanges===

The M4 has two of the three four-level stack interchanges in the UK, including the first UK example at junction 20, the &quot;Almondsbury Interchange&quot; with the M5. The other is at junction 4b, the &quot;Thorney Interchange&quot; with the M25; this interchange has to make provision for a railway line passing beneath the M4. Due to the nature of these junctions, one cannot make a U-turn at either of them.

===Notable junctions===
Junction 8/9 near Maidenhead, Berkshire, and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire is the only one in the UK with dual numbers. This arose at the time when the M4 turned north near junction 8, where it met the A308, and headed for the original junction 9, where the motorway ended at a roundabout interchange with the A4. When the westward extension was opened, junction 8 was closed and a new junction built a little to the west, taking both numbers. The road to the A4 became A423(M) and later A404(M), and the junction with the A4 became 9B. Junction 9A is the exit for Cox Green and White Waltham. To the west of junction 13 on the eastbound carriageway there are a set of sliproads signposted &quot;Works Unit Only&quot;. The signs have red borders, implying a military exit. It is a back entrance to RAF Welford, a Second World War airfield and now an RAF/USAF military installation mainly used for storing munitions. The M4 entrance allows easier access for the large vehicles used to carry the munitions.

Plans for the &quot;missing&quot; Junction 31, also known as the Thornhill interchange, for which planning permission was originally granted in September 1991 (but subsequently expired), were rekindled after proposals for a new business park on a site north of the M4 were submitted in 2007 to Cardiff Council. The developers of the business park, St Modwen Developments, would likely fund the new junction, which would be on the A469. A freedom of information request in 2010 to Cardiff Council shows that whilst the land that would enable this junction should continue to be strategically protected, the decision to formally abandon the proposed Junction 31 Thornhill was made in October 2007 and there had been no subsequent mention of it in Cardiff Council Strategic or Planning meetings since.

In South Wales, the M4 has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and built-up areas, so there are some unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but has severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. At the time of construction, junction numbers 30 and 31 were reserved for future intermediate interchanges. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added, but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.

Junction 41 comprises two different junctions; one for local traffic to and from the west and one from the east. The former leads to and from a spur leading to the roundabout in Briton Ferry, formerly known as junction 41a, and the original bridge over the River Neath, which would allow access onto the stretch of the M4 from junction 43 westward. The second, eastern junction leads to and from the A48 towards Port Talbot. As a result, one can travel for almost on the motorway in either direction, both joining and then leaving the motorway at junction 41. Junction 44 is unusual in that the eastbound entrance dives under the inside of the junction, effectively creating a &quot;right-turn&quot; on a roundabout. Similarly, slip roads pass under or over the main motorway at junctions 41 and 42.

There have been calls to close the slip roads at junctions 40 and 41 to improve traffic flow. The motorway has only two lanes on this stretch and is a major traffic congestion blackspot. The short slip roads have not been modernised. A small-scale trial of closing the westbound on-slip of junction 41 between 7Â am and 9Â am and from 4Â pm to 6Â pm on weekdays started on 4Â August 2014 but following heavy criticism from local businesses and residents, was stopped on 29 May 2015.

==Relief road==

On 5 June 2019, the Welsh Government scrapped the proposal for a proposed motorway south of Newport. The Welsh Assembly Government had revived the scheme as a tolled bypass in 2007 and later abandoned it for financial reasons. An extension to the Newport Southern Distributor Road through the old Corus steel works was considered. This road is already a dual carriageway. A public consultation exercise on options for improving the capacity of the M4 corridor around Newport opened on 5 March 2012. Its website states that: &quot;the motorway around Newport does not conform to today&#x27;s motorway standards. It lacks continuous hard shoulders, has closely spaced junctions with sub-standard slip road visibility and narrows to a restricted two lane section through the Brynglas Tunnels. Heavy congestion occurs along this stretch and either side of it at peak hours.&quot;

<text>El Tor is a particular strain of the bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, the causative agent of cholera. Also known as &quot;V. cholerae&quot; biotype eltor, it has been the dominant strain in the seventh global cholera pandemic. It is distinguished from the classic strain at a genetic level, although both are in the serogroup O1 and both contain Inaba, Ogawa and Hikojima serotypes. It is also distinguished from classic biotypes by the production of hemolysins.

==History==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Ottoman government established six medical stations along the coast of the Sinai Peninsula to cater to pilgrims returning from Mecca. One of them was in El Tor (A&#x27; Tur as it is called today). Sick passengers were dropped off in one of the stations for treatment. In 1905, Felix Gotschlich, a German physician at the El Tor station identified vibrios in stool specimen of two pilgrims returning from Mecca. Though the pilgrims failed to show ante or post mortem evidence of cholera, the vibrios isolated agglutinated with the anti-cholera serum. He did not think it was cholera, since it was hemolytic for human and animal red cells, while the true &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; is not.Â At that time, there was no cholera epidemic in Mecca or at the El Tor station, and the two pilgrims died from other causes. 

Later in 1905, Kraus and Pribram found that the bacteria, which produced soluble hemolysin, were more related to non-cholera vibrios; therefore, referred to all hemolytic vibrios as El Tor vibrios. In the early 1930s, A. Shousha, A. Gardner and K. Venkatraman, all researchers, suggested that only hemolytic vibrios agglutinated with anti-cholera serum should be referred to as El Tor vibrios. In 1959, R. Pollitzer designated El Tor as its own species &quot;V. eltor&quot; separate from &quot;V. cholerae&quot;, but six years later, in 1965, R. Hugh discovered that &quot;V. cholerae&quot; and &quot;V. eltor&quot; were similar in 30 positive and 20 negative characteristics. Thus, they were classified as a single species &quot;V. cholerae&quot;: however, Hugh believed the differing features between the two could be of epidemiological importance, so El Tor vibrios were further classified as &quot;V. cholerae&quot; biotype eltor (serogroup O1).

El Tor was identified again in an outbreak in 1937 but the pandemic did not arise until 1961 in Sulawesi. El Tor spread through Asia (Bangladesh in 1963, India in 1964) and then into the Middle East, Africa and Europe. From North Africa it spread into Italy by 1973. The extent of the pandemic has been due to the relative mildness (lower expression level) of El Tor, the disease has many more asymptomatic carriers than is usual, outnumbering active cases by up to 50:1. The outbreaks during this time frame are believed to be due to the rapid development of transportation and communication on an international level, as well as decreased sanitation levels in areas with increasing populations. In the late 1970s there were small outbreaks in Japan and in the South Pacific.

Molecular evidence, that is, a specific pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile, suggests that the distinct genotype of El Tor strain which appeared in Calcutta in 1993, may have spread to Africa. In the country of Guinea-Bissau, it was responsible for an epidemic that began in October 1994 and continued into 1996.

==Epidemiology==
An El Tor infection is relatively mild, or at least rarely fatal, and patients are asymptomatic for about a week. El Tor is able to survive in the body longer than classical cholera vibrios. This characteristic allows carriers to infect a greater population of people. In fact, &quot;V. cholerae&quot; biotype eltor can be isolated from water sources in the absence of an outbreak of cases. In extreme cases, persons can become long-term carriers; for example, Cholera Dolores, who tested vibrio positive nine years after her primary infection. El Tor is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. This route is the consequence of infected persons defecating near a water source, and uninfected persons consuming contaminated water. In addition, the bacteria can be transmitted by consuming uncooked food fertilized with human feces. Treatment of a cholera infection consists of replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes by intravenous or oral solutions, and by antibiotics. El Tor outbreaks can be prevented by better standards of sanitation, filtering and boiling water, thoroughly cooking seafood, and washing vegetables and fruits before consumption.

<text>Robert LeRoy Parker (April 13, 1866 â November 7, 1908), better known as Butch Cassidy, was an American train and bank robber and the leader of a gang of criminal outlaws known as the &quot;Wild Bunch&quot; in the Old West.

Parker engaged in criminal activity for more than a decade at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century, but the pressures of being pursued by law enforcement, notably the Pinkerton detective agency, forced him to flee the United States. He fled with his accomplice Harry Longabaugh, known as the &quot;Sundance Kid&quot;, and Longabaugh&#x27;s girlfriend Etta Place. The trio traveled first to Argentina and then to Bolivia, where Parker and Longabaugh are believed to have been killed in a shootout with the Bolivian Army in November 1908; the exact circumstances of their fate is unclear.

Parker&#x27;s life and death have been extensively dramatized in film, television and literature, and he remains one of the best-known icons of the &quot;Wild West&quot; mythos in modern times.

== Early life ==

Robert LeRoy Parker was born on April 13, 1866, in Beaver, Utah Territory, the first of thirteen children of English immigrants Maximillian Parker and Ann Campbell Gillies. The Parker and Gillies families had converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints while still living in the United Kingdom. Maximillian Parker was twelve years old when his family arrived in Salt Lake City in 1856 as Mormon pioneers. Ann Gillies was born and lived in Newcastle in northeast England before immigrating to the U.S. with her family in 1859 at age 14. The couple were married in July 1865.
Robert Parker grew up on his parents&#x27; ranch near Circleville.

Parker fled his home as a teenager and, while working on a dairy ranch, met cattle thief Mike Cassidy. He subsequently worked on several ranches, in addition to a brief apprenticeship with a butcher in Rock Springs, Wyoming Territory, where he got his nickname (by the word &quot;butcher&quot;, which morphed later into &quot;Butch&quot;), to which he soon added the last name Cassidy in honor of his old friend and mentor.

== Criminal career ==
Butch Cassidy&#x27;s first criminal offense was minor. Around 1880 he journeyed to a clothier shop in another town but found it closed. He broke into the shop and stole a pair of jeans and some pie, leaving an IOU promising to pay on his next visit. The clothier pressed charges, but Cassidy was acquitted by a jury. He continued to work on ranches until 1884, when he moved to Telluride, Colorado, ostensibly to seek work, but perhaps to deliver stolen horses to buyers. Cassidy led a cowboy&#x27;s life in Wyoming Territory and Montana Territory before returning to Telluride in 1887, where he met Matt Warner, the owner of a racehorse. Cassidy and Warner raced the horse at various events, dividing the winnings between them.

=== 1889â1895 ===

Cassidy&#x27;s first bank robbery took place on June 24, 1889, when he, Warner, and two of the McCarty brothers robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. Businessman L. L. Nunn had taken a controlling interest in the bank the previous year. The robbers stole around $21,000 (), after which they fled to the Robbers Roost, a remote hideout in the southeastern corner of Utah Territory.
In 1890, Cassidy purchased a ranch on the outskirts of Dubois, Wyoming. This location was across the state from the notorious Hole-in-the-Wall, a natural geological formation, and a popular hideout for outlaw gangs, including Cassidy&#x27;s, during the era. Cassidy&#x27;s ranching was possibly a faÃ§ade for clandestine activities, perhaps with Hole-in-the-Wall outlaws, as he was never financially successful at ranching. Cassidy&#x27;s ranch used the &quot;unmistakable brand&quot; of &quot;Reverse-E, Box, E&quot;.

In early 1894, Cassidy became involved romantically with rancher and outlaw Ann Bassett. Her father was a rancher who did business with Cassidy, supplying him with fresh horses and beef. That same year, Cassidy was arrested at Lander, Wyoming, for stealing horses and possibly for running a protection racket among the local ranchers there. He was imprisoned in the Wyoming State Prison in Laramie, where he served eighteen months of a two-year sentence; he was released and pardoned in January 1896 by Governor William Alford Richards. He became involved briefly with Bassett&#x27;s older sister Josie before returning to Ann.

=== Formation of the Wild Bunch ===
Cassidy associated with a wide circle of criminals, most notably his closest friend William Ellsworth &quot;Elzy&quot; Lay, Harvey &quot;Kid Curry&quot; Logan, Ben &quot;The Tall Texan&quot; Kilpatrick, Harry Tracy, Will &quot;News&quot; Carver, Laura Bullion and George &quot;Flat Nose&quot; Curry, who collectively became the so-called &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;. The gang assembled sometime after Cassidy&#x27;s release from prison in 1896 and took its name from the DoolinâDalton gang, also known as the &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;.
On August 13, 1896, Cassidy, Lay, Logan and Bob Meeks robbed the bank at Montpelier, Idaho, escaping with roughly $7,000. Cassidy recruited Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, also known as the &quot;Sundance Kid&quot;, into the gang soon after.

Bassett, Lay and Lay&#x27;s girlfriend Maude Davis all joined Cassidy at Robbers Roost in early 1897. The four hid there until early April, when Lay and Cassidy sent the women home so that the men could plan their next robbery. They ambushed a small group of men carrying the payroll of the Pleasant Valley Coal Company in the mining town of Castle Gate, Utah, on April 22, 1897, stealing a sack of silver coins, with which they fled back to the Robbers Roost.

On June 2, 1899, the gang robbed a Union Pacific &quot;Overland Flyer&quot; passenger train near Wilcox, Wyoming, a robbery that earned them a great deal of notoriety and resulted in a massive manhunt. Many notable lawmen took part in the hunt but did not find them. Kid Curry and George Curry had a shootout with lawmen following the train robbery, killing Sheriff Joe Hazen. Tom Horn, a killer-for-hire employed by the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, was told by explosives expert Bill Speck about the Hazen shooting. Pinkerton detective Charlie Siringo was then assigned the task of capturing the outlaws. He became friends with Elfie Landusky, who was using the last name Curry after becoming pregnant by Kid Curry&#x27;s brother Lonny Logan, and Siringo intended to locate the gang through her.

On July 11, 1899, Lay and others were involved in a Colorado and Southern Railroad train robbery near Folsom, New Mexico, which Cassidy might have planned and personally directed. A shootout ensued with local law enforcement, during which Lay killed Sheriff Edward Farr and Henry Love; Lay was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at the New Mexico State Penitentiary.

The Wild Bunch typically separated following a robbery and fled in different directions, later reuniting at a predetermined location such as the Hole-in-the-Wall, Robbers Roost, or Fannie Porter&#x27;s brothel in San Antonio.

=== 1899 plea for amnesty ===
Cassidy approached Utah Governor Heber Wells to negotiate an amnesty. Wells advised him to ask the Union Pacific Railroad to drop their criminal complaints against him, and Union Pacific chairman E. H. Harriman attempted to meet with Cassidy through Warner. On August 29, 1900, Cassidy, Longabaugh, and others robbed Union Pacific train No. 3 near Tipton, Wyoming, breaking Cassidy&#x27;s earlier promise to the governor of Wyoming and ending any chance for amnesty.

=== 1900â01 ===
On February 28, 1900, lawmen attempted to arrest Lonny Logan at his aunt&#x27;s home. Lonny was killed in the shootout that followed, and his cousin Bob Lee was arrested for rustling and sent to prison in Wyoming. On March 28, George Curry and News Carver were pursued by a posse from St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona, after using currency they had stolen in the Wilcox train robbery. The posse engaged them in a shootout, during which Deputies Andrew Gibbons and Frank LeSueur were killed, while Carver and Curry escaped. On April 17, George Curry was killed in a shootout with Grand County, Utah, Sheriff John Tyler and Deputy Sam Jenkins. On May 26, Kid Curry rode into Moab, Utah, and killed both Tyler and Jenkins in another shootout in retaliation for the deaths of George and Lonny.

In December, Cassidy posed alongside Longabaugh, Logan, Carver, and Ben Kilpatrick in Fort Worth, Texas, for the now-famous &quot;Fort Worth Five&quot; photograph. The Pinkerton Agency obtained a copy of the photograph and began to use it for wanted posters.

On July 3, 1901, Kid Curry and a group of men robbed a Great Northern train near Wagner, Montana, stealing more than $60,000 in cash (). The gang split up, but a posse led by Sheriff Elijah Briant caught up with News Carver and killed him. Kilpatrick was captured in St. Louis on November 5 at Josie Blakey&#x27;s resort on Chestnut Street. In his pocket, they found a key to a room at The Laclede Hotel. The next morning, they found Laura Bullion in the lobby, checking out with her luggage. In her valise was $8500 in unsigned banknotes from the Great Northern robbery. Curry killed Knoxville policemen William Dinwiddle and Robert Saylor in another shootout on December 13, then escaped. He returned to Montana, pursued by Pinkertons and other law enforcement officers, where he shot and killed rancher James Winters in retaliation for killing his brother Johnny years before.

== Escape to South America ==

Cassidy and Longabaugh fled to New York City, feeling continuous pressure from the numerous law enforcement agencies pursuing them and seeing their gang falling apart. They departed from there to Buenos Aires, Argentina, aboard the British steamer &quot;Herminius&quot; on February 20, 1901, along with Longabaugh&#x27;s companion Etta Place. Cassidy posed as James Ryan, Place&#x27;s fictitious brother. They settled in a four-room log cabin on a ranch that they purchased on the east bank of the Rio Blanco near Cholila, just east of the Andes in Chubut.

Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s &quot;In Patagonia&quot; references a letter Butch wrote from Cholila to Elza Lay&#x27;s mother-in-law in Utah, dated August 10, 1902. The letter cites &quot;our little family of 3&quot; living in a 4 room house with 300 cattle, 1500 sheep, and 28 horses. Chatwin states the letter resides with the Utah State Historical Society.

=== 1905 ===
Two English-speaking bandits held up the Banco de TarapacÃ¡ y Argentino in RÃ­o Gallegos on February 14, 1905, south of Cholila near the Strait of Magellan, and the pair vanished north across the Patagonian grasslands. Cassidy and Longabaugh sold the Cholila ranch on May 1, fearing that law enforcement had located them. The Pinkerton Agency had known their location for some time, but the snow and the hard winter of Patagonia had prevented their agent Frank Dimaio from making an arrest. Governor Julio Lezana issued an arrest warrant, but Sheriff Edward Humphreys, a Welsh-Argentine who was friendly with Cassidy and enamored of Place, tipped them off. The trio then fled north to San Carlos de Bariloche, where they embarked on the steamer &quot;Condor&quot; across Nahuel HuapÃ­ Lake by the end of the year. Cassidy, Longabaugh, Place, and an unknown male associate robbed the Banco de la NaciÃ³n Argentina branch in Villa Mercedes, San Luis Province on December 19, west of Buenos Aires, taking 12,000 pesos. They fled across the Andes to reach the safety of Chile.

On June 30, 1906, Place decided that she had enough of life on the run, so Longabaugh took her back to San Francisco. Cassidy obtained honest work under the alias James &quot;Santiago&quot; Maxwell at the Concordia Tin Mine in the Santa Vera Cruz range of the central Bolivian Andes, where Longabaugh joined him upon his return. Their main duties included guarding the company payroll. The two traveled to Santa Cruz in late 1907, a frontier town in Bolivia&#x27;s eastern savannah, still wanting to settle down as respectable ranchers.

=== Death ===
A courier was carrying the payroll for the Aramayo Franke and Cia Silver Mine on November 3, 1908, near the small mining town of San Vicente in southern Bolivia, when he was attacked by two masked American bandits believed to be Cassidy and Longabaugh. Witnesses saw them three days later in San Vicente, where they lodged in a small boarding house owned by miner Bonifacio Casasola. Casasola became suspicious of them because they had a mule from the Aramayo Mine, identifiable from the company&#x27;s brand. He notified a nearby telegraph officer, who notified the Abaroa cavalry regiment stationed nearby. The unit dispatched three soldiers under the command of Captain Justo Concha, and they notified the local authorities.

The soldiers, the police chief, the local mayor, and some of his officials all surrounded the lodging house on the evening of November 6, intending to arrest the Aramayo robbers. As they approached the house, the bandits opened fire, killing one of the soldiers and wounding another and starting a gunfight which lasted for several hours into the evening and the night. At around 2:00 am, during a lull in the fighting, the mayor heard a man scream three times inside the house, then two successive shots were fired from inside the house.

The authorities entered the house the next morning, where they found two bodies with numerous bullet wounds to the arms and legs. The man assumed to be Longabaugh had a bullet wound in the forehead, and the man thought to be Cassidy had a bullet hole in the temple. The local police report speculated that judging from the positions of the bodies, Cassidy had probably shot the fatally wounded Longabaugh to put him out of his misery, then killed himself with his final bullet. The Tupiza police identified the bandits as the men who robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities did not know their real names, nor could they positively identify them.

The two bodies were buried at the small San Vicente cemetery, near the grave of a German miner named Gustav Zimmer. American forensic anthropologist Clyde Snow and his researchers attempted to find the graves in 1991, but they did not find any remains with DNA matching the living relatives of Cassidy and Longabaugh. Snow&#x27;s search formed the basis of the British documentary &quot;Wanted - Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (Channel 4, April 22, 1993; later screened on &quot;Nova&quot;, October 12, 1993).

In 2017, a new search was launched for Cassidy&#x27;s grave, which zeroed in on a mine outside Goodsprings, Nevada. The dig found human remains, but they did not match the DNA provided.

=== Rumors of survival ===
John McPhee&#x27;s &quot;Annals of the Former World&quot; repeats a story that Dr. Francis Smith told to geologist David Love in the 1930s. Smith stated that he had seen Cassidy, who told him that his face had been altered by a surgeon in Paris, and he showed Smith an old bullet wound that Smith recognized as work that he had done.

Josie Bassett claimed in 1960 that Cassidy came to visit her in the 1920s &quot;after returning from South America,&quot; and that he &quot;died in Johnnie, Nevada about 15 years ago.&quot; Residents in Cassidy&#x27;s hometown of Circleville, Utah, claimed in an interview that he worked in Nevada until his death. Western historian Charles Kelly observed in his 1938 book &quot;The Outlaw Trail: A History of Butch Cassidy and His Wild Bunch&quot;, &quot;it seems exceedingly strange&quot; that Cassidy never returned to Circleville, Utah, to visit his father if he were still alive. According to his great nephew, Bill Betenson, he did return to Utah to visit his family in Circleville many times.

Bruce Chatwin, in his classic travel book &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, says, &quot;I went to see the star witness; his sister, Mrs. Lulu [sic] Parker Betenson, a forthright and energetic woman in her nineties ... She has no doubts: her brother came back and ate blueberry pie with family at Circleville in ... 1925. She believes he died of pneumonia in Washington in the late 1930s.&quot;

An episode of the television series &quot;In Search of...&quot; (1978) examined the claims and possible evidence for Cassidy&#x27;s return to America during the 1920s in a series of interviews with residents of Baggs, Wyoming, a popular destination for the Wild Bunch during their raiding years. Residents claimed that Cassidy had visited for several days in 1924, driving a Ford Model T. Lula Parker-Betenson stated that he returned to the family home in Circleville during this period, and picked up his brother Mark in a Ford, then drove to their father&#x27;s home, where she also lived. Her father allegedly said to her, &quot;I&#x27;ll bet you don&#x27;t know who this is. This is your brother Robert LeRoy.&quot; She stated that Cassidy was full of regrets, particularly at having disappointed his mother. She quoted him lamenting, &quot;all I did is make a wreck of my life.&quot; Betenson claims that Cassidy lived out his years in &quot;the Northwest&quot; and died in 1937 and that the family had agreed not to disclose his final resting place, since &quot;they had chased him all his life, and now he&#x27;s going to rest in peace.&quot; This story is also recounted by W. C. Jameson in &quot;Butch Cassidy: Beyond the Grave&quot;, referencing the 1975 book Betenson co-authored with Dora Flack, &quot;Butch Cassidy, My Brother&quot;.

On an episode of the series &quot;Mission Declassified&quot; (2019), investigative journalist Christof Putzel met with local researcher Marilyn Grace at Cassidy&#x27;s childhood log cabin on the Parker ranch in Circleville to talk about the alleged burial of Cassidy there on July 20, 1937. Grace explains that Cassidy was secretly buried at Tom&#x27;s Cabin, a former sheepherders&#x27; log cabin located in a remote area of the property, a favorite camping spot for his brothers and him. Grace says an eyewitness, neighbor Dee Crosby, saw the burial take place at the cabin. Earlier, Putzel spoke to Alta Orton, another Parker neighbor, who described the family as having been dressed in funeral-like attire on that same day. Grace goes on to say that cadaver dogs had been brought to the cabin in an attempt to locate remains and led to a positive indication. The underside of the cabin was later dug and two bones discovered, identified as a human spinal bone and a toe bone. Putzel had forensic scientist Suzanna Ryan at Pure Gold Forensics in Redlands, California, conduct a DNA test on the bones. Ryan confirmed they were human, but lacked enough DNA for a complete profile. As the site may have become public knowledge, the Parker family is believed to have since excavated Cassidy&#x27;s remains at the cabin and moved them to a different burial site, leaving the spinal and toe bones behind in the process.

William T. Phillips claimed to have known Cassidy since childhood. In his book &quot;In Search of Butch Cassidy&quot;, Larry Pointer speculated that Phillips was actually Cassidy, based upon stories in Phillips&#x27;s unpublished manuscript, &quot;The Bandit Invincible,&quot; and a resemblance between the two men. In 2012, though, Pointer obtained a copy of the Wyoming Territorial Prison mugshot of William T. Wilcox, a previously unknown associate of Cassidy&#x27;s. Observing the similarities between the two men, he revised his previous theory and concluded that Phillips was Wilcox, and not Cassidy.

<text>Buckingham ( ) is a market town in north Buckinghamshire, England, close to the borders of Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire, which had a population of 12,890 at the 2011 Census. The town lies approximately west of Central Milton Keynes, south-east of Banbury, and north-east of Oxford.

Buckingham was the county town of Buckinghamshire from the 10th century, when it was made the capital of the newly formed shire of Buckingham, until Aylesbury took over this role in the 18th century.

Buckingham has a variety of restaurants and pubs, typical of a market town. It has a number of local shops, both national and independent. Market days are Tuesday and Saturday which take over Market Hill and the High Street cattle pens. Buckingham is twinned with Neukirchen-Vluyn, Germany and Mouvaux, France.

== History ==
Buckingham and the surrounding area has been settled for some time with evidence of Roman settlement found in several sites close to the River Great Ouse, including a temple south of the A421 at Bourton Grounds which was excavated in the 1960s and dated to the 3rd century AD. A possible Roman building was identified at Castle Fields in the 19th century. Pottery, kiln furniture and areas of burning found at Buckingham industrial estate suggest it was the site of some early Roman pottery kilns.

In the 7th century, Buckingham (literally &quot;hemmed in land of Bucca&#x27;s people&quot;) is said to have been founded by Bucca, the leader of the first Anglo Saxon settlers. The first settlement was located around the top of a loop in the River Great Ouse, presently the Hunter Street campus of the University of Buckingham. Between the 7th century and the 11th century, the town of Buckingham regularly changed hands between the Saxons and the Danes, in particular, in 914 King Edward the Elder and a Saxon army encamped in Buckingham for four weeks forcing local Danish Viking leaders to surrender. Subsequently, a fort was constructed at the location of the present Buckingham parish church. Buckingham is mentioned in the Burghal Hidage, a document commonly ascribed to the early tenth century, but more probably of the period 878â9, which describes a system of forts set up by King Alfred (d.899) over the whole of the West Saxon kingdom. When King Edward encamped at Buckingham with his army in 914, he was therefore restoring a fort which had already existed for more than a generation. This tactical move was part of a &quot;putsch&quot; against the Danish Vikings who controlled what had been southern Mercia, and which involved the taking of control of Viking centres at Bedford, Northampton, Cambridge and eventually the whole of East Anglia by the end of 917.

Buckingham is the first settlement referred to in the Buckinghamshire section of the Domesday Book of 1086. Buckingham was referred to as Buckingham with Bourton, and the survey makes reference to 26 burgesses, 11 smallholders and 1 mill.

The town received its charter in 1554 when Queen Mary created the free Borough of Buckingham with boundaries extending from Thornborowe Bridge (now Thornborough) to Dudley Bridge and from Chackmore Bridge to Padbury Mill Bridge. The designated borough included a bailiff, twelve principal burgesses and a steward. Yeomanry House, the offices and home of the commanding officer of the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, was built in the early 19th century.

The town suffered a significant fire that raged through the town centre on 15 March 1725, with the result that many streets of the town were destroyed including Castle Street, Castle Hill and the north side of Market Hill. The result was 138 dwellings (out of a total of 387 in the town at that time) being consumed in the fire. The current Georgian architecture on these streets today is a consequence of the fire, but the immediate aftermath was difficult for the town. Collections were made in surrounding towns such as Aylesbury and Wendover to help those made homeless, by 1730, only a third of the homes had been rebuilt. Due to many buildings being considered to be of historic interest, a number of them have been granted &#x27;listed building&#x27; status. These include the Grade I listed Castle House on West Street, which dates back to the 15th century. Buckingham Town Hall, which is Grade II* listed, dates to the late 18th century.

The town was connected to the London and North Western Railway by the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1850.

The municipal borough had a population of 1,816 in 1841.

In 1971, Buckinghamshire County Council set up the Buckingham Development Company with other local councils, and undertook a significant project to grow the town and provide a bypass, mainly to the south and east of the historic town centre. The population rose from just over 5,000 to 9,309 in 1991.

=== Saint Rumbold ===

The town is said to be the final resting place of St Rumbold (also known as Saint Rumwold), a little-known Saxon saint. He is now most often referred to as St Rumbold,
the latter being the most common, as it can be found being used on a local road name and recent booklets about the subject.

== Geography ==

The town is centred on the historic market place and contains many 18th century buildings. There are three main roads crossing Buckingham, namely the A413, the A421 (the southern bypass) and the A422. Capability Brown&#x27;s historic formal garden design at Stowe (on the A422 westbound) is an important attraction in the care of the National Trust.

There is a medieval well known as St Rumbold&#x27;s Well on the south side of the dismantled railway which borders the town. The well, which is now dry for much of the year, was positioned to exploit the spring line below the crest of a north facing slope overlooking the town.

Suburbs of Buckingham include Mount Pleasant, Page Hill, Bourton, Badgers, Linden Village, Castle Fields, Tingewick Road Estate and Lace Hill. Maids Moreton, a village on the north eastern borders of the town has become contiguous with the Buckingham urban area. Nearby (10 miles radius) settlements include Winslow, Bicester, Brackley, Milton Keynes and Silverstone. Local villages in the immediate vicinity include Padbury and Gawcott to the south, Chackmore to the north and Shalstone to the north west. It is also very near Stowe, the location of Stowe House, Stowe Gardens and Stowe School.

There is a degree confluence point on the edge of the town, at exactly .

=== Bourton ===
Bourton was a hamlet in the parish of Buckingham. The hamlet name is Old English in origin, and means &#x27;fortified enclosure&#x27;. It is now an integral part of the town of Buckingham, with a road and old mill named Bourton still visible to visitors.

Bourton was once the location of a great house that belonged to the Minshull family. In the English Civil War the house was plundered by Parliamentarian forces. The house has long since disappeared.

===Population===
At the 2011 Census, the population of the Buckingham built-up area, which includes Maids Moreton but excludes Lace Hill, was 12,890. The population of the Buckingham civil parish (which excludes Maids Moreton but includes Lace Hill) was 12,043. The town has continued to grow since 2011 and thus the figures at the prospective 2021 Census are expected to be significantly greater. , the Town Council estimates the population of its civil parish at 15,700.

== Education ==
The town is home to the University of Buckingham, the oldest of the UK&#x27;s six private universities. Like other UK universities, a large proportion of its students are from overseas.

The Buckinghamshire Council operates the Tripartite System of state secondary education. The local state secondary schools are the Royal Latin School (a Grammar School) and the Buckingham School (a secondary modern). Stowe School and Akeley Wood School, just outside the town, are private schools.

There are four primary schools, one a community school and the other three academies, serving different areas of the town: Buckingham Primary School is the community primary, and the three academies (Bourton Meadow Academy, George Grenville Academy and Lace Hill Academy) are all operated by Campfire Education Trust.

== Industry and business ==
The town is home to a number of industrial estates and technology parks housing high tech companies in the pharmaceutical, electronic, foods and composite materials fields, including Racelogic and Wipac.

Buckingham was home to the Thomas Rickett steam car, an innovative vehicle from 1860, though considered ahead of its time and only two are thought to have been made.

Most retail is located in the town centre with a variety of independent stores, cafes and restaurants as well as national chains. The Hidden Quarter, located mainly in Well Street and Bridge Street, hosts a number of independent retailers selling everything from handmade home wares to retro wooden toys. Currently, there are two banks in the town centre - Barclays and Lloyds.

=== Town markets ===

Buckingham&#x27;s historic street market has been in the town for over 600 years and dates from the Charters granted by Queen Mary in 1554 and Charles II in 1664, giving the markets a unique heritage.

Street markets are held every Tuesday and Saturday. Regular and casual market traders offer a wide variety of products, including fish, fruit and veg, award-winning bread, household goods, tools, flowers and clothes. There is a flea market held every Saturday on the site of the town&#x27;s former cattle pens, offering a wide selection of antiques, collectables and jewellery.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government in Buckingham, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Buckingham Town Council and Buckinghamshire Council. The town council is based at the Buckingham Centre on Verney Close in the town.
Historically, Buckingham was an ancient borough, and it became a municipal borough in 1836. Buckingham Borough Council was based at Buckingham Town Hall until 1965, when it moved to Castle House on West Street. The borough was abolished in 1974 to become part of Aylesbury Vale district, with Buckingham Town Council being established as a successor parish covering the former borough. Aylesbury Vale District Council in turn was abolished in 2020, merging with Buckinghamshire County Council and the county&#x27;s other districts to become Buckinghamshire Council.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Buckingham stands at the crossroads of the A413 (north-south), A421 and A422 (east-west) roads. The town was by-passed in the early 1980s by creating a new section of the A421 to the south.

=== Bus ===
Buckingham is linked to Milton Keynes, Winslow and Aylesbury by the regular X60 bus. An inter-city coach service, the X5, links the town to both Bedford (via Milton Keynes) and Oxford (via Bicester). Some surrounding villages are connected to Buckingham by a market day bus and there is a community bus scheme called Bart.

=== Canal ===
Buckingham was served by the Buckingham Arm of the Grand Junction Canal from 1801 until the end of the 19th century. In 1928, the Grand Junction Canal Company offered to re-open the canal if a minimum income of tolls could be guaranteed, but this was not forthcoming, with only occasional use reported up to 1932, and the canal was finally abandoned in 1964. The canal ran from Cosgrove, Northamptonshire to the centre of Buckingham to a wharf. A short section of the canal to the east of the town has now been restored.

=== Rail ===
Buckingham had a railway station on the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line, which opened in 1850 and closed to passengers in 1964 and freight in 1966. Finmere railway station on the Great Central Main Line was originally called &quot;Finmere for Buckingham&quot; when it opened in 1899, despite being from Buckingham. Finmere station dropped the &quot;for Buckingham&quot; from its name in the early 1920s, and closed in 1963. The closest stations to Buckingham are now Wolverton and Milton Keynes Central to the east and Bicester North and Bicester Village to the south west. The new East West rail link will have a stop at nearby Winslow, scheduled to start running by the end of 2025.

There are two local football teams, and a rugby union club including teams for women and young women. These are Buckingham Athletic F.C. based at Stratford Fields, Buckingham United F.C based at Lace Hill and Buckingham RUFC based at Floyd Field, Maids Moreton. Moretonville Junior Football Club also has boys and girls teams from u7s â u16s. The town used to be home to Buckingham Town F.C. founded in 1883 until their relocation to Fenny Stratford in 2019; they played at Ford Meadow from 1883 until being evicted in 2011.

The town also has the Buckingham Town Cricket Club, based at Bourton Road and the Buckingham Hockey Club which plays at Stowe School. Since 2014, Buckingham has been host to a weekly Parkrun.

The town has several public sports facilities including the Swan Leisure Centre with an indoor swimming pool, climbing wall, an all weather sports pitch, squash courts. There are two bowls pitch and tennis courts managed by clubs and several private golf clubs in the vicinity of the town.

The Chandos Cinema was in operation from 1934 and closed in 1987, but in 2005 an independent community cinema opened in the university called the Film Place. Live music events are regularly held in the Radcliffe Centre.

A library is located in the town centre, operated by Buckinghamshire County Council.

The town is home to numerous clubs and associations including the Buckingham Society, a civic amenity society linked with Civic Voice, a large U3A with over 900 members, and many music, photography and arts clubs.

The town holds an annual Charter Fair. It is held in October over two successive Saturdays starting on the first Saturday after the 11th of the month. During the 19th century it was called the Statute Fair. The public roasting of an ox, sheep and pig often took place at the same time.

<text>Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.
Colorectal cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine whether the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening, by one of several methods, is recommended starting from ages 45 to 75. It was recommended starting at age 50 but it was changed to 45 due to increasing numbers of colon cancers. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.
Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014. The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person&#x27;s overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases. In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease. It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found. It is less common in women than men.
==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old. Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.

Rectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50. Weight loss and changes in a person&#x27;s bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.

==Cause==
75â95% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male sex, high intake of fat, sugar, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. The Rectal Cancer Survival Calculator developed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center additionally considers race to be a risk factor; however, there are equity issues concerning whether this might lead to inequity in clinical decision making. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking five glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps. The consumption of dairy products, such as milk, is protective against colorectal cancer. &quot;Streptococcus gallolyticus&quot; is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of &quot;Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus&quot; complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with &quot;Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus&quot; bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of &quot;Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus&quot; is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high-risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to &quot;Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus&quot; antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.

Pathogenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite, colibactin.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
People with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease) are at increased risk of colon cancer. The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation. In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended. Endoscopic surveillance in this high-risk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer. People with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly. In those with Crohn&#x27;s disease (with colonic involvement), 2% get colorectal cancer after 10Â years, 8% after 20Â years, and 18% afterÂ 30 years. In people who have ulcerative colitis, approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30Â years.

===Genetics===
Those with a family history in two or more first-degree relatives (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease, and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. Several genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, the removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains. The most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome, which is associated with a 25-40% risk of CRC.

Mutations in the pair of genes (POLE and POLD1) have been associated with familial colon cancer.

Most deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease. A gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (&quot;MACC1&quot;), has been isolated. It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion, and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.

Epigenetic factors, such as abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters, play a role in the development of colorectal cancer.

Ashkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the APC gene being more common.

==Pathogenesis==
Colorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of genetic mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increases signaling activity. The Wnt signaling pathway normally plays an important role for normal function of these cells including maintaining this lining. Mutations can be inherited or acquired, and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell. The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the &quot;APC&quot; gene, which produces the APC protein. The APC protein prevents the accumulation of Î²-catenin protein. Without APC, Î²-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer. While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased Î²-catenin because of mutations in Î²-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.

Beyond the defects in the Wnt signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The p53 protein, produced by the &quot;TP53&quot; gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the &quot;TP53&quot; gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is mutated instead.

Other proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are TGF-Î² and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). TGF-Î² has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-Î² is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named SMAD is deactivated. DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.

Approximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer. Some genes are oncogenes: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins KRAS, RAF, and PI3K, which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion. PTEN, a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.

Comprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types. In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated CTNNB1, FAM123B, SOX9, ATM, and ARID1A. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of ACVR2A, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9, TCF7L2, and BRAF. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in Wnt and TGF-Î² signaling pathways, which results in increased activity of MYC, a central player in colorectal cancer.

Mismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high number of poly-nucleotide tandem repeats. This is caused by a deficiency in MMR proteins â which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Lynch syndrome). 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have MMR deficiencies, with 3 percent developing due to Lynch syndrome. The role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells (&quot;i.e.&quot;, error detecting and correcting). Consequently, a deficiency in MMR proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage, allowing for further cancer-causing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress.

The polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. In this adenoma-carcinoma sequence, normal epithelial cells progress to dysplastic cells such as adenomas, and then to carcinoma, by a process of progressive genetic mutation. Central to the polyp to CRC sequence are gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, and local inflammatory changes. The polyp to CRC sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes.

===Field defects===
The term &quot;field cancerization&quot; was first used in 1953 to describe an area or &quot;field&quot; of epithelium that has been preconditioned (by what were largely unknown processes at the time) to predispose it towards the development of cancer. Since then, the terms &quot;field cancerization&quot;, &quot;field carcinogenesis&quot;, &quot;field defect&quot;, and &quot;field effect&quot; have been used to describe pre-malignant or pre-neoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.

Field defects are important in the progression of colon cancer.

However, as pointed out by Rubin, &quot;The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors &quot;in vivo&quot;, or on discrete neoplastic foci &quot;in vitro&quot;. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.&quot; Similarly, Vogelstein et al. pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.

An expanded view of field effect has been termed &quot;etiologic field effect&quot;, which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death.

===Epigenetics===
Epigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic (mutational) alterations. As described by Vogelstein et al., an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations (together designated &quot;driver mutations&quot;), with about 60 further &quot;passenger&quot; mutations. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under Pathogenesis.

In addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of miRNAs, other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands of protein-encoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression. As an example, 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein-coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers, and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers. In addition, 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of miRNAs were also associated with colorectal cancers. Abnormal (aberrant) methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older. The source and trigger of this age-related methylation is unknown. Approximately half of the genes that show age-related methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer. These findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

Epigenetic reductions of DNA repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer. As summarized in the articles Carcinogenesis and Neoplasm, for sporadic cancers in general, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.

Epigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a person&#x27;s response to chemotherapy.

===Genomics and epigenomics===

Consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015. CMS classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for CRC that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.

A novel Epigenome-based Classification (EpiC) of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with CRC. Chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify EpiC subtypes. A combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and EpiCs could significantly enhance current treatment strategies.

==Diagnosis==

Colorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion.

===Medical imaging===
A colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on CT scan.

The presence of metastases is determined by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other potential imaging tests such as PET and MRI may be used in certain cases. MRI is particularly useful to determine the local stage of the tumor and to plan the optimal surgical approach.

MRI is also performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to identify patients who achieve a complete response. Patients with a complete response on both MRI and endoscopy may not require surgical resection and can avoid unnecessary surgical morbidity and complications. Patients selected for non-surgical treatment of rectal cancer should have periodic MRI scans, receive physical examinations, and undergo endoscopy procedures to detect any tumor re-growth which can occur in a minority of these patients. When local recurrence occurs, periodic follow-up can detect it when it is still small and curable with salvage surgery. In addition, MRI tumor regression grades can be assigned after chemoradiotherapy which correlate with patients&#x27; long-term survival outcomes.

===Histopathology===

The histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95% and 98% of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous, and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes are more aggressive. Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.

===Staging===

Staging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings. As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs. The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.

==Prevention==
It has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable. Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol consumption decrease the risk.

===Lifestyle===
Lifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity. The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.
Current research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease. Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large-scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions will have significant protective effects. In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that &quot;There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.&quot;

Consuming alcoholic drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

The 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that dietary fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but that most studies at the time had not yet studied the correlation. A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains. The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as &quot;probable&quot; as of 2017. A 2022 umbrella review says there is &quot;convincing evidence&quot; for that association.
Higher physical activity is recommended. Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. Regular exercise does not negate the risk but does lower it.

===Medication and supplements===
Aspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk. Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer. It is not recommended in those at average risk.

There is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is insufficient to make a recommendation.

Adequate Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.

===Screening===
As more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and prevention. Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2â3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms. Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.

The three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.

Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical. If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. When done once every 1â2 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality. Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing. However, research in the UK has found that for these immunochemical tests, the threshold for further investigation is set at a point that may miss more than half of bowel cancer cases. The research suggests that the NHS England&#x27;s Bowel Cancer Screening Programme could make better use of the test&#x27;s ability to provide the exact concentration of blood in faeces (rather than only whether it is above or below a cutoff level).

Other options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can. Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects. Further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a three-year screening interval is correct.

====Recommendations====
In the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 and 75Â years. The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45. For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized. For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.

Several screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years. It is unclear which of these two methods is better. Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications. For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy. For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10Â years, screening is not recommended. It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit. The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.

In Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. Colonoscopy is less preferred.

Some countries have national colorectal screening programs that offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 and 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

The UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme aims to find warning signs in people aged 60 to 74, by recommending a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every two years. FIT measures blood in faeces, and people with levels above a certain threshold may have bowel tissue examined for signs of cancer. Growths having cancerous potential are removed.

==Treatment==
The treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person&#x27;s health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor. Assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not. When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.

===Surgery===

At an early stage, colorectal cancer may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. Endoscopic resection is possible if there is a low possibility of lymph node metastasis and the size and location of the tumor make en bloc resection possible. For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes. This can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors. The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.

If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs. For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer.

===Chemotherapy===
In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in the management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.

In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion, or inadequate lymph node sampling are identified. It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For Stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.

If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with Stage III and Stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used. Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT. The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI. Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the three FDA approved ones are aflibercept, cetuximab and panitumumab.

The primary difference in the approach to low-stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low-lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similarly to Stage IV colon cancer.

Stage IV colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery, in some people. Also, T4 colorectal cancer can be treated with HIPEC to avoid future relapses.

===Radiation therapy===
While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer, for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence. For squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal, chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with 5-FU and mitomycin C is preferred over radiation alone, offering improved survival outcomes but with increased risks of acute hematological toxicity. 

The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation. Radiation therapy&#x27;s side effects (and occurrence rates) include acute (27%) and late (17%) dermatological toxicities, acute (14%) and late (27%) gastrointestinal toxicities, and late pelvic radiation disease (1-10%), e.g., irreversible lumbosacral plexopathy.

As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer. This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment. Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.

=== Immunotherapy ===
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability. Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments. Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.

On the other hand, in a prospective phase 2 study published in June 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine, 12 patients with Deficient Mismatch Repair () stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were administered single-agent dostarlimab, an antiâPD-1 monoclonal antibody, every three weeks for six months. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6 to 25 months), all 12 patients had a complete clinical response with no evidence of tumor on MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucoseâpositron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. Moreover, no patient in the trial needed chemoradiotherapy or surgery, and no patient reported adverse events of grade 3 or higher. However, although the results of this study are promising, the study is small and has uncertainties about long-term outcomes.

===Palliative care===
Palliative care can be used at the same time as the cancer treatment and is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms. Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.

In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain, and intestinal obstruction. Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.

=== Psychosocial Intervention ===
In addition to medical intervention, a variety of psychosocial interventions have been implemented to address psychosocial concerns in the context of colorectal cancer. Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with CRC, therefore psychosocial interventions can help alleviate psychological distress. Many patients continue to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression following treatment, regardless of treatment outcome. Societal stigmas associated with colorectal cancer present further psychosocial challenges for CRC patients and their families.

==== Depression and Anxiety ====
Colorectal cancer patients have a 51% higher risk of experiencing depression than individuals without the disease. Additionally, CRC patients are at high risk of experiencing severe anxiety, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, and social anxiety.

==== Post-Treatment Distress ====
Regardless of treatment outcome, many CRC patients experience ongoing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and distress.

Survivorship of CRC can involve significant lifestyle adjustments. Postoperative afflictions may include stomas, bowel issues, incontinence, odor, and changes to sexual functioning. These changes can result in distorted body image, social anxiety, depression, and distressâall of which contribute to a poorer quality of life.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Transitioning into palliative care and contending with mortality can be a deeply distressing experience for a CRC patient and their loved ones.

==== Stigma ====
Colorectal cancer is highly stigmatized and can elicit feelings of disgust from patients, healthcare professionals, families, intimate partners, and the general public. Patients with stomas are especially vulnerable to stigmatization due to unavoidable odors, gas, and unpleasant noises from stoma bags. Additionally, associated CRC risk factors like poor diet, alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity prompt negative assumptions of blame and personal responsibility onto CRC patients. Judgement from others along with internalized self-blame and embarrassment can negatively affect self-esteem, sociability, and quality of life.

==== Methods of Intervention ====
Face-to-face interventions such as clinician-patient talk therapy, body-mind-spirit practices, and support group sessions have been identified as most effective in reducing anxiety and depression in CRC patients. Additionally, journaling exercises and over-the-phone talk therapy sessions have been implemented. Though deemed less effective, these non-face-to-face interventions are economically inclusive and have been found to reduce both depression and anxiety in CRC patients.

===Follow-up===

The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer. A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp &gt;1 centimeter or high-grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.

Routine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.

For people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.

===Exercise===
Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy for cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers. People with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (Î²-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in people with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for the benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormones and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers.

Another potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.

Physical activity provides benefits to people with non-advanced colorectal cancer. Improvements in aerobic fitness, cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life have been reported in the short term. However, these improvements were not observed at the level of disease-related mental health, such as anxiety and depression.

==Prognosis==
Fewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example the heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1A), and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the putative RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3). The prognosis is also correlated with a poor fidelity of the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus, and thus a high number of deviating alternative splicing.

===Recurrence rates===

The average five-year recurrence rate in people with &quot;colon cancer&quot; where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II, and 33% in stage III. However, depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 9â22% in stage II and 17â44% in stage III. The average five-year recurrence rate in people with &quot;rectal cancer&quot; where surgery is successful is 9% for stage 0 (after pre-treatment) cancers, 8% for stage I cancers, 18% in stage II and 34% in stage III. Depending on the number of risk factors (0-2) the risk for distant metastasis in &quot;rectal cancer&quot; ranges from 4-11% in stage 0, 6-12% in stage I, 11-28% in stage II, and 15-43% in stage III.

The recurrence rates have decreased over the past decades as a result of improvements in the colorectal cancer management. The risk of recurrence after five years of surveillance remain very low.

===Survival rates===
In Europe, the five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it.

Survival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early-stage detection are about five times that of late-stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. People with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have a poor prognosis and the five-year survival ranges from &lt;5 percent to 31 percent.

Five-year overall survival (OS) in rectal cancer after modern preoperative treatment and surgery was 90% for stage 0, 86% for stage I, 78% for stage II, and 67% for stage III according to a nationwide, population-based study.

Whilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment. For example, it is common for people to experience incontinence, sexual dysfunction, problems with stoma care and fear of cancer recurrence after primary treatment has concluded.

A qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer: support mechanisms, severity of late effects of treatment, and psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, people must be offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Globally more than 1Â million people get colorectal cancer every year resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990.

, it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%) with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer. It is more common in developed than developing countries. Global incidence varies 10-fold, with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia.

===United States===
In 2022, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States was anticipated to be about 151,000 adults, including over 106,000 new cases of colon cancer (some 54,000 men and 52,000 women) and about 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer. Since the 1980s, the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased, dropping by about 2% annually from 2014 to 2018 in adults aged 50 and older, due mainly to improved screening. However, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased in individuals aged 25 to 50. In early 2023, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that 20% of diagnoses (of colon cancer) in 2019 were in patients under age 55, which is about double the rate in 1995, and rates of advanced disease increased by about 3% annually in people younger than 50. It predicted that, in 2023, an estimated 19,550 diagnoses and 3,750 deaths would be in people younger than 50. Colorectal cancer also disproportionately affects the Black community, where the rates are the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups. Black Americans often experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survival, including systemic racial disparities that are complex and go beyond the obvious connection to cancer.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.

=== Australia ===
One in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer compared to lung, stomach, liver, or breast cancer. It is estimated that 8 in 100,000 people are likely to develop colorectal cancer every year, while 24 in 100,000 women are likely to develop breast cancer.

== Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCC) ==
A diagnosis of colorectal cancer in patients under 50 years of age is referred to as early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCC). Instances of EOCC have increased over the last decade, specifically in patient populations aged 20 to 40 years old throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and China.

=== Incidence by age ===
The incidence of colorectal cancer in younger populations has increased over the last decade. While advancements in the diagnostic procedure may have some impact, reduced likelihood of screening among these populations suggests detection bias is not a major contributor to this trend. It is more likely that cohort effects are contributing.

The population experiencing the greatest rise in EOCC cases are men and women aged 20 to 29 years old, with incidence increasing by 7.9% per year between 2004 and 2016. Similarly, though less severe, men and women aged 30 to 39 experienced an increase in cases at a rate of 3.4% per year during that same period. Despite these increases, the mortality rate for colorectal cancer has remained the same.

=== Risk factors ===
Risk factors associated with EOCC are akin to those of all colorectal cancer cases. Observed cohort effects are likely the product of generational shifts in lifestyle and environmental factors.

=== Preventative screening ===
In 2018, the American Cancer Society modified their previous screening guideline for colorectal cancer from age 50 down to age 45 following the recognition of increasing cases of EOCC. Individuals under the age of 60 have been identified as most susceptible to non-participation in colorectal cancer screening.

==History==

Rectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.

==Society and culture==

In the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.

==Research==

Preliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.

<text>Maids Moreton is a village and civil parish in north-west Buckinghamshire, England, around north of Buckingham. The village sits on top of a plateau overlooking Buckingham and is less than 1km away from the Foxcote Reservoir SSSI.

==Description and history==
The parish of Maids Moreton covers about of which are arable, permanent grass and woods and plantations. The soil is mostly clay and gravel and the subsoil gravel.

The village lies along the Buckingham to Towcester road (A413). It contains many 17th-century houses and cottages with timber frames with brick or plaster filling and thatched roofs.

The 15th-century parish church of Saint Edmund is said to have been built by two maiden ladies of the Pever family hence the name &quot;Maids&#x27; Moreton&quot;. The Maids&#x27; memorials are a wall painting over the north door and brasses on a slab just within the doorway.

The old post office, situated at the junction of Main Street with the A413, closed in the mid-1990s and is now a private house. The chapel (on the A413) was demolished in the early 1980s and the allotments next to the chapel were all used for new housing.

The village of Maids Moreton is currently fighting two greenfield planning applications to build 163 and 15 houses increasing the village size by 50%. David Wilson Homes a subsidiary of Barrett Developments are looking to build 163 houses in planning application 16/00151/AOP which was challenged at Judicial Review in 2022. Buckinghamshire Council successfully defended that legal challenge. The planning application is notable for having seven different sets of Biodiversity Net Gain figures. The village produced two documentary films covering the history of the fight which are viewable at maidsmoretonmatters.org

In October 2019, Ben Field was jailed for the murder of Maids Moreton resident Peter Farquhar in 2015. Field was also accused of attempted murder of another Maids Moreton resident, Ann Moore-Martin, but was found not guilty. The case was the centre of the 2023 BBC drama &quot;The Sixth Commandment&quot;.

==School==
Maids Moreton Church of England School is a mixed Church of England voluntary controlled primary school in Maids Moreton. The school takes children between the ages of four and seven and has about 50 pupils.

<text>The A413 is a major road in England that runs between Denham (west of London) to Towcester (northwest of Milton Keynes). It passes through or near various towns and villages including (in northbound order) Gerrards Cross, Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Amersham, Little Missenden, Great Missenden, Wendover, Aylesbury, Winslow, and Buckingham. Most of the road is in Buckinghamshire, with a part at the north end in Northamptonshire.

In the 1960s, a by-pass was built around Great Missenden and re-routing has taken place through Aylesbury town centre. In recent years , by-passes have been built for Amersham (1987) and Wendover (1998). In the early 21st century, the junction near Towcester where the A413 joins the A43 has also been redeveloped along with much-needed A43 redevelopment around Silverstone Circuit.

That part of the route which runs along the Misbourne Valley dates back into pre-history. In medieval times, the Cartulary of Missenden Abbey simply recorded the road as &quot;the Kings Highway&quot;. Also just north of Aylesbury the road crosses Holman&#x27;s Bridge, the location in 1642 of the Battle of Aylesbury.

The section of the A413 between Aylesbury and Winslow is known locally for its high accident rate. A number of signs have been put up along this stretch of road stating how many casualties have occurred on the road in recent years. The stretch has a high number of blind turnings, sudden speed limits and steep gradients. The worst accident to occur in recent years was in 2003 when a lorry crashed through the side of a bridge just south of the hamlet of Hardwick. The road was closed completely for two days resulting in all bus services being diverted onto the A418 or A41.

==In popular culture==
Aylesbury rockstar John Otway wrote a B-Side about the road on his Number 9 hit single &quot;Bunsen Burner.&quot; The song was called &quot;A413 Revisited&quot; and is about John returning home no longer as a one hit wonder but as a two hit artist. The chorus is:
:&quot;From Amersham, to Missenden,
:to Wendover to the Vale of Aylesbury,
:that&#x27;s me heading down the 4-1-3&quot;
::and features places located on the road such as The Grange School in Aylesbury.

<text>Likud (, ), officially known as Likud â National Liberal Movement (), is a major right-wing political party in Israel. It was founded in 1973 by Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon in an alliance with several right-wing parties. Likud&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1977 elections was a major turning point in the country&#x27;s political history, marking the first time the left had lost power. In addition, it was the first time in Israel that a right-wing party received the most votes. After ruling the country for most of the 1980s, the party lost the Knesset election in 1992. Likud&#x27;s candidate Benjamin Netanyahu won the vote for prime minister in 1996 and was given the task of forming a government after the 1996 elections following Yitzak Rabin&#x27;s assassination. Netanyahu&#x27;s government fell apart after a vote of no confidence, which led to elections being called in 1999 and Likud losing power to the One Israel coalition led by Ehud Barak.

In 2001 Likud&#x27;s Ariel Sharon, who replaced Netanyahu following the 1999 election, defeated Barak in an election called by the prime minister following his resignation. After the party recorded a convincing win in the 2003 elections, Likud saw a major split in 2005 when Sharon left to form the Kadima party. This resulted in Likud slumping to fourth place in the 2006 elections and losing 28 seats in the Knesset. Following the 2009 elections, Likud was able to gain 15 seats, and, with Netanyahu back in control of the party, formed a coalition with fellow right-wing parties Yisrael Beiteinu and Shas to take control of the government from Kadima, which earned a plurality, but not a majority. Netanyahu served as prime minister from then until 2021. Likud had been the leading vote-getter in each subsequent election until April 2019, when Likud tied with Blue and White and September 2019, when Blue and White won one more seat than the Likud. Likud won the most seats at the 2020 and 2021 elections, but Netanyahu was removed from power in June 2021 by an unprecedented coalition led by Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett. He subsequently returned to the office of prime minister after winning the 2022 election.

==History==
===Formation and leadership of Begin===
The Likud was formed on 13 September 1973 as a secular party by an alliance of several right-wing parties prior to that year&#x27;s legislative electionâHerut, the Liberal Party, the Free Centre, the National List, and the Movement for Greater Israel. Herut had been the nation&#x27;s largest right-wing party since growing out of the Irgun in 1948. It had already been in coalition with the Liberals since 1965 as Gahal, with Herut as the senior partner. Herut remained the senior partner in the new grouping, which was given the name Likud, meaning &quot;Consolidation&quot;, as it represented the consolidation of the Israeli right. It worked as a coalition under Herut&#x27;s leadership until 1988, when the member parties merged into a single party under the Likud name. From its establishment in 1973, Likud enjoyed great support from blue-collar Sephardim.

In its first election Likud won 39 seats, reducing the Alignment&#x27;s lead to 12. The party went on to win the 1977 election with 43 seats, finishing 11 seats ahead of the Alignment. Menachem Begin formed a government with the support of the religious parties, consigning the left wing to opposition for the first time since independence. A former leader of the hard-line paramilitary Irgun, Begin signed the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 EgyptâIsrael peace treaty. In the 1981 election, the Likud won 48 seats, but formed a narrower government than in 1977.

Likud has long been a loose alliance between politicians committed to different and sometimes opposing policy preferences and ideologies. The 1981 election highlighted divisions that existed between the populist wing of Likud, headed by David Levy of Herut, and the Liberal wing, who represented a policy agenda of the secular bourgeoisie.

===Shamir and Netanyahu&#x27;s first term===

On 28 August 1983 Begin announced his intention to resign as prime minister. He was replaced by Yitzhak Shamir, a former commander of the Lehi underground, who defeated Deputy Prime Minister David Levy in a leadership election held by Herut&#x27;s central committee. Shamir was seen as a hard-liner, who opposed the Camp David accords and Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Southern Lebanon. The party won 41 seats in the 1984 election, less than the Alignment&#x27;s 44. The Alignment was unable to form a government on its own, leading to the formation of a rotation government, led jointly by the Alignment and Likud. Shimon Peres became the prime minister, with Shamir becoming the foreign minister. In October 1986, the two switched posts. The Likud won the 1988 election, defeating the Alignment by a one-seat Margin. The two parties formed another government, in which Shamir served as prime minister without a rotation. In 1990 Peres withdrew from the government and led a successful vote of no confidence against it, in what became known as the dirty trick. Shamir formed a new government with right-wing parties, which served until the 1992 election, in which the Likud was defeated by Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s Labor Party.

Shamir stepped down as Likud leader after losing the election in March 1993. To replace him, the party held its first primary election, in which former United Nations Ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu defeated David Levy, Benny Begin and Moshe Katsav, becoming the Leader of the Opposition. In 1995, following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, his temporary successor, decided to call early elections in order to give the government a mandate to advance the peace process. The election was held in May 1996, and included a direct vote for the prime minister in which Netanyahu narrowly defeated Peres, becoming the new prime minister.
In 1998 Netanyahu agreed to cede territory in the Wye River Memorandum, which led some Likud MKs, led by Benny Begin (Menachem Begin&#x27;s son), Michael Kleiner and David Re&#x27;em, to break away and form a new party, named Herut â The National Movement. The new party was endorsed by Yitzhak Shamir, who expressed disappointment in Netanyahu&#x27;s leadership. Following the withdrawal of his remaining partners, Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition collapsed in December 1998, resulting in the 1999 election, where Labor&#x27;s Ehud Barak defeated Netanyahu on a platform promoting the settlement of final status issues. Following his defeat, Netanyahu stepped down as leader of Likud. That September, former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon won a leadership election to replace Netanyahu, defeating Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and former Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit.

Barak&#x27;s government collapsed in December 2000, several months after the Camp David Summit ended without an agreement, and early elections for Prime Minister were called for February 2001, in which Sharon decisively defeated Barak. In 2002 Netanyahu challenged Sharon in a leadership election, but was defeated. During Sharon&#x27;s tenure, Likud faced an internal split due to Sharon&#x27;s policy of unilateral disengagement from Gaza and parts of the West Bank, which proved extremely divisive within the party.

===Sharon and Kadima split===
Sharon&#x27;s Disengagement Plan alienated him from some Likud supporters and fragmented the party. He faced several serious challenges to his authority shortly before his departure. The first was in March 2005, when he and Netanyahu, then his finance minister, proposed a budget plan that met fierce opposition from the opposition and parties to the Likud&#x27;s right. The plan passed the Knesset&#x27;s finance committee by a one-vote margin, before being approved by the Knesset by a wider margin later that month. The second was in September 2005, when Sharon&#x27;s critics in the Likud, led by Netanyahu, forced a vote in the Likud&#x27;s central committee on a proposal for an early leadership election, which was defeated by 52% to 48%. In November, Sharon&#x27;s opponents within the Likud joined with the opposition to prevent the appointment of three of his associates to the Cabinet, successfully preventing the appointment of two.

On 20 November 2005 Labor announced its withdrawal from Sharon&#x27;s governing coalition following the election of the left-wing Amir Peretz as its leader. On 21 November 2005, Sharon announced he would be leaving the Likud and forming a new centrist party, Kadima. The new party included both Likud and Labor supporters of unilateral disengagement. Sharon also announced that an election would take place in early 2006. Seven candidates had declared themselves as contenders to replace Sharon as leader: Netanyahu, Uzi Landau, Shaul Mofaz, Yisrael Katz, Silvan Shalom and Moshe Feiglin. Landau and Mofaz later withdrew, the former in favour of Netanyahu and the latter to join Kadima.

===Netanyahu&#x27;s second term===
Netanyahu went on to win a leadership election to replace Sharon in December, obtaining 44.4% of the vote. Shalom came in a second with 33%, while far-right candidate Moshe Feiglin achieved 12.4% of the vote. Due to Shalom&#x27;s performance, Netanyahu guaranteed him the second place on the party&#x27;s list of Knesset candidates. Polls before the 2006 election showed a substantial reduction in the Likud&#x27;s support, with Kadima achieving a dominant polling lead.
In January 2006 Sharon suffered a stroke that left him in a vegetative state, leading to his replacement as Kadima leader by Ehud Olmert, who led Kadima to victory in the election, winning 29 seats. The Likud experienced a substantial loss in support, coming in fourth place and winning only 12, while other right-wing nationalist parties such as Yisrael Beiteinu, which came within 116 votes of overtaking Likud, gained votes. After the election, Netanyahu was re-elected Likud Leader in 2007, defeating Feiglin and World Likud Chairman Danny Danon.

Following the opening of several criminal investigations against Olmert, he resigned as prime minister on 21 September 2008 and retired from politics. In the ensuing snap election, held in 2009, Likud won 27 seats, the second-largest number of seats and one seat less than Kadima, now led by Tzipi Livni. However, Likud&#x27;s allies won enough seats to allow Netanyahu to form a government, which included Likud, Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas, United Torah Judaism, The Jewish Home, and Labor. Labor left the coalition in 2011 after party leader Ehud Barak left to form his own party, Independence, that remained a member of Netanyahu&#x27;s government. The next year, Netanyahu was re-elected as Likud leader, defeating Moshe Feiglin. Kadima then joined the coalition in May 2012 before leaving in July. Following Kadima&#x27;s withdrawal from the government and amid disagreements related to the 2013 budget, the Knesset was dissolved in October 2012 and a snap election was called for January 2013.

==== Partnership with Yisrael Beitenu and 2015 election ====
Several days after the election was called on 25 October 2012, Netanyahu and Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman announced that their respective political parties would run together on a single ballot in the election under the name Likud Yisrael Beiteinu. The move led to speculation that Lieberman would eventually seek the leadership of Likud after he stated that he &quot;wanted to become the Prime Minister&quot;. Several days before the election, Lieberman said the parties would not merge, and that their direct partnership would end after the election. The partnership ultimately lasted until July 2014, when it officially dissolved.

In the 2013 elections the LikudâYisrael Beiteinu alliance won 31 seats, 20 of which were Likud members. The second largest party, Yair Lapid&#x27;s Yesh Atid, won 19. Netanyahu continued as prime minister after forming a coalition with Yesh Atid, the Jewish Home, and Hatnuah. The government collapsed in December 2014 due to disagreements over the budget and the proposed Nation-state bill, triggering a snap election the next year.

Likud won the 2015 election, defeating the Zionist Union, an alliance of Labor and Hatnuah, winning 30 seats to the Zionist Union&#x27;s 24. The party subsequently formed a government with United Torah Judaism, Shas, Kulanu, and the Jewish Home. In May 2016, Yisrael Beitenu joined the government, before leaving in December 2018, causing Netanyahu to call a snap election for April 2019.

=== 2019â2022 elections ===
During the course of the April 2019 Israeli legislative election campaign, Likud facilitated the formation of the Union of Right-Wing Parties between the Jewish Home, Tkuma and Otzma Yehudit by providing a slot on its own electoral list to Jewish Home candidate Eli Ben-Dahan. In the aftermath of the election, Kulanu merged into Likud.

During the September 2019 Israeli legislative election campaign, Likud agreed to a deal with Zehut, whereby the latter party would drop out of the election and endorse Likud in exchange for a ministerial post for its leader, Moshe Feiglin, as well as policy concessions.

Prior to the 2020 Israeli legislative election Gideon Sa&#x27;ar unsuccessfully challenged Netanyahu for the Likud leadership. In December of that year, Sa&#x27;ar left Likud, along with four other Likud MKs, to form New Hope.

Prior to the 2021 Israeli legislative election, Gesher merged into Likud, receiving a slot on its electoral list. 2021 marked the first time that Likud put a Muslim on its slate, choosing Muslim school principal Nail Zoabi for 39th on its slate.

Likud also facilitated the formation of a joint list between the Religious Zionist Party, Otzma Yehudit and Noam by providing the Religious Zionist Party a slot on the Likud list. On 14 June, after the swearing-in of the 36th government, Ofir Sofer who held the slot, split from the Likud faction and returned to the Religious Zionist Party, decreasing the Likud faction by one to 29 seats in the Knesset.

Likud won the most seats in the 2022 Israeli legislative election.

==Ideological positions==

Likud emphasizes national security policy based on a strong military force when threatened with continued enmity against Israel. It has shown reluctance to negotiate with its neighbors whom it believes continue to seek the destruction of the Jewish state, that based on the principle of the party founder Menachem Begin concerning the preventive policy to any potential attacks on State of Israel. Its suspicion of neighboring Arab nations&#x27; intentions, however, has not prevented the party from reaching agreements with Israel&#x27;s neighbors, such as the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. Likud&#x27;s willingness to enter mutually accepted agreements with neighboring countries over the years is related to the formation of other right-wing parties. Like other right-wing parties in Israel, Likud politicians have sometimes criticized particular Supreme Court decisions, but it remains committed to rule of law principles that it hopes to entrench in a written constitution.

, the party remains divided between moderates and hard-liners.

Likud is considered to be the leading party in the national camp in Israeli politics.

===Territory===

The original 1977 party platform stated that &quot;between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.&quot;

The 1999 Likud Party platform emphasized the right of settlement:

Similarly, they claim the Jordan River as the permanent eastern border to Israel and it also claims Jerusalem as belonging to Israel.

The &#x27;Peace &amp; Security&#x27; chapter of the 1999 Likud Party platform rejects a Palestinian state:

With Likud back in power, starting in 2009, Israeli foreign policy is still under review. Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, in his &quot;National Security&quot; platform, neither endorsed nor ruled out the idea of a Palestinian state. According to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Netanyahu has hinted that he does not oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, but aides say he must move cautiously because his religious-nationalist coalition partners refuse to give away land.&quot;

On 14 June 2009, Netanyahu delivered a speech at Bar-Ilan University (also known as &quot;Bar-Ilan Speech&quot;), at Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the Arab world, on the topic of the Middle East peace process. He endorsed for the first time the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, with several conditions.

However, on 16 March 2015, Netanyahu stated in the affirmative, that if he were elected, a Palestinian state would not be created. Netanyahu argued, &quot;anyone who goes to create today a Palestinian state and turns over land, is turning over land that will be used as a launching ground for attacks by Islamist extremists against the State of Israel.&quot; Some take these statements to mean that Netanyahu and Likud oppose a Palestinian state. After having been criticised by U.S. White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest for the &quot;divisive rhetoric&quot; of his election campaign, on 19 March 2015, Netanyahu retreated to &quot;I don&#x27;t want a one-state solution. I want a peaceful, sustainable two-state solution. I have not changed my policy.&quot;

The Likud Constitution of May 2014 is more vague and ambiguous. Though it contains commitments to the strengthening of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, it does not explicitly rule out the establishment of a Palestinian state.

===Economy===
The Likud party claims to support a free market capitalist and liberal agenda, though, in practice, it has mostly adopted mixed economic policies. Under the guidance of finance minister and current party leader Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud pushed through legislation reducing value added tax (VAT), income and corporate taxes significantly, as well as customs duty. Likewise, it has instituted free trade (especially with the European Union and the United States) and dismantled certain monopolies (Bezeq and the seaports). Additionally, it has privatized numerous government-owned companies (e.g. El Al and Bank Leumi), and has moved to privatize land in Israel, which until now has been held symbolically by the state in the name of the Jewish people. Netanyahu was the most ardent free-market Israeli finance minister to date. He argued that Israel&#x27;s largest labor union, the Histadrut, has so much power as to be capable of paralyzing the Israeli economy, and claimed that the main causes of unemployment are laziness and excessive benefits to the unemployed. Under Netanyahu, Likud has and is likely to maintain a comparatively fiscally conservative economic stance. However, the party&#x27;s economic policies vary widely among members, with some Likud MKs supporting more leftist economic positions that are more in line with popular preferences.

===Palestinians===
Likud has historically espoused opposition to Palestinian statehood and support of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, it has also been the party that carried out the first peace agreements with Arab states. For instance, in 1979, Likud prime minister Menachem Begin signed the Camp David Accords with Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat, which returned the Sinai Peninsula (occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967) to Egypt in return for peace between the two countries. Yitzhak Shamir was the first Israeli prime minister to meet Palestinian leaders at the Madrid Conference following the Persian Gulf War in 1991. However, Shamir refused to concede the idea of a Palestinian state, and as a result was blamed by some (including United States Secretary of State James Baker) for the failure of the summit. On 14 June 2009, as Prime Minister Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed a &quot;Demilitarized Palestinian State&quot;, though said that Jerusalem must remain the unified capital of Israel.

In 2002, during the Second Intifada, Israel&#x27;s Likud-led government reoccupied Palestinian towns and refugee camps in the West Bank. In 2005 Ariel Sharon defied the recent tendencies of Likud and abandoned the policy of seeking to settle in the West Bank and Gaza. Though re-elected Prime Minister on a platform of no unilateral withdrawals, Sharon carried out the Gaza disengagement plan, withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, as well as four settlements in the northern West Bank. Though losing a referendum among Likud registered voters, Sharon achieved government approval of this policy by firing most of the cabinet members who opposed the plan before the vote.

Sharon and the faction who supported his disengagement proposals left the Likud party after the disengagement and created the new Kadima party. This new party supported unilateral disengagement from most of the West Bank and the fixing of borders by the Israeli West Bank barrier. The basic premise of the policy was that the Israelis have no viable negotiating partner on the Palestinian side, and since they cannot remain in indefinite occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel should unilaterally withdraw.

Netanyahu, who was elected as the new leader of Likud after Kadima&#x27;s creation, and Silvan Shalom, the runner-up, both supported the disengagement plan; however, Netanyahu resigned his ministerial post before the plan was executed. As of 2018, most Likud members supported the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and opposed Palestinian statehood and the disengagement from Gaza.
Although settlement activity has continued under recent Likud governments, much of the activity outside the major settlement blocs has been to accommodate the Jewish Home, a coalition partner; support within Likud to build outside the blocs is not particularly strong.

Likud, under Netanyahu, is alleged to have intentionally propped up the rule of Hamas in Gaza as a means of dividing the Palestinians politically and using Palestinian extremism drawing the peace process away from a two-state solution.

In the 2019 elections Likud was widely criticized as a &quot;racist party&quot; after scaremongering anti-Arab rhetoric by its members as well as Netanyahu who claimed minority Arabs and Palestinians in Israel as &quot;threats&quot; and &quot;enemies&quot;.

===Culture===

Likud generally advocates free enterprise and nationalism, but it has sometimes compromised these ideals in practice, especially as its constituency has changed. Its support for populist economic programs are at odds with its free enterprise tradition, but are meant to serve its largely nationalistic, lower-income voters in small towns and urban neighborhoods.

On religion and state, Likud has a moderate stance, and supports the preservation of status quo. With time, the party has played into the traditional sympathies of its voter base, though the origins and ideology of Likud are secular. Religious parties have come to view it as a more comfortable coalition partner than Labor.

Likud promotes a revival of Jewish culture, in keeping with the principles of Revisionist Zionism. Likud emphasizes such Israeli nationalist themes as the use of the Israeli flag and the victory in the 1948 ArabâIsraeli War. In July 2018, Likud lawmakers voted a controversial Nation-State bill into law which declares Israel as the &quot;nation-state of the Jewish people&quot;.

Likud publicly endorses press freedom and promotion of private sector media, which has grown markedly under governments Likud has led. A Likud government headed by Ariel Sharon, however, closed the popular right-wing pirate radio station Arutz Sheva (&quot;Channel 7&quot;). Arutz Sheva was popular with the Jewish settler movement and often criticised the government from a right-wing perspective.

Historically, the Likud and its pre-1948 predecessor, the Revisionist movement advocated secular nationalism. However, the Likud&#x27;s first prime minister and long-time leader Menachem Begin, though secular himself, cultivated a warm attitude to Jewish tradition and appreciation for traditionally religious Jewsâespecially from North Africa and the Middle East. This segment of the Israeli population first brought the Likud to power in 1977. Many Orthodox Israelis find the Likud a more congenial party than any other mainstream party, and in recent years also a large group of Haredim, mostly modern Haredim, joined the party and established the Haredi faction in the Likud.

===Foreign policy===

Since the 1990s, Likud has advocated a hardline stance against Iran and its proxy militias such as the Lebanese Hezbollah.

Likud prime ministers Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu have typically pursued improved relations with Russia, with Likud using posters of Netanyahu meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin during its September 2019 Israeli legislative election campaign. However, since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Likud has been divided, with party leader Netanyahu seeking to maintain working relations with Russia and avoid involvement in the conflict, while some MKs, such as Nir Barkat and Yuli Edelstein, have advocated closer alignment with the West against Russia and support for Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian war.

The Likud government during the 2010s advocated closer ties with Japan, China and India, in order to reduce Israel&#x27;s dependency on Western Europe. In 2017 Netanyahu described closer Israeli alignment with China as a &quot;marriage made in heaven&quot;. Likud has also maintained connections with the ruling political party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Likud governments have pursued close ties with the Republican Party in the United States, leading to a perception of preference for the Republicans over the rival Democratic Party. In 2015 Netanyahu delivered an address to the Republican-held United States Congress without consulting the Democratic presidential administration at the time.

The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 drew criticism from the Likud foreign minister Ariel Sharon, who described it as &quot;brutal interventionism&quot;. Relations between Serbia and Israel improved during the Netanyahu-led Likud government of the 2010s. Likud has had long-term political ties to the Hungarian ruling party Fidesz, which has led to warm diplomatic relations between Netanyahu&#x27;s Likud governments and the Hungarian governments of Viktor OrbÃ¡n.

In recent years, Likud has cultivated ties with European right-wing populist political parties, including the Spanish Vox, the Italian Lega, the Portuguese Chega, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the French National Rally, the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians and the Belgian Vlaams Belang.

==Composition (1973â1988)==
==Leaders==
===Leader election process===
During Begin&#x27;s tenure as leader of Herut/Likud, his leadership was effectively unchallenged. From 1983 through 1992, Herut/Likud elected its party leaders through votes held in party agencies. The 1983 and 1984 Herut leadership elections were undertaken through a vote of Herut&#x27;s Central Committee. The day after Yitzhak Shamir won the 1983 secret ballot vote of the Herut Central Committee to obtain Herut&#x27;s party leadership, the party leaders of the other Likud coalition member parties announced that they agreed to have Shamir lead the Likud coalition.

The 1992 Likud leadership election was the first held after Likud became a unified party. The 1992 leadership election was held as a vote of the Likud Central Committee. After 1992, the party moved to electing its leaders through votes of its general membership, with the first such vote taking place in 1993.

=== Party list selection process ===

Prior to the 2006 election, the Likud&#x27;s Central Committee relinquished control of selecting the Knesset list to the &quot;rank and file&quot; members at Netanyahu&#x27;s behest. The aim was to improve the party&#x27;s reputation, as the central committee had gained a reputation for corruption.

<text>Lancashire hotpot is a stew originating in Lancashire in the North West of England. It consists of lamb or mutton and onion, topped with sliced potatoes and slowly baked in a pot at a low heat.

==History and etymology==
In the 17th century, the word &quot;hotpot&quot; referred not to a stew but to a hot drinkâa mixture of ale and spirits, or sweetened spiced ale. An early use of the term to mean a meat stew was in &quot;The Liverpool Telegraph&quot; in 1836: &quot;hashes, and fricassees, and second-hand Irish hot-pots&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) cites the dish as being served in Liverpool in 1842. The &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot; (OCF) cites Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1854 novel &quot;North and South&quot;, depicting hot-pot as the most prized dish among cotton workers in a northern town.

The OED gives the etymology as &quot;hot adj. + pot n.&quot;, and cites the analogous French term &quot;pot-au-feu&quot;. The OCF refers to earlier forms of the term: &quot;hotchpotch&quot; (a mixed dish, typically a meat and vegetable stew) and &quot;hotchpot&quot;, from the medieval French &quot;hochepot&quot;. &quot;A Book of Cookrye&quot; (1591) gives a recipe for hodgepodge, using &quot;neck of mutton or a fat rump of beef&quot;, cooked and served in a broth thickened with bread. The term &quot;hotchpotch&quot; for a stew continued into the 19th century: Mrs Beeton (1861) gives a recipe under that name for a beef and onion stew in beer.

Hotpot became associated with Lancashire. In the OCF the food historian Roy Shipperbottom writes:
==Preparation==
The recipe usually calls for a mix of mutton (nowadays more frequently lamb) and onions covered with sliced potato, and slowly baked in a pot containing stock or sometimes water. The traditional Lancashire hotpot dish is tall, round and straight-sided, with a lid. Some early recipes add lamb kidneys or oysters to the dish; it is traditionally served with pickled red cabbage.

<doc id="206992" wikidata="Q15711842" url="?curid=206992" title="Shalom aleichem">
<text>Shalom aleichem (; , ) is a greeting in the Hebrew language. When someone is greeted with these words, the appropriate response is (, ). The term is plural, but is still used when addressing one person.

This form of greeting is traditional among Jews worldwide, and typically connotes a religious context. It is particularly common among Ashkenazi Jews.

== History ==
Biblical figures greet each other with (Å¡ÄlÅm to you, m. singular) or (plural).

The term (masculine singular) is first attested in the Scroll of Blessings for the First Month (before 30 BCE), a Dead Sea Scroll, where it is spelled, in their manner, with a final &quot;he&quot;.

The plural first appears in the Jerusalem Talmud (), always with a plural object. It occurs there six times and the response is to repeat . According to y. Sheviit 4:3, it was specifically a Jewish greeting at this time.

 appears many times in the Talmud Bavli () and Leviticus Rabbah (contested date), where the response is to repeat .

The inverted response (masculine singular) is first attested in the Midrash Abba Gorion (before 1050 CE), in the gloss on Esther 3:5: 
&quot;What did Haman do when he passed by and Mordechai did not rise to greet him? He came from one side and made as if Mordechai had greeted him, saying &#x27;&lt;dfn&gt;&quot;Ê¿ÄlÄkÄ Å¡ÄlÅm&quot;&lt;/dfn&gt;,&#x27; but Mordechai replied, &#x27;the LORD says there is no Å¡ÄlÅm for the wicked.&#x27;&quot; â 

The plural greeting and response became common among Ashkenazi Jews in the second half of the next millennium, as the use of plural forms to denote respect was imported from French and German.

In most communities, one says &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot; to three people who respond &quot;Aleichem shalom&quot; as part of the Kiddush levana ritual.

== In other languages ==

Many other Semitic languages (the language family to which Hebrew belongs), as well as some Indo-European languages, share cognates to this greeting.

=== Semitic languages ===
Among Arabs, the variation  (, ) has been a traditional greeting since before the rise of Islam with the appropriate response (, ) first attested by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Following the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century, it was established as a prevalent greeting among many non-Arab Muslims.

In Classical Syriac, the term (, ) is prevalent.

=== Indo-European languages ===
Similar greetings gained prominence with the rise of European Christianity. Within the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, bishops and priests initially use the liturgical greeting &quot;peace be with you&quot; (; ) during divine services. During the Mass, Catholic priests who are not bishops say &quot;the Lord be with you&quot; (), with &quot;and with your spirit&quot; being the appropriate response. Bishops and priests also use the somewhat similar greeting &quot;the peace of the Lord be with you always&quot; during the Mass. In the Orthodox Church, the greeting is always &quot;peace be with you&quot; during services.

Similarly, &quot;peace be with you&quot; is used within Anglicanism, particularly within the liturgies of the Episcopal Church and others in the Anglican Communion, with the &quot;and also with you&quot; being the appropriate response. In the liturgy of the Lutheran Church, the greeting by the pastor is &quot;the peace of Christ be with you always&quot; followed by &quot;and also with you&quot; as the congregation&#x27;s response. Others, such as the Presbyterian Church and the Church of the Brethren, have similar traditional greetings.

== Jewish songs ==
The greeting inspired the traditional folk song Hevenu Shalom Aleichem, which was eventually translated to many languages and became popular in peace demonstrations abroad.

<doc id="206993" wikidata="Q2036693" url="?curid=206993" title="Poi (food)">
<text>Poi is a traditional staple food in the Polynesian diet, made from taro. Traditional poi is produced by mashing cooked taro on a wooden pounding board (), with a carved pestle () made from basalt, calcite, coral, or wood. Modern methods use an industrial food processor to produce large quantities for retail distribution. This initial paste is called . Water is added to the paste during mashing, and again just before eating, to achieve the desired consistency, which can range from highly viscous to liquid. In Hawaii, this is informally classified as either &quot;one-finger&quot;, &quot;two-finger&quot;, or &quot;three-finger&quot;, alluding to how many fingers are required to scoop it up (the thicker the poi, the fewer fingers required to scoop a sufficient mouthful).

Poi can be eaten immediately, when fresh and sweet, or left to ferment and become sour, developing a smell reminiscent of plain yogurt. A layer of water on top can prevent fermenting poi from developing a crust.

==History and culture==

Poi is thought to have originated in the Marquesas Islands, created some time after initial settlement from Polynesian explorers. While mashing food does occur in other parts of the Pacific, the method involved was more rudimentary. In western Polynesia, the cooked starch was mashed in a wooden bowl using a makeshift pounder out of either the stem of a coconut leaf or a hard, unripe breadfruit with several wooden pegs stuck into it. The origins of poi coincided with the development of basalt pounders in the Marquesas, which soon spread elsewhere in eastern Polynesia, with the exception of New Zealand and Easter Island.

Poi was considered such an important and sacred aspect of daily Hawaiian life that Hawaiians believed that the spirit of HÄloa, the legendary ancestor of the Hawaiian people, was present when a bowl of poi was uncovered for consumption at the family dinner table. Accordingly, all conflict among family members was required to come to an immediate halt.

Hawaiians traditionally cook the starchy, potato-like heart of the taro corm for hours in an underground oven called an &quot;imu&quot;, which is also used to cook other types of food such as pork, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Breadfruit can also be made into poi (i.e. &quot;poi Ê»ulu&quot;), Hawaiians however consider this inferior in taste to that of the taro.

==Fermentation==

Poi has a paste-like texture and a delicate flavor when freshly prepared in the traditional manner, with a pale purple color that naturally comes from the taro corm. It has a smooth, creamy texture. The flavor changes distinctly once the poi has been made; fresh poi is sweet and edible; each day thereafter, the poi loses sweetness and turns sour due to a natural fermentation that involves &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; bacteria, yeasts, and &quot;Geotrichum&quot; fungi. Therefore, some people find fermented poi more palatable if it is mixed with milk or sugar or both. The speed of this fermentation process depends upon the bacterial level present in the poi, but the souring process can be slowed by storing poi in a cool, dark location. To prepare commercial poi that has been stored in a refrigerator, it is squeezed out of the bag into a bowl (sometimes adding water), and a thin layer of water is put over the part exposed to air to keep a crust from forming on top. New commercial preparations of poi require refrigeration, but stay fresh longer and taste sweeter.

Sour poi is still edible, but may be less palatable, and is usually served with salted fish or Hawaiian lomi salmon on the side (as in the lyrics &quot;my fish and poi&quot;). Sourness can be prevented by freezing or dehydrating fresh poi, although the resulting poi after defrosting or rehydrating tends to taste bland when compared to the fresh product. Sour poi has an additional use as a cooking ingredient with a sour flavor (similar to buttermilk), usually in breads and rolls.

==Nutrition and dietary and medical uses==
Taro is low in fat, high in vitamin A, and abounds in complex carbohydrates.

Poi has been used specifically as a milk substitute for babies, or as a baby food. It is supposed to be easy to digest. It contains no gluten, making it safe to eat for people who have celiac disease or a gluten intolerance.

<text>James Martineau (; 21 April 1805 â 11 January 1900) was a British religious philosopher influential in the history of Unitarianism.

He was the brother of the atheist social theorist, abolitionist Harriet Martineau. James Martineau&#x27;s children included the Pre-Raphaelite watercolourist Edith Martineau, and painter and woodcarver Gertrude Martineau.

For 45 years he was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in Manchester New College (now Harris Manchester College, of the University of Oxford), the principal training college for British Unitarianism. He also served as its Principal and President.

Many portraits of Martineau, including one painted by George Frederick Watts, are held at London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery. In 2014, the gallery revealed that its patron, Catherine, Princess of Wales, was related to Martineau. The Princess&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Francis Martineau Lupton, was Martineau&#x27;s grandnephew. The gallery also holds written correspondence between Martineau and Poet Laureate, Alfred, Lord Tennyson - who records that he &quot;regarded Martineau as the mastermind of all the remarkable company with whom he engaged&quot;. Martineau and Lord Tennyson were familiar with Queen Victoria&#x27;s son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and noted that Leopold, who had often &quot;conversed with the eminent Dr. Martineau, was considered to be a young man of a very thoughtful mind, high aims, and quite remarkable acquirements&quot;. William Ewart Gladstone said to Frances Power Cobbe &quot;Dr Martineau is beyond question the greatest of living thinkers&quot;.

==Early life==
The seventh of eight children, James Martineau was born in Norwich, England, where his father Thomas (1764â1826) was a cloth manufacturer and merchant. His mother, Elizabeth Rankin, was the eldest daughter of a sugar refiner and grocer. The Martineau family were descended from Gaston Martineau, a Huguenot surgeon and refugee, who married Marie Pierre in 1693, and settled in Norwich. His son and grandson, respectively the great-grandfather and grandfather of James Martineau, were surgeons in the same city. Many of the family were active in Unitarian causes, so much so that a room in Essex Hall, the headquarters of British Unitarianism, was eventually named after them. Branches of the Martineau family in Norwich, Birmingham and London were socially and politically prominent Unitarians; other elite Unitarian families in Birmingham were the Kenricks, Nettlefolds and the Chamberlains, with much intermarriage between these families taking place. Essex Hall held a statue of Martineau. His niece, Frances Lupton, who was close to his sister Harriet, had worked to open up educational opportunities for women.

==Education and early years==
James was educated at Norwich Grammar School where he was a school-fellow with George Borrow under Edward Valpy, as good a scholar as his better-known brother Richard, but proved too sensitive for school. He was sent to Bristol to the private academy of Dr. Lant Carpenter, under whom he studied for two years. On leaving he was apprenticed to a civil engineer at Derby, where he acquired &quot;a store of exclusively scientific conceptions,&quot; but also began to look to religion for mental stimulation.

Martineau&#x27;s conversion followed, and in 1822 he entered the dissenting academy Manchester College, then at York - his uncle Peter Finch Martineau was one of its vice-presidents. Here he &quot;woke up to the interest of moral and metaphysical speculations.&quot; Of his teachers, one, the Rev. Charles Wellbeloved, was, Martineau said, &quot;a master of the true Lardner type, candid and catholic, simple and thorough, humanly fond indeed of the counsels of peace, but piously serving every bidding of sacred truth.&quot; The other, the Rev. John Kenrick, he described as a man so learned as to be placed by Dean Stanley &quot;in the same line with Blomfield and Thirlwall,&quot; and as &quot;so far above the level of either vanity or dogmatism, that cynicism itself could not think of them in his presence.&quot; On leaving the college in 1827 Martineau returned to Bristol to teach in the school of Lant Carpenter; but in the following year, he was ordained for a Unitarian church in Dublin, whose senior minister was a relative of his.

Martineau&#x27;s ministerial career was suddenly cut short in 1832 by difficulties growing out of the &quot;regium donum&quot;, which had on the death of the senior minister fallen to him. He conceived it as &quot;a religious monopoly&quot; to which &quot;the nation at large contributes,&quot; while &quot;Presbyterians alone receive,&quot; and which placed him in &quot;a relation to the state&quot; so &quot;seriously objectionable&quot; as to be &quot;impossible to hold.&quot; The invidious distinction it drew between Presbyterians on the one hand, and Catholics, members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), other nonconformists, unbelievers, and Jews on the other, who were compelled to support a ministry they conscientiously disapproved, offended his conscience. His conscience did, however, allow him to attend both the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838 and her Golden Jubilee half a century later. A year prior to the coronation, at St James&#x27;s Palace, Martineau had &quot;kissed the hand&quot; of the queen at the deputation of British Presbyterian ministers.

==Work and writings==
From Dublin, he was called to Liverpool. He lodged in a house owned by Joseph Williamson. It was during his 25 years in Liverpool that he published his first work, &quot;Rationale of Religious Enquiry&quot;, which caught the attention of many religious and philosophical figures.

In 1840 Martineau was appointed Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in Manchester New College, the seminary in which he had been educated, and which had now moved from York back to Manchester. This position, and the principalship (1869â1885), he held for 45 years. In 1853 the college moved to London, and four years later he followed it there. In 1858 he combined this work with preaching at the pulpit of Little Portland Street Chapel in London, which for the first two years he shared with John James Tayler (who was also his colleague in the college), and then for twelve years as its only minister.

In 1866, the Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College, London, fell vacant when the liberal nonconformist Dr John Hoppus retired. Martineau became a candidate, and despite strong support from some quarters, potent opposition was organised by the anti-clerical George Grote, whose refusal to endorse Martineau resulted in the appointment of George Croom Robertson, then an untried man. Martineau, however, sidestepped Grote&#x27;s opposition, much as Hoppus had learnt to do during his Professorship, and developed a cordial friendship with Robertson.

Martineau was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1872. He was awarded LL.D. of Harvard in 1872, S.T.D. of Leiden in 1874, D.D. of Edinburgh in 1884, D.C.L. of Oxford in 1888 and D.Litt. of Dublin in 1891.
==Life and thought==
Martineau described some of the changes he underwent; how he had &quot;carried into logical and ethical problems the maxims and postulates of physical knowledge,&quot; and had moved within narrow lines &quot;interpreting human phenomena by the analogy of external nature&quot;; and how in a period of &quot;second education&quot; at Humboldt University in Berlin, with Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, he experienced &quot;a new intellectual birth&quot;. It made him, however, no more of a theist than he had been before, and he developed Transcendentalist views, which became a significant current within Unitarianism.

===Early years===
In his early life he was a preacher. Although he did not believe in the Incarnation, he held deity to be manifest in humanity; man underwent an apotheosis, and all life was touched with the dignity and the grace which it owed to its source. His preaching led to works that built up his reputation:&quot;Endeavours after the Christian Life&quot;, 1st series, 1843; 2nd series, 1847; &quot;Hours of Thought&quot;, 1st series, 1876; 2nd series, 1879; the various hymn-books he issued at Dublin in 1831, at Liverpool in 1840, in London in 1873; and the &quot;Home Prayers&quot; in 1891.

In 1839 Martineau came to the defence of Unitarian doctrine, under attack by Liverpool clergymen including Fielding Ould and Hugh Boyd MâNeile. In the controversy, Martineau published five discourses, in which he discussed &quot;the Bible as the great autobiography of human nature from its infancy to its perfection,&quot; &quot;the Deity of Christ,&quot; &quot;Vicarious Redemption,&quot; &quot;Evil,&quot; and &quot;Christianity without Priest and without Ritual.&quot;

In Martineau&#x27;s earliest book, &quot;The Rationale of Religious Enquiry&quot;, published in 1836, he placed the authority of reason above that of Scripture; and he assessed the New Testament as &quot;uninspired, but truthful; sincere, able, vigorous, but fallible.&quot; The book marked him down, among older British Unitarians, as a dangerous radical, and his ideas were the catalyst for a pamphlet war in America between George Ripley (who favored Martineau&#x27;s questioning of the historical accuracy of scripture) and the more conservative Andrews Norton. Despite his belief that the Bible was fallible, Martineau continued to hold the view that &quot;in no intelligible sense can any one who denies the supernatural origin of the religion of Christ be termed a Christian,&quot; which term, he explained, was used not as &quot;a name of praise,&quot; but simply as &quot; a designation of belief.&quot; He censured the German rationalists &quot;for having preferred, by convulsive efforts of interpretation, to compress the memoirs of Christ and His apostles into the dimensions of ordinary life, rather than admit the operation of miracle on the one hand, or proclaim their abandonment of Christianity on the other&quot;.

===Transcendentalism===
Martineau came to know German philosophy and criticism, especially the criticism of Ferdinand Christian Baur and the TÃ¼bingen school, which affected his construction of Christian history. French influences were Ernest Renan and the Strassburg theologians. The rise of evolution compelled him to reformulate his theism. He addressed the public, as editor and contributor, in the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot;, the &quot;Christian Reformer&quot;, the &quot;Prospective Review&quot;, the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; and the &quot;National Review&quot;. Later he was a frequent contributor to the literary monthlies. More systematic expositions came in &quot;Types of Ethical Theory&quot; and &quot;The Study of Religion&quot;, and, partly, in &quot;The Seat of Authority in Religion&quot; (1885, 1888 and 1890). What did Jesus signify? This was the problem which Martineau attempted to deal with in &quot;The Seat of Authority in Religion&quot;.

Martineau&#x27;s theory of religious society, or church, was that of an idealist. He propounded a scheme, which was not taken up, that would have removed the church from the hands of a clerical order, and allowed the coordination of sects or churches under the state. Eclectic by nature, he gathered ideas from any source that appealed. Stopford Brooke once asked A. P. Stanley, Dean of Westminster, &quot;if the Church of England would broaden sufficiently to allow James Martineau to be made Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;.


==Later years==
Although he had opposed the removal (1889) of Manchester New College to Oxford, Martineau took part in the opening of the new buildings, conducting the communion service (19 October 1893) in the chapel of what is today Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford.

A wide circle of friends mourned his death on 11 January 1900; Oscar Wilde references him in his prose.

He was buried in a family grave on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. One of his daughters was the watercolourist Edith Martineau who was interred in the family grave in 1909. The Martineau Memorial Hall in Norwich was built in 1907 and named after celebrated members of the family who had long resided in the area and were deacons of the chapel to which the hall was attached. However, unofficially, the hall was named after James who had died within recent years having established the hall&#x27;s Sunday school some decades earlier.
