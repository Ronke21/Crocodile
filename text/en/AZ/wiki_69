<text>On April 8, 2003, three locations in Baghdad housing journalists were fired upon by U.S. armed forces during 2003 invasion of Iraq, killing three journalists and wounding four.

== Al Jazeera&#x27;s office ==

Two American air-to-surface missiles hit the Qatar satellite TV station at Al Jazeera&#x27;s office in Baghdad and killed Tareq Ayyoub, a Palestinian reporter, and wounded Zouhair al-Iraqi, an Iraqi cameraman. They were live broadcasting on the roof of the building. Al Jazeera accused the U.S. of intentionally targeting Al Jazeera as the U.S. bombed its Kabul bureau in 2001 during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.

== Palestine Hotel ==

A U.S. Army tank fired into the 15th floor of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, where almost all foreign journalists were based. The image of the hotel had been frequently broadcast in the news, since many journalists filmed their reports nearby. The tank fire killed the Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and wounded three. José Couso of Telecinco Spanish television who was on the 14th floor also died.

At the time, Company A of the 4th Battalion, 64th Armored Regiment was holding the west end of the al-Jumhuria Bridge. The U.S. Forces were under attack from Iraqi units on both sides of the Tigris River, including mortar fire. Earlier that morning, the battalion had captured an Iraqi two-way radio, over which they heard an Iraqi forward observer directing mortar fire against Company A. This information was relayed to the forces at the bridge, who began looking for the enemy spotter. An A-Company tank spotted an individual on a balcony on the upper floor of a high-rise building to the southeast who appeared to be observing the company with &quot;some kind of optics&quot; (likely Protsyuk). Assuming this was the enemy spotter, the tank commander asked for and received permission to fire. The tank fired a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round at the balcony, killing Protsyuk and Couso. Before the incident, no one in the 4-64 had been briefed about the Palestine Hotel or its location, since the hotel was not in their sector (the east bank of the Tigris was allocated to the 1st Marine Division). U.S. forces later determined that the Iraqi artillery spotter was probably in a nearby building, not the hotel.

In 2008, whistleblower Sgt. Adrienne Kinne, a former Arabic linguist in U.S. Army Intelligence, reported that she had seen secret documents listing the Palestine Hotel as a possible military target before the 2003 shelling incident in which it was targeted.
== Abu Dhabi&#x27;s office ==

The office of the United Arab Emirates satellite channel Abu Dhabi was hit by air strikes. The station aired the picture of Iraqi fire from beneath the camera.

== Responses to the three in general ==

Pentagon

During a briefing from The Pentagon on April 8, a reporter asked &quot;(...) There are reports that a tank took small arms and perhaps R.P.G. fire from the direction of the hotel, although journalists say that they saw no sign of it. Do you think that&#x27;s reason enough for a tank to fire a round at the hotel where you know there are unarmed journalists?&quot;

Major General Stanley McChrystal answered &quot;(...) particularly with this war, journalists have been closer to coalition soldiers than probably ever before with the embedded program, and those who are not. (...) When [forces] get into combat in the cities, which, from the beginning, we had specifically said would be dangerous and difficult, you put yourself in their position, they had the inherent right of self-defense. When they are fired at, they have not only the right to respond, they have the obligation to respond to protect the soldiers with them and to accomplish the mission at large (...).&quot;

U.S. Central Command

At a briefing in Doha, Qatar, Brigadier General Vincent K. Brooks said of the Al Jazeera attack, &quot;This coalition does not target journalists. We don&#x27;t know every place journalists are operating on the battlefield. It&#x27;s a dangerous place indeed.&quot;

Governments

On March 8, Spanish and Portuguese governments insisted that all the journalists of the countries evacuate from Baghdad.

Journalist and civil organizations

Committee to Protect Journalists sent a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to demand investigation. Reporters Without Borders demanded proof from Donald Rumsfeld that the incidents &quot;were not deliberate attempts to dissuade the media from reporting.&quot; Amnesty International demanded independent investigation.

==Report of Committee to Protect Journalists==

On May 27, 2003, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published a report of their investigation into the tank shelling of the Palestine Hotel on April 8, 2003. After interviewing &quot;about a dozen reporters who were at the scene, including two embedded journalists who monitored the military radio traffic before and after the shelling occurred&quot; the CPJ determined that the facts suggest that the &quot;attack on the journalists, while not deliberate, was avoidable&quot;. The CPJ determined that the tank&#x27;s intended target was an Iraqi forward artillery observer when it hit the hotel. The report went on to say &quot;CPJ has learned that Pentagon officials, as well as commanders on the ground in Baghdad, knew that the Palestine Hotel was full of international journalists and were intent on not hitting it.&quot;

<text>Contre-jour (; ) is a photographic technique in which the camera is pointing directly toward a source of light, as well as an equivalent technique of painting.

==Description==

Before its use in photography, contre-jour was used in painting, where the shadows would fall to the left on the left, to the right on the right and forward in the lower centre. The edges of the subject would show surprising colour effects. 

Contre-jour produces backlighting of the subject. This effect usually hides details, causes a stronger contrast between light and dark, creates silhouettes and emphasizes lines and shapes. The sun, or other light source, is often seen as either a bright spot or as a strong glare behind the subject. Fill light may be used to illuminate the side of the subject facing toward the camera. The subject is generally considered silhouetted when there is a lighting ratio of 16:1 or more.

<doc id="207676" wikidata="Q1474197" url="?curid=207676" title="Muckraker">
<text>The muckrakers were reform-minded journalists, writers, and photographers in the Progressive Era in the United States (1890s–1920s) who claimed to expose corruption and wrongdoing in established institutions, often through sensationalist publications. The modern term generally references investigative journalism or watchdog journalism; investigative journalists in the US are occasionally called &quot;muckrakers&quot; informally.

The muckrakers played a highly visible role during the Progressive Era. Muckraking magazines—notably &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; of the publisher S. S. McClure—took on corporate monopolies and political machines, while trying to raise public awareness and anger at urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, prostitution, and child labor. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposés often had a major impact, too, such as those by Upton Sinclair.

In contemporary American usage, the term can refer to journalists or others who &quot;dig deep for the facts&quot; or, when used pejoratively, those who seek to cause scandal. The term is a reference to a character in John Bunyan&#x27;s classic &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;the Man with the Muck-rake&quot;, who rejected salvation to focus on filth. It became popular after President Theodore Roosevelt referred to the character in a ; Roosevelt acknowledged that &quot;the men with the muck rakes are often indispensable to the well-being of society; but only if they know when to stop raking the muck.&quot;

==History==

While a literature of reform had already appeared by the mid-19th century, the kind of reporting that would come to be called &quot;muckraking&quot; began to appear around 1900. By the 1900s, magazines such as &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; were already in wide circulation and read avidly by the growing middle class. The January 1903 issue of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; is considered to be the official beginning of muckraking journalism, although the muckrakers would get their label later. Ida M. Tarbell (&quot;The History of Standard Oil&quot;), Lincoln Steffens (&quot;The Shame of the Cities&quot;) and Ray Stannard Baker (&quot;The Right to Work&quot;), simultaneously published famous works in that single issue. Claude H. Wetmore and Lincoln Steffens&#x27; previous article &quot;Tweed Days in St. Louis&quot; in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; October 1902 issue was called the first muckraking article.

===Changes in journalism prior to 1903===


The muckrakers would become known for their investigative journalism, evolving from the eras of &quot;personal journalism&quot;—a term historians Emery and Emery used in &quot;The Press and America&quot; (6th ed.) to describe the 19th century newspapers that were steered by strong leaders with an editorial voice (p. 173)—and yellow journalism.

One of the biggest urban scandals of the post-Civil War era was the corruption and bribery case of Tammany boss William M. Tweed in 1871 that was uncovered by newspapers. In his first muckraking article &quot;Tweed Days in St. Louis&quot;, Lincoln Steffens exposed the graft, a system of political corruption, that was ingrained in St. Louis. While some muckrakers had already worked for reform newspapers of the personal journalism variety, such as Steffens who was a reporter for the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; under Edwin Lawrence Godkin, other muckrakers had worked for yellow journals before moving on to magazines around 1900, such as Charles Edward Russell who was a journalist and editor of Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot;. Publishers of yellow journals, such as Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, were more intent on increasing circulation through scandal, crime, entertainment and sensationalism.

Just as the muckrakers became well known for their crusades, journalists from the eras of &quot;personal journalism&quot; and &quot;yellow journalism&quot; had gained fame through their investigative articles, including articles that exposed wrongdoing. In &quot;yellow journalism&quot;, the idea was to stir up the public with sensationalism, and thus sell more papers. If, in the process, a social wrong was exposed that the average man could get indignant about, that was fine, but it was not the intent to correct social wrongs as it was with true investigative journalists and muckrakers.

Julius Chambers of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; could be considered to be the original muckraker. Chambers undertook a journalistic investigation of Bloomingdale Asylum in 1872, having himself committed with the help of some of his friends and his newspaper&#x27;s city editor. His intent was to obtain information about alleged abuse of inmates. When articles and accounts of the experience were published in the &quot;Tribune&quot;, it led to the release of twelve patients who were not mentally ill, a reorganization of the staff and administration of the institution and, eventually, to a change in the lunacy laws. This later led to the publication of the book &quot;A Mad World and Its Inhabitants&quot; (1876). From this time onward, Chambers was frequently invited to speak on the rights of the mentally ill and the need for proper facilities for their accommodation, care and treatment.

Nellie Bly, another yellow journalist, used the undercover technique of investigation in reporting &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot;, her 1887 exposé on patient abuse at Bellevue Mental Hospital, first published as a series of articles in &quot;The World&quot; newspaper and then as a book. Nellie would go on to write more articles on corrupt politicians, sweat-shop working conditions and other societal injustices.

====Other works that predate the muckrakers====

* Helen Hunt Jackson (1831–1885) – &quot;A Century of Dishonor,&quot; U.S. policy regarding Native Americans.
* Henry Demarest Lloyd (1847–1903) – &quot;Wealth Against Commonwealth,&quot; exposed the corruption within the Standard Oil Company.
* Ida B. Wells (1862–1931) – an author of a series of articles concerning Jim Crow laws and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1884, and co-owned the newspaper &quot;The Free Speech&quot; in Memphis in which she began an anti-lynching campaign.
* Ambrose Bierce (1842–1913(?)) – author of a long-running series of articles published from 1883 through 1896 in &quot;The Wasp&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; attacking the Big Four and the Central Pacific Railroad for political corruption.
* B. O. Flower (1858–1918) – author of articles in &quot;The Arena&quot; from 1889 through 1909 advocating for prison reform and prohibition of alcohol.
* Jacob Riis (1849–1914) – author of &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, advocating for changes to tenements through flash photography

The muckrakers appeared at a moment when journalism was undergoing changes in style and practice. In response to yellow journalism, which had exaggerated facts, objective journalism, as exemplified by &quot;The New York Times&quot; under Adolph Ochs after 1896, turned away from sensationalism and reported facts with the intention of being impartial and a newspaper of record. The growth of wire services had also contributed to the spread of the objective reporting style. Muckraking publishers like Samuel S. McClure also emphasized factual reporting, but he also wanted what historian Michael Schudson had identified as one of the preferred qualities of journalism at the time, namely, the mixture of &quot;reliability and sparkle&quot; to interest a mass audience. In contrast with objective reporting, the journalists, whom Roosevelt dubbed &quot;muckrakers&quot;, saw themselves primarily as reformers and were politically engaged. Journalists of the previous eras were not linked to a single political, populist movement as the muckrakers were associated with Progressive reforms. While the muckrakers continued the investigative exposures and sensational traditions of yellow journalism, they wrote to change society. Their work reached a mass audience as circulation figures of the magazines rose on account of visibility and public interest.

===Magazines===
Magazines were the leading outlets for muckraking journalism. Samuel S. McClure and John Sanborn Phillips started &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in May 1893. McClure led the magazine industry by cutting the price of an issue to 15 cents, attracting advertisers, giving audiences illustrations and well-written content and then raising ad rates after increased sales, with &quot;Munsey&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; following suit.

McCuckz sought out and hired talented writers, like the then unknown Ida M. Tarbell or the seasoned journalist and editor Lincoln Steffens. The magazine&#x27;s pool of writers were associated with the muckraker movement, such as Ray Stannard Baker, Burton J. Hendrick, George Kennan (explorer), John Moody (financial analyst), Henry Reuterdahl, George Kibbe Turner, and Judson C. Welliver, and their names adorned the front covers. The other magazines associated with muckraking journalism were &quot;American Magazine&quot; (Lincoln Steffens), &quot;Arena&quot; (G. W. Galvin and John Moody), &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (Samuel Hopkins Adams, C.P. Connolly, L. R. Glavis, Will Irwin, J. M. Oskison, Upton Sinclair), &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (Josiah Flynt, Alfred Henry Lewis, Jack London, Charles P. Norcross, Charles Edward Russell), &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (William Hard, Thomas William Lawson, Benjamin B. Lindsey, Frank Norris, David Graham Phillips, Charles Edward Russell, Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens, Merrill A. Teague, Bessie and Marie Van Vorst), &quot;Hampton&#x27;s&quot; (Rheta Childe Dorr, Benjamin B. Hampton, John L. Mathews, Charles Edward Russell, and Judson C. Welliver), &quot;The Independent&quot; (George Walbridge Perkins, Sr.), &quot;Outlook&quot; (William Hard), &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (Alfred Henry Lewis, Charles Edward Russell), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (George French), and &quot;World&#x27;s Work&quot; (C.M. Keys and Q.P.). Other titles of interest include &quot;Chatauquan&quot;, &quot;Dial&quot;, &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;. In addition, Theodore Roosevelt wrote for &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; after leaving office.

===Origin of the term, Theodore Roosevelt===
After President Theodore Roosevelt took office in 1901, he began to manage the press corps. To do so, he elevated his press secretary to cabinet status and initiated press conferences. The muckraking journalists who emerged around 1900, like Lincoln Steffens, were not as easy for Roosevelt to manage as the objective journalists, and the President gave Steffens access to the White House and interviews to steer stories his way.

Roosevelt used the press very effectively to promote discussion and support for his Square Deal policies among his base in the middle-class electorate. When journalists went after different topics, he complained about their wallowing in the mud. In a speech on April 14, 1906 on the occasion of dedicating the House of Representatives office building, he drew on a character from John Bunyan&#x27;s 1678 classic, &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, saying:
While cautioning about possible pitfalls of keeping one&#x27;s attention ever trained downward, &quot;on the muck&quot;, Roosevelt emphasized the social benefit of investigative muckraking reporting, saying:
Most of these journalists detested being called muckrakers. They felt betrayed that Roosevelt would describe them with such a term after they had helped him with his election. Muckraker David Graham Philips believed that the tag of muckraker brought about the end of the movement as it was easier to group and attack the journalists.

The term eventually came to be used in reference to investigative journalists who reported about and exposed such issues as crime, fraud, waste, public health and safety, graft, and illegal financial practices. A muckraker&#x27;s reporting may span businesses and government.

==Early 20th century muckraking==
Some of the key documents that came to define the work of the muckrakers were:

Ray Stannard Baker published &quot;The Right to Work&quot; in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1903, about coal mine conditions, a coal strike, and the situation of non-striking workers (or scabs). Many of the non-striking workers had no special training or knowledge in mining, since they were simply farmers looking for work. His investigative work portrayed the dangerous conditions in which these people worked in the mines, and the dangers they faced from union members who did not want them to work.

Lincoln Steffens published &quot;Tweed Days in St. Louis&quot;, in which he profiled corrupt leaders in St. Louis, in October 1902, in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The prominence of the article helped lawyer Joseph Folk to lead an investigation of the corrupt political ring in St. Louis.

Ida Tarbell published &quot;The Rise of the Standard Oil Company&quot; in 1902, providing insight into the manipulation of trusts. One trust they manipulated was with Christopher Dunn Co. She followed that work with &quot;The History of The Standard Oil Company: the Oil War of 1872&quot;, which appeared in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1908. She condemned Rockefeller&#x27;s immoral and ruthless business tactics and emphasized &quot;our national life is on every side distinctly poorer, uglier, meaner, for the kind of influence he exercises.&quot; Her book generated enough public anger that it led to the splitting up of Standard Oil under the Sherman Anti Trust Act.

Upton Sinclair published &quot;The Jungle&quot; in 1906, which revealed conditions in the meat packing industry in the United States and was a major factor in the establishment of the Pure Food and Drug Act and Meat Inspection Act. Sinclair wrote the book with the intent of addressing unsafe working conditions in that industry, not food safety. Sinclair was not a professional journalist but his story was first serialized before being published in book form. Sinclair considered himself to be a muckraker.

&quot;The Treason of the Senate: Aldrich, the Head of it All&quot;, by David Graham Phillips, published as a series of articles in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in February 1906, described corruption in the U.S. Senate. This work was a keystone in the creation of the Seventeenth Amendment which established the election of Senators through popular vote.

&quot;The Great American Fraud&quot; (1905) by Samuel Hopkins Adams revealed fraudulent claims and endorsements of patent medicines in America. This article shed light on the many false claims that pharmaceutical companies and other manufacturers would make as to the potency of their medicines, drugs and tonics. This exposure contributed heavily to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act alongside Upton Sinclair&#x27;s work. Using the example of Peruna in his article, Adams described how this tonic, which was made of seven compound drugs and alcohol, did not have &quot;any great potency&quot;. Manufacturers sold it at an obscene price and hence made immense profits. His work forced a crackdown on a number of other patents and fraudulent schemes of medicinal companies.

Many other works by muckrakers brought to light a variety of issues in America during the Progressive era. These writers focused on a wide range of issues including the monopoly of Standard Oil; cattle processing and meat packing; patent medicines; child labor; and wages, labor, and working conditions in industry and agriculture. In a number of instances, the revelations of muckraking journalists led to public outcry, governmental and legal investigations, and, in some cases, legislation was enacted to address the issues the writers identified, such as harmful social conditions; pollution; food and product safety standards; sexual harassment; unfair labor practices; fraud; and other matters. The work of the muckrakers in the early years, and those today, span a wide array of legal, social, ethical and public policy concerns.

==Disappearance==

The influence of the muckrakers began to fade during the more conservative presidency of William Howard Taft. Corporations and political leaders were also more successful in silencing these journalists as advertiser boycotts forced some magazines to go bankrupt. Through their exposés, the nation was changed by reforms in cities, business, politics, and more. Monopolies such as Standard Oil were broken up and political machines fell apart; the problems uncovered by muckrakers were resolved and thus the muckrakers of that era were needed no longer.

==Impact==

According to Fred J. Cook, the muckrakers&#x27; journalism resulted in litigation or legislation that had a lasting impact, such as the end of Standard Oil&#x27;s monopoly over the oil industry, the establishment of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the creation of the first child labor laws in the United States around 1916. Their reports exposed bribery and corruption at the city and state level, as well as in Congress, that led to reforms and changes in election results.

&quot;The effect on the soul of the nation was profound. It can hardly be considered an accident that the heyday of the muckrakers coincided with one of America&#x27;s most yeasty and vigorous periods of ferment. The people of the country were aroused by the corruptions and wrongs of the age – and it was the muckrakers who informed and aroused them. The results showed in the great wave of progressivism and reform cresting in the remarkable spate of legislation that marked the first administration of Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1917. For this, the muckrakers had paved the way.&quot;

Other changes that resulted from muckraker articles include the reorganization of the U.S. Navy (after Henry Reuterdahl published a controversial article in McClure&#x27;s). Muckraking investigations were used to change the way senators were elected by the Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and led to government agencies to take on watchdog functions.

==Since 1945==

Some today use &quot;investigative journalism&quot; as a synonym for muckraking. Carey McWilliams, editor of the &quot;Nation&quot;, assumed in 1970 that investigative journalism, and reform journalism, or muckraking, were the same type of journalism. Journalism textbooks point out that McClure&#x27;s muckraking standards &quot;Have become integral to the character of modern investigative journalism.&quot; Furthermore, the successes of the early muckrakers have continued to inspire journalists.
Moreover, muckraking has become an integral part of journalism in American history. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein exposed the workings of the Nixon Administration in Watergate, which led to Nixon&#x27;s resignation. More recently, Edward Snowden disclosed the activities of governmental spying, albeit illegally, which gave the public knowledge of the extent of the infringements on their privacy.

<text>Nell is a 1994 American drama film directed by Michael Apted from a screenplay written by William Nicholson. The film stars Jodie Foster (who also produced) as Nell Kellty, a young woman who has to face other people for the first time after being raised by her mother in an isolated cabin. Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson, Richard Libertini, and Nick Searcy are featured in supporting roles. Based on Mark Handley&#x27;s play &quot;Idioglossia&quot;, the script for &quot;Nell&quot; was developed by co-producer Renée Missel and was inspired by Handley&#x27;s time living in the Cascade Mountains in the 1970s, and the story of Poto and Cabengo, twins who created their own language.

&quot;Nell&quot; received a limited release on December 16, 1994, before expanding into wide release on December 23. The film received mixed reviews from critics upon its release, with praise for the direction, score, and performances, but criticism for its execution and limited exploration of the titular character. Despite this, it was a box office success, grossing over $106 million worldwide on a $24.5 million production budget.

Foster&#x27;s performance was widely praised and brought her various awards and nominations. She won the inaugural Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. The film also received two additional nominations at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards for Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and Best Original Score.

==Plot==
When Violet Kellty, who had an undiagnosed stroke, dies in her secluded cabin in the North Carolina mountains, Dr. Jerry Lovell, the town doctor, discovers a frightened young woman hiding in the house rafters. She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to communicate using a unique language. While examining Violet&#x27;s Bible, Jerry finds a note instructing whoever discovers it to care for Violet&#x27;s daughter, Nell. Sheriff Todd Peterson shows Jerry a news clipping revealing that Nell was conceived through rape. Jerry seeks assistance from Dr. Paula Olsen, a researcher specializing in autistic children. Paula, along with her colleague Dr. Al Paley, is interested in studying a &quot;wild child&quot; (feral child), although Al persists in labeling Nell as such despite evidence to the contrary in filmed observations.

Paula and Al obtain a court order to institutionalize Nell for further study, but Jerry hires lawyer Don Fontana to prevent this. The judge grants Jerry and Paula three months to interact with Nell and understand her needs. Paula arrives on a houseboat equipped with electronic monitoring equipment to observe Nell&#x27;s behavior, while Jerry chooses to stay in a tent near Nell&#x27;s cabin to quietly observe her.

Paula eventually deduces that Nell&#x27;s seemingly indecipherable language is a form of English, influenced by her mother&#x27;s aphasic speech after a stroke and her secret language shared with her deceased identical twin sister. A tentative friendship forms between Jerry and Paula. Nell, who sleeps during the day and only ventures outside after sunset, comes to trust Jerry, viewing him as the &quot;gah&#x27;inja&quot; her mother promised would arrive. Jerry later realizes that &quot;gah&#x27;inja&quot; is Nell&#x27;s term for &quot;guardian angel.&quot;

To alleviate Nell&#x27;s fear of evildoers and the possibility of rape, Paula encourages Jerry to swim with Nell in the lake, allowing her to feel his body, hug him, and have fun. Using popcorn as an incentive, Jerry succeeds in coaxing Nell outside into the sunlight. Nell leads Jerry and Paula to the decayed remains of her identical twin sister, May, who died in a fall while playing in the woods.

When reporter Mike Ibarra learns of Nell&#x27;s existence and visits her cabin, Nell initially displays curiosity, but the camera flash frightens her. Jerry intervenes, ejecting the reporter. He later realizes the reporter isn&#x27;t from the press and apologizes for overreacting but requests that he forget their encounter. Paula believes that Nell would be safer in a hospital, while Jerry argues for leaving Nell alone to live as she pleases. An argument ensues, with Paula accusing Jerry of exploiting Nell for his own satisfaction. However, Nell manages to calm them down after overhearing their conversation.

Ultimately, they decide to introduce Nell to the world, taking her to town. There, Nell befriends Mary, Todd&#x27;s depressed wife, goes shopping with Jerry and Paula, but also encounters some unruly boys in a pool hall. Jerry intervenes when they ask her to expose herself. Jerry and Paula provide Nell with a book about love, romance, and intimacy to help her understand the concept. She demonstrates her understanding by having Jerry and Paula touch each other&#x27;s faces, strengthening their bond.

With increased media intrusion, Jerry and Paula take Nell to a hospital for her protection. There, Nell becomes extremely despondent and unresponsive after seeing a vision of May. Jerry removes her from the hospital and hides her in a hotel. Paula joins him, and the two confess their love for each other.

At the subsequent court hearing, Al, who wants to study Nell in a controlled environment, asserts that Nell has Asperger syndrome and should be institutionalized. Nell then steps forward and, with Jerry interpreting, speaks for herself, reassuring everyone that there is no need to fear or worry for her, as her sorrows are no greater than anyone else&#x27;s.

Five years later, Jerry and Paula bring their daughter, Ruthie, to visit Nell in her house on her birthday, and friends surround her. Nell treats Ruthie like a little sister and takes her to the lake, although this reminds her of May.

==Cast==
==Production==
Production took place in North Carolina, including the town of Robbinsville and the city of Charlotte.

About the nude skinny-dipping scenes, Michael Apted said that Jodie Foster accepted them without problems, only complaining about the coldness of the water.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted with $5.7 million. It eventually grossed $33.6 million domestically while bringing over $73 million around the world to a total of $106.6 million worldwide.

===Critical response===

&quot;Nell&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast but criticised the screenplay. Foster received widespread praise for her performance. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s review noted that &quot;Jodie Foster, transcendent in the bravura title role, is far grander than the film itself, and her performance helps camouflage the weaknesses of its structure and the naivete of its themes.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin noted that: &quot;For all its technical brilliance, not even Ms. Foster&#x27;s intense, accomplished performance in the title role holds much surprise. The wild-child story of &#x27;Nell&#x27; unfolds in unexpectedly predictable ways, clinging fiercely to the banal thought that Nell&#x27;s innocence makes her purer than anyone else in the story.&quot; Maslin also wished the film had explored Nell&#x27;s adult sexuality. Roger Ebert liked the movie, commenting that &quot;Despite its predictable philosophy, however, &quot;Nell&quot; is an effective film, and a moving one.&quot; He also singled out the performances of Foster and Neeson. 
The film holds a score of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes from 35 reviews as of 2022, and with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Despite a committed performance by Jodie Foster, &quot;Nell&quot; opts for ponderous melodrama instead of engaging with the ethical dilemmas of socializing its titular wild child.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 60% based on reviews from 23 critics.

<doc id="207685" wikidata="Q10464" url="?curid=207685" title="Cassiopeia (constellation)">
<text>Cassiopeia () is a constellation and asterism in the northern sky named after the vain queen Cassiopeia, mother of Andromeda, in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivaled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive &#x27;W&#x27; shape, formed by five bright stars.

Cassiopeia is located in the northern sky and from latitudes above 34°N it is visible year-round. In the (sub)tropics it can be seen at its clearest from September to early November, and at low southern, tropical, latitudes of less than 25°S it can be seen, seasonally, low in the North.

At magnitude 2.2, Alpha Cassiopeiae, or Schedar, is the brightest star in Cassiopeia. The constellation hosts some of the most luminous stars known, including the yellow hypergiants Rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae and white hypergiant 6 Cassiopeiae. In 1572, Tycho Brahe&#x27;s supernova flared brightly in Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant and the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky at frequencies above 1 GHz. Fourteen star systems have been found to have exoplanets, one of whichHD 219134is thought to host six planets. A rich section of the Milky Way runs through Cassiopeia, containing a number of open clusters, young luminous galactic disc stars, and nebulae. IC 10 is an irregular galaxy that is the closest known starburst galaxy and the only one in the Local Group of galaxies.

== Mythology ==
The constellation is named after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed next to each other among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the north celestial pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.

Cassiopeia has been variously portrayed throughout her history as a constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in her right hand, wearing a crown, as well as a two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding her robe in her right hand. This depiction is from Augustin Royer&#x27;s 1679 atlas.

In Chinese astronomy, the stars forming the constellation Cassiopeia are found among three areas: the Purple Forbidden enclosure (紫微垣, &quot;Zǐ Wēi Yuán&quot;), the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, &quot;Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ&quot;), and the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎, &quot;Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ&quot;).

The Chinese astronomers saw several figures in what is modern-day Cassiopeia. Kappa, Eta, and Mu Cassiopeiae formed a constellation called the Bridge of the Kings; when seen along with Alpha and Beta Cassiopeiae, they formed the great chariot &quot;Wang-Liang&quot;. The charioteer&#x27;s whip was represented by Gamma Cassiopeiae, sometimes called &quot;Tsih&quot;, the Chinese word for &quot;whip&quot;.

In Hindu Mythology, Cassiopeia was associated with the mythological figure Sharmishtha – the daughter of the great Devil (Daitya) King Vrishparva and a friend to Devayani (Andromeda).

In Welsh Mythology &quot;Llys Dôn&quot; (literally &quot;The Court of Dôn&quot;) is the traditional Welsh name for the constellation. At least three of Dôn&#x27;s children also have astronomical associations: Caer Gwydion (&quot;The fortress of Gwydion&quot;) is the traditional Welsh name for the Milky Way, and Caer Arianrhod (&quot;The Fortress of Arianrhod&quot;) being the constellation of Corona Borealis.

In the 17th century, various Biblical figures were depicted in the stars of Cassiopeia. These included Bathsheba, Solomon&#x27;s mother; Deborah, an Old Testament prophet; and Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus.

A figure called the &quot;Tinted Hand&quot; also appeared in the stars of Cassiopeia in some Arab atlases. This is variously said to represent a woman&#x27;s hand dyed red with henna, as well as the bloodied hand of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima. The hand is made up of the stars α Cas, β Cas, γ Cas, δ Cas, ε Cas, and η Cas. The arm is made up of the stars α Per, γ Per, δ Per, ε Per, η Per, and ν Per.

Another Arab constellation that incorporated the stars of Cassiopeia was the Camel. Its head was composed of Lambda, Kappa, Iota, and Phi Andromedae; its hump was Beta Cassiopeiae; its body was the rest of Cassiopeia, and the legs were composed of stars in Perseus and Andromeda.

Other cultures see a hand or moose antlers in the pattern. These include the Sámi, for whom the W of Cassiopeia forms an elk antler. The Chukchi of Siberia similarly saw the five main stars as five reindeer stags.

The people of the Marshall Islands saw Cassiopeia as part of a great porpoise constellation. The main stars of Cassiopeia make its tail, Andromeda and Triangulum form its body, and Aries makes its head. In Hawaii, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Cassiopeiae were named. Alpha Cassiopeiae was called &quot;Poloahilani&quot;, Beta Cassiopeiae was called &quot;Polula&quot;, and Gamma Cassiopeiae was called &quot;Mulehu&quot;. The people of Pukapuka saw the figure of Cassiopeia as a distinct constellation called &quot;Na Taki-tolu-a-Mataliki&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

 Cassiopeia had a supernova, Cassiopeia A, SN 1572.

Covering 598.4 square degrees and hence 1.451% of the sky, Cassiopeia ranks 25th of the 88 constellations in area. It is bordered by Cepheus to the north and west, Andromeda to the south and west, Perseus to the southeast and Camelopardalis to the east, and also shares a short border with Lacerta to the west.

The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Cas&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 30 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between 77.69° and 46.68°. Its position in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers north of 12°S. High in the northern sky, it is circumpolar (that is, it never sets in the night sky) to viewers in the British Isles, Canada and the northern United States.

== Features ==
=== Stars ===
The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omega, and then A and B, to label the most prominent 26 stars in the constellation. Upsilon was later found to be two stars and labelled Upsilon1 and Upsilon2 by John Flamsteed. B Cassiopeiae was in fact the supernova known as Tycho&#x27;s Supernova. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 157 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

==== &#x27;W&#x27; asterism ====
The five brightest stars of CassiopeiaAlpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon Cassiopeiaeform the characteristic W-shaped asterism. All five are prominent naked eye stars, three are noticeably variable, and a fourth is a suspected low amplitude variable. The asterism is oriented as a W when below Polaris during northern spring and summer nights. In northern winter, and when seen from southern latitudes, it is &quot;above&quot; Polaris (i.e. closer to the zenith) and the W appears inverted.

Alpha Cassiopeiae, traditionally called Schedar (from the Arabic &quot;Al Sadr&quot;, &quot;the breast&quot;), is commonly mistaken as a four-star system, but is actually a single star with three physically distant optical components. The primary dominates, an orange-hued giant of magnitude 2.2, from Earth. With a luminosity of around 771 times that of the Sun, it has swollen and cooled after exhausting its core hydrogen over its 100 to 200 million-year lifespan, spending much of it as a blue-white B-type main-sequence star. Magnitude 8.9 yellow dwarf companion (B) is widely separated; companions (C and D) are closer and magnitudes 13 and 14 respectively.

Beta Cassiopeiae, or Caph (meaning &quot;hand&quot;), is a white-hued star of magnitude 2.3, from Earth. Around 1.2 billion years old, it has used up its core hydrogen and begun expanding and cooling off the main sequence. It is around 1.9 times as massive as the Sun, and around 21.3 times as luminous. Rotating at about 92% of its critical speed, Caph completes a full rotation every 1.12 days. This is giving the star an oblate spheroid shape with an equatorial bulge that is 24% larger than the polar radius. It is a Delta Scuti variable with a small amplitude and period of 2.5 hours.

Gamma Cassiopeiae is the prototype Gamma Cassiopeiae variable star, a type of variable star that has a variable disc of material flung off by the high rotation rate of the star. Gamma Cassiopeiae has a minimum magnitude of 3.0 and a maximum magnitude of 1.6, but is generally near magnitude 2.2, with unpredictable fades and brightenings. It is a spectroscopic binary, with an orbital period of 203.59 days and a companion with a calculated mass about the same as the Sun. However, no direct evidence of this companion has been found, leading to speculation that it might be a white dwarf or other degenerate star. It is from Earth.

Delta Cassiopeiae, also known as Ruchbah or Rukbat, meaning &quot;knee,&quot; is a possible Algol-type eclipsing binary star with a maximum brightness of magnitude 2.7. It has been reported to show eclipses of less than 0.1 magnitudes with a period of 2 years and 1 month., but this has never been confirmed. It is from Earth. Delta Cassiopeiae was the star used by Jean Picard in 1669 to establish the length on the Earth&#x27;s surface corresponding to one degree, and hence the radius of the Earth.

Epsilon Cassiopeiae has an apparent magnitude of 3.3. Located from Earth, it is a hot blue-white star of spectral type B3 III with a surface temperature of . It is 6.5 times as massive and 4.2 times as wide as the Sun, and belongs to a class of stars known as Be stars—rapidly spinning stars that throw off a ring or shell of matter.

==== Fainter stars ====

The next seven brightest stars in Cassiopeia are also all confirmed or suspected variable stars, including 50 Cassiopeiae which was not given a Greek letter by Bayer and is a suspected variable with a very small amplitude. Zeta Cassiopeiae (Fulu) is a suspected slowly pulsating B-type star. Kappa Cassiopeiae is a blue supergiant of spectral type BC0.7Ia that is some 302,000 times as luminous as the Sun and has 33 times its diameter. It is a runaway star, moving at around 2.5 million mph relative to its neighbors (1,100 kilometers per second). Its magnetic field and wind of particles creates a visible bow shock 4 light-years ahead of it, colliding with the diffuse, and usually invisible, interstellar gas and dust. The dimensions of the bow shock are vast: around 12 light-years long and 1.8 light-years wide. Theta Cassiopeiae, named Marfak, is a suspected variable star whose brightness changes by less than a tenth of a magnitude. Iota Cassiopeiae is a triple star 142 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.5 and an α2 Canum Venaticorum variable, the secondary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.9, and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 8.4. The primary and secondary are close together but the primary and tertiary are widely separated. Omicron Cassiopeiae is a triple star and the primary is another γ Cassiopeiae variable.

Eta Cassiopeiae (Achird) is the nearest star in Cassiopeia, located some 19.13 ly away. It is a binary star made up of a G-dwarf star similar to the Sun, of apparent magnitude 3.45, and a K-dwarf star of apparent magnitude 7.51. It is visually located between Alpha and Gamma Cassiopeiae and are one of the nearest G-type / K-type stars to Earth.

Sigma Cassiopeiae is a binary star 1500 light-years from Earth. It has a green-hued primary of magnitude 5.0 and a blue-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3. Psi Cassiopeiae is a triple star 193 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.7 and the secondary is a close pair of stars that appears to be of magnitude 9.0.

Rho Cassiopeiae is a semi-regular pulsating variable yellow hypergiant, and is among the most luminous stars in the galaxy at approximately . It has a minimum magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum magnitude of 4.1; its period is approximately 320 days. It has around 450 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter and 17 times its mass, having begun life 45 times as massive as the Sun. Rho Cassiopeiae is about 10,000 light-years from Earth. Cassiopeia includes V509 Cassiopeiae, a second example of the extremely rare yellow hypergiants, which is around 400,000 times as luminous as the Sun and 14 times as massive, as well as 6 Cassiopeiae which is a hotter white hypergiant. It also hosts the red supergiant PZ Cassiopeiae, which is one of the largest known stars with an estimate of and is also a semiregular variable. Between 240,000 and 270,000 times as luminous as the Sun, it is around 9,160 light-years distant from Earth.

AO Cassiopeiae is a binary system composed of an O8 main sequence star and an O9.2 bright giant that respectively weigh anywhere between 20.30 and 57.75 times and 14.8 and 31.73 times the mass of the Sun. The two massive stars are so close to each other they distort each other into egg-shapes.

Tycho Brahe&#x27;s supernova was visible within Cassiopeia, and the star Tycho G is suspected of being the donor of the material that triggered that explosion.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

A rich section of the Milky Way runs through Cassiopeia, stretching from Perseus towards Cygnus, and it contains a number of open clusters, young luminous galactic disc stars, and nebulae.

The Heart Nebula and the Soul Nebula are two neighboring emission nebulae about 7,500 light-years away.

Two Messier objects, M52 (NGC 7654) and M103 (NGC 581), are located in Cassiopeia; both are open clusters. M52, once described as a &quot;kidney-shaped&quot; cluster, contains approximately 100 stars and is from Earth. Its most prominent member is an orange-hued star of magnitude 8.0 near the cluster&#x27;s edge. M103 is far poorer than M52, with only about 25 stars included. It is also more distant, between 8000 and 9500 light-years from Earth. Its most prominent member is actually a closer, superimposed double star; it consists of a 7th-magnitude primary and 10th-magnitude secondary.

The other prominent open clusters in Cassiopeia are NGC 457 and NGC 663, both of which have about 80 stars. NGC 457 is looser, and its brightest member is Phi Cassiopeiae, a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 5.0. However, it is uncertain whether Phi Cassiopeiae is part of the open cluster or not. The stars of NGC 457, arrayed in chains, are approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth. NGC 663 is both closer, at 8200 light-years from Earth, and larger, at 0.25 degrees in diameter.

There are two supernova remnants in Cassiopeia. The first, designated 3C 10 or just &quot;Tycho&#x27;s Supernova Remnant&quot;, is the aftermath of the supernova called Tycho&#x27;s Star. It was observed in 1572 by Tycho Brahe and now exists as a bright object in the radio spectrum. Within the &#x27;W&#x27; asterism formed by Cassiopeia&#x27;s five major stars lies Cassiopeia A (Cas A). It is the remnant of a supernova that took place approximately 300 years ago (as observed now from Earth; it is 10,000 light-years away), and has the distinction of being the strongest radio source observable outside the Solar System. It was perhaps observed as a faint star in 1680 by John Flamsteed. It was also the subject of the first image returned by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory in the late 1990s. The shell of matter expelled from the star is moving at per second; it has a temperature of on average.

NGC 457 is another open cluster in Cassiopeia, also called the E.T. Cluster, the Owl Cluster, and Caldwell 13. The cluster was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel. It has an overall magnitude of 6.4 and is approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth, lying in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way. However, its most prominent member, the double star Phi Cassiopeiae, is far closerbetween 1000 and 4000 light-years away. NGC 457 is fairly rich; it is a Shapley class e and Trumpler class I 3 r cluster. It is concentrated towards its center and detached from the star field. It contains more than 100 stars, which vary widely in brightness.

Two members of the Local Group of galaxies are in Cassiopeia. NGC 185 is a magnitude 9.2 elliptical galaxy of type E0, 2 million light-years away. Slightly dimmer and more distant NGC 147 is a magnitude 9.3 elliptical galaxy, like NGC 185 it is an elliptical of type E0; it is 2.3 million light-years from Earth. Though they do not appear in Andromeda, both dwarf galaxies are gravitationally bound to the far larger Andromeda Galaxy.

IC 10 is an irregular galaxy that is the closest known starburst galaxy and the only one in the Local Group of galaxies.

Cassiopeia also contains part of the closest galaxy group to our Local Group, the IC 342/Maffei Group. The galaxies Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are located just to the south of the Heart and Soul nebulae. As a result of this location in the Zone of Avoidance, both are surprisingly faint despite both being within 10 million light-years away (Maffei 2 is below the range of most amateur telescopes).

=== Meteor shower ===
The December Phi Cassiopeiids are a recently discovered early December meteor shower that radiates from Cassiopeia. Phi Cassiopeiids are very slow, with an entry velocity of approximately 16.7 kilometers per second. The shower&#x27;s parent body is a Jupiter family comet, though its specific identity is unknown.

== Namesakes ==
USS &quot;Cassiopeia&quot; (AK-75) was a United States Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the constellation.

In &quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&quot;, the villainous team, Team Star, is divided into five squads named after the brightest stars in the constellation: Segin Squad, Schedar Squad, Ruchbah Squad, Navi Squad, and Caph Squad. The group&#x27;s leader uses the alias Cassiopeia.

In &quot;Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch&quot;, the penultimate main antagonist and &quot;White Witch&quot; in question is named Queen Cassiopeia.

Cassiopeia is also the name of a song by London-based band Bears in Trees. Although the lyrics of the song mainly refer to the ancient Greek woman, the album cover shows the constellation.

Cassiopeia is the name of a champion in &quot;League of Legends&quot;. Her beauty and vanity mirror the character in Greek mythology.

Casiopea is the name of a Japanese Jazz-Fusion group formed in 1976. The name was chosen by the guitarist&#x27;s mother, solely so the band members could remember the name.

<text>Sula () is a municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is part of the Sunnmøre district. The administrative centre is the village of Langevåg. Other villages include Solevåg, Fiskarstrand, Veibust, Leirvågen, and Mauseidvåg. Sula is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Møre og Romsdal county, and it is part of the Ålesund Region since it is just south of the city of Ålesund. The municipality encompasses the island of Sula and the many small surrounding islets.

The municipality is the 346th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Sula is the 117th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 9,636. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 14.8% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==
Originally, most of the island of Sula was part of Borgund Municipality and the small southwestern part of the island was part of Ulstein Municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 July 1958, the southwestern part of Sula island was transferred to Borgund, unifying the whole island as part of the same municipality. In 1968, Borgund (including all of the island of Sula) was merged with the town of Ålesund to form the large municipality of Ålesund. On 1 January 1977, the entire island of Sula and the many small islets around it were separated from Ålesund to become the new municipality of Sula. The initial population of the Sula was 6,302.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the island of Sula () since the island made up the majority of the municipality. The name is likely derived from the word which means &quot;cleft&quot;, probably referring to the cleft between the twin peaks of &quot;Rundehornet&quot; and &quot;Vardane&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 16 December 1983. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, a chief and pile argent&quot; (). This means the arms have are divided with a horizontal line that has a triangular part that drops below the main line. The field (background) below the line has a tincture of blue. Above the line, the field has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The design was chosen to symbolize the cleft of the island between the twin peaks of &quot;Rundehornet&quot; and &quot;Vardane&quot;. The arms were designed by Jarle Skuseth. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within Sula. It is part of the Nordre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre.

==Geography==

Sula includes one main island and many small surrounding islets. It is bordered by the Sulafjorden strait to the west, the Storfjorden to the south, the Hessafjorden and Borgundfjorden to the north, and the narrow Vegsundet strait to the east. The only road access to the island is the European route E39 highway bridge over the Vegsundet.

The natural environment is typically coastal with a sparse forest. The landscape is mostly rocky with heather covering the ground. The highest elevation is the tall mountain Sulafjellet. Its neighbouring municipalities are all separated from it by sea, with Hareid to the west, Ørsta to the south, Giske to the northwest, and Ålesund to the north and east.

<text>The Country Studies are works published by the Federal Research Division of the United States Library of Congress, freely available for use by researchers. No copyright is claimed on them. Therefore, they have been dedicated to the public domain and can be copied freely, though not all the pictures used therein are in the public domain. The Country Studies Series presents a description and analysis of the historical setting and the social, economic, political, and national security systems and institutions of countries throughout the world. The series examines the interrelationships of those systems and the ways they are shaped by cultural factors.

The books represent the analysis of the authors and should not be construed as an expression of an official United States Government position, policy, or decision. The authors have sought to adhere to accepted standards of scholarly objectivity. 

Online information contained in the online Country Studies is not copyrighted and thus is available for free and unrestricted use by researchers. As a courtesy, however, appropriate credit should be given to the series. The material may be copied into Wikipedia, but its plagiarism rule requires explicit credit be given.

Hard-copy editions of all books in the series (except the regional studies on Macau and Afghanistan) can be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Publishing Office at the U.S. Government Bookstore.

The last appropriation for the program was in fiscal year 2004. In response to this one-time infusion &quot;...the Federal Research Division initiated action to produce five new Country Studies, as well as a number of shorter, updated Country Profiles. All of that work continues, but in the absence of renewed funding ... no additional work can be initiated.&quot;

== Summary of Library of Congress Country Studies ==
The Library of Congress Country Studies is a valuable resource for researchers interested in learning about various countries around the world. Here are the key points:

<doc id="207697" wikidata="Q379761" url="?curid=207697" title="Black crowned crane">
<text>The black crowned crane (Balearica pavonina) is a part of the family Gruidae, along with its sister species, the grey crowned crane. It is topped with its characteristic bristle-feathered golden crown. It is usually found in the shallow wetlands of sub-Saharan Africa during the wet season, which act as its principal breeding, feeding and roosting sites although it can also be found foraging in grasslands and near croplands of dry savanna.

== Taxonomy ==
The black crowned crane was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the cranes and herons in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea pavonina&quot;. He specified the type locality as Africa. Linnaeus cited earlier authors including the English naturalist George Edwards who in 1751 had included a description and a hand-colour etching of the &quot;Crowned African Crane&quot; in the fourth volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. The black crowned crane is now placed together with the grey crowned crane in the genus &quot;Balearica&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is from Latin &quot;Baliaricus&quot; meaning &quot;of the Balearic Islands&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;pavonina&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;peacock-like&quot; or &quot;patterned or coloured like the peacock’s tail&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. p. ceciliae&quot; Mitchell, PC, 1904 – southwest Chad to west Ethiopia to northwest Kenya and north Uganda
* &quot;B. p. pavonina&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Senegal and Gambia to Chad

== Description ==

The black crowned crane can measure up to in length, weigh between and has a wingspan of . Naturally, it is characterized by its dark slate-grey to black plumage, and it has stiff golden feathers at the top of its head which make up its crown. Each golden bristle-like feather is a spiral that is white on one side and brown on the other with black at the very tip. 

Other distinct features of these birds include the white feathers on the upper section of their wings and the small pouch of red skin, the gular sac, hanging underneath their chins. Their long legs and their toes are black, and they possess a long hind toe that allows them to grasp onto perches. The black crowned crane also has large red cheek patches just behind its eye that differ in size between its two subspecies; the West African black crowned crane (&quot;Balearica pavonina pavonina&quot;) has red on the lower half of its cheek patch while the Sudan black crowned crane (&quot;Balearica pavonine ceciliae&quot;) has red extending to the upper half as well. Male black crowned cranes are larger but are otherwise indistinguishable from females. Juveniles are mostly grey with a brown crown and a nape, grey to brown body.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The black crowned crane is found across the Sahel and Sudan savanna regions of Africa, occupying open areas such as grasslands, shallow wetlands, marshes, as well as the margins of lakes and rivers. It is also known to roost in trees. Its range extends from the Senegal Basin and Guinea-Bissau Drainage in West Africa to the Ethiopian Highlands and South-West Rift Valley in East Africa. &quot;Balearica pavonina pavonina&quot; occupies the western part of this range, while &quot;Balearica pavonina ceciliae&quot; is found in the east with the greatest numbers in Sudan.

== Behavior ==

=== Vocalization ===
Black crowned crane vocalization is characterized as generally low-pitched and mellow “honk” and “ka-wonk ka-wonk ka-wonk” expressions.

=== Diet ===
Black crowned cranes are generalist feeders, with a diet consisting of insects like grasshoppers, locust, and flies; other invertebrates, like molluscs, millipedes, and crustaceans; fish, amphibians, and small reptiles. They will be mostly resident to wetlands except during the dry season and will sometimes forage in short and dry grasses or in upland areas by livestock where insect numbers are high. Black crowned cranes may also forage in croplands and feed on rice, corn, teff, millet, chickpea, and lentil. They will seldom dig for food but rather will peck at it off surfaces. As an alternative to digging, they might stomp their feet to disturb and reveal invertebrates in the soil.

=== Breeding ===

Breeding may occur from May to December for the West African black crowned crane and from July to January for the Sudan black crowned crane. The margins for breeding time are wide as breeding success is dependent on the wet and dry seasons and the suitability of the environment. Black crowned crane numbers will peak in the dry season where flocks may include several hundred individuals. They gather in this way before the next breeding season commences, which allows for juvenile cranes to merge with other young flocks that have not yet reached the first breeding age of 3–5 years. In the breeding season, Black crowned cranes are usually found in pairs but are also observed in groups of up to 20 individuals.

Nests (base of 69–109 mm x 71–140 mm diameters) are built within or on the edges of dense wetlands and are constructed with grasses and sedges modified into circular platforms. Due to their opportunistic nature regarding food availability and shelter, Black crowned cranes may alter their nesting sites accordingly with the season. Clutch sizes for the black crowned crane are made up of 1 to 3 eggs, which will be in mass. Incubation of eggs will be performed by both males and females and will last 28–31 days. Males are known to stand guard by the nest in nearby trees, prepared to signal a threat, as females forage. Chicks will forage with their parents in grassland areas the day after hatching. Fledging takes place between 60–100 days.

== Conservation status and threats ==
Currently, the black crowned crane is listed as a Vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, with a population of 28 000–47 000 individuals remaining. Black crowned cranes face major conservation threats due to the degradation of wetlands which act as the principal breeding, feeding and roosting sites for the species. Increases in drought and the draining of wetlands in the name of farming, dam construction or irrigation projects have led to the destruction of these ecosystems. Furthermore, fragmented wetlands result in reduced movement of aquatic mammals and therefore limits Black crowned crane food availability. The negative effects of habitat degradation on black crowned crane populations are further aggravated by the hunting, capturing or trade of these birds which have claimed much of their remaining wild populations.

== In culture ==
The black crowned crane is the national bird of Nigeria, and is often regarded as a symbol of peace.

<text>USS &quot;Independence&quot; (CVL-22) (also CV-22) was a United States Navy light aircraft carrier. The lead ship of her class, she served during World War II.

Converted from the hull of a Cleveland-class light cruiser, she was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and commissioned in January 1943. She took part in the attacks on Rabaul and Tarawa before being torpedoed by Japanese aircraft, necessitating repairs in San Francisco from January to July 1944.

After repairs, she launched many strikes against targets in Luzon and Okinawa. &quot;Independence&quot; was part of the carrier group that sank the remnants of the Japanese Mobile Fleet in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and several other Japanese ships in the Surigao Strait. Until the surrender of Japan, she was assigned to strike duties against targets in the Philippines and Japan. She finished her operational duty off the coast of Japan supporting occupation forces until being assigned to return American veterans back to the United States as part of Operation Magic Carpet.

&quot;Independence&quot; was later used as a target during the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests. After being transported back to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco for study, she was later sunk near the Farallon Islands.

==Construction and deployment==
Begun as light cruiser &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, CL-59, she was launched as CV-22 on 22 August 1942 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy Warner, wife of Rawleigh Warner, Sr, Chairman of Pure Oil Co., and commissioned 14 January 1943.

The first of a new class of carriers converted from cruiser hulls, &quot;Independence&quot; conducted shakedown training in the Caribbean. She then steamed through the Panama Canal to join the Pacific Fleet, arriving at San Francisco on 3 July 1943. &quot;Independence&quot; got underway for Pearl Harbor 14 July, and after two weeks of training exercises sailed with carriers and for a raid on Marcus Island. Aircraft from the carrier force struck on 1 September and destroyed over 70 percent of the installations on the island. The carrier began her next operation, a similar strike against Wake Island 5 to 6 October as CVL-22, having been redesignated 15 July 1943.

=== Rabaul and Gilbert Islands strikes ===
&quot;Independence&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor for Espiritu Santo on 21 October. During an ensuing carrier attack on Rabaul on 11 November, the ship&#x27;s gunners scored their first success – six Japanese aircraft shot down. After this operation, the carrier refueled at Espiritu Santo, headed for the Gilbert Islands, and conducted pre-landing strikes on Tarawa 18 to 20 November 1943. During a Japanese counterattack on 20 November, &quot;Independence&quot; was attacked by a group of aircraft low on the water. Six were shot down, but the aircraft launched at least five torpedoes, one of which hit the carrier&#x27;s starboard quarter. Seriously damaged, the ship steamed to Funafuti on 23 November for emergency repairs. &quot;Independence&quot; returned to San Francisco 2 January 1944 for more permanent repairs.

=== Refitting and training for night operations ===
The now-veteran carrier returned to Pearl Harbor 3 July 1944. During her repair period, the ship had been fitted with an additional catapult, and upon her arrival in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Independence&quot; began training for night carrier operations embarking the specially trained night fighter and torpedo units of Night Air Group 41 (NAG-41) in August. She continued this pioneering work 24 to 29 August out of Eniwetok. The ship sailed with a large task group 29 August to take part in the Palau operation and the Battle of Peleliu, aimed at securing bases for the final assault on the Philippines in October. &quot;Independence&quot; provided night reconnaissance and night combat air patrol for Task Force 38 during this operation.

=== Philippines ===
In September the fast carrier task force regularly pounded the Philippines in preparation for the invasion. When no Japanese counterattacks developed in this period, &quot;Independence&quot; shifted to regular daytime operations, striking targets on Luzon. After replenishment at Ulithi in early October, the great force sortied 6 October for Okinawa. In the days that followed the carriers struck Okinawa, Formosa, and the Philippines. Japanese air counterattacks were repulsed, with &quot;Independence&quot; providing day strike groups in addition to night fighters and reconnaissance aircraft for defensive protection.

As the carrier groups steamed east of the Philippines 23 October, it became apparent, as Admiral Carney later recalled, that &quot;something on a grand scale was underfoot.&quot; And indeed it was, as the Japanese fleet moved in a three-pronged effort to turn back the American beachhead on Leyte Gulf. Aircraft from &quot;Independence&quot;″s Task Group 38.2, under Rear Admiral Bogan, spotted Kurita&#x27;s striking force in the Sibuyan Sea 24 October and the carriers launched a series of attacks. Aircraft from Task Group 38.2 and other task groups sank the battleship and disabled the heavy cruiser Myoko. Embarking a night carrier air group, Independence played no role in the attacks on Kurita&#x27;s force on the 24th.

That evening Admiral Halsey made the decision to turn Task Force 38 northward in search of Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s carrier group. &quot;Independence&quot;″s night search aircraft made contact and shadowed the Japanese ships of the northern force until dawn on 25 October, when the carriers launched an attack. In this second part of the great Battle for Leyte Gulf, all four Japanese carriers were sunk. Meanwhile, American heavy ships had won a victory to secure the Surigao Strait; and an escort carrier force had outfought the remainder of Kurita&#x27;s ships in the Battle off Samar; &quot;Independence&quot; sailed with TF38 during the destruction of Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s northern diversion fleet off Cape Engaño. After the battle, which virtually spelled the end of the Japanese Navy as a major threat, &quot;Independence&quot; continued to provide search aircraft and night fighter protection for TF 38 in strikes against the Philippines.

&quot;Independence&quot; returned to Ulithi for long-delayed rest and replenishment 9 to 14 November, but soon got underway to operate off the Philippines on night attacks and defensive operations. This phase continued until 30 December 1944, when the task force sortied from Ulithi once more and moved northward. From 3 to 9 January 1945 the carriers supported the Lingayen landings on Luzon, after which Halsey took his fleet on a foray into the South China Sea. In the days that followed the aircraft struck at air bases on Formosa and on the coasts of Indo-China and China. These operations in support of the Philippines campaign marked the end of the carrier&#x27;s night operations, and she sailed 30 January 1945 for repairs at Pearl Harbor.

=== Okinawa ===
&quot;Independence&quot; returned to Ulithi 13 March 1945 and got underway next day for operations against Okinawa. She carried out pre-invasion strikes 30 to 31 March, and after the assault 1 April remained off the island supplying combat air patrol and strike aircraft. Her aircraft shot down numerous enemy aircraft during the desperate Japanese attacks on the invasion force. &quot;Independence&quot; remained off Okinawa until 10 June when she sailed for Leyte.

During July and August the carrier took part in the final carrier strikes against Japan itself. After the end of the war 15 August, &quot;Independence&quot; aircraft continued surveillance flights over the mainland locating prisoner of war camps and covered the landings of Allied occupation troops. The ship departed Tokyo 22 September 1945, arriving at San Francisco via Saipan and Guam 31 October.

=== Operation Crossroads ===

&quot;Independence&quot; joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet beginning 15 November 1945, transporting veterans back to the United States until arriving at San Francisco once more 28 January 1946. Assigned as a target vessel for the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests, she was placed within one half mile of ground zero for the 1 July explosion. The veteran ship did not sink (though her funnels and island were crumpled by the blast), and after taking part in another explosion on 25 July was taken to Kwajalein and decommissioned 28 August 1946.

==Sinking and wreck==
The highly radioactive hull was later moved to Pearl Harbor and then San Francisco for further tests. She was finally scuttled near the Farallon Islands off the coast of California on 29 January 1951, by packing two torpedoes in her hull.

Controversy has subsequently arisen about the sinking of &quot;Independence,&quot; as it is claimed that she was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste at the time of her sinking, and that the waste has subsequently contaminated the wildlife refuge and commercial fisheries associated with the Farallon Islands. However, in 2015, it was considered that &quot;any public health risk was small&quot;, as might be expected after this period of time.

In 2009 the position of the wreck of &quot;Independence&quot; in of water in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary off the Farallon Islands at approximately was confirmed via deep-water multibeam sonar survey conducted from the . In March 2015, scientists and technicians of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the sanctuary vessel R/V &quot;Fulmar&quot; used the autonomous underwater vehicle &quot;Echo Ranger&quot; to survey the wreck, employing the Echoscope three-dimensional imaging sonar to make a series of images. The ship is resting upright with a slight list to starboard and most of the flight deck intact, although there are gaping holes in the flight deck leading to the hangar deck below. No signs of radioactive contamination were detected, although the barrels of waste are still visible inside the hangar deck, and some have rusted open. A NOAA spokesman described the wreck as &quot;amazingly intact.&quot;

In 2016, a mission led by James P. Delgado, deep-sea archaeologist, and partnered with the Ocean Exploration Trust and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, brought investigators closer to the wreckage than ever before. Using robotic exploration vehicles, the team surveyed the USS &quot;Independence&quot; for the first time since she sank 65 years ago, streaming footage online. While investigating the wreckage, researchers found evidence of at least one existing Grumman Hellcat plane as well as the partial remains of an SB2C-4 Helldiver and 40-millimeter and 20-millimeter anti-aircraft weaponry.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Independence&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="207723" wikidata="Q592832" url="?curid=207723" title="Integralism">
<text>In politics, integralism, integrationism or integrism () is an interpretation of Catholic social teaching that argues the principle that the Catholic faith should be the basis of public law and public policy within civil society, wherever the preponderance of Catholics within that society makes this possible. Integralism is anti-pluralist, seeking the Catholic faith to be dominant in civil and religious matters. Integralists uphold the 1864 definition of Pope Pius IX in &quot;Quanta cura&quot; that the religious neutrality of the civil power cannot be embraced as an ideal situation and the doctrine of Leo XIII in &quot;Immortale Dei&quot; on the religious obligations of states. In December 1965, the Second Vatican Council approved and Pope Paul VI promulgated the document &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;–the Council&#x27;s &quot;Declaration on Religious Freedom&quot;–which states that it &quot;leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ&quot;. However, they have simultaneously declared &quot;that the human person has a right to religious freedom,&quot; a move that some traditionalist Catholics such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the founder of the Society of St. Pius X, have argued is at odds with previous doctrinal pronouncements.

The term is sometimes used more loosely and in non-Catholic contexts to refer to a set of theoretical concepts and practical policies that advocate a fully integrated social and political order based on a comprehensive doctrine of human nature. In this generic sense some forms of integralism are focused purely on achieving political and social integration, others national or ethnic unity, while others were more focused on achieving religious and cultural uniformity. Integralism has, thus, also been used to describe non-Catholic religious movements, such as Protestant fundamentalism or Islamism. In the political and social history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the term integralism was often applied to traditionalist conservatism and similar political movements on the right wing of a political spectrum, but it was also adopted by various centrist movements as a tool of political, national and cultural integration.

As a distinct intellectual and political movement, integralism emerged during the 19th and early 20th century polemics within the Catholic Church, especially in France. The term was used as an epithet to describe those who opposed the modernists, who had sought to create a synthesis between Christian theology and the liberal philosophy of secular modernity. Proponents of Catholic political integralism taught that all social and political action ought to be based on the Catholic Faith. They rejected the separation of church and state, arguing that Catholicism should be the proclaimed religion of the state.

==Catholic integralism==
===History===

The first polity that formally embraced Christianity was Armenia under Tiridates III. However, the establishment of the civil order upheld by integralists is generally thought of as beginning with the conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine I in 312. While Constantine personally embraced Christianity, it was only in 380 that Theodosius I formally adopted Nicene Christianity as the religion of the empire by the Edict of Thessalonica. What R. W. Southern called the identification of the Church with the whole of organised society was intensified by the legal reforms of Justinian in the 6th century. The climactic stage in the identification began in the Latin West with the papal transference of Translatio imperii to Charlemagne in 800. The Constantinian age began to decline with the Reformation and is generally treated as ending with the French Revolution. In 1950, Pius XII identified the Dominican friar and prophet Savonarola as an early pioneer of integralism in the face of the &quot;neo-pagan&quot; influences of the Renaissance: &quot;Savonarola shows us the strong conscience of the ascetic and an apostle who has a lively sense of things divine and eternal, who takes a stand against rampant paganism, who remains faithful to the evangelical and Pauline ideal of integral Christianity, put into action in public life as well and animating all institutions. This is why he started preaching, prompted by an interior voice and inspired by God.&quot;

===Teachings===
Catholic integralism is an interpretation of Catholic social teaching that argues for an authoritarian and anti-pluralist Catholic state, wherever the preponderance of Catholics within that society makes this possible; it was born in 19th-century Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy. It was a movement that sought to assert a Catholic underpinning to all social and political action and to minimize or eliminate any competing ideological actors, such as secular humanism and liberalism. Integralism arose in opposition to liberalism, which some Catholics saw as a &quot;relentless and destructive ideology&quot;. Catholic integralism does not support the creation of an autonomous &quot;Catholic&quot; State Church, or Erastianism (Gallicanism in French context). Rather, it supports subordinating the state to the moral principles of Catholicism. Thus, it rejects separating morality from the state and favours Catholicism as the proclaimed religion of the state.

Catholic integralism appeals to the teaching on the necessity of the subordination of the state and on the subordination of temporal to spiritual power of medieval popes such as Pope Gregory VII and Pope Boniface VIII. However, Catholic integralism as a more consciously articulated doctrine came about as a reaction against the political and cultural changes that followed the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. The 19th-century papacy challenged the growth of liberalism (with its doctrine of popular sovereignty) as well as new scientific and historical methods and theories (which were thought to threaten the special status of the Christian revelation). Pope Pius IX condemned a list of liberal and Enlightenment ideas in his &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;. The term &quot;integralism&quot; was applied to a Spanish political party founded about 1890, which based its programme on the &quot;Syllabus&quot;. Catholic integralism reached its &quot;classical&quot; form in the reaction against modernism. The term did not, however, become popular till the time of Pope Pius X, whose papacy lasted from 1903 to 1914. After the papal condemnation of modernism in 1907, those most active in promoting the papal teachings were sometimes referred to as &quot;integral Catholics&quot; (), from which the words &quot;intégrisme&quot; (integrism) and &quot;intégralisme&quot; (integralism) were derived. Encouraged by Pope Pius X, they sought out and exposed any co-religionist whom they suspected of modernism or liberalism. An important integralist organization was the Sodalitium Pianum, known in France as &quot;La Sapinière&quot; (fir plantation), which was founded in 1909 by Umberto Benigni.

Another component of the anti-modernist programme of Pius X was its insistence on the importance of Thomas Aquinas, both in theology and philosophy. In his decree &quot;Postquam Sanctissimus&quot; of 1914, the pope published a list of 24 philosophical theses to summarise &#x27;the principles and more important thoughts&#x27; of St Thomas. Thus integralism is also understood to include a commitment to the teachings of the Angelic Doctor, understood especially as a bulwark against the subjectivist and sceptical philosophies emanating from Descartes and his successors.

===Political authority===
The idea that temporal political authority should be subordinated to man’s ultimate, spiritual end is a common theme – if not the main theme – of contemporary Catholic integralism.

===Revival===
Contemporary discussions of integralism were renewed in 2014, focusing on criticism of liberalism and capitalism.

In recent years, however, a &quot;revived Catholic integralism&quot; has been noted among the younger generation of Catholics writing for websites such as &quot;The Josias&quot;. Integralism could be said to merely be the modern continuation of the traditional Catholic conception of Church–State relations elucidated by Pope Gelasius I and expounded upon throughout the centuries up to the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, which condemned the idea that the separation of Church and State is a moral good. For example, some Catholics have praised the actions of Pius IX in the 1858 Mortara case, in which he ordered the abduction of a six-year-old Jewish boy who had been baptized without his parents&#x27; consent. A systematic account of Catholic integralism as a coherent political philosophy has recently been attempted by Thomas Crean and Alan Fimister in their work, &#x27;Integralism: a manual of political philosophy&#x27;.

Scholars have drawn parallels between Catholic integralism and a view held by a minority in the Reformed churches, Christian reconstructionism. In the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, Joshua J. McElwee stated that both Catholic integralists and Reformed Christian reconstructionists have created a non-traditional ecumenical alliance to achieve the goal of establishing a &quot;theocratic type of state&quot;. Some integralists place themselves on the left wing of the political spectrum. Tradistae and Tradinista, both groups acknowledge what they see as the duty of the state towards the Catholic Church as well as supporting Liberation Theology and rejecting capitalism.

Integralism has been identified as a basis for modern legal conceptions that emphasize natural law, including common good constitutionalism. Proposed and popularized by Adrian Vermeule, common good constitutionalism was developed like integralism to &quot;combat the legitimate societal threat of modern liberal individualism&quot;. Some Protestant figures, such as Brad Littlejohn, have expressed interest in integralism and contended it more closely resembles a traditionally Protestant account of politics rather than a Catholic one.

==Variants of integralism==

There are a number of variants and localized permutations of integralist political theory, often named by their country of origin.

===French integralism===
The term &quot;intégrisme&quot; is largely used generically and pejoratively in French philosophical and sociopolitical parlance, particularly to label any religious extremism. Integralism in the narrow sense is often but controversially applied to the integral nationalism and &quot;Action Française&quot; movement founded by Charles Maurras although Maurras was an atheist and his movement was condemned by Rome as &#x27;political modernism&#x27; in 1926. Jacques Maritain claimed that his own position of Integral humanism, which he adopted after rejecting &quot;Action Française&quot;, was the authentically integralist stance, although it is generally viewed as its antithesis.

===Portuguese integralism===
&quot;Integralismo Lusitano&quot; (Lusitanian Integralism) was the integralist movement of Portugal, founded in 1914. Portuguese integralism was traditionalist, but not conservative. It was against parliamentarism and, instead, it favored decentralization, Catholicism and the monarchy.

===Brazilian integralism===

Somewhat rooted in the Portuguese integralist tradition, the Brazilian integralist movement led by Plínio Salgado – Ação Integralista Brasileira – was founded in Brazil in 7 October 1932; it lasted less than six years as a legally recognized organization. Salgado&#x27;s organization was, however, an integral nationalist movement only tangentially connected to Catholic integralism.

===Spanish integralism===

The political implications of Catholic integralism are apparent in the Basque-Navarrese context of Spain, where that Integrism or Traditionalist Catholicism refers to a 19th- and 20th-century anti-Liberal movement advocating for the re-establishment of not only clerical but also native institutions lost in the context of the First Carlist War (1833, 1840). One of its branches evolved by the turn of the 20th century into Basque nationalism.

The term may also refer to the Spanish formation (1888–1932) led by Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal.

==Criticism==
The Southern Poverty Law Center uses the term &quot;integrism&quot; to refer to &quot;radical traditional Catholics&quot; who reject the Second Vatican Council. SPLC describes them as antisemitic and &quot;extremely conservative&quot; regarding women, and also notes that some claim recent popes are illegitimate.

Critics and opponents of integralism, such as George Weigel, argue that the movement can be associated with fascism. Supporters of integralism argue that it is a mistake to associate the movement with fascism, stating that it developed before fascism, and that collaboration between fascist and integralist groups is overstated. John Zmirak criticizes contemporary Catholic integralists as enemies of &quot;religious liberty&quot;, while authors such as Thomas Pink insist integralism is compatible with Vatican II&#x27;s account of religious freedom.

<text>Milton is a riverside inner suburb of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Milton had a population of 3,144 people.

== Geography ==
Milton is by road west of the Brisbane CBD. The suburb is a mixture of light industry, warehouses, commercial offices, retail and single and multiple occupancy residences. The main roads are Milton Road, which runs beside the main western rail line and Coronation Drive (formerly River Road), which runs along the Brisbane River.

== History ==
Settlement in the Milton area by Europeans began in the 1840s, with land mostly used for farming and grazing.

The suburb&#x27;s name was derived from the farm name &quot;Milton Farm&quot;, used from the late 1840s by Ambrose Eldridge, chemist. Eldridge named the farm after John Milton, the English poet.

Circa 1862, the Anglican Church established a mortuary chapel for the North Brisbane Burial Ground (now Lang Park). It was demolished in 1891.

Christ Church Anglican was dedicated in 1876. It was re-built and re-dedicated in 1891.

In 1878, 68 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by John Cameron on Monday, 27 May 1878. This area was called the &quot;Milton Estate&quot; and was subdivisions of portion 14 in the parish of Enoggera. The allotments were situated across the road from the Milton railway station. It was reported in The Brisbane Courier that 44 of the 68 allotments were sold at the auction for between £11 and £39.

In 1879, 98 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by J.B. Ellis &amp; Co on Monday, 24 February 1879. This area was called the &quot;Bayswater Estate&quot; and was subdivision of portions 228 and 229 in the parish of Enoggera.

Milton State School opened on 18 March 1889. In 1989 the school celebrated its centenary.

In 1899, 461 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love &amp; Co on Saturday, 2 September 1899 (Federation Day), Saturday 9 September 1899 and Saturday 16 September 1899. This area was called the &quot;Dunmore Estate&quot; and is now mostly in Toowong as well as partly in Milton. On the real estate map for &quot;Dunmore Estate&quot;, Cribb&#x27;s Paddock, Milton is a black and white photo titled &quot;Panoramic view of the river looking towards town&quot;. In 1899 it was advertised in the Brisbane Courier for contractors for the &quot;Dunmore Estate&quot;, Cribb&#x27;s Paddock, Milton to make an access road through the lagoon and a roadway under the railway bridge. It was reported in The Brisbane Courier and The Telegraph that a total of 240 lots were sold - 108 lots on 2 September 1899, 81 lots on 9 September 1899 and 51 lots on 16 September 1899.

Between 1900 and 1962, Milton was served by trams running along Milton Road from Toowong and Rainworth, with the latter branching off at Baroona Road. The services were withdrawn after the disastrous Paddington tram depot fire and replaced by buses. The suburb continues to be served by most western suburb bus routes operated by Transport for Brisbane.

In 1911, 20 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love &amp; Co on Saturday, 30 September 1911. This area was called the &quot;Payne Estate&quot; and was subdivisions 4 to 7 and 10 to 22 and 27 to 29 in the parish of Enoggera. The allotments were situated on Park Road, Milton near the Brisbane River and near Milton Railway Station. It was reported in The Brisbane Courier that 15 of the 20 allotments were sold at the auction.

In 1913, 32 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros. on Saturday, 10 May 1913. This area was called the &quot;Fairholme Estate&quot;. It was reported in The Telegraph that 28 allotments were sold at the auction.

The Morrow biscuit factory opened in December 1913 on the north-east corner of Coronation Drive and Boomerang Street (). In 1949 the Morrow company merged with the Arnott&#x27;s Biscuits company and the factory became known as the Arnott&#x27;s factory from 1956. It was well known because of the pleasant smell of baking biscuits that surrounded it and was a landmark structure. The factory was vacated in the 1990s when Arnotts&#x27; moved their Brisbane operations to 46 Robinson Road East, Virginia. The Milton Morrow/Arnott&#x27;s site was demolished and redeveloped as apartments in 2004.

Milton Courts opened in 1915. They were Brisbane&#x27;s major tennis courts, where major international and national tournaments were held until the courts closed in the 1990s.

Between 1927 and 1969, the Brisbane City Council&#x27;s tramway workshops were located at Boomerang Street, a site formerly used as a nightsoil dump. Trams accessed the workshops from Milton Road, under the railway line. After the closure of the tram system on 13 April 1969, the workshops continued to be used to service the City Council&#x27;s bus fleet, until the workshop complex was shifted to Toowong in 1979. The workshops were then demolished and the site used as a successful &quot;Park and Ride&quot; car park, where commuters could park their cars at the edge of the CBD and continue their journey by bus. However, in the late 1980s, a change in City Council policy saw the site sold for office development.

The Brisbane City Council&#x27;s trolley-bus depot and garage was located between Chippendall and Castlemaine Streets and operated between 1951 and 1969. The building remained until it was demolished to make way for the redevelopment of Lang Park as a stadium.

Hubbard&#x27;s School (also known as Hubbards Academy) opened in 1952 as an after-school tutoring institution. From 1953, it accepted students on a full-time basis.

Milton Bowl opened in 1962. It was a ten-pin bowling alley located at the Rosalie end of the suburb. It closed on 17 March 2008, after 45 years.

In January 2011, Milton experienced flooding as part of the 2010–2011 Queensland floods.

In 2014, Brisbane City Council redeveloped the former Milton Courts and Milton Bowl sites as Frew Park, a large inner city parkland incorporating tennis courts, children&#x27;s playground and open space.

=== Lang Park ===

Lang Park is at 40 Castlemaine Street, Milton, with frontage and entrance now on Caxton Street, Paddington (). In 1840 the site was originally established as a cemetery by Reverend John Dunmore Lang for which it was used until 1875. In 1911 the cemetery was closed and most of the graves were moved to Toowong and Lutwyche Cemeteries. The site then became a rubbish tip. In 1914 the site established as parkland (John Brown Oval after a City Council alderman and used for cycling, athletics and soccer). In 1955 Frank Burke persuaded Queensland Rugby League to sign a 21-year lease on the grounds with the Brisbane City Council and the newly christened Lang Park became the official headquarters for the Rugby League football code in Queensland. The first Rugby League match was held there in 1958 and in 1963 the Lang Park Trust was established under an Act of Parliament. Rugby internationals (1965 First Rugby Union Test against South African Springboks), cricket internationals (1966 the Ashes campaign, Australia vs. Great Britain with a new attendance record of 45,047), soccer internationals (1970 Queensland vs Russian Club Moscow Dynamo) and local baseball (1972 All Stars vs Ipswich with a 2,000 crowd) were played there. The first State of Origin match between Queensland and New South Wales was held there in 1980, and it became the home of the Brisbane Broncos Rugby league team (1988–92, 2003– ), and the now defunct Crushers rugby league team (1995). The old stadium and its various grandstands were demolished in 2000 (quite controversially) and a new state of the art modern stadium was completed in 2003 and rechristened Suncorp Stadium after its major corporate sponsor. Older fans still refer to the ground as Lang Park as do some media personalities much to the chagrin of the Suncorp sponsor. Radio humorists and State of Origin match callers, Roy and HG, were reprimanded for referring to the new stadium as Lang Park and from then on referred to the site as &quot;the place formerly called Lang Park&quot;.Officially the correct title is the Suncorp Stadium at Lang Park. The stadium is unofficially known as &quot;The Cauldron&quot;, and Queensland fans developed a reputation for vocal support of their teams, adding to this mythology. Extensive use of steel has helped to provide a built-in atmosphere and the designers of the redevelopment have opted for the use of a low flat steel roof because of its ability to enclose crowd noise within the stadium and re-creating the Cauldron atmosphere of the original Lang Park.

The 1992 statue of rugby league footballer Wally Lewis erected at the southern end of the Stadium.

== Transport ==
By ferry, the Milton ferry wharf () is at the end of Park Road as it meets Coronation Drive.

By train, the Milton railway station () is the first station on the Ipswich line west of Roma Street Station. It is served by commuter trains only.

<text>Phoenicopteriformes is a group of water birds which comprises flamingos and their extinct relatives. Flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes) and the closely related grebes (Podicipedidae) are contained in the parent clade Mirandornithes.


== Fossil record ==
Flamingos and their relatives are well attested in the fossil record, with the first unequivocal member of the Phoenicopteridae, &quot;Elornis&quot;, known from the late Eocene epoch.

=== Relation to extinct palaelodids ===
The Palaelodidae – an extinct family of peculiar &quot;swimming flamingos&quot; – are believed to be the closest relatives of the modern flamingos, with the extinct genus &quot;Juncitarsus&quot; slightly more primitive than the clade which contains flamingos and grebes (Mirandornithes).

The foot and wing anatomy of fossil palaelodids suggests that they were surface-swimming birds, rather than grebe-like divers as was proposed in the past. Whether swimmers or divers, that both primitive phoenicopteriforms and their closest relatives, the grebes, were highly aquatic, indicates that the entire clade Mirandornithes evolved from aquatic, probably swimming ancestors.

<doc id="207737" wikidata="Q1128283" url="?curid=207737" title="Mydriasis">
<text>Mydriasis is the dilation of the pupil, usually having a non-physiological cause, or sometimes a physiological pupillary response. Non-physiological causes of mydriasis include disease, trauma, or the use of certain types of drugs. It may also be of unknown cause.

Normally, as part of the pupillary light reflex, the pupil dilates in the dark and constricts in the light to respectively improve vividity at night and to protect the retina from sunlight damage during the day. A &quot;mydriatic&quot; pupil will remain excessively large even in a bright environment. The excitation of the radial fibres of the iris which increases the pupillary aperture is referred to as a mydriasis. More generally, mydriasis also refers to the natural dilation of pupils, for instance in low light conditions or under sympathetic stimulation. Mydriasis is frequently induced by drugs for certain ophthalmic examinations and procedures, particularly those requiring visual access to the retina.

Fixed, unilateral mydriasis could be a symptom of raised intracranial pressure. The opposite, constriction of the pupil, is referred to as miosis. Both mydriasis and miosis can be physiological. Anisocoria is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other.

==Causes==

There are two types of muscle that control the size of the iris: the iris sphincter, composed of circularly arranged muscle fibers, and the iris dilator, composed of radially arranged muscle fibers. The sphincter is controlled by nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system, and the dilator by the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic stimulation of the adrenergic receptors causes the contraction of the radial muscle and subsequent dilation of the pupil. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation causes contraction of the circular muscle and constriction of the pupil.

The mechanism of mydriasis depends on the agent being used. It usually involves either a disruption of the parasympathetic nerve supply to the eye (which normally constricts the pupil) or overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
Pupil diameter also increases in reaction to cognitive tasks requiring memory and attention, and this phenomenon is used as an indicator of mental activation (‘arousal’) in psychophysiological experiments.

=== Drugs ===
A mydriatic is an agent that induces dilation of the pupil. Drugs such as tropicamide are used in medicine to permit examination of the retina and other deep structures of the eye. Mydriatics typically also have a cycloplegic effect, reducing or paralyzing the accommodation reflex which may also be used for certain ophthalmic examinations or treatments, such as reducing painful ciliary muscle spasm. One effect of administration of a mydriatic is intolerance to bright light (photophobia). Purposefully-induced mydriasis via mydriatics is also used as a diagnostic test for Horner&#x27;s syndrome.

Mydriasis can be induced via modulation of adrenergic or cholinergic signalling.

Drugs that can cause mydriasis include:
* Stimulants (typically monoaminergics) such as amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA, and mephedrone.
* Anticholinergics such as diphenhydramine, atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine antagonize the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the eye. Blocking acetylcholine receptors reduces the pupillary muscles&#x27; ability to constrict and causes dilation (which is critical in eye surgery procedures such as cataract surgery which require uninterrupted access to the inner eye via the pupillary aperture, thus requiring that the eye be both paralyzed and anesthetized before the procedure can go ahead). The antimuscarinic, tropicamide, may be used as a mydriastic agent during surgery.
* Serotonergics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and 2C-B. These drugs are typically hallucinogens. Similarly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause mydriasis.
* Dissociatives such as dextromethorphan (an SSRI and sigma-1 agonist).
* Certain GABAergic drugs, such as phenibut and GHB.
* Adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine and cyclomydril. Adrenergic agonists may be used if strong mydriasis is needed in surgery. Norepinephrine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that regulates the involuntary muscles of the autonomic nervous system, including dilation of the pupil aperture via the muscles of the iris. Hence adrenergic agonists mimic the activity of norepinephrine, which is how they induce mydriasis.

Natural release of the hormone oxytocin can cause mild to moderate mydriasis.

Long term effects of drugs can also cause mydriasis, for example opioid withdrawal.

Marijuana can cause mydriasis.

===Autonomic neuropathy===
Parasympathetic fibers travel with cranial nerve III, the oculomotor nerve, to innervate the circular layer of muscle of the eye (sphincter pupillae). Damage to this nerve typically manifests itself as mydriasis, because the sympathetic supply to the pupil, which causes mydriasis, remains unaffected, and therefore unopposed.

Multiple central nervous system disorders e.g. epilepsy, stroke, and impending brain herniation are known to lead to temporal mydriasis as well. A brain catastrophe, or a rapidly increasing brain mass, can cause compression of the oculomotor nerve.

===Trauma===
In cases of head injury or orbit trauma (eye injury), the iris sphincter (the muscle responsible for closing the pupil) or the nerves controlling it can be damaged, reducing or eliminating the normal pupillary light reflex.

<text>An outside flame ignitor was an early ignition device used in internal-combustion engines that used a flame outside the engine and a sliding port on the cylinder head. At the appropriate time in the compression cycle of the engine, the port would briefly be opened and closed allowing the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder to be ignited by the flame. They had many problems, including partial loss of compression through the port when it opened and many mechanical problems with the mechanism that operated the port. They were considered obsolete before 1911.

<doc id="207745" wikidata="Q561596" url="?curid=207745" title="Johnny Clegg">
<text>Jonathan Paul Clegg, (7 June 195316 July 2019) was a South African musician, singer-songwriter, dancer, anthropologist and anti-apartheid activist.

He first performed as part of a duo - &quot;Johnny &amp; Sipho&quot; - with Sipho Mchunu which released its first single, Woza Friday in 1976. The two then went on to form the band Juluka which released its debut album in 1979. In 1986, Clegg founded the band Savuka, and also recorded as a solo act, occasionally reuniting with his earlier band partners. Sometimes called &quot;Le Zoulou Blanc&quot; (, for &quot;The White Zulu&quot;), he was an important figure in South African popular music and a prominent white figure in the resistance to apartheid, becoming for a period the subject of investigation by the security branch of the South African Police. His songs mixed English with Zulu lyrics, and also combined working class African music with various forms of Western popular music.

==Early life and career==
Clegg was born on 7 June 1953 in Bacup, Lancashire, to an English father of Scottish descent, Dennis Clegg, and a Rhodesian mother, Muriel (Braudo). Clegg&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family were Jewish immigrants from Belarus and Poland and Clegg had a secular Jewish upbringing, learning about the Ten Commandments but refusing to have a &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; - until later in life, when he became a father and decided to have a &quot;double&quot; bar mitzvah with his son Jesse. He moved with his mother to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) at age 6 months, and his parents divorced soon afterwards. At age six, he moved to South Africa with his mother, also spending part of a year in Israel during his childhood.

He grew up in Yeoville, then a predominantly Jewish inner city neighbourhood of Johannesburg. He encountered the demi-monde of the city&#x27;s Zulu migrant workers&#x27; music and dance. Under the tutelage of Charlie Mzila, a flat cleaner by day and musician by night, Clegg mastered both the Zulu language and the maskandi guitar and the isishameni dance styles of the migrants. Clegg&#x27;s involvement with black musicians often led to arrests for trespassing on government property and for contravening the Group Areas Act. He was first arrested at the age of 15 for violating apartheid-era laws in South Africa banning people of different races from congregating together after curfew hours.

At the age of 16, he met Sipho Mchunu, a Zulu migrant worker with whom he began performing music. The partnership, which they named Juluka, began in 1969, and was profiled in the 1970s television documentary &quot;Beats of the Heart: Rhythm of Resistance&quot;.

After graduating with a BA (Hons) in Social Anthropology from the University of Witwatersrand, Clegg pursued an academic career for four years where he lectured and wrote several seminal scholarly papers on Zulu music and dance. In the early stages of his musical career, Clegg combined his music with the study of anthropology at Wits, where he was influenced by the work of David Webster, a social anthropologist who was later assassinated in 1989.

He preceded each song with snippets of Zulu culture, information, commentary, humor and personal anecdotes relevant and unique to that song, occasionally also incorporating aspects of his Jewish roots in songs such as &quot;Jericho&quot;, &quot;Jarusalema&quot; and &quot;Warsaw 1943&quot;.

==Juluka==
Juluka was an unusual musical partnership for the time in South Africa, with a white man (Clegg) and a black man (Mchunu) performing together. The band, which grew to a six-member group (with three white musicians and three black musicians) by the time it released its first album &quot;Universal Men&quot; in 1979, faced harassment and censorship, with Clegg later remarking that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to perform in public in South Africa. The group tested the apartheid-era laws, touring and performing in private venues, including universities, churches, hostels, and even private homes in order to attract an audience, as national broadcasters would not play their music.

Just as unusually, the band&#x27;s music combined Zulu, Celtic, and rock elements, with both English and Zulu lyrics. Those lyrics often contained coded political messages and references to the battle against apartheid, although Clegg maintained that Juluka was not originally intended to be a political band. &quot;Politics found us,&quot; he told &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in 1996. In a 1989 interview with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Clegg denied the label of &quot;political activist.&quot; &quot;For me a political activist is someone who has committed himself to a particular ideology. I don’t belong to any political party. I stand for human rights.&quot;

Juluka&#x27;s music was both implicitly and explicitly political; not only was the fact of the success of the band (which openly celebrated African culture in a bi-racial band) a thorn in the flesh of a political system based on racial separation, the band also produced some explicitly political songs. For example, the album &quot;Work for All&quot; (which includes a song with the same title) picked up on South African trade union slogans in the mid-1980s. As a result of their political messages and racial integration, Clegg and other band members were arrested several times and concerts routinely broken up.

Despite being ignored and often harassed by the South African government at home, Juluka were able to tour internationally, playing in Europe, Canada, and the United States, and had two platinum and five gold albums, becoming an international success. The group was disbanded in 1985, when Mchunu retired from music and went back to his family farm to return to his people&#x27;s traditional life of raising cattle. It was briefly reconstituted when Mchunu and Clegg reunited in the mid-1990s, releasing one final album in 1997 before breaking up for good.

==Savuka==
Together with the black musician and dancer Dudu Zulu, Clegg went on to form his second inter-racial band, Savuka, in 1986, continuing to blend African music with European influences. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Third World Child&quot;, broke international sales records in several European countries, including France. The band went on to record several more albums, including &quot;Heat, Dust and Dreams&quot;, which received a Grammy Award nomination. Johnny Clegg and Savuka played both at home and abroad, even though Clegg&#x27;s refusal to stop performing in apartheid-era South Africa created tensions with the international anti-apartheid movement. Despite his high-profile (and personally hazardous) opposition to the South African regime, this led to Clegg&#x27;s expulsion from the British Musicians&#x27; Union, in what one writer has since called &quot;a fit of pique&quot;. In one instance, the band drew such a large crowd in Lyon that Michael Jackson cancelled a concert there, complaining that Clegg and his group had &quot;stole[n] all his fans&quot;. In 1993, the band dissolved after Dudu Zulu was shot and killed while attempting to mediate a taxi war.

==Juluka reunion and solo career==

Briefly reunited in the mid-1990s, Clegg and Mchunu reformed Juluka, released a new album, and toured throughout the world in 1996 with King Sunny Adé. In the following years, Clegg recorded several solo albums.

During one concert in 1999, he was joined on stage by South African President Nelson Mandela, who danced as Johnny Clegg sang the protest song &quot;Asimbonanga&quot; that Savuka had dedicated to Mandela. Asimbonanga became an anthem of protest for the Mass Democratic Movement&#x27;s umbrella organisation, the United Democratic Front. During Mandela&#x27;s illness and death in 2013, the video of the concert attracted considerable media attention outside South Africa.

His touring schedule was abbreviated in 2017 after he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer, and Clegg performed his last concert in Harare, Zimbabwe on 3 November 2018..

==In popular culture==
Clegg&#x27;s song &quot;Scatterlings of Africa&quot; gave him his only entries in the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 44 in February 1983 with Juluka and No. 75 in May 1987 as Johnny Clegg and Savuka. The following year the song was featured on the soundtrack to the 1988 Oscar-winning film &quot;Rain Man&quot;.

His song &quot;Life is a Magic Thing&quot; was featured in &quot;&quot;.

Savuka&#x27;s song &quot;Dela&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1997 film &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and its 2003 sequel, while &quot;Great Heart&quot; was the title song for the 1986 film &quot;Jock of the Bushveld&quot; and the end credits song for the 2000 film &quot;&quot;. &quot;Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World&quot; was featured in the 1990 film &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; and 1991 film &quot;Career Opportunities&quot;.

Jimmy Buffett recorded &quot;Great Heart&quot; for his 1988 album, &quot;Hot Water&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Johnny Clegg was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015, which ultimately led to his death on 16 July 2019. He died in his Johannesburg home surrounded by loved ones and was laid to rest the following day in Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg. Clegg was survived by his wife, Jenny, and his two sons, Jesse (also a musician) and Jaron.

In 2018, during Clegg&#x27;s illness, over 50 South African musicians collaborated to record Clegg&#x27;s song &quot;The Crossing&quot; as a tribute to Clegg and his contribution to South African music. The song was originally written by Clegg in memory of bandmate Dudu Zulu who was killed in 1992, and refers to the crossing from life to death.

<text>Plagiaulax is a genus of mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of Europe. It was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, and shared the world with dinosaurs. It is of the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Plagiaulacidae. The genus was named by Hugh Falconer in 1857, and was the first described multituberculate species.
Fossil remains of the species &quot;Plagiaulax becklesii&quot; are known from the Lulworth Formation of Durlston Bay in Dorset, England. They include at least one partial lower jaw with teeth, though there may well be further specimens. Some material has been reported from Galve, Spain.

Another possible species, &quot;P. dawsoni&quot;, was provisionally named by Woodward in 1891. This came from the county of Sussex, which is further east along the English coast. It was subsequently damaged and there seems not to have been a scientific description. Its discoverer, Charles Dawson has been implicated in the Piltdown hoax and Pevensey tiles hoax.

<text>Tenpin bowling is a type of bowling in which a bowler rolls a bowling ball down a wood or synthetic lane toward ten pins positioned evenly in four rows in an equilateral triangle. The goal is to knock down all ten pins on the first roll of the ball (a strike), or failing that, on the second roll (a spare). While most people approach modern tenpin bowling as a simple recreational pastime, those who bowl competitively, especially at the highest levels, consider it a demanding sport requiring precision and skill.

An approximately long &quot;approach&quot; area used by the bowler to impart speed and apply rotation to the ball ends in a &quot;foul line&quot;. The , lane is bordered along its length by &quot;gutters&quot; (&quot;channels&quot;) that collect errant balls. The lane&#x27;s long and narrow shape limits straight-line ball paths to angles that are smaller than optimum angles for achieving strikes; accordingly, bowlers impart side rotation to &quot;hook&quot; (curve) the ball into the pins to increase the likelihood of striking.

Oil is applied to approximately the first two-thirds of the lane&#x27;s length to allow a &quot;skid&quot; area for the ball before it encounters friction and hooks. The oil is applied in different lengths and layout patterns, especially in professional and tournament play, to add complexity and regulate challenge in the sport. Especially when coupled with technological developments in ball design since the early 1990s, easier oil patterns common for league bowling enable many league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professional bowlers who must bowl on more difficult patterns—a development that has caused substantial controversy.

Tenpin bowling arose in the early 1800s as an alternative to nine-pin bowling, with truly standardized regulations not being agreed on until nearly the end of that century. After the development of automated mechanical pinsetters, the sport enjoyed a &quot;golden age&quot; in the mid twentieth century. Following substantial declines since the 1980s in both professional tournament television ratings and amateur league participation, bowling centers have increasingly expanded to become diverse entertainment centers.

Tenpin bowling is often simply referred to as &quot;bowling&quot;. &quot;Tenpin&quot;, or less commonly &quot;big-ball&quot;, is prepended in the English-speaking world to distinguish it from other bowling types such as bowls, candlepin, duckpin and five-pin.

==Facilities and equipment==
===Lanes===
Tenpin bowling lanes are from the foul line to the center of the head pin (1-pin), with guide arrows (aiming targets) about from the foul line. The lane is wide and has 39 wooden boards, or is made of a synthetic material with the 39 &quot;boards&quot; simulated using marking lines. The approach has two sets of dots, respectively and behind the foul line, to help with foot placement.
Modern bowling lanes have oil patterns designed not only to shield the lanes from damage from bowling ball impacts, but to provide bowlers with different levels of challenge in achieving strikes. As illustrated, a typical house pattern (or THS, typical house shot) has drier outside portions that give bowling balls more friction to hook (curve) into the pocket, but heavier oil concentrations surrounding the centerline so that balls slide directly toward the pocket with less hooking. In the more challenging sport patterns used in tournaments and professional-level matches, a &quot;flat&quot; oil pattern—one with oil distributed more evenly from side to side—provides little assistance in guiding the ball toward the pocket, and is less forgiving with regard to off-target shots. The ratio of centerline oil concentration to side oil concentration (the &quot;oil ratio&quot;) can exceed 10-to-1 for THSs but is restricted to 3-to-1 or less for sport shots.

Lane oils, also called lane conditioners, are composed of about 98% mineral oil that, with numerous additives, are designed to minimize breakdown and carry-down that would change ball reaction after repeated ball rolls. Lane oils are characterized by different levels of viscosity, with oils of higher viscosity (thicker consistency) being more durable but causing balls to slow and hook earlier than lower-viscosity oils.

===Balls===
Rubber balls (introduced in 1905) were eventually supplanted by polyester (&quot;plastic&quot;) balls (1959) and polyurethane (&quot;urethane&quot;) balls (1980s). Coverstocks (surfaces) of bowling balls then evolved to increase the hook-enhancing friction between ball and lane: reactive resin balls arrived in the early 1990s, and particle-enhanced resin balls in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the increasingly sophisticated technology of internal cores (also called &quot;weight blocks&quot;) has increased balls&#x27; dynamic imbalance, which, in conjunction with the coverstocks&#x27; increased friction, enhances hook (curving) potential to achieve the higher entry angles that have enabled dramatic increases in strike percentage and game scores.

Hook potential has increased so much that dry lane conditions or spare shooting scenarios sometimes compel use of plastic or urethane balls, to purposely avoid the larger hook provided by reactive technology.

The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) regulates ball parameters including maximum diameter (), maximum circumference (), and maximum weight (16 pounds (7.26 kg)).

====Ball motion====
Because pin spacing is much larger than ball size, it is impossible for the ball to contact all pins. Therefore, a tactical shot is required, which would result in a chain reaction of pins hitting other pins (called &quot;pin scatter&quot;). In what is considered an ideal strike shot, the ball contacts only the 1, 3, 5 and 9 pins (right-handed deliveries).

Most new players roll the ball straight, while more experienced bowlers may roll a hook that involves making the ball start out straight but then curve toward a target, to increase the likelihood of striking: USBC research has shown that shots most likely to strike enter the pocket at an angle of entry that is achievable only with a hook.

A complex interaction of a variety of factors influences ball motion and its effect on scoring results. Such factors may be categorized as:
* The bowler&#x27;s delivery (see Effect of delivery characteristics on ball motion) Characteristics of the ball&#x27;s delivery that affect ball motion include the ball&#x27;s speed going down the lane, its rotational speed (&quot;rev rate&quot;), the angle of the ball&#x27;s axis of rotation in horizontal and vertical planes (&quot;axis rotation&quot; and &quot;axis tilt&quot;, respectively), and how far beyond the foul line that the ball first contacts the lane (&quot;loft&quot;).
* Bowling ball design (see Effect of coverstock, core and layout on ball motion). A 2005-2008 USBC Ball Motion Study found that the ball design factors that most contributed to ball motion were the microscopic spikes and pores on the ball&#x27;s surface (present in balls with &quot;reactive resin&quot; coverstock), the respective coefficients of friction between ball and lane in the oiled and dry parts of the lane, and the ball&#x27;s oil absorption rate, followed in dominance by certain characteristics of the ball&#x27;s core (mainly &quot;radius of gyration&quot; and &quot;total differential&quot;). Friction-related factors may be categorized as &quot;chemical friction&quot; (degree of &quot;stickiness&quot; designed by manufacturers into the resin coverstock) and &quot;physical friction&quot; (which can be modified by sanding or polishing, or by including additives that physically increase lubrication). &quot;Weak&quot; (&quot;pin down&quot;) versus &quot;strong&quot; (&quot;pin up&quot;) layouts of the finger and thumb holes with respect to core orientation affect skid lengths and hook angularity.
* Lane conditions (see Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion). Lane conditions that affect ball motion include &quot;lane transition&quot; (including &quot;breakdown&quot; and &quot;carry-down&quot;), the oil absorption characteristics of previously thrown balls and the paths they followed, wood versus synthetic composition of the lane (more generally: soft vs. hard lanes), imperfections in lane surface (&quot;topography&quot;), and oil &quot;viscosity&quot; (thick or thin consistency; innate viscosity being affected by temperature and humidity).

===Pins and pin carry===

Bowling pins (with a maximum thickness of at the waist) are &quot;spotted&quot; (placed) in four rows, forming an equilateral triangle with four pins on a side to form a tetractys. Neighboring pins are centered apart, leaving a space of between pins that can be bridged by a bowling ball of regulation diameter ().

Pin &quot;carry&quot; essentially determines the probability of achieving a strike assuming the ball impacts in or near the pocket—and varies with several factors. Even before a 2008 USBC pin carry study, it was known that entry angle and ball weight increase strike percentages. The 2008 study concluded that an impact with the ball centered at &quot;board 17.5&quot; causes pin scatter that maximizes likelihood of striking. The material of the pin deck and &quot;kickback&quot; (side) plates was also found to materially affect pin carry.

==Ball delivery==
===Delivery style categories===

Three widely recognized categories are &quot;stroker, cranker&quot; and &quot;tweener&quot;.

* Strokers—using the most &quot;classic&quot; bowling form—tend to keep the shoulders square to the foul line and develop only a moderately high backswing, achieving modest ball rotation (&quot;rev&quot;) rates and ball speeds, which thus limit hook potential and kinetic energy delivered to the pins. Strokers rely on accuracy and repeatability, and benefit from the high entry angles that reactive resin balls enable.
* Crankers tend to open (rotate) the shoulders and use strong wrist and arm action in concert with a high backswing, achieving higher rev rates and ball speeds, thus maximizing hook potential and kinetic energy. Crankers rely on speed and power, but may leave splits rarely left by strokers.
* Tweeners (derived from &quot;in-between&quot;) have styles that fall between those of strokers and crankers; the term is considered by some to include &quot;power strokers&quot; who combine the high rev rates of crankers with the smooth delivery of strokers.

====Alternative deliveries====
* So-called &quot;two-handed&quot; bowling, first popularized late in the 2000s by Australian Jason Belmonte, involves not inserting the thumb into any thumbhole, with the opposite hand supporting and guiding the ball throughout &quot;almost&quot; the entire forward swing. This delivery style, involving more athletic ability, is increasingly popular with younger bowlers and technically still involves a one-handed &quot;release.&quot; It allows the inserted fingers to generate higher revolution rates and thus attain greater hook potential than with a thumb-in-hole approach. In contrast, in what is literally a two-handed delivery and release, children or physically challenged players use both hands to deliver the ball forward from between the legs or from the chest.
*&quot;No-thumb&quot; bowling involves only a single hand during the forward swing, without the thumb inserted. The ball is often balanced on the wrist and forearm of the delivery hand for this technique. A successful professional who uses the one-handed no-thumb delivery is Tom Daugherty.
* The &quot;spinner&quot; style, which is mainly popular in parts of Asia, has a &quot;helicopter&quot; or &quot;UFO&quot; release that involves rotating the wrist to impart a high (vertical) axis of rotation that causes the bowling ball to spin like a top while traveling straight down the lane. Usually involving a lighter (10-12 pound) ball, the spinner style takes advantage of the ball deflection from the head pin to then &quot;walk down&quot; the other visible pins and cause domino effects diagonally through the pins.
* In the &quot;backup&quot; (or &quot;reverse hook&quot;) release, the wrist rotates clockwise (for right hand releases) or counter-clockwise (for left hand releases), causing the ball to hook in a direction opposite to that of conventional releases.

===Grips===
A &quot;conventional grip&quot;, used on non-customized house balls and some custom-drilled balls, involves insertion of fingers to the second knuckle. A &quot;fingertip grip&quot;, involving insertion of fingers only to the first knuckle, enables greater revolution rates and resultant hook potential. A &quot;thumbless grip&quot;, often used by so-called &quot;two-handed&quot; bowlers, maximizes ball rotational speed (&quot;rev rate&quot;).

==Pins and scoring==
===Pins===
The USBC indicated that, effective August 1, 2023, it is certifying string pinsetters and string pin bowling as an independent category of equipment and competition separate from conventional free-fall pinsetters. USBC lab data indicated strike percentage on string pin bowling is 7.1% lower, causing the USBC to plan additional testing to determine whether a scoring conversion should be created between the categories. String pinsetters are less expensive and easier to maintain, motivating bowling centers to phase them in.

===Traditional scoring===
In traditional scoring, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over, and when fewer than all ten pins are knocked down in two rolls in a frame (an &quot;open frame&quot;), the frame is scored with the total number of pins knocked down. However, when all ten pins are knocked down with either the first or second rolls of a frame (a &quot;mark&quot;), &quot;bonus&quot; pins are awarded as follows:
*Strike: When all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll (marked &quot;X&quot; on the scorescreen), the frame receives ten pins &quot;plus&quot; a bonus of pinfall on the next two &quot;rolls&quot; (not necessarily the next two &quot;frames&quot;). A strike in the tenth (final) frame receives two extra rolls for bonus pins.
*Spare: When a second roll of a frame is needed to knock down all ten pins (marked &quot;/&quot; on the scorescreen), the frame receives ten pins &quot;plus&quot; a bonus of pinfall in the next &quot;roll&quot; (not necessarily the next &quot;frame&quot;). A spare in the first two rolls in the tenth (final) frame receives a third roll for bonus pins.
*Split: When pins that have not yet been knocked down from a gap that&#x27;s at least one pin apart, therefore making it very difficult to get a spare. (marked by highlighting the number of the roll in red on the scorescreen)
*Gutter: When no pins are hit on a roll. (marked &quot;-&quot; on the scorescreen.)

The maximum score is 300, achieved by getting twelve strikes in a row within the same game (known as a perfect game).

===World Bowling scoring===
The World Bowling scoring system—described as &quot;current frame scoring&quot;—awards pins as follows:
:* A strike is 30 pins, regardless of ensuing rolls&#x27; results.
:* A spare is 10 pins, plus the pinfall on first roll of the &quot;current&quot; frame.
:* An open frame is the total pinfall of the current frame.
The maximum score is 300, achieved with ten consecutive strikes (as opposed to twelve in traditional scoring), but with no bonus pins received in the tenth frame.

World Bowling scoring is thought to make bowling easier to follow than with traditional scoring, increase television viewership, and help bowling to become an Olympic sport.

====Variant of World Bowling scoring====
Another variant of scoring, a 12-frame system introduced at the November 2014 World Bowling Tour (WBT) finals, resembles golf&#x27;s match play scoring in counting the greater number of &quot;frames&quot; won rather than measuring accumulated pinfall score. A frame may be won immediately by a higher pincount on the first roll of the frame, and a match may be won when one player is ahead by more frames than remain of the possible 12 frames. This variant reduces match length and scoring complexity for two-player matches.

==History==
===Early history===
Modern tenpin bowling derives mainly from the German Kegelspiel, or kegeling, which used nine pins set in a diamond formation. The enjoyment of kegeling by German peasants contrasted with (lawn) bowls that was reserved for the upper classes, consistent with bowling&#x27;s enduring reputation as a common man&#x27;s sport.

A &quot;circa&quot; 1810 painting of Ipswich, England, shows a man bowling outdoors with a triangular formation of ten pins. An outdoor version of tenpin bowling was advertised, also in Ipswich, at least as early as 1828.

An 1841 Connecticut law banned ninepin bowling because of its perceived association with gambling and crime, and people were said to circumvent the prohibition by adding a tenth pin. Other locations (e.g., 1838, re Baltimore and 1842, Charles Dickens re New York) also recount that strategy. Even earlier, an 1834 Washington, D.C. ordinance had limited the time (before 8 p.m. and not on Sundays) and place (more than 100 yards from inhabited houses) of &quot;nine pin and ten pins&quot; or &quot;any game in the likeness or imitation thereof ... played with any number of pins whatsoever&quot;. U.S. newspapers referred to &quot;ten pin alleys&quot; at least as early as 1820
(also later in the 1820s
and in the 1830s

).

In the mid-1800s, various alternatives to free-standing pins received U.S. patents to solve perceived problems in pinsetting and ball return, aiming to avoid the need for human pinsetters to perform these functions. One scheme (1851) involved pins with spherical bases that when hit by a ball merely fell over, in place, to be rotated back to a vertical position. A second arrangement (1853) involved resetting the pins via cords descending from respective pin bottoms to weights beneath the pin deck. Another design (1869) involved suspending the pins with overhead cords.

In 1884, the Brunswick Corporation became the first American bowling ball manufacturer, and by 1905 introduced the Mineralite (hard rubber) ball that was considered so revolutionary over wooden balls that it was displayed at the Century of Progress Exposition in 1934. In 1886, Joe Thum—who would become known as the &quot;father of bowling&quot;—began opening bowling alleys and over decades strove to elevate the sport&#x27;s image to compete with upper-class diversions such as theaters and opera houses.

In 1875, delegates from New York City and Brooklyn bowling clubs formed the National Bowling Association (NBA) to standardize rules, but disagreements prevailed. In 1887 Albert G. Spalding wrote &quot;Standard Rules for Bowling in the United States&quot;, and in the mid-1890s the United Bowling Clubs (UBC) was organized with 120 members. The American Bowling Congress (ABC) was established in 1895, followed by the Women&#x27;s International Bowling Congress (WIBC) in the 1910s, such organizations promoting standardized rules and striving to improve the sport&#x27;s image.

From 1920 to 1929, the number of ABC-sanctioned alleys grew from 450 to about 2,000, with Prohibition leading to the growth of family-appropriate &quot;dry&quot; alleys. The 1933 repeal of Prohibition allowed breweries to sponsor teams and bowlers, adding to bowling&#x27;s reputation as a working-class sport. Though at the turn of the twentieth century most bowling alleys were small establishments, post-Prohibition bowling lanes shifted from side entertainment at fancy Victorian venues or seedier saloons to independent establishments that embraced the Art Deco style and fit the era&#x27;s perceived &quot;need for speed&quot;.

===1940s to early 1960s===

Gottfried Schmidt invented the first mechanical pinsetter in his garage in 1936, one implementation of which was publicly exhibited in 1946 before AMF placed a production model into service in 1952.

The 1940s through the 1970s became known as the &quot;golden age of bowling&quot;, with ABC membership growing from 700,000 (1940), to 1.1 million (1947), to 2.3 million (1958), to 4.5 million (1963), Women&#x27;s International Bowling Congress membership growing from 82,000 (1940) to 866,000 (1958), American Junior Bowling Congress membership growing from 8,000 (1940) to 175,000 (1958), and sanctioned individual lanes growing from 44,500 (1947) to 159,000 (1963).

Bowling&#x27;s growth was fueled by the deployment of automatic mechanical pinsetters by AMF (1952) and Brunswick (1955), television broadcasts (said to be &quot;ubiquitous&quot; in the 1950s), modernization and stylization of establishments with amenities to attract broader clientele, and formation of bowling leagues. Though President Truman had installed a bowling alley in the White House in 1947, a report of the American Society of Planning Officials in 1958 characterized bowling alleys as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s country club&quot;.

ABC bylaws had included a &quot;white-males-only&quot; clause since its inception in the 1890s, but numerous lobbying efforts and legal actions after World War II by civil rights and labor organizations led to a reversal of this policy in 1950.

Sports agent Eddie Elias founded the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) in 1958 with 33 members, and the first PBA tournaments began in 1959. The &quot;Pro Bowlers Tour&quot; TV program aired from 1962 through 1997.

In the 1930s and 1940s, professional bowling was dominated by &quot;beer leagues&quot; with many of the best bowlers sponsored by beer companies, but by 1965 the PBA tour was televised nationally on ABC Sports with sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Ford.

In parallel with professional bowling was &quot;action bowling&quot; or &quot;pot bowling&quot;—bowling matches based on monetary bets—historically associated with the New York underworld from the 1940s to the 1970s.

===Late 1960s to 1980===

The first ten-pin lanes in Europe had been installed in Sweden in 1909, but attempts to popularize the sport in Europe were unsuccessful over the next several decades, though hundreds of lanes were installed on U.S. military bases in the U.K. during World War II. Various countries developed the sport to some extent, and the Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ; now World Bowling) was formed in 1952 to coordinate international amateur competition.

A firmer establishment of the sport began in the U.K. in 1960 in London (Stamford Hill) in January 1960, and the British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA) was formed the following year. The first British made tenpin was by H Massil and sons who received the permit no.1 from the BTBA. Various other countries, including Australia, Mexico and Japan, adopted the trend over the ensuing decade. After initial faddish growth in the U.K., however, the sport did not thrive as it did in the U.S., and by the 1970s many British bowling alleys were converted to serve competing pastimes, such as bingo.

The &quot;Lane Master&quot; automatic lane cleaning and conditioning machine was first deployed in the 1960s.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, top bowling professionals made twice as much money as NFL football stars, received million-dollar endorsement contracts, and were treated as international celebrities. The $100,000 Firestone Tournament of Champions launched in 1965, in a decade that saw ABC membership peak at almost 4.6 million male bowlers. The number of sanctioned bowling alleys peaked at about 12,000 in the mid-1960s, mostly in blue-collar urban areas, and Women&#x27;s International Bowling Congress (WIBC) membership peaked at 4.2 million members in 1979.

In the late 1960s, the participation sport of bowling found itself competing with spectator sports and outdoor recreational activities. The number of certified bowling centers was to eventually decline from its 1960s high of 12,000 to 6,542 in 1998 and 3,976 in 2013. The decline was noted acutely in waning league participation over the intervening decades.

===1980 to 2000===

Tournament prize funds in the 1980s included the PBA National Championship ($135,000, its largest) and the Firestone Tournament of Champions ($150,000), and PBA membership approached 2,500. Ten-pin bowling became an exhibition sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics (Seoul), has been a medal sport since its debut at the 1991 Pan American Games (Havana), and was included in the 1998 Commonwealth Games (Kuala Lumpur).

Outside elite and professional bowling, participation in leagues—traditionally the more profitable end of the business—declined from a 1980 peak (8 million), compelling alleys to further diversify into entertainment amenities. As busier, two-earner households became more common in the 1980s to make league participation more difficult, the number of spectator sports and competing leisure time opportunities (jogging, tennis, skiing) grew. While league bowling decreased by 40 percent between 1980 and 1993, the total number of bowlers actually increased by 10 percent during that period, with nearly 80 million Americans going bowling at least once during 1993. In 1995, the National Bowling Stadium (Reno, Nevada) was constructed at a cost of $47.5 million, but the PBA Pro Bowlers Tour TV program was canceled in 1997 after a 35-year run.

In 1991, equipment manufacturer DBA Products released &quot;The Lane Walker&quot;—the first computer-driven lane cleaning and oiling machine, programmable to clean up to 50 lanes.

The early 1990s brought the development of reactive resin (&quot;reactive&quot;) balls with chemically &quot;tacky&quot; surfaces that enhance traction to dramatically enhance hook and substantially increase the likelihood of striking, raising average scores even for less experienced bowlers.

In 1998, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) president attributed an increase in popularity to bowling alley remodeling, technological innovations in balls and lanes, computerized scoring, and promotion by bowling organizations.

===2000 to present===
From 1998 to 2013, the number of American bowling centers fell by one quarter. Similarly, in the two decades following 1997, the number of USBC-certified &quot;lanes&quot;—also indicative of business viability—declined by one-third. This business decline is often attributed to waning league participation: USBC membership—indicative of league participation that was the main source of revenue—declined by two-thirds in those two decades, and the portion of alley revenue attributable to leagues is estimated to have dropped from 70% to 40%. Political scientist Robert D. Putnam&#x27;s book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; (2000) asserts, with some controversy, that the retreat from league bowling epitomizes a broader societal decline in social, civic and community engagement in the U.S.

As an indication of the decline, AMF Bowling, the largest operator of bowling centers in the world at the time, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2001, and again in 2012. By 2013, AMF Bowling had merged with New York–based Bowlmor (no relation to the defunct, 1940s-founded &quot;Bowl-Mor&quot; firm that invented the automatic pinsetter for candlepin bowling), the company becoming known as Bowlmor AMF.

In 2000, three former tech industry executives bought a debt-laden PBA—which saw its 36-year television contract with ABC Sports end in 1997—and turned it from a non-profit league into a for-profit organization, and invested heavily in marketing. The January 2005 merger of four U.S. bowling organizations to form the USBC formed a &quot;central brand&quot; aiming to grow the sport. Beginning late in the decade of the 2000s, the two-handed approach became popularized, first by Australian Jason Belmonte, with some hoping that the controversial delivery style would boost popularity of the sport. In January 2013, the eight-team PBA League began competition, the strategy being that basing teams in specific geographic localities would generate viewer enthusiasm and corporate sponsorship in the same manner as teams in other professional sports. Still, continuing the reversal of bowling&#x27;s peak popularity in the 1960s, in the 2012–2013 season the average yearly winnings of the ten highest-earning PBA competitors was less than US$155,000, and the average for the remaining 250 competitors was $6,500—all much less than a rookie NFL football player&#x27;s minimum base salary of $375,000.
Estimates of the number of total (league and non-league) bowlers in the U.S. have varied, from 82 million (1997, International Bowling Museum) to 51.6 million (2007, research firm White Hutchinson) to 71 million (2009, USBC), the USBC stating in 2019 that bowling is still the #1 participation sport in the U.S. More broadly, the International Bowling Museum stated in 2016 that bowling is played by 95 million people in more than 90 countries. In an era of continual decline in league participation, bowling centers promoted &quot;party bowling&quot; and black-light-and-disco-ball &quot;cosmic bowling&quot; and experienced a shift from blue-collar participants to open-play (non-league) family-oriented clientele in combined bowling and entertainment centers. Some offered laser tag, indoor playgrounds, go-karting, climbing walls, arcade games, skating rinks, gourmet restaurants, and nightclub-style bowling lounges. School sport programs expanded, the USBC stating that more than 5,000 high schools offered bowling as a competitive sport, with 50,000 student bowlers participating in 2009–2010. In 2011, the Bowling Proprietor&#x27;s Association of America stated that more than 60% of U.S. bowlers were under age 34, that 46% were girls and women, and that children participated in bowling at a higher rate than any other population group.

Since 1997, Bowlero Corporation (later called Lucky Strike Entertainment Corporation) acquired competitors AMF Bowling, Brunswick and Lucky Strike Lanes, and purchased the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA). In the early 2020s, U.S. bowlers experienced a surge in fees attributed by experts to consolidation of big chains, facilities upgrades, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic when bowling alleys were deemed &quot;non-essential businesses&quot;.

In contrast to the U.S., the 2000s and 2010s brought a bowling renaissance in the U.K., achieved by accommodating sophisticated modern tastes by providing (for example) retro-style bowling alleys outfitted with 1950s Americana, &quot;boutique bowling&quot;, &quot;VIP lanes&quot;, and cameras for instant replays, and by rejuvenating bowling &quot;alleys&quot; into diverse-entertainment bowling &quot;centres&quot;. The population of ten-pin bowling centres grew from a low of barely 50 (in the 1980s) to over 200 (2006), with almost a third of Britons going bowling in 2016 and league participation growing over 20% over two years (2015–2017).

Though ten-pin bowling was a demonstration sport in the 1988 Summer Olympics (Seoul) and has been included in the Pan American Games since 1991, after making the shortlist for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), it was cut. One commentator noted that the sport&#x27;s limited geographic popularity (the U.S., Australia and a few European and South American countries), and aging demographic of those who follow the sport, make it difficult to convince an Olympic Committee that wants to appeal to youth.

==Bowling organizations==
===International===
World Bowling (WB) was formed in 2014 from component organizations of the &quot;Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs&quot; (FIQ, International Federation of Bowlers), which in 1952 developed from the International Bowling Association (IBA) which began operations in 1926. Since 1979 the International Olympic Committee has recognized the FIQ, and later, WB, as the sport&#x27;s world governing body. WB establishes rules for the uniform practice of bowling throughout the world, and promotes bowling as an Olympic sport. The World Tenpin Bowling Association &quot;membership discipline&quot; (component organization) of WB serves the amateur sport of ten-pin bowling worldwide, adopting uniform playing rules and equipment specifications.

===United Kingdom===
The British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA, formed in 1961) is the official governing body recognized by World Bowling as the official sanctioning body in England, and as such &quot;is responsible for the protection, integrity and development of the sport&quot;. Its stated vision is &quot;to ensure that all people, irrespective of their age, disability, ethnic origin, marital status, sexual orientation or social status have a genuine and equal opportunity to participate in the sport at all levels and in all roles&quot;.

The National Association of Youth Bowling Clubs (NAYBC) is a BTBA subcommittee serving youth bowlers and youth bowling clubs.

The British Universities Tenpin Bowling Association (BUTBA, formed in 2008) organizes bowling events for present and former university and college students.

The Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA, formed in 1961 as an umbrella organization) is a trade association for the British ten-pin bowling industry.

===United States===

The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) was formed as the governing body for the U.S. on January 1, 2005, by the merger of:
* the American Bowling Congress (ABC, an originally male-only organization founded in 1895),
* the Women&#x27;s International Bowling Congress (WIBC, 1916),
* the Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA, 1982), which itself was formed from combining the American Junior Bowling Congress (AJBC, 1946), Youth Bowling Association (YBA, 1963–64), and ABC/WIBC Collegiate division (mid-1970s), and
* (Team) USA Bowling (1989).
As the national governing body for bowling, its stated mission is to provide services, resources and the standards for the sport, its stated goals including growing the sport and promoting values of &quot;credibility, dedication, excellence, heritage, inclusiveness, integrity, philanthropy and sportsmanship&quot;.

===Museums===
The International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame is located on the International Bowling Campus in Arlington, Texas, U.S.

==Tournaments==

World Bowling oversees quadrennial World Championship tournaments, and international championships for various sectors, including for women, seniors, youth and junior bowlers.

The QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup (begun in 1965) is recognized as bowling&#x27;s largest event in terms of number of countries competing, according to the USBC in 2018.

The Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour has held anywhere from 15 to 25 events annually in recent years, mainly at U.S. locations. The PBA Tour includes &quot;major&quot; championship events:
the U.S. Open, the USBC Masters, the PBA Tournament of Champions, the PBA World Championship, and the PBA Players Championship. Dozens more PBA tournaments are held in various U.S. geographical segments as part of the PBA Regional Tour.

The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) has various tournaments for the PBA tour, PWBA, youth and seniors, including the USBC Masters and U.S. Open (both major tournaments on the PBA tour), and USBC Queens and U.S. Women&#x27;s Open (both major tournaments on the PWBA tour), plus the USBC Team USA Trials/U.S. National Amateur Bowling Championships. Additionally, the USBC has regional tournaments and certifies local tournaments.

The European Tenpin Bowling Federation (ETBF) owns the European Bowling Tour (organized in 2000), including its final tournament, the European Bowling Tour Masters (first edition: 2008).

The Commonwealth Tenpin Bowling Federation (CTBF), made up of World Bowling member federations within the Commonwealth of Nations, owns the Commonwealth Tenpin Bowling Championships, which has held tournaments at irregular intervals since 2002.

The Weber Cup is an annual, three-day US vs. Europe tournament, named after Dick Weber, that began in 2000 and has been held almost exclusively in the U.K.

In the decade of the 2000s, the World Ranking Masters, owned by World Bowling, ranked standings in the Pan American Bowling Confederation (PABCON), Asian Bowling Federation (ABF), and European Tenpin Bowling Federation (ETBF).

Though ten-pin bowling has not progressed beyond a demonstration sport at the Olympic Games, international games modeled after the Olympics (awarding medals) do include the sport, including the World Games (governed by the International World Games Association), the Asian Games (governed by the Olympic Council of Asia, OCA) and the Pan American Games (governed by the Pan American Sports Organization, PASO). The Maccabiah Games (governed by the Israeli Bowling Federation, IBF, with events played according to WTBA-ETBF rules) host ten-pin tournaments as medal events.

==Leagues==


Bowling leagues vary in format, including demographic specialization (male, female, mixed, senior, youth),
number of bowlers per team (usually 3–5),
number of games per series (usually 3),
day and time of scheduled sessions,
starting dates and duration of league seasons,
scoring (scratch versus handicap), and
systems for bestowing awards and prizes.
Usually, each team is scheduled to oppose each of the other teams over the course of a season. Position rounds—in which the first place team opposes the second place team, third place opposes fourth place, and so on—are often inserted into the season schedule.

Customarily, team position standings are computed after each series, awarding a first number of points for each game won and a second number of points for achieving the higher team score for that series, the particular numbers being specified in each league&#x27;s rules. Further, in leagues having &quot;match point&quot; scoring, individual bowlers on one team are matched against respective members of the opposing team, the winners receiving points that supplement their team&#x27;s game and series points.

The number of league bowlers in the U.S. peaked at 8 million in 1980, declining to approximately 1 million by the early 2020s.

==Perfect (300) game history==
Ernest Fosberg (East Rockford, Illinois) bowled the first recognized 300 in 1902, before awards were given out. In 1908, A.C. Jellison and Homer Sanders (both of St. Louis) each bowled 300 games in the same season, the ABC awarding the gold medal for the highest score of the year to Jellison after a three-game tie-breaker match, without regard to the chronological order of their accomplishments.

On January 7, 2006, Elliot John Crosby became the youngest British bowler to bowl a BTBA-sanctioned 300 game at the age of 12 years, 2 months and 10 days, breaking the 1994 record of Rhys Parfitt (age 13 years, 4 months).

On November 17, 2013, Hannah Diem (Seminole, Florida) became the youngest American bowler to bowl a USBC-certified 300 game at the age of 9 years, 6 months and 19 days, breaking the 2006 record of Chaz Dennis (age 10) and the 2006 female record of Brandie Reamy (age 12).

Jeremy Sonnenfeld (Sioux Falls, South Dakota) rolled the first certified 900 series in 1997. A well-publicized court-contested 900 series by Glenn Allison in 1982, considered by many to be the first-ever 900 series, was denied certification due to non-conforming lane conditions.

==&quot;Score inflation&quot; controversy==

The 905 perfect games that were rolled during the 1968–69 season increased 38-fold to 34,470 in the 1998–99 season. Likewise, the number of perfect-game league bowlers increased from about one of 3150 (1900–1980) to about one of 27 (2007), a greater-than-hundredfold increase that many thought threatened to jeopardize the integrity of the sport. Though median averages for male league bowlers remained at about 168 from the 1980s through the mid-2010s, the number of top average scores over 190 soared, suggesting that more skilled bowlers are making use of technological advancements. The USBC Technical Director wrote that the &quot;USBC is concerned that technology has overtaken player skill in determining success in the sport of bowling,&quot; announcing in 2007 the completion of a ball motion study undertaken &quot;to strike a better balance between player skill and technology&quot;.
Separately, a USBC pin carry study completed in about 2008 found that dramatically increased entry angles improve pin carry to result in higher scores—regardless of whether the bowlers supplied additional effort or improved their skill. Among the factors allowing higher scores were technological advances in coverstock and core design combined with improved lane surfaces and accommodative oil patterns.

Specifically, the reactive resin balls and particle balls that came out in the 1990s increased frictional engagement with the lane to provide greater hook potential that made high entry angles easier to achieve. Moreover, changes in lane surface technology, as well as the introduction of voids into pins to make them lighter and more top-heavy, helped to raise average scores as early as the 1970s. Expanded choices in oil viscosity and electronically controlled lane oiling machines permitted alley owners to customize house oil patterns to optimize the advantages of the new ball technologies. Technological progress allowed some 1990s league scores to surpass those of professionals in the 1950s.

Responding to such concerns, the USBC initiated &quot;sport bowling&quot; leagues and tournaments that provide &quot;sport&quot;, &quot;challenge&quot; and &quot;PBA Experience&quot; oil patterns that are more challenging than the accommodative patterns of typical house shots. Still, the USBC has encountered enduring issues concerning how to maintain &quot;average integrity&quot; (fair handicapping) across leagues using oil patterns of differing difficulty.

As a result of various USBC studies, including a bowling technology study published in February 2018, the USBC Equipment and Specifications Committee established new specifications focusing mainly on balls. The overall result of the new specifications was said to slightly limit hook potential, more specifically eliminating balance holes (as of the 2020–21 season) and setting a new specification for oil absorption. The USBC stated that the new specifications will slow oil pattern transition, cause bowlers to move less, and keep the same scoring pace with lower oil volume.

==In media==
===Coverage of events===
Beginning in 1962, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Pro Bowlers Tour&quot; was broadcast on Saturday afternoons to be viewed by millions, and—with various entertainment-oriented programs including &quot;Make That Spare&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot; and &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot;—confirmed the sport&#x27;s popularity. The &quot;Pro Bowlers Tour&quot; garnered excellent ratings in the 1960s and early 1970s, as a lead-in to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. However, television ratings fell substantially, from 9.1 in the mid-1970s to 2.0 in 1997, the year in which &quot;Pro Bowlers Tour&quot; was canceled.

The decline in bowling event coverage has been attributed to a variety of factors, including time demands burdening the schedules of two-income households, small purses (winnings) for professional tournaments, declining participation in league bowling, the perceived demographic of bowlers (old, or of low social class), waning popularity with the public, competing sports programming on cable television, lack of corporate sponsorship, lack of an inspiring bowling star (2004), and an aging audience for TV bowling. A 2006 PBA article describing the PBA bowlers in the documentary &quot;A League of Ordinary Gentlemen&quot; called bowling athletes &quot;the Rodney Dangerfields of professional sports&quot;.

The decline in coverage has also been attributed to the perception that bowling is less an athletic sport (not being in the Olympic Games) and more of a recreational pastime (such as for children&#x27;s birthday parties). This perception is reinforced by the easy lane conditions provided to bowling leagues that enable seasoned league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professionals who must bowl under more challenging lane conditions.

Former PBA Commissioner Mark Gerberich said that ABC paid the PBA $200,000 per broadcast in 1991, but by 1997 &quot;we were paying $150,000 to stay on TV.&quot; Said to be &quot;near bankruptcy&quot; in 2000, the PBA changed ownership to one that emphasized marketing with the goal of running the organization as a for-profit business. ESPN featured bowling from 2000 to 2018 on Sunday afternoons, with CBS Sports Network also airing a smaller number of bowling tournaments.

In 2019, the PBA entered an agreement, expected to last four years, in which Fox Sports would sell advertising and sponsorships for the sport to establish the sport&#x27;s presence on broadcast television, also providing cable, streaming, and social media programming. In September 2019, Bowlero Corporation purchased the PBA.

===Games===
:&quot;See also Bowling video games.&quot;

What is believed to be the first bowling video game was released in the 1977, a built-in provided with the RCA Studio II console. A pseudo-3D game was released in 1982 for the Emerson Arcadia 2001 console, and a multi-player game was released by SNK in 1991, almost a decade before convincing 3D graphics arrived. &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, which was released in 2006, includes a bowling game for the 3D-motion-controlled console, and mobile-device bowling games have since become increasingly popular. Several organizations—including the PBA and entertainment franchises such as &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;The Flintstones&quot;—have granted licenses to use their names for video games.

<doc id="207748" wikidata="Q207034" url="?curid=207748" title="Keith Jarrett">
<text>Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945) is an American pianist and composer. Jarrett started his career with Art Blakey and later moved on to play with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis. Since the early 1970s, he has also been a group leader and solo performer in jazz, jazz fusion, and classical music. His improvisations draw from the traditions of jazz and other genres, including Western classical music, gospel, blues, and ethnic folk music.

His album &quot;The Köln Concert&quot;, released in 1975, is the best-selling piano recording in history. In 2008, he was inducted into &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in the magazine&#x27;s 73rd Annual Readers&#x27; Poll.

In 2003, Jarrett received the Polar Music Prize and was the first recipient to be recognized with prizes for both contemporary and classical music. In 2004, he received the Léonie Sonning Music Prize.

In February 2018, Jarrett suffered a stroke and has been unable to perform since. A second stroke in May 2018 left him partially paralyzed and unable to play with his left hand.

==Early life and education==
Jarrett was born on May 8, 1945, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to a mother of Slovenian descent. Jarrett&#x27;s grandmother was born in Segovci, near Apače in Slovenia. Jarrett&#x27;s father was of mostly German descent. He grew up in suburban Allentown with significant early exposure to music.

Jarrett possesses absolute pitch and displayed prodigious musical talents as a young child. He began piano lessons before his third birthday. At age five, he appeared on a television talent program hosted by swing bandleader Paul Whiteman. He performed in his first formal piano recital at the age of seven, playing works by composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Saint-Saëns, and ending with two of his own compositions. Encouraged by his mother, he took classical piano lessons with a series of teachers, including Eleanor Sokoloff of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

Jarrett attended Emmaus High School in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, where he learned jazz and became proficient in it. He developed a strong interest in contemporary jazz, and was inspired by a Dave Brubeck performance he attended in New Hope. He was invited to study classical composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, but he was already leaning toward jazz and turned it down.

After his graduation from Emmaus High School in 1963, Jarrett moved to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music and play cocktail piano in local Boston clubs.

==Career==
===The Jazz Messengers===

In 1964, Jarrett moved to New York City, where he played at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. Art Blakey hired Jarrett to play with The Jazz Messengers. Jarrett&#x27;s appearance on the Messengers&#x27; live album &quot;Buttercorn Lady&quot; marked his commercial recording debut. However, there was friction between Blakey and Jarrett, and Jarrett left after four months of touring. During a show he was noticed by Jack DeJohnette, who recommended Jarrett to his band leader Charles Lloyd. The Charles Lloyd Quartet had formed not long before and were exploring open, improvised forms while building supple grooves, and they were moving into terrain that was also being explored, although from another stylistic background, by some of the psychedelic rock bands of the West Coast. Their 1966 album &quot;Forest Flower&quot; was one of the most successful jazz recordings of the mid-1960s. They were invited to play The Fillmore in San Francisco, and won over the local hippie audience. The quartet toured across the U.S. and Europe, including appearances in Leningrad and Moscow. Their concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall was attended by The Beatles. The band was profiled in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which made Jarrett a popular musician in rock and jazz. The tour also laid the foundation for a lasting musical bond with DeJohnette.

Jarrett began to record his own tracks as a leader of small groups at first in a trio with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian. &quot;Life Between the Exit Signs&quot; (1967), his first album as a band leader, was released by Vortex followed by &quot;Restoration Ruin&quot; (1968), which Thom Jurek of AllMusic wrote was &quot;a curiosity in his catalog&quot;. Not only does Jarrett barely touch the piano, but he plays all the other instruments on what is essentially a folk-rock album. Unusually, he also sings. &quot;Somewhere Before&quot;, another trio album with Haden and Motian, was released in 1968 on Atlantic Records.

===Miles Davis===

The Charles Lloyd Quartet with Jarrett, Ron McClure, and DeJohnette came to an end in 1968 after their recording of &quot;Soundtrack&quot; because of money disputes and artistic differences. Jarrett was asked to join the Miles Davis group after the trumpeter heard him in a New York City club. During his tenure with Davis, Jarrett played both electronic organ and Rhodes piano, alternating with Chick Corea. The two appear side by side on some 1970 recordings, including the Isle of Wight Festival performance of August 1970 in the film &quot;Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue&quot; and on &quot;Bitches Brew Live&quot;. After Corea left in 1970, Jarrett often played electric piano and organ simultaneously. Despite his growing dislike of amplified music and electric instruments within jazz, Jarrett continued with the group out of respect for Davis and because of his desire to work with DeJohnette. Jarrett has often cited Davis as a vital musical and personal influence on his own thinking about music and improvisation.

Jarrett performs on several Davis albums, including &quot;Miles Davis at Fillmore&quot;, recorded June 17–20, 1970 at Fillmore East in New York City, and &quot;The Cellar Door Sessions 1970&quot;, recorded December 16–19, 1970 at The Cellar Door club in Washington, D.C.. His keyboard playing features prominently on &quot;Live-Evil&quot; and he plays electric organ on &quot;Get Up with It&quot;. Some other tracks from this period were released much later.

DeJohnette left Davis&#x27; band in the middle of 1971, and Jarrett followed in December. Jarrett later reflected: &quot;When Jack left I knew I was going to have to leave ... Nobody knew what Jack knew and could do what he could do simultaneously. That was the end of the flexibility of the band&quot;.

===1970s quartets and Manfred Eicher===

In 1971, Jarrett, Haden, and Motian participated in a four-day session for Atlantic Records during which they recorded the trio album &quot;The Mourning of a Star&quot; and two albums, &quot;El Juicio (The Judgement)&quot; and &quot;Birth&quot;, on which the trio was augmented by saxophonist Dewey Redman. Redman became an official member of the group, which later became known as the &quot;American quartet&quot;. They would go on to record over a dozen albums over five years. The group was often supplemented by an extra percussionist, such as Danny Johnson, Guilherme Franco, or Airto Moreira, and occasionally by guitarist Sam Brown.

Later in 1971, the quartet, with Brown and Moreira, recorded &quot;Expectations&quot; for Columbia Records, with string and brass arrangements by Jarrett. However, Columbia suddenly dropped Jarrett in favor of Herbie Hancock, and Jarrett&#x27;s manager negotiated a contract with Impulse! Records, for whom the group would record eight albums.

The quartet members played various instruments. Jarrett played soprano saxophone, recorder, banjo, percussion, and piano. Redman played musette, a Chinese double-reed instrument, and percussion, and Motian and Haden played a variety of percussion. Haden also produced a variety of unusual plucked and percussive sounds with his acoustic bass, running it through a wah-wah pedal for one track (&quot;Mortgage on My Soul&quot; on the album &quot;Birth&quot;). &quot;Byablue&quot; and &quot;Bop-Be&quot;, albums recorded for Impulse!, feature the compositions of Haden, Motian and Redman, as opposed to Jarrett&#x27;s own, which dominated the previous albums. Jarrett&#x27;s compositions and the musical identities of the group members gave this ensemble a distinctive sound. The quartet&#x27;s music is an amalgam of free jazz, straight-ahead post-bop, gospel music, and exotic, Middle-Eastern-sounding improvisations.

During this time, Jarrett received a letter from producer Manfred Eicher asking if he would like to record for the relatively new ECM label. Jarrett was impressed by the fact that Eicher was primarily concerned with musical quality, as opposed to financial gain. Jarrett&#x27;s American quartet released two albums, &quot;The Survivors&#x27; Suite&quot; and &quot;Eyes of the Heart&quot;, on ECM, and the label also issued &quot;Ruta and Daitya&quot;, consisting of duo tracks featuring Jarrett and DeJohnette recorded in early 1971 and tracks with Miles Davis after Jarrett gave tapes of the session to Eicher.

In 1972, Eicher proposed that Jarrett work with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek, whom Jarrett had met while in Europe with Charles Lloyd during the late 1960s. Their initial collaborations laid the groundwork for what would become known as the &quot;European quartet&quot;, which also featured Palle Danielsson on bass and Jon Christensen on drums. The group recorded five albums for ECM, each played in a style similar to that of the American quartet but with many of the avant-garde and Americana elements replaced by the European folk and classical music influences that characterized the work of ECM artists at the time.

===Solo piano===

Jarrett recorded a few solo pieces live under the guidance of Miles Davis at the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C., in December 1970. These were done on electric pianos (Rhodes and Contempo). Most parts of these recorded sets were released in 2007 on &quot;The Cellar Door Sessions&quot;, featuring four improvisations by Jarrett.

Jarrett&#x27;s first album for ECM, &quot;Facing You&quot; was released in 1971. He has continued to record solo studio piano albums intermittently throughout his career, including &quot;Staircase&quot; (1976), &quot;Invocations/The Moth and the Flame&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Melody at Night, with You&quot; (1999). &quot;Book of Ways&quot; (1986) is a studio recording of clavichord solos.

In 1973, Jarrett began playing totally improvised solo concerts, and it is the popularity of these concert recordings that made him one of the best-selling jazz artists in history. Albums released from these concerts were &quot;Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne&quot; (1973), which &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Jazz Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;The Köln Concert&quot; (1975), which became the best-selling piano recording in history, &quot;All About Jazz&quot;, and &quot;Sun Bear Concerts&quot; (1976), a 10-LP (and later 6-CD) box set. Another of Jarrett&#x27;s solo concerts, &quot;Dark Intervals&quot;, was released in 1987.

After a hiatus, Jarrett returned to extended solo improvised concert format with &quot;Paris Concert&quot; (1990), &quot;Vienna Concert&quot; (1991), Live at the Royal Festival Hall (1991) and &quot;La Scala&quot; (1995). These later concerts tend to be more influenced by classical music than the earlier ones, reflecting his interest in composers such as Bach and Shostakovich. In the liner notes to &quot;Vienna Concert&quot;, Jarrett named the performance his greatest achievement and the fulfillment of everything he was aiming to accomplish. &quot;I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself&quot;, he wrote.

Jarrett has commented that his best performances have been when he has had only the slightest notion of what he was going to play at the next moment. He also said that most people don&#x27;t know &quot;what he does&quot; which relates to what Miles Davis said to him expressing bewilderment as to how Jarrett could &quot;play from nothing&quot;.

Jarrett&#x27;s 100th solo performance in Japan was captured on video at Suntory Hall, Tokyo, in April 1987, and released the same year as &quot;Solo Tribute&quot;. This is a set of almost all standard songs. Another video recording, &quot;Last Solo&quot;, was released in 1987 from a solo concert at Kan-i Hoken hall in Tokyo in January 1984.

In the late 1990s, Jarrett was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and was unable to leave his home for long periods of time. During this period, he recorded &quot;The Melody at Night, with You&quot;, a solo piano effort consisting of jazz standards. The album had originally been a Christmas gift to his second wife, Rose Anne.

By 2000, Jarrett had returned to touring, both solo and with the Standards Trio. Two 2002 solo concerts in Japan, Jarrett&#x27;s first solo piano concerts following his illness, were released on the 2005 CD &quot;Radiance&quot; (a complete concert in Osaka and excerpts from one in Tokyo) and the 2006 DVD &quot;Tokyo Solo&quot; (the entire Tokyo performance). In contrast with previous concerts (which were generally a pair of continuous improvisations 30–40 minutes long), the 2002 concerts consist of a linked series of shorter improvisations (some as short as a minute and a half).

In September 2005, at Carnegie Hall, Jarrett performed his first solo concert in North America in more than ten years, released a year later as a double-CD set, &quot;The Carnegie Hall Concert&quot;. In late 2008, he performed solo in the Salle Pleyel in Paris and at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, marking the first time Jarrett played solo in London in 17 years. Recordings of these concerts were released in October 2009 on the album &quot;Paris / London: Testament&quot;. The 2005 documentary &quot;The Art of Improvisation&quot;, broadcast on BBC Two on November 12, 2021 concluded with his trio performing a recognizable version of &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;.

===The Standards Trio===

In 1983, at the suggestion of ECM head Manfred Eicher, Jarrett asked bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette, with whom he had worked on Peacock&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Tales of Another&quot;, to record an album of jazz standards, simply titled &quot;Standards, Vol. 1&quot;. Two more albums, &quot;Standards, Vol. 2&quot; and &quot;Changes&quot;, both recorded at the same session, followed soon after. The success of these albums and the group&#x27;s ensuing tour, which came as traditional acoustic post-bop was enjoying an upswing in the early 1980s, led to this new standards trio becoming one of the premier working groups in jazz, and certainly one of the most enduring, continuing to record and tour for more than 25 years. The Trio went on to record numerous live and studio albums consisting primarily of jazz repertory material.

The Jarrett-Peacock-DeJohnette trio also produced recordings that consist largely of challenging original material, including 1987&#x27;s &quot;Changeless&quot;. Several of the standards albums contain an original track or two, some attributed to Jarrett, but most are improvisations on jazz standards. The live recordings &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Always Let Me Go&quot; (released in 2001 and 2002 respectively) marked a renewed interest by the trio in wholly improvised free jazz. By this point in their history, the musical communication among these three men had become nothing short of telepathic, and their group improvisations frequently take on a complexity that sounds almost composed. The standards trio undertook frequent world tours of recital halls (the only venues Jarrett, a notorious stickler for acoustics, will play) and was one of the few truly successful jazz groups to play both straight-ahead (as opposed to smooth) and free jazz.

A related recording, &quot;At the Deer Head Inn&quot; (1992), is a live album of standards recorded with Paul Motian replacing DeJohnette, at the venue in Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania, 40 miles from Jarrett&#x27;s hometown, where he had his first job as a jazz pianist. It was the first time Jarrett and Motian had played together since the demise of the American quartet sixteen years earlier.

The Standard Trio disbanded in 2014 after more than 30 years. The final concert of Keith Jarrett&#x27;s trio was on November 30, 2014 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, New Jersey. The last encore was Thelonious Monk&#x27;s composition &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;. Peacock died in September 2020.

===Classical music===
Since the early 1970s, Jarrett&#x27;s success as a jazz musician has enabled him to maintain a parallel career as a classical composer and pianist, recording almost exclusively for ECM Records. &quot;In the Light&quot;, an album made in 1973, consists of short pieces for solo piano, strings, and various chamber ensembles, including a string quartet and a brass quintet, and a piece for cellos and trombones. This collection demonstrates a young composer&#x27;s affinity for a variety of classical styles.

&quot;Luminessence&quot; (1974) and &quot;Arbour Zena&quot; (1975) both combine composed pieces for strings with improvising jazz musicians, including Jan Garbarek and Charlie Haden. The strings here have a moody, contemplative feel that is characteristic of the &quot;ECM sound&quot; of the 1970s, and is also particularly well suited to Garbarek&#x27;s keening saxophone improvisations. From an academic standpoint, these compositions are dismissed by many classical music aficionados as lightweight, but Jarrett appeared to be working more towards a synthesis between composed and improvised music at this time, rather than the production of formal classical works. From this point on, however, his classical work would adhere to more conventional disciplines.

&quot;Ritual&quot; (1977) is a composed solo piano piece recorded by Dennis Russell Davies that is somewhat reminiscent of Jarrett&#x27;s own solo piano recordings.

&quot;The Celestial Hawk&quot; (1980) is a piece for orchestra, percussion, and piano that Jarrett performed and recorded with the Syracuse Symphony under Christopher Keene. This piece is the largest and longest of Jarrett&#x27;s efforts as a classical composer.

&quot;Bridge of Light&quot; (1993) is the last recording of classical compositions to appear under Jarrett&#x27;s name. The album contains three pieces written for a soloist with orchestra, and one for violin and piano. The pieces date from 1984 and 1990.

In 1988, New World Records released the CD &quot;Lou Harrison: Piano Concerto and Suite for Violin, Piano and Small Orchestra&quot;, featuring Jarrett on piano, with Naoto Otomo conducting the piano concerto with the New Japan Philharmonic. Robert Hughes conducted the Suite for Violin, Piano, and Small Orchestra. In 1992 came the release of Jarrett&#x27;s performance of Peggy Glanville-Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Etruscan Concerto&quot;, with Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Brooklyn Philharmonic. This was released on Music Masters Classics, with pieces by Lou Harrison and Terry Riley. In 1995 Music Masters Jazz released a CD on which one track featured Jarrett performing the solo piano part in &quot;Lousadzak&quot;, a 17-minute piano concerto by American composer Alan Hovhaness. The conductor again was Davies. Most of Jarrett&#x27;s classical recordings are of older repertoire, but he may have been introduced to this modern work by his one-time manager George Avakian, who was a friend of the composer. Jarrett has also recorded classical works for ECM by composers such as Bach, Handel, Shostakovich, and Arvo Pärt.

In 2004, Jarrett was awarded the Léonie Sonning Music Prize. Usually associated with classical musicians and composers, Miles Davis is the only other jazz performer to have won it.

===Other works===
Jarrett has also played harpsichord, clavichord, organ, soprano saxophone, and drums. He often played saxophone and various forms of percussion in the American quartet, though his recordings since the breakup of that group have rarely featured these instruments. On the majority of his recordings in the last 20 years, he has played acoustic piano only. He has spoken with some regret of his decision to give up playing the saxophone, in particular.

On April 15, 1978, Jarrett was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The 2001 German film &quot;Mostly Martha&quot;, whose music consultant was ECM Records founder Manfred Eicher, features Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;Country&quot; from the European quartet album &quot;My Song&quot; and &quot;U Dance&quot; from the Standards Trio album &quot;Tribute&quot;, as well as excerpts from Jarrett&#x27;s solo concerts.

==Lawsuit against Steely Dan==
Following the release of the album &quot;Gaucho&quot; in 1980 by the U.S. rock band Steely Dan, Jarrett sued the band for copyright infringement. &quot;Gaucho&#x27;s&quot; title track, credited to Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, bore a resemblance to Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;Long As You Know You&#x27;re Living Yours&quot; from Jarrett&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Belonging&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, Becker and Fagen were asked about the similarity between the two pieces of music, and Becker told &quot;Musician&quot; that he loved the Jarrett composition, while Fagen said they had been influenced by it. After their comments were published, Jarrett sued, and Becker and Fagen were legally obliged to add his name to the credits and provide Jarrett with publishing royalties.

==Idiosyncrasies==
Jarrett frequently emits loud vocalizations, sometimes characterized as moaning, during his playing. Jarrett is also physically active while playing jazz and improvised solo performances, but the vocalizations are generally absent whenever he plays classical repertoire. Jarrett has noted his vocalizations are based on involvement, not content, and are more of an interaction than a reaction. Interviewed in 2015, Jarrett explained the involuntary vocalizations made during his performances: &quot;It&#x27;s potential limitlessness that I&#x27;m feeling at that moment. If you think about it, it&#x27;s often in a space between phrases, [when I&#x27;m thinking,] &quot;How did I get to this point where I feel so full?&quot; And if you felt full of some sort of emotion you would have to make a sound. So that&#x27;s actually what it is – with the trio, without the trio, solo. Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t do it with classical music&quot;.

Jarrett is highly intolerant of audience noise, especially during solo improvised performances. He feels extraneous noise affects his inspiration and distracts from the purity of the sound. Cough drops are routinely supplied to Jarrett&#x27;s audiences in cold weather, and he has been known to stop playing and lead the crowd in a group cough. He has also complained onstage about audience members taking photographs, and has performed in the dark to prevent this.

Jarrett is opposed to electronic instruments and equipment, which he has described as &quot;toys&quot;. His liner notes for the 1973 album &quot;Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne&quot; states: &quot;I am, and have been, carrying on an anti-electric-music crusade of which this is an exhibit for the prosecution. Electricity goes through all of us and is not to be relegated to wires.&quot; He has largely eschewed electric or electronic instruments since his time with Miles Davis. However, in October 1972, he played electric piano and piano on Freddie Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Sky Dive.&quot;

==Cultural references==
A 2025 feature film, Köln 75, tells the story of Jarrett&#x27;s 1975 concert at the Köln Opera House.

Jarrett was referred to in Season 5, Episode 6 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in 2004, titled &quot;Sentimental Education&quot;; in the episode, Tony Blundetto mentions &quot;piping in a little Keith Jarrett&quot; among his plans for the massage studio he is building.

Jarrett was also mentioned in Season 2, Episode 6 of FX&#x27;s &quot;Atlanta&quot; in 2018. In this episode, titled &quot;Teddy Perkins&quot; , Darius remarks to a picture in Teddy Perkins&#x27; home and asked if the other person in the picture is Keith Jarrett, and Perkins says it was.

==Personal life==
Jarrett lives in an 18th-century farmhouse in Oxford Township, New Jersey, in rural Warren County, where he uses an adjacent barn as a recording and practice studio.

Jarrett was a follower of the teachings of George Gurdjieff (1866–1949) for many years, and in 1980 recorded an album of Gurdjieff&#x27;s compositions, called &quot;Sacred Hymns&quot;, for ECM. His forebears were Christian Scientists, and though he endorses the core of the faith, he does not follow all its precepts, and also identifies with the Sufi tradition and mystical Islam.

In 1964, Jarrett married Margot Erney, his girlfriend from Emmaus High School with whom Jarrett reconnected in Boston. The couple had two sons, Gabriel and Noah, and divorced in 1979. He and his second wife Rose Anne (née Colavito) divorced in 2010 after a 30-year marriage. Jarrett has four younger brothers, two of whom are involved in music. Chris Jarrett is also a pianist and Scott Jarrett is a producer and songwriter. Of the two sons from his first marriage, Noah Jarrett, is a bassist and composer and Gabriel Jarrett is a drummer based in Vermont. Keith Jarrett is currently married to Akiko Jarrett.

Jarrett&#x27;s race has been a source of commentary by media and activists throughout his career, as he has reported being recurrently mistaken as a black person. In a 2000 interview with Terry Gross, Jarrett relates an incident at the Heidelberg Jazz Festival in the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany when he was protested by black musicians for something akin to cultural appropriation. He also tells of a separate moment in his career when black jazz musician Ornette Coleman approached him backstage, and &quot;said something like &#x27;Man, you&#x27;ve got to be Black. You just have to be black. Jarrett replied &quot;I know. I know. I&#x27;m working on it.&quot;

In a September 11, 2000 interview with Terry Gross, Jarrett revealed that chronic fatigue syndrome required him to radically overhaul his piano to have less breakaway keypress resistance in order for him to keep playing.

Jarrett suffered two strokes in February and May 2018. After the second, he was paralyzed and spent nearly two years in a rehabilitation facility. Although he has regained a limited ability to walk with a cane and can play piano with his right hand, he remains partly paralyzed on his left side and is not expected to perform again. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what my future is supposed to be. I don&#x27;t feel right now like I&#x27;m a pianist&quot;, Jarrett told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October 2020.

<text>Bolodon is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of Europe and North America. It was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata and belongs to the suborder Plagiaulacida and family Plagiaulacidae.

==Type species==
The type species, &quot;Bolodon crassidens&quot;, is known from fossils of the Lower Cretaceous of England from the Lulworth Formation in Durlston Bay, Dorset.

The species &quot;Bolodon elongatus&quot; is possibly not referable to this genus: &quot;?new genus to be erected for &quot;Bolodon elongatus&quot;,&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 414).
Fossils of the species &quot;Bolodon minor&quot; (type species of the &quot;Plioprion&quot;) have been found in the Lower Cretaceous of Durlston Bay, Dorset. &quot;Plioprion&quot; (Cope, 1884) is probably synonymous with &quot;Bolodon&quot;.

The species &quot;Bolodon osborni&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1928. Fossils have been found in the Berriasian (Lower Cretaceous) of Durlston Bay, Dorset. Cifelli et al. (2014) erected &quot;B. hydei&quot; for remains from the Berriasian-Valanginian age Chilson Member of the Lakota Formation of South Dakota.

<text>David Maurice Robinson (born August 6, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1989 to 2003, and minority owner of the Spurs. Nicknamed &quot;the Admiral&quot; for his service with the U.S. Navy, Robinson was a 10-time NBA All-Star, the 1995 NBA MVP, a two-time NBA champion (1999 and 2003), a two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner (1992, 1996), a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee (2009 for his individual career, 2010 as a member of the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team), and a two-time U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame inductee (2008 individually, 2009 as a member of the 1992 Olympic team). He was honored as one of the league&#x27;s all-time players by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary (1996) and 75th Anniversary Teams (2021). He is widely considered one of the greatest centers in both college basketball and NBA history.

==Early life, family and education==

Robinson was born in Key West, Florida, the second child of Ambrose and Freda Robinson. Since Robinson&#x27;s father was in the U.S. Navy, the family moved frequently. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. Robinson attended Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., where Robinson&#x27;s father was working as an engineer.

Robinson was of average height for most of his childhood and teenage years, standing tall in his junior year of high school (age 16–17). However, during his senior year (age 17–18) in high school, he experienced a large growth spurt and grew to . He had not played organized basketball or attended any basketball camps, but the school&#x27;s basketball coach added him to the team. Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches.

Robinson graduated from Osbourn Park in 1983. He achieved a score of 1320 on the SAT and subsequently attended the United States Naval Academy, where he would major in mathematics and play on the basketball team. At the time the Naval Academy had a height restriction of for all midshipmen, but in the autumn when the new academic year began, Robinson had grown to . Assuming that he was unlikely to grow much more, the academy&#x27;s superintendent granted him a waiver, but Robinson continued growing, and by the start of his second year at the academy he had nearly reached his adult height of , which later prevented him from serving on any U.S. Navy ships.

In 2011, Robinson earned a Master of Arts in Administration (with concentration in organizational development) from the University of the Incarnate Word to better &quot;understand how businesses work and how to build them.&quot;

==College career and military service==
Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history. He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but in Robinson&#x27;s final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball&#x27;s two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim head coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.

Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to his naval career and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was required to serve only an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia. He was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service. Despite the nickname &quot;Admiral&quot;, Robinson&#x27;s actual rank upon fulfilling his service commitment was lieutenant (junior grade).

==Professional career==
===San Antonio Spurs (1989–2003)===
==== Rookie of the Year, DPOY award and scoring title (1989–1994)====
Since he had not signed a contract, NBA regulations stated that Robinson could have reentered the draft after his naval service. Although there was speculation that he might choose not to sign with the Spurs, Robinson agreed to move to San Antonio for the 1989–90 season, but the Spurs agreed to pay him as much as the average of the salaries of the two highest-paid players in the league each year, or release him to free agency.

The Spurs had spent the second half of the 1980s as an also-ran, bottoming out in 1988–89 season with a 21–61 record, the worst in franchise history at the time. While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history at the time (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98 season, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled &quot;David Robinson&#x27;s Supreme Court&quot;. The Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row. In the 1991–92 season Robinson led the league in blocks and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona. During the 1993–94 season, he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin&#x27;s single-game franchise record of 63) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it. In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.

====MVP title, playoff upsets and injury (1994–1998)====
Robinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play. In a &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine story, he seemed perplexed. “Solve Hakeem?” said Robinson. “You don’t solve Hakeem.”

Early in the 1996–97 season, Robinson&#x27;s dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with it, the first pick in the next year&#x27;s NBA draft. They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson&#x27;s quest for an NBA title.

==== Championship season (1998–1999) ====

The later years of Robinson&#x27;s career were plagued by back ailments.
Before the start of the 1998–99 season, the NBA owners and NBA commissioner David Stern locked out the NBA Players&#x27; Association to force negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37–13, giving them the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.

The Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers by a combined record of 11–1 to reach the NBA Finals for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year power forward Tim Duncan proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks in five games to become the first former American Basketball Association team to win an NBA title. Duncan was named Finals MVP.

Robinson and Duncan were nicknamed &quot;The Twin Towers&quot;.
==== Twilight years and second championship (1999–2003) ====

During the 1999–00 season, Robinson averaged 17.8 points per game, 10.0 rebounds per game and 2.3 blocks per game in 80 games. The Spurs made it to the playoffs as the fourth seed, but were defeated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs despite Robinson&#x27;s 23.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game.

Robinson announced he would retire from basketball following the 2002–03 season.

On June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson&#x27;s career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88–77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. During this game, Robinson scored 13 points, as well as getting 17 rebounds. He and the year&#x27;s regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award.

==Player profile==
Robinson possessed tremendous mobility in the post, speed, and ball-handling, especially for a center. With good hands on both offense and defense, Robinson was nearly unstoppable on both sides of the floor, throwing down dunks and blocking shots. He was also noted for his strong midrange jumpshot.

Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. He is also one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).

He is also one of only ten players to record 70 or more points in a single game. Robinson scored 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994. Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), Donovan Mitchell (71 points), Damian Lillard (71 points), Kobe Bryant (81 points), Joel Embiid (70 points), and Luka Dončić (73 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game. 

Robinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did, and to have reduced his own role in the team&#x27;s offense to accommodate a younger star. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Robinson as the 20th greatest player in NBA history.

==National team career==

David Robinson was a member of the United States national team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, 1987 Pan American Games, 1988 Summer Olympics, 1992 Summer Olympics, and 1996 Summer Olympics. He won the gold medal at all tournaments except the 1987 Pan Am Games, where he won a silver medal, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal.

==Other ventures==

In 2001, Robinson founded and funded the $9 million Carver Academy in San Antonio, a non-profit private school named for George Washington Carver to provide more opportunities for inner-city children. In 2012, the school became a public charter school and its name changed to IDEA Carver. Robinson continues to be a very active participant in the school&#x27;s day-to-day activities.

In 2008, Robinson partnered with Daniel Bassichis, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a board member of The Carver Academy, to form Admiral Capital Group, a private equity firm whose mission is to invest in opportunities that can provide both financial and social returns. Robinson&#x27;s primary motivation in starting Admiral Capital was to create a source of additional financial support for The Carver Academy. Its portfolio is worth more than $100 million and includes nine hotels and office buildings across the US as well as Centerplate, one of the largest hospitality companies in the world. Admiral Capital Group also partnered with Living Cities to form the Admiral Center, a non-profit created to support other athletes and entertainers with their philanthropic initiatives. Robinson is also co-owner of a Jaguar Land Rover dealership in San Juan, Texas.

==Personal life==

Robinson married Valerie Hoggatt in 1991. They have three sons, David Jr., Corey, and Justin. Corey attended Notre Dame and was a wide receiver on the football team before ending his playing career in 2016 on medical advice due to multiple concussions prior to what would have been his senior season. He was student body president for the 2016–17 school year. Justin, a forward in basketball and a two-time all-state selection in Texas, began attending Duke University in August 2015. He was initially recruited to the Duke team as a &quot;preferred walk-on&quot; with the opportunity to eventually earn a scholarship, but he was placed on scholarship before his arrival at Duke. On September 18, 2020, Mornar Bar of Erste Liga in Montenegro announced that they had signed Justin, signaling the start to his professional basketball career.

David Robinson became a Christian on June 8, 1991, after being encouraged to read the Bible.

==Charitable efforts==
In addition to his lengthy NBA career, Robinson is also noted for his charitable work. In 1991, Robinson visited with fifth-graders at Gates Elementary School in San Antonio and challenged them to finish school and go to college. He offered a $2,000 scholarship to everyone who did. In 1998, proving even better than his word, Robinson awarded $8,000 to each of those students who had completed his challenge. In perhaps his greatest civic and charitable achievement, David and his wife, Valerie, founded the Carver Academy in San Antonio, which opened its doors in September 2001. To date, the Robinsons have donated more than $11 million to the school.

In March 2003, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to charity, the NBA renamed its award for outstanding charitable efforts in honor of Robinson. Winners of the NBA&#x27;s Community Assist Award receive the &quot;David Robinson Plaque&quot;, with the inscription &quot;Following the standard set by NBA Legend David Robinson who improved the community piece by piece.&quot; The award is given out monthly by the league to recognize players for their charitable efforts. Robinson is also the recipient of the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. In 2011, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts with the Carver Academy, Robinson received the Children&#x27;s Champion Award from the charitable organization Children&#x27;s Hunger Fund. In 2018, Robinson became a member of the V Foundation for Cancer Research&#x27;s board of directors.

<text>Albionbaataridae is a family of small, extinct mammals within the order Multituberculata. Fossil remains are known from the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Europe and Asia. These herbivores lived their obscure lives during the Mesozoic, also known as the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot; They were among the more derived representatives of the informal suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;. The taxon Albionbaataridae was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Ensom P.C. in 1994.

Members of Albionbaataridae were &quot;Shrew-sized taxa that differ from all other multituberculates in having relatively flat, multi-cusped anterior upper premolars, with 10-14 cusps arranged in three rows, rather than 3-4, rarely up to nine high cusps in two rows, and in having lingual slope of all premolars covered by prominent, subparallel ridges...,&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 414).

<text>In cellular biology, a somatic cell (), or vegetal cell, is any biological cell forming the body of a multicellular organism other than a gamete, germ cell, gametocyte or undifferentiated stem cell. Somatic cells compose the body of an organism and divide through mitosis.

In contrast, gametes derive from meiosis within the germ cells of the germline and they fuse during sexual reproduction. Stem cells also can divide through mitosis, but are different from somatic in that they differentiate into diverse specialized cell types.

In mammals, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to spermatozoa and ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote, which divides and differentiates into the cells of an embryo. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cell in the human body.

Theoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they transmit their mutations, to their cellular descendants (if they have any), but not to the organism&#x27;s descendants. However, in sponges, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in Cnidaria, differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline. Mitotic cell division is only seen in diploid somatic cells. Only some cells like germ cells take part in reproduction.

==Evolution==
As multicellularity was theorized to be evolved many times, so did sterile somatic cells. The evolution of an immortal germline producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of mortality, and can be viewed in its simplest version in volvocine algae. Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germline are called Weismannists. Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., vertebrates, arthropods, &quot;Volvox&quot;), as many species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g., land plants, most algae, and numerous invertebrates).

==Genetics and chromosomes==
Like all cells, somatic cells contain DNA arranged in chromosomes. If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called diploid and the organism is called a diploid organism. The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called haploid. Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. In humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes organized into 23 pairs. By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a zygote. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).

A large number of species have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours (&quot;tetraploid&quot;) or even sixes (&quot;hexaploid&quot;). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of wheat, &quot;Triticum aestivum L.&quot;, a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every chromatid.

The frequency of spontaneous mutations is significantly lower in advanced male germ cells than in somatic cell types from the same individual. Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells. These findings appear to reflect employment of more effective mechanisms to limit the initial occurrence of spontaneous mutations in germ cells than in somatic cells. Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic DNA damages.

==Cloning==

In recent years, the technique of cloning whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called &quot;somatic cell nuclear transfer&quot; and involves removing the nucleus from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an ovum of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a diploid number of chromosomes). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the uterus of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any mitochondrial DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus. In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as Dolly the Sheep (July 5, 1996 - February 14, 2003) and, more recently, Snuppy (April 24, 2005 - May 2015), the first cloned dog.

== Biobanking ==
Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of biobanking. The cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a means of conserving animal genetic material in response to decreasing ecological biodiversity. As populations of living organisms fall so does their genetic diversity. This places species long-term survivability at risk. Biobanking aims to preserve biologically viable cells through long-term storage for later use. Somatic cells have been stored with the hopes that they can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can then differentiate into viable reproductive cells.

==Genetic modifications==

Development of biotechnology has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions. Two current means of gene editing are the use of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).

Genetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some controversies, although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.

==Cellular aging==

In mammals a high level of repair and maintenance of cellular DNA appears to be beneficial early in life. However, some types of cell, such as those of the brain and muscle, undergo a transition from mitotic cell division to a post-mitotic (non-dividing) condition during early development, and this transition is accompanied by a reduction in DNA repair capability. This reduction may be an evolutionary adaptation permitting the diversion of cellular resources that were earlier used for DNA repair, as well as for DNA replication and cell division, to higher priority neuronal and muscular functions. An effect of these reductions is to allow increased accumulation of DNA damage likely contributing to cellular aging.

<text>Yvonne Louise Georgette Loriod-Messiaen (; 20 January 1924 – 17 May 2010) was a French pianist, teacher, and composer, and the second wife of composer Olivier Messiaen. Her sister was the Ondes Martenot player Jeanne Loriod.

==Biography==
Loriod was born in Houilles, Yvelines to Gaston and Simone Loriod. Initially receiving piano lessons from her godmother, she later studied at the Paris Conservatoire and became one of Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s most avid pupils. She also studied with Isidor Philipp, Lazare Lévy then Marcel Ciampi. She went on to become a nationally acclaimed recording artist and concert pianist and premiered most of Messiaen&#x27;s works for the piano, starting in the 1940s. Messiaen said that he was able to indulge in &quot;the greatest eccentricities&quot; when writing for piano, knowing that they would be mastered by Loriod. Both she and her sister Jeanne often performed as the soloists in his &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;. Loriod also orchestrated part of Messiaen&#x27;s final orchestral work, &quot;Concert à quatre&quot;.

Loriod gave the French premiere of Béla Bartók&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1945, having learnt it in only eight days.

In 1961, Loriod married Olivier Messiaen following the death of his long institutionalized first wife, Claire Delbos. She is generally considered to be the most important interpreter of Messiaen&#x27;s piano works. In her later years, she and Messiaen acted as mentors to the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who has since become a great champion of the works of Messiaen.

Olivier Messiaen died in April 1992 in Saint-Denis. She survived him by 18 years and died on 17 May 2010 in Paris, aged 86.

<text>Gardner Raymond Dozois ( ; July 23, 1947 – May 27, 2018) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the founding editor of &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot; anthologies (1984–2018) and was editor of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; (1986–2004), garnering multiple Hugo and Locus Awards for those works almost every year. He also won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story twice. He was inducted to the Science Fiction Hall of Fame on June 25, 2011.

==Biography==
Dozois was born July 23, 1947, in Salem, Massachusetts. He graduated from Salem High School with the Class of 1965. From 1966 to 1969 he served in the Army as a journalist, after which he moved to New York City to work as an editor in the science fiction field. One of his stories had been published by Frederik Pohl in the September 1966 issue of &quot;If&quot; but his next four appeared in 1970, three in Damon Knight&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Orbit&quot;.

Dozois said that he turned to reading fiction partially as an escape from the provincialism of his home town.

He was badly injured in a taxi accident after returning from a Philadelphia Phillies game in 2004 (causing him to miss Worldcon for the first time in many years) but made a full recovery. On July 6, 2007, Dozois had surgery for a planned quintuple bypass operation. A week later, he experienced complications which prompted additional surgery to implant a defibrillator.

Dozois died on May 27, 2018, of a systemic infection at a hospital in Philadelphia at the age of 70.

== Fiction ==
As a writer, Dozois mainly worked in shorter forms. He won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story twice: once for &quot;&quot; in 1983, and again for &quot;Morning Child&quot; in 1984. His short fiction has been collected in &quot;The Visible Man&quot; (1977), &quot;Geodesic Dreams&quot; (a best-of collection), &quot;Slow Dancing through Time&quot; (1990, collaborations), &quot;Strange Days&quot; (2001, another best-of collection), &quot;Morning Child and Other Stories&quot; (2004) and &quot;When the Great Days Come&quot; (2011). As a novelist, Dozois&#x27;s oeuvre is significantly smaller. He was the author of one solo novel, &quot;Strangers&quot; (1978), as well as a collaboration with George Alec Effinger, &quot;Nightmare Blue&quot; (1977), and a collaboration with George R. R. Martin and Daniel Abraham for &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Run&quot; (2008). After becoming editor of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot;, Dozois&#x27;s fiction output dwindled. His 2006 novelette &quot;Counterfactual&quot; won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. Dozois also wrote short fiction reviews for &quot;Locus&quot;.

Michael Swanwick, one of his co-authors, completed a long interview with Dozois covering every published piece of his fiction. &quot;Being Gardner Dozois: An Interview by Michael Swanwick&quot; was published by Old Earth Books in 2001. It won the Locus Award for Non-Fiction and was a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Related Work.

==Editorial work==
Dozois was known primarily as an editor, winning the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor 15 times in 17 years from 1988 to his retirement from &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; in 2004. George R. R. Martin described him as the most important and influential editor in science fiction since John W. Campbell. In addition to his work with &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; (of which he was the first associate editor in 1976), he also worked in the 1970s with magazines such as &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Worlds of Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;.

Dozois was also a prolific short fiction anthologist. After resigning from his &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; position, he remained the editor of the anthology series &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot;, published annually since 1984. In three decades &quot;Locus&quot; readers have voted it the year&#x27;s best anthology almost 20 times and the runner-up almost 10 times. And, with Jack Dann, he edited a long series of themed anthologies, each with a self-explanatory title such as &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Seaserpents&quot;, or &quot;Hackers&quot;.

Stories selected by Gardner Dozois for the annual best-of-year volumes have won, as of December 2015, 44 Hugos, 41 Nebulas, 32 Locus, 10 World Fantasy and 18 Sturgeon Awards. That also includes the Dutton series (Dozois volumes only).

Dozois consistently expressed a particular interest in adventure SF and space opera, which he collectively referred to as &quot;center-core SF&quot;.

<text>Joe William Haldeman (born June 9, 1943) is an American science fiction author. 

He is best known for his novel &quot;The Forever War&quot; (1974), which was inspired by his experiences as a combat soldier in the Vietnam War. That novel and other works, including &quot;The Hemingway Hoax&quot; (1991) and &quot;Forever Peace&quot; (1997), have won science fiction awards, including the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. He received the SFWA Grand Master for career achievements. In 2012, he was inducted as a member of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. 

From 1983 to 2014, he was a professor teaching writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

== Life ==

Haldeman was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His family traveled and he lived in Puerto Rico, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Bethesda (Maryland) and Anchorage (Alaska) as a child. He had to repeatedly start classes as a new kid in local schools.

In 1965, Haldeman married Mary Gay Potter, known as Gay Haldeman. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Maryland in 1967.

He was immediately drafted into the United States Army. Serving as a combat engineer in the Vietnam War, he was wounded in combat and received a Purple Heart. He struggled to adjust to civilian life after returning home. His wartime experience inspired his debut novel, &quot;War Year;&quot; his later novels such as &quot;The Hemingway Hoax&quot; and &quot;The Forever War,&quot; continued to explore the experience of soldiers in wartime and after returning home.

In 1975, he received a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. 

Haldeman has resided alternately in Gainesville, Florida, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1983 until his retirement in 2014, he was an adjunct professor of writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He set his 2007 novel, &quot;The Accidental Time Machine&quot; at MIT. Haldeman is also a painter.

In 2009 and 2010, Haldeman was hospitalized for pancreatitis.

== Work ==
Haldeman&#x27;s first book was a 122-page novel, &quot;War Year&quot;, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in May 1972. The novel was sold with the help of fellow writer Ben Bova. It was based on his letters home from Vietnam and was marketed as mainstream and young adult. His most famous novel is his second, &quot;The Forever War&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 1974), which was inspired by his Vietnam experiences and originated as his MFA thesis for the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. It won the year&#x27;s &quot;Best Novel&quot; Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards. He later wrote sequels.

In 1975, two Attar novels were published as Pocket Books paperback originals under the pen name Robert Graham. Haldeman also wrote two of the earliest original novels based on the 1960s &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series universe, &quot;Planet of Judgment&quot; (August 1977) and &quot;World Without End&quot; (February 1979).

In a college creative writing class in 1967, Haldeman wrote the first two SF stories which he (later) sold. &quot;Out of Phase&quot; was published in the September 1969 &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine, and &quot;the other worked its way down to a penny-a-word market, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and netted me all of $15 – but then years later it was adapted for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, for fifty times as much. Not bad for a story banged out overnight to meet a class deadline.&quot;

Haldeman has written at least one produced Hollywood movie script. The film, a low-budget science fiction film called &quot;Robot Jox&quot;, was released in 1990. He was not entirely happy with the product, saying &quot;to me it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;d had a child who started out well and then sustained brain damage&quot;.

In a 2016 interview, Haldeman said, &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none I think. It&#x27;s a way to go. Not all writers go that way, but many of them do. On a day-to-day basis I wake up in the morning and I can do anything I feel like doing. I don&#x27;t say, uh oh, I&#x27;ve gotta get back to that damn novel again. I can always write a poem or something. ... &quot;

== Major awards ==
The Science Fiction Writers of America officers and past presidents selected Haldeman as the 27th SFWA Grand Master in 2009, and he received the corresponding Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement as a writer during Nebula Awards weekend in 2010. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in June 2012.

He has also won numerous annual awards for particular works.

He is a lifetime member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), and past president.

His filk song &quot;The Ballad of Stan Long (a sexist epic)&quot; received a Pegasus Award in 2005.

He received the Inkpot Award in 1991.

<doc id="207770" wikidata="Q371247" url="?curid=207770" title="Oslo II Accord">
<text>The Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly known as Oslo II or Oslo 2, was a key and complex agreement in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. Because it was signed in Taba, Egypt, it is sometimes called the Taba Agreement. The Oslo Accords envisioned the establishment of a Palestinian interim self-government in the Palestinian territories. Oslo II created the Areas A, B and C in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority was given some limited powers and responsibilities in the Areas A and B and a prospect of negotiations on a final settlement based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The Accord was officially signed on 28 September 1995.

==Historical context==
The Oslo II Accord was first signed in Taba (in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt) by Israel and the PLO on 24 September 1995 and then four days later on 28 September 1995 by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and witnessed by US President Bill Clinton as well as by representatives of Russia, Egypt, Jordan, Norway, and the European Union in Washington, D.C.

The agreement is built on the foundations of the initial Oslo I Accord, formally called the &quot;Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements&quot;, which had been formally signed on 13 September 1993 by Israel and the PLO, with Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat in Washington, D.C. shaking hands, and officially witnessed by the United States and Russia.

It supersedes three earlier agreements:

* the Gaza–Jericho Agreement or Cairo Agreement of 4 May 1994
* the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO of 29 August 1994
* the Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities of 27 August 1995

The Oslo II Accord is called an &quot;interim&quot; agreement because it was supposed to be the basis for subsequent negotiations and the preliminary of an eventual comprehensive peace agreement. Several additional agreements were concluded following Oslo II, but negotiations did not produce a final peace agreement. The 2002 Road map for peace abandoned the Oslo Accords and envisioned a rather loose scheme of withdrawal.

== Aim of the agreement ==

The preamble of the agreement speaks of peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity, and security, while recognizing the mutual legitimate and political rights of the parties. The aim of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is, among other things, to establish a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, for a transitional period not exceeding five years, leading to a permanent settlement based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.

As soon as possible but not later than 4 May 1996, negotiations on the permanent status would be started, leading to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and settling all the main issues.

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared the main object of the Interim Agreement 
==Content of the agreement==
The Interim Agreement comprises over 300 pages containing 5 &quot;chapters&quot; with 31 &quot;articles&quot;, plus 7 &quot;annexes&quot; and 9 attached &quot;maps&quot;. The agreement has a &quot;preamble&quot; acknowledging its roots in earlier diplomatic efforts of UN Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) and UN Security Council Resolution 338 (1973) the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the other prior agreements that came before it. Most significantly the agreement recognizes the establishment of a &quot;Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority,&quot; that is an elected Council, called &quot;the Council&quot; or &quot;the Palestinian Council&quot;.

===Chapter 1: The Palestinian Council===
Consisting of Articles I–IX: The role and powers of a governing Palestinian &quot;council&quot; and committee dealing with civil affairs and the transfer of power from Israel to the Palestinian Council.

===Chapter 3: Legal affairs===
Consisting of Articles XVII–XXI: The scope of the Palestinian Council&#x27;s authority and jurisdiction and the resolution of conflicts, the legislative powers of the Council, that &quot;Israel and the Council shall exercise their powers and responsibilities ... with due regard to internationally-accepted norms and principles of human rights and the rule of law&quot;, the various rights, liabilities and obligations with the transfer of powers and responsibilities from the Israeli military government and its civil administration to the Palestinian Council, dealing with financial claims, and the settlement of differences and disputes.

===Chapter 4: Cooperation===
Consisting of Articles XXII–XXVIII: Relations between Israel and the Council:

The rules for economic relations as set out in the Protocol on Economic Relations, signed in Paris on April 29, 1994, cooperation programs that will hopefully be developed, the role and functioning of the &quot;Joint Israeli-Palestinian Liaison Committee&quot; set up as part of the &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; (Oslo Accords 1993 and the setting up of a &quot;Monitoring and Steering Committee&quot;, liaison and cooperation with Jordan and Egypt, and locating and returning missing persons and soldiers missing in action.

===Chapter 5: Miscellaneous provisions===
Consisting of Articles XXIX–XXXI: Arrangements for safe passage of persons and transportation between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, coordination between Israel and the Council regarding passage to and from Egypt and Jordan as well as any other agreed international crossings, and then the final clauses dealing with the signing of the agreement, its implementation, that the Gaza–Jericho Agreement (May 1994), the Preparatory Transfer Agreement (August 1994), and the Further Transfer Protocol (August 1995) will be superseded by this agreement, the need and timing of permanent status negotiations, and that:

Discussion about the release of Palestinian prisoners, agreement about the attached annexes and maps, and commencement of Israel&#x27;s redeployment.

<doc id="207772" wikidata="Q489193" url="?curid=207772" title="Harry Harrison (writer)">
<text>Harry Max Harrison (born Henry Maxwell Dempsey; March 12, 1925 – August 15, 2012) was an American science fiction author, known mostly for his character The Stainless Steel Rat and for his novel &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (1966). The latter was the rough basis for the motion picture &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973). Long resident in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, Harrison was involved in the foundation of the Irish Science Fiction Association, and was, with Brian Aldiss, co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group.

Aldiss called him &quot;a constant peer and great family friend&quot;. His friend Michael Carroll said of Harrison&#x27;s work: &quot;Imagine &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; or &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, and picture them as science-fiction novels. They&#x27;re rip-roaring adventures, but they&#x27;re stories with a lot of heart.&quot; Novelist Christopher Priest wrote in an obituary

==Career==

Before becoming an editor and writer, Harrison started in the science fiction field as an illustrator, notably with EC Comics&#x27; two science fiction comic book series, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot;. In these and other comic book stories, he most often worked with Wally Wood. Wood usually inked over Harrison&#x27;s layouts, and the two freelanced for several publishers and genres, including westerns and horror comics. He and Wood split up their partnership in 1950 and went their separate ways. Harrison used house pen names such as Wade Kaempfert and Philip St. John to edit magazines and published other fiction under the pen names Felix Boyd and Hank Dempsey (see Personal Life below). Harrison ghostwrote &quot;Vendetta for the Saint&quot;, one of the long-running series of novels featuring Leslie Charteris&#x27; character The Saint. Harrison also wrote for syndicated comic strips, writing several stories for the character Rick Random.

His first short story, &quot;Rock Diver&quot;, was published in the February 1951 issue of &quot;Worlds Beyond&quot;, edited by Damon Knight; the magazine had previously published his illustrations. While in New York, he socialized at the Hydra Club, an organization of New York&#x27;s science fiction writers, including Isaac Asimov, Alfred Bester, James Blish, Anthony Boucher, Avram Davidson, Judith Merril, and Theodore Sturgeon.

Harrison has become much better known for his later writing, particularly for his humorous and satirical science fiction, such as the &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; series and his novel &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&quot;—which parodied the works of Isaac Asimov. Priest wrote:

Adi Robertson agreed: &quot;His books toed the line between science fiction adventure, humor, and satire, often with a strong anti-military bent informed by his time in the U.S. Army Air Forces.&quot;

During the 1950s and 1960s, he was the main writer of the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; newspaper strip. One of his &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; scripts was serialized in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine. Harrison drew sketches to help the artist be more scientifically accurate, which the artist largely ignored.

Not all of Harrison&#x27;s writing was comic. He wrote many stories on serious themes, of which by far the best known is the novel about overpopulation and consumption of the world&#x27;s resources, &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (1966), which was used as a basis for the 1973 science fiction film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (though the film changed aspects of the plot).

For a time Harrison was closely associated with Brian Aldiss. They collaborated on a series of anthology projects and did much in the 1970s to raise the standards of criticism in the field, including institution of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Priest wrote, &quot;In 1965 Harrison and Aldiss published the first issue (of two) of the world&#x27;s first serious journal of SF criticism, &quot;SF Horizons&quot;. Together they edited many anthologies of short stories, each one illustrating the major themes of SF, and although not intended as critical apparatus the books were a way of delineating the unique material of the fantastic. As committed internationalists, the two men created World SF, an organisation of professionals intended to encourage and enhance the writing of non-anglophone SF.&quot; In particular, the two edited nine volumes of &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot; anthology series as well as three volumes of the &quot;Decade&quot; series, collecting science fiction of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s respectively.

In 1990, Harrison was the professional Guest of Honor at ConFiction, the 48th World SF Convention, in The Hague, Netherlands, together with Joe Haldeman and Wolfgang Jeschke.

Harrison did not win a major genre award for any specific work of fiction. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Harrison in 2004 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him its 26th SFWA Grand Master in 2008 (presentation of the Damon Knight Award following in 2009). He became a cult hero in Russia, where he won the 2008 Golden Roscon award for lifetime achievement in science fiction.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Harrison was born March 12, 1925, as Henry Maxwell Dempsey in Stamford, Connecticut. His father, Henry Leo Dempsey, a printer who was three-fourths of Irish descent, changed his name to Harrison soon after Harry was born. Harry did not know this himself until he was 30 years old, at which point he changed his name to Harry Max Harrison in court. His mother, Ria, née Kirjassoff, was Russian Jewish. She had been born in Riga, Latvia, and grew up in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Her brother, Max David Kirjassoff (1888–1923), had been an American consul in Japan, but he died along with his wife Alice during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

After finishing Forest Hills High School in 1943, Harrison was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II as a gunsight technician and as a gunnery instructor. Priest adds that he became a sharpshooter, a military policeman, and a specialist in the prototypes of computer-aided bomb-sights and gun turrets. &quot;But overall the army experience vested in him a hatred of the military that was to serve him well as a writer later on.&quot;

In 1946, he enrolled in Hunter College in New York City and later ran a studio selling illustrations to comics and science fiction magazines.

===Marriages===
Harrison married Evelyn Harrison, whom he included in a cartoon he drew of the Hydra Club in 1950. They divorced in 1951, and Evelyn married the science fiction writer Lester del Rey shortly afterwards.

Harrison married Joan Merkler Harrison in 1954. Their marriage lasted until her death of cancer in 2002. They had two children, Todd (born in 1955) and Moira (born in 1959), to whom he dedicated his novel &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot;

===Esperanto===
In his middle years, Harrison became an advocate of Esperanto, saying he could &quot;write and speak it with an automatic ease I have never been able to capture in any language other than my native English&quot;; he learned it, according to Christopher Priest, out of boredom during military service. The language often appears in his novels, particularly in his &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; and &quot;Deathworld&quot; series.

He was the honorary president of the Esperanto Association of Ireland, where he had moved in the 1970s, living with his family for a number of years in a then-state-of-the-art home he built in the Vale of Avoca in County Wicklow. He also held memberships in other Esperanto organizations such as Esperanto-USA (formerly the &quot;Esperanto League for North America&quot;), of which he was an honorary member, and the Universala Esperanto-Asocio (World Esperanto Association), of whose Honorary Patrons&#x27; Committee he was a member.

===Residences===
Harrison resided in many parts of the world including Mexico, England, Italy, Denmark, and Ireland.

Priest writes that Harrison made many household moves abroad:

After many years of moving around and raising children, he spent most of his later years residing in Ireland. Because Harrison had an Irish grandparent, he was able to assume citizenship, and by taking advantage of the Irish tax exemption for artists, he enjoyed tax-free status.

Harrison also kept an apartment in London for many years, and later in Brighton, these being used for his frequent visits to England, and when Joan died in 2002, his British home became permanent.

Harrison&#x27;s official website, launched at the Irish national convention a few years earlier, announced his death on August 15, 2012, at his apartment in Brighton, England.

On learning of his death on August 15, 2012, Harlan Ellison said, &quot;It&#x27;s a day without stars in it.&quot;

==Bibliography==

<doc id="207774" wikidata="Q724395" url="?curid=207774" title="Keith Laumer">
<text>John Keith Laumer ( – ) was an American science fiction author. Prior to becoming a full-time writer, he was an officer in the United States Air Force and a diplomat in the United States Foreign Service. His older brother March Laumer was also a writer, known for his adult reinterpretations of the Land of Oz (also mentioned in Laumer&#x27;s &quot;The Other Side of Time&quot;). Frank Laumer, their youngest brother, is a historian and writer.

==Early life==
Keith Laumer was born in 1925 in Syracuse, New York. He attended Indiana University, 1943–44, and then served in the United States Army Air Forces in the Second World War in Europe. He later attended Stockholm University, 1948–49, and then received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1950 from the University of Illinois. He served twice in the US Air Force, 1953–56 and 1960–65, attaining the rank of captain in the latter tour. In between the two terms in the military, Laumer was a member of the US Foreign Service in Burma.

In the late 1950s, Mr. Laumer returned to Florida and purchased a small two-acre island on a lake in Hernando County near Weeki Wachee. He would reside there for the rest of his life.

Around this time he turned his attention to writing, specifically science fiction; his first work, a short story, was published in April 1959.

==Writing career==
Keith Laumer is best known for his Bolo and Retief stories. Stories from the former chronicle the evolution of super tanks that eventually become self-aware through the constant improvement resulting from centuries of intermittent warfare against various alien races. The latter deals with the adventures of a cynical spacefaring diplomat who constantly has to overcome the red-tape-infused failures of people with names like Ambassador Grossblunder. The Retief stories were greatly influenced by Laumer&#x27;s earlier career in the US Foreign Service. In an interview with Paul Walker of &quot;Luna Monthly&quot;, Laumer stated, &quot;I had no shortage of iniquitous memories of the Foreign Service.&quot;

Laumer&#x27;s other adventures often included the subjects of time travel and alternate worlds, such as found in &quot;A Trace of Memory&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Beach&quot; and the Imperium series.

Four of his shorter works received Hugo or Nebula Award nominations (&quot;In the Queue&quot; was nominated for both), and &quot;A Plague of Demons&quot; (1965) received a nomination for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966.

During his peak years of 1959–1971, Laumer was a prolific science fiction writer. His novels and stories tend to follow one of three patterns:

* fast-paced, straight adventures in time and space, with an emphasis on lone-wolf, latent superhuman protagonists, self-sacrifice, and transcendence
* broad, sometimes over-the-top, comedies
* experimental work verging on New Wave science fiction

In 1971, Laumer suffered a stroke while working on the novel &quot;The Ultimax Man&quot;. As a result, he was unable to write for a few years. As he explained in an interview with Charles Platt published in &quot;Dream Makers Volume II&quot; (1983), he refused to accept the doctors&#x27; diagnosis. He came up with an alternative explanation and developed an alternative (and very painful) treatment program. Although he was unable to write in the early 1970s, he had a number of books published that had been unpublished at the time of the stroke.

In the mid-1970s, Laumer partially recovered from the stroke and resumed writing. However, the quality of his work suffered, and his career declined. In later years, Laumer also re-used scenarios and characters from earlier works to create new books, which one critic felt limited their appeal:

His Bolo creations were popular enough that other authors have written standalone science fiction about them.

An anthology &quot;Created by Keith Laumer&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Vegetables&quot;, appeared in 1998. Actually edited by Martin H. Greenberg and Charles G. Waugh, the book&#x27;s introduction (by Ben Bova) said the book was Laumer&#x27;s idea, but that he had died without completing it.

==Model airplane designer==
Laumer was also a model airplane enthusiast, and published two dozen designs between 1956 and 1962 in the U.S. magazines &quot;Air Trails&quot;, &quot;Model Airplane News&quot; and &quot;Flying Models&quot;, as well as the British &quot;Aeromodeller&quot;. He published one book on the subject, &quot;How to Design and Build Flying Models&quot; in 1960. His later designs were mostly gas-powered, free-flight planes, and had a whimsical charm with names to match, like the &quot;Twin Lizzie&quot; and the &quot;Lulla-Bi&quot;. His designs are still being revisited, reinvented and built today.

Books set in the Imperium mythos: a continuum of parallel worlds policed by the Imperium, a government based in an alternate Stockholm. In the science fiction novel &quot;Worlds of the Imperium&quot;, the Imperium is formed in an alternate history where the American Revolution did not occur, and the British Empire and Germany merged into a unified empire in 1900. The protagonist, American diplomat Brion Bayard, is kidnapped by the Imperium because the Brion Bayard in a third parallel Earth is apparently waging war against the Imperium. Further adventures follow after Bayard decides to remain in the service of the Imperium.

* &quot;Enemies From Beyond&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Army of the Undead&quot; by-lined Rafe Bernard (1967) is often mistakenly attributed to Laumer because it is the third entry in the Pyramid Books &quot;Invaders&quot; novel series as published in the US, but in fact &quot;Bernard&quot; (a pseudonym for Reginald Alec Martin) was one of the two British authors commissioned by Corgi Books in the UK to pen original novels based on the TV show (the other was Peter Leslie). The book appeared as the third title in Corgi&#x27;s UK line as &quot;The Halo Highway&quot;. Evidence seems to indicate a reciprocal reprint deal Pyramid worked out with Corgi for use of a single title, since only the Bernard book, but not the Peter Leslie ones, saw print in the United States; while only Laumer&#x27;s first &quot;Invaders&quot; title, but not his second, saw print in the United Kingdom. (Verification can be found in Kurt Peer&#x27;s book &quot;TV Tie-Ins&quot; (1967, Neptune Publishing and, later, TV Books).

<doc id="207775" wikidata="Q152768" url="?curid=207775" title="Daniel Barenboim">
<text>Daniel Moses Barenboim (; born 15 November 1942) is an Argentine-Israeli classical pianist and conductor based in Berlin, who also has Spanish and Palestinian citizenship. From 1992 until January 2023, Barenboim was the general music director of the Berlin State Opera and &quot;Staatskapellmeister&quot; of its orchestra, the Staatskapelle Berlin.

Barenboim previously served as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including seven Grammy awards, an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France&#x27;s Legion of Honour as a Commander, Grand Officier and Grand Cross, and the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2002, along with Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said, he was given Spain&#x27;s Prince of Asturias Concord Award. Barenboim is multilingual, fluent in English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish.

==Biography==

Daniel Barenboim was born on 15 November 1942 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Jewish parents Aida (née Schuster) and Enrique Barenboim, both professional pianists. He started piano lessons at the age of five with his mother, continuing to study with his father, who remained his only teacher. On 19 August 1950, at the age of seven, he gave his first formal concert, in Buenos Aires.

In 1952, Barenboim&#x27;s family moved to Israel. Two years later, in the summer of 1954, his parents took him to Salzburg to take part in Igor Markevitch&#x27;s conducting classes. During that summer he also met and played for Wilhelm Furtwängler, who has remained a central musical influence and ideal for Barenboim. Furtwängler called the young Barenboim a &quot;phenomenon&quot; and invited him to perform the Beethoven First Piano Concerto with the Berlin Philharmonic, but Barenboim&#x27;s father considered it too soon after the Second World War for a Jewish boy to go to Germany. In 1955, Barenboim studied harmony and composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.

On 15 June 1967, Barenboim and British cellist Jacqueline du Pré were married in Jerusalem at a Western Wall ceremony, du Pré having converted to Judaism. Acting as one of the witnesses was the conductor Zubin Mehta, a long-time friend of Barenboim. Since &quot;I was not Jewish I had to temporarily be renamed Moshe Cohen, which made me a &#x27;kosher witness, Mehta recalled. Du Pré retired from music in 1973, after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). The marriage lasted until du Pré&#x27;s death in 1987.

In the early 1980s, Barenboim and Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova started a relationship. Together they had two sons, both born in Paris before du Pré&#x27;s death: David Arthur, born 1983, and Michael, born 1985. Barenboim worked to keep his relationship with Bashkirova hidden from du Pré, and believed he had succeeded. He and Bashkirova married in 1988. Both sons are part of the music world: David is a manager-writer for the German hip-hop band Level 8, and is a classical violinist.

===Citizenship===
Barenboim holds citizenship in Argentina, Israel, Palestine, and Spain, and was the first person to hold Palestinian and Israeli citizenship simultaneously. He lives in Berlin.

==Career==
After performing in Buenos Aires, Barenboim made his international debut as a pianist at the age of 10 in 1952 in Vienna and Rome. In 1955, he performed in Paris, in 1956, in London, and in 1957 in New York under the baton of Leopold Stokowski. Regular concert tours of Europe, the United States, South America, Australia and the Far East followed thereafter.

In June 1967, Barenboim and his then-fiancée Jacqueline du Pré gave concerts in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa and Beersheba before and during the Six-Day War. His friendship with musicians Itzhak Perlman, Zubin Mehta, and Pinchas Zukerman, and marriage to du Pré led to the 1969 film by Christopher Nupen of their performance of the Schubert &quot;Trout&quot; Quintet.

Following his debut as a conductor with the English Chamber Orchestra in Abbey Road Studios, London, in 1966, Barenboim was invited to conduct by many European and American symphony orchestras. Between 1975 and 1989, he was music director of the Orchestre de Paris, where he conducted much contemporary music.

Barenboim made his opera conducting debut in 1973 with a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival. He made his debut at Bayreuth in 1981, conducting there regularly until 1999. In 1988, he was appointed artistic and musical director of the Opéra Bastille in Paris, scheduled to open in 1990, but was fired in January 1989 by the opera&#x27;s chairman Pierre Bergé. Barenboim was named music director designate of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1989 and succeeded Sir Georg Solti as its music director in 1991, a post he held until 17 June 2006. He expressed frustration with the need for fund-raising duties in the United States as part of being a music director of an American orchestra.
In 1992, Barenboim became music director of the Berlin State Opera and the Staatskapelle Berlin, succeeding in maintaining the independent status of the State Opera. He has tried to maintain the orchestra&#x27;s traditional sound and style. In autumn 2000 he was made conductor for life of the Staatskapelle Berlin.

On 15 May 2006, Barenboim was named principal guest conductor of La Scala opera house, in Milan, after Riccardo Muti&#x27;s resignation. He subsequently became music director of La Scala in 2011.

In 2006, Barenboim presented the BBC Reith Lectures, presenting a series of five lectures titled &quot;In the Beginning was Sound&quot;. The lectures on music were recorded in a range of cities, including London, Chicago, Berlin, and two in Jerusalem. In the autumn of 2006, Barenboim gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University, entitling his talk &quot;Sound and Thought&quot;.

In November 2006, Lorin Maazel submitted Barenboim&#x27;s name as his nominee to succeed him as the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s music director. Barenboim said he was flattered but &quot;nothing could be further from my thoughts at the moment than the possibility of returning to the United States for a permanent position&quot;, repeating in April 2007 his lack of interest in the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s music directorship or its newly created principal conductor position. Barenboim made his conducting debut on 28 November 2008 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York for the House&#x27;s 450th performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

In 2009, Barenboim conducted the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic for the first time. In his New Year message, he expressed the hope that 2009 would be a year for peace and for human justice in the Middle East. He returned to conduct the 2014 Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert, and also conducted the 2022 Concert.

In 2014, construction began on the Barenboim–Said Academy in Berlin. A joint project Barenboim developed with Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said, the academy was planned as a site for young music students from the Arab world and Israel to study music and humanities in Berlin. It opened its doors on 8 December 2016. In 2017, the Pierre Boulez Saal opened as the public face of the academy. The elliptical shaped concert hall was designed by Frank Gehry. Acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota created the hall&#x27;s sound profile.

In 2015, Barenboim unveiled a new concert grand piano. Designed by Chris Maene with support from Steinway &amp; Sons, the piano features straight parallel strings instead of the conventional diagonally-crossed strings of a modern Steinway.

In 2018, Barenboim was the subject of the French animated series &quot;Max &amp; Maestro&quot;.

In 2020, Barenboim curated the digital festival of new music &quot;Distance / Intimacy&quot; with flautist Emmanuel Pahud in the Pierre Boulez Saal. At their invitation ten contemporary composers, among them Jörg Widmann, Olga Neuwirth and Matthias Pintscher, contributed new works engaging artistically with the COVID-19 pandemic. All participating composers and musicians waived their fees, inviting listeners to financially support arts and culture.

In October 2022, Barenboim announced on social media that he would be reducing his conducting and other engagements for health reasons. On 6 January 2023, the &quot;Staatsoper Unter den Linden&quot; announced Barenboim&#x27;s resignation as its &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot;, effective 31 January 2023, because of health reasons.

On 6 February 2025, Daniel Barenboim announced in his official Instagram page that he has Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Musical style==
Barenboim has rejected some current musicological research, such as the authentic performance movement. His recording of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies shows his preference for some conventional twentieth-century practices, rather than fully adhering to Bärenreiter&#x27;s new edition (edited by Jonathan Del Mar).
Barenboim has opposed the practice of choosing the tempo of a piece based on historical evidence, such as the composer&#x27;s metronome marks. He argues instead for finding the tempo from within the music, especially from its harmony and harmonic rhythm. He has reflected this in the general tempi chosen in his recording of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies, usually adhering to early-twentieth-century practices. He has not been influenced by the faster tempos chosen by other conductors such as David Zinman and authentic movement advocate Roger Norrington.

In his recording of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, Barenboim makes frequent use of the right-foot sustaining pedal, a device absent from the keyboard instruments of Bach&#x27;s time (although the harpsichord was highly resonant), producing a sonority very different from the &quot;dry&quot; and often staccato sound favoured by Glenn Gould. Moreover, in the fugues, he often plays one voice considerably louder than the others, a practice impossible on a harpsichord. According to some scholarship, this practice began in Beethoven&#x27;s time (see, for example, Matthew Dirst&#x27;s book &quot;Engaging Bach&quot;). When justifying his interpretation of Bach, Barenboim claims that he is interested in the long tradition of playing Bach that has existed for two and a half centuries, rather than in the exact style of performance in Bach&#x27;s time:

The study of old instruments and historic performance practice has taught us a great deal, but the main point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved by the fact that tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach&#x27;s gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! ... I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of &quot;progressive&quot; efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time ...

===Recordings===

In the beginning of his career, Barenboim concentrated on music of the classical era, as well as some romantic composers. He made his first recording in 1954. Notable classical recordings include the complete cycles of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert&#x27;s piano sonatas, Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos (with the New Philharmonia Orchestra and Otto Klemperer), and Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos (conducting the English Chamber Orchestra from the piano). Romantic recordings include Brahms&#x27;s piano concertos (with John Barbirolli), Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;, and Chopin&#x27;s Nocturnes.

Barenboim also recorded many chamber works, especially in collaboration with his first wife, Jacqueline du Pré, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, and the violinist and violist Pinchas Zukerman. Noted performances include: the complete Mozart violin sonatas (with Perlman), Brahms&#x27;s violin sonatas (live concert with Perlman, previously in the studio with Zukerman), Beethoven&#x27;s and Brahms&#x27;s cello sonatas (with du Pré), Beethoven&#x27;s and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s piano trios (with du Pré and Zukerman), and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; (with du Pré, Perlman, Zukerman, and Zubin Mehta).

Notable recordings as a conductor include the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Schubert, and Schumann; the Da Ponte operas of Mozart; numerous operas by Wagner, including the complete Ring Cycle; and various concertos. Barenboim has written about his changing attitude to the music of Mahler; he has recorded Mahler&#x27;s Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth symphonies and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. He has also performed and recorded the &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; by Rodrigo and Villa-Lobos guitar concerto with John Williams as the guitar soloist.

By the late 1990s, Barenboim had widened his concert repertoire, performing works by baroque as well as twentieth-century classical composers. Examples include: J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; (which he has played since childhood) and &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, Albeniz&#x27;s &quot;Iberia&quot;, and Debussy&#x27;s Préludes. In addition, he turned to other musical genres, such as jazz, and the folk music of his birthplace, Argentina. He conducted the 2006 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Buenos Aires, in which tangos were played.

Barenboim has continued to perform and record chamber music, sometimes with members of the orchestras he has led. Some examples include the &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot; by Messiaen with members of the Orchestre de Paris during his tenure there, Richard Strauss with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Trio with members of the Berlin Staatskapelle.

To mark Barenboim&#x27;s 75th birthday, Deutsche Grammophon released a box set of 39 CDs of his solo recordings, and Sony Classical issued a box set of Barenboim&#x27;s orchestral recordings on 43 CDs and three DVDs in 2017, &quot;Daniel Barenboim – A Retrospective&quot;.

===Conducting Wagner in Israel===

The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (then Palestine Orchestra) had performed Richard Wagner&#x27;s music in Mandatory Palestine even during the early days of the Nazi era. But after the Kristallnacht, Jewish musicians avoided playing Wagner&#x27;s music in Israel because of the use Nazi Germany made of the composer and because of Wagner&#x27;s own anti-Semitic writings, initiating an unofficial boycott.

This informal ban continued when Israel was founded in 1948, but from time to time unsuccessful efforts were made to end it. In 1974 and again in 1981 Zubin Mehta planned to (but did not) lead the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in works of Wagner. During the latter occasion, fist fights broke out in the audience.

Barenboim, who had been selected to head the production of Wagner&#x27;s operas at the 1988 Bayreuth Festival, had since at least 1989 publicly opposed the Israeli ban. In that year, he had the Israel Philharmonic &quot;rehearse&quot; two of Wagner&#x27;s works. In a conversation with Edward Said, Barenboim said that &quot;Wagner, the person, is absolutely appalling, despicable, and, in a way, very difficult to put together with the music he wrote, which so often has exactly the opposite kind of feelings ... noble, generous, etc.&quot; He called Wagner&#x27;s anti-Semitism obviously &quot;monstrous&quot;, and feels it must be faced, but argues that &quot;Wagner did not cause the Holocaust.&quot;

In 1990, Barenboim conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in its first appearance in Israel, but he excluded Wagner&#x27;s works. &quot;Although Wagner died in 1883, he is not played [in Israel] because his music is too inextricably linked with Nazism, and so is too painful for those who suffered&quot;, Barenboim told a reporter. &quot;Why play what hurts people?&quot; Not long afterwards, it was announced that Barenboim would lead the Israel Philharmonic in two Wagner overtures, which took place on 27 December &quot;before a carefully screened audience&quot;.

In 2000, the Israel Supreme Court upheld the right of the Rishon LeZion Orchestra to perform Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;. At the Israel Festival in Jerusalem in July 2001, Barenboim had scheduled to perform the first act of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; with three singers, including tenor Plácido Domingo. However, strong protests by some Holocaust survivors, as well as the Israeli government, led the festival authorities to ask for an alternative program. (The Israel Festival&#x27;s Public Advisory board, which included some Holocaust survivors, had originally approved the program.) The controversy appeared to end in May, after the Israel Festival announced that a selection by Wagner would not be included at the 7 July concert. Barenboim agreed to substitute music by Schumann and Stravinsky.

However, at the end of the concert with the Berlin Staatskapelle, Barenboim announced that he would like to play Wagner as a second encore and invited those who objected to leave, saying, &quot;Despite what the Israel Festival believes, there are people sitting in the audience for whom Wagner does not spark Nazi associations. I respect those for whom these associations are oppressive. It will be democratic to play a Wagner encore for those who wish to hear it. I am turning to you now and asking whether I can play Wagner.&quot; A half-hour debate ensued, with some audience members calling Barenboim a &quot;fascist&quot;. In the end, a small number of attendees walked out and the overwhelming majority remained, applauding loudly after the performance of the &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; Prelude.

In September 2001, a public relations associate for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where Barenboim was the music director, revealed that season ticket-holders were about evenly divided about the wisdom of Barenboim&#x27;s decision to play Wagner in Jerusalem.

Barenboim regarded the performance of Wagner at the 7 July concert as a political statement. He said he had decided to defy the ban on Wagner after having a news conference he held the previous week interrupted by the ringing of a mobile phone to the tune of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;. &quot;I thought if it can be heard on the ring of a telephone, why can&#x27;t it be played in a concert hall?&quot; he said.

A Knesset committee subsequently called for Barenboim to be declared a persona non-grata in Israel until he apologized for conducting Wagner&#x27;s music. The move was condemned by the musical director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra Zubin Mehta and members of Knesset. Prior to receiving the $100,000 Wolf Prize, awarded annually in Israel, Barenboim said, &quot;If people were really hurt, of course I regret this, because I don&#x27;t want to harm anyone&quot;.

In 2005, Barenboim gave the inaugural Edward Said Memorial Lecture at Columbia University, entitled &quot;Wagner, Israel and Palestine&quot;. In the speech, according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Barenboim &quot;called on Israel to accept the Palestinian &#x27;narrative even though they may not agree with it&#x27;&quot;, and said, &quot;The state of Israel was supposed to provide the instrument for the end of anti-Semitism ... This inability to accept a new narrative has led to a new anti-Semitism that is very different from the European anti-Semitism of the 19th century.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Barenboim said it was the &quot;fear, this conviction of being yet again the victim, that does not allow the Israeli public to accept Wagner&#x27;s anti-Semitism ... It is the same cell in the collective brain that does not allow them to make progress in their understanding of the needs of the Palestinian people&quot;, and also said that suicide bombings in Israel &quot;had to be seen in the context of the historical development at which we have arrived&quot;. The speech caused controversy; the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that Barenboim had &quot;compared Herzl&#x27;s ideas to Wagner&#x27;s; criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks but also justified them; and said Israeli actions contributed to the rise of international anti-Semitism&quot;.

In March 2007, Barenboim said: &quot;The whole subject of Wagner in Israel has been politicized and is a symptom of a malaise that goes very deep in Israeli society...&quot;

In 2010, before conducting Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; for the gala premiere of La Scala&#x27;s season in Milan, he said that the perception of Wagner was unjustly influenced by the fact that he was Hitler&#x27;s favourite composer: &quot;I think a bit of the problem with Wagner isn&#x27;t what we all know in Israel, anti-Semitism, etc ... It is how the Nazis and Hitler saw Wagner as his own prophet ... This perception of Hitler colors for many people the perception of Wagner ... We need one day to liberate Wagner of all this weight&quot;.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Barenboim said, &quot;It saddens me that official Israel so doggedly refuses to allow Wagner to be performed – as was the case, once again, at the University of Tel Aviv two weeks ago – because I see it as a symptom of a disease. The words I&#x27;m about to use are harsh, but I choose them deliberately: There is a politicization of the remembrance of the Holocaust in Israel, and that&#x27;s terrible.&quot; He also argued that after the trial of Adolf Eichmann and the Six-Day War, &quot;a misunderstanding also arose ... namely that the Holocaust, from which the Jews&#x27; ultimate claim to Israel was derived, and the Palestinian problem had something to do with each other.&quot;

He also said, that:

...since the Six-Day War, Israeli politicians have repeatedly established a connection between European anti-Semitism and the fact that the Palestinians don&#x27;t accept the founding of the State of Israel. But that&#x27;s absurd! The Palestinians weren&#x27;t primarily anti-Semitic. They just didn&#x27;t accept their expulsion. But European anti-Semitism goes much further back than to the partition of Palestine and the establishment of Israel in 1948.

In response to a question from the interviewer, he said he conducted Wagner with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra because, &quot;The musicians wanted it. I said: Sure, but we have to talk about it. It&#x27;s a tricky decision.&quot; When the interviewer asked if the initiative came from Arab musicians in the orchestra, he replied, &quot;On the contrary. It was the Israelis. The Israeli brass players.&quot;

Over the years, observers of the Wagner battle have weighed in on both sides of the issue.

==Political views==

Barenboim is an outspoken critic of Israel&#x27;s conservative governments and the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In an interview with the British music critic Norman Lebrecht in 2003, Barenboim accused Israel of behaving in a manner that was &quot;morally abhorrent and strategically wrong&quot; and &quot;putting in danger the very existence of the state of Israel&quot;. In 1967, at the start of the Six-Day War, Barenboim and du Pré had performed for the Israeli troops on the front lines, as well as during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. During the Gulf War, he and an orchestra performed in Israel in gas masks.

Barenboim has argued publicly for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. In a November 2014 opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he wrote that the &quot;ongoing security of the state of Israel ... is only possible in the long term if the future of the Palestinian people, too, is secured in its own sovereign state. If this does not happen, the wars and history of that region will be constantly repeated and the unbearable stalemate will continue.&quot;

===West–Eastern Divan===
In 1999, Barenboim and Palestinian-American intellectual Edward Said jointly founded the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra. This initiative brings together, every summer, a group of young classical musicians from Israel, Palestine and Arab countries to study, perform and to promote mutual reflection and understanding. Barenboim and Said jointly received the 2002 Prince of Asturias Awards for their work in &quot;improving understanding between nations&quot;. Together they wrote the book &quot;Parallels and Paradoxes&quot;, based on a series of public discussions held at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

In September 2005, presenting the book written with Said, Barenboim refused to be interviewed by uniformed Israel Defense Forces Radio reporter Dafna Arad, considering the wearing of the uniform insensitive for the occasion. In response, Israeli Education Minister Limor Livnat of the Likud party called him &quot;a real Jew hater&quot; and &quot;a real anti-Semite&quot;.

After being invited for the fourth time to the Doha Festival for Music and Dialogue in Qatar with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra in 2012, Barenboim&#x27;s invitation was cancelled by the authorities because of &quot;sensitivity to the developments in the Arab world&quot;. There had been a campaign against him in the Arab media, accusing him of &quot;being a Zionist&quot;.

In July 2012, Barenboim and the orchestra played a pivotal role at the BBC Proms, performing a cycle of Beethoven&#x27;s nine symphonies, with the Ninth timed to coincide with the opening of the London 2012 Olympic Games. In addition, he was an Olympic flag carrier at the opening ceremony of the Games.

===Wolf Prize===
In May 2004, Barenboim was awarded the Wolf Prize at a ceremony at the Israeli Knesset. Education Minister Livnat held up the nomination until Barenboim apologized for his performance of Wagner in Israel. Barenboim called Livnat&#x27;s demand &quot;politically motivated&quot;, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t see what I need to apologize about. If I ever hurt a person privately or in public, I am sorry, because I have no intention of hurting people...&quot;, which was good enough for Livnat. The ceremony was boycotted by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, also a member of the Likud party. In his acceptance speech, Barenboim expressed his opinion on the political situation, referring to the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948:

I am asking today with deep sorrow: Can we, despite all our achievements, ignore the intolerable gap between what the Declaration of Independence promised and what was fulfilled, the gap between the idea and the realities of Israel? Does the condition of occupation and domination over another people fit the Declaration of Independence? Is there any sense in the independence of one at the expense of the fundamental rights of the other? Can the Jewish people whose history is a record of continued suffering and relentless persecution, allow themselves to be indifferent to the rights and suffering of a neighboring people? Can the State of Israel allow itself an unrealistic dream of an ideological end to the conflict instead of pursuing a pragmatic, humanitarian one based on social justice?

Israel&#x27;s President Moshe Katsav, originally also of Likud, and Education Minister Livnat criticized Barenboim for his speech. Livnat accused him of attacking the State of Israel, to which Barenboim replied that he had not done so, but that he instead had cited the text of the Israeli Declaration of Independence.

===Performing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip===
Barenboim has performed several times in the West Bank: at Bir Zeit University in 1999 and several times in Ramallah.

In December 2007, Barenboim and 20 musicians from Britain, the United States, France and Germany, and one Palestinian were scheduled to play a baroque music concert in Gaza. Although they had received authorization from Israeli authorities, the Palestinian was stopped at the Israel–Gaza border and told that he needed individual permission to enter. The group waited seven hours at the border, and then canceled the concert in solidarity. Barenboim commented: &quot;A baroque music concert in a Roman Catholic church in Gaza – as we all know – has nothing to do with security and would bring so much joy to people who live there in great difficulty.&quot;

In January 2008, after performing in Ramallah, Barenboim accepted honorary Palestinian citizenship, becoming the first Jewish Israeli citizen to be offered the status. Barenboim said he hoped it would serve as a public gesture of peace. Some Israelis criticized Barenboim&#x27;s decision to accept Palestinian citizenship. The parliamentary faction chairman of the Shas party demanded that Barenboim be stripped of his Israeli citizenship, but the Interior Minister told the media that &quot;the matter is not even up for discussion&quot;.

In January 2009, Barenboim cancelled two concerts of the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra in Qatar and Cairo &quot;due to the escalating violence in Gaza and the resulting concerns for the musicians&#x27; safety&quot;.

In May 2011, Barenboim conducted the &quot;Orchestra for Gaza&quot; composed of volunteers from the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Orchestre de Paris, at al-Mathaf Cultural House. The concert, held in Gaza City, was co-ordinated in secret with the United Nations. The orchestra flew from Berlin to Vienna and from there to El Arish on a plane chartered by Barenboim, entering the Gaza Strip at the Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing. The musicians were escorted by a convoy of United Nations vehicles. The concert, the first performance by an international classical ensemble in the Strip, was attended by an invited audience of several hundred schoolchildren and NGO workers, who greeted Barenboim with applause. The orchestra played Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; and Symphony No. 40, also familiar to an Arab audience as the basis of one of the songs of the famous Arab singer Fairuz. In his speech, Barenboim said: &quot;Everyone has to understand that the Palestinian cause is a just cause therefore it can be only given justice if it is achieved without violence. Violence can only weaken the righteousness of the Palestinian cause&quot;.

The minor planet 7163 Barenboim, discovered in 1984, is named after him.

==Straight-strung piano==
In 2017, Barenboim unveiled a piano that has straight-strung bass strings, as opposed to the crossed-stringed modern instrument. He was inspired by Liszt&#x27;s Érard piano, which has straight strings. Barenboim appreciates the clarity of tone and a greater control over the tonal quality (or color) his new instrument gives. This piano was developed with the help of Chris Maene at Maene Piano, who also built it. In 2019, Barenboim used this instrument to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

<doc id="207776" wikidata="Q7729397" url="?curid=207776" title="The Dearborn Independent">
<text>The Dearborn Independent, also known as The Ford International Weekly, was a weekly newspaper established in 1901, and published by Henry Ford from 1919 through 1927. At its height during the mid-1920s it claimed a circulation of between 700,000 and 900,000. If true, this would make it second only to The New York Times in terms of national readership. Those numbers were largely due to a quota system for promotion imposed on Ford dealers. Lawsuits regarding antisemitic material published in the paper caused Ford to close it, and the last issue was published in December 1927. The publication&#x27;s title was derived from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan.

==Acquisition by Ford==

In 1918, Ford&#x27;s closest aide and private secretary, Ernest G. Liebold, purchased the &quot;Independent&quot; from Marcus Woodruff, who had been running it at a loss. The initial staff of the newspaper included E. G. Pipp, previously managing editor of the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, writers William J. Cameron (also formerly of the &quot;News&quot;) and Marcus Woodruff, and Fred Black as business manager.

The paper was printed on a used press purchased by Ford and installed in Ford&#x27;s tractor plant in The Rouge. Publication under Ford was inaugurated in January 1919. The paper initially attracted notoriety in June 1919 with coverage of the libel lawsuit between Henry Ford and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, when stories written by Pipp and Cameron were picked up nationally.

==Ford&#x27;s motivations==

Henry Ford, a self-proclaimed pacifist who opposed World War I, believed that Jews were responsible for starting wars in order to profit from them: &quot;International financiers are behind all war. They are what is called the international Jew: German Jews, French Jews, English Jews, American Jews. I believe that in all those countries except our own the Jewish financier is supreme ... here the Jew is a threat&quot;.

Ford felt that Jews, in their role as financiers, contributed nothing of value to society. He believed that Jewish businesses focused solely on price, and cheapened their products. Ford once bit into a candy bar and, finding it not as good as it once had been, said &quot;The Jews have taken hold of it. They&#x27;ve cheapened it to make more money&quot;.

In 1915, Ford blamed Jews for instigating World War I, saying &quot;I know who caused the war: German-Jewish bankers.&quot; In 1925, Ford said &quot;What I oppose most is the international Jewish money power that is met in every war. That is what I oppose – a power that has no country and that can order the young men of all countries out to death.&quot;

Ford ensured that everyone who worked for any of his companies accepted his views, and made sure not to hire a single Jew in office jobs, although he hired them for physical labor.

So began the articles with themes of a worldwide conspiracy by Jewish super-capitalists, that the Jews invented the stock market and gold standard just to corrupt the world and other peoples.

==Antisemitic articles==
Pipp left the &quot;Independent&quot; in April 1920 in disgust with the planned antisemitic articles, which began in May. He later claimed that a major influence on the paper&#x27;s antisemitism came from Boris Brasol, a White Russian émigré lawyer, writer, and conspiracy theorist. Ford did not write the articles. He expressed his opinions verbally to his executive secretary, Ernest Liebold, and to William J. Cameron, who replaced Pipp as editor. Cameron had the main responsibility for expanding these opinions into article form. Liebold was responsible for collecting more material to support the articles.

One of the articles, &quot;Jewish Power and America&#x27;s Money Famine&quot;, asserted that the power exercised by Jews over the nation&#x27;s supply of money was insidious, depriving farmers and others outside the banking coterie of money when they needed it most. The article asked the question: &quot;Where is the American gold supply? ... It may be in the United States but it does not belong to the United States.&quot; It concluded that Jews controlled the gold supply and, hence, American money.

Another article, &quot;Jewish Idea Molded Federal Reserve System&quot;, was a reflection of Ford&#x27;s distrust of the Federal Reserve System and its proponent, Paul Warburg. Ford believed the Federal Reserve system was secretive and insidious.

These articles gave rise to claims of antisemitism against Ford, and in 1929 he signed a statement apologizing for the articles.

While Henry Ford owned &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;, none of its content was directly written by him, including the &quot;International Jew&quot; series. However, the views expressed in the &quot;International Jew&quot; reflected Ford&#x27;s own antisemitic views, especially because nothing was published without Ford&#x27;s final approval. This series of antisemitic articles in the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; was published for a total of 91 weeks. The articles pinned cultural developments such as jazz, immoral books, flashy jewelry, and alcohol consumption on the Jews and Jewish influence. Partially attributable to his antisemitic beliefs, Hitler was a fan of Ford, and Hitler had a full-length portrait of Henry Ford at the headquarters of the National Social Party.

== &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; ==
Many issues of the &quot;Independent&quot; commented extensively upon &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. The first mention of the &quot;Protocols&quot; appears in the issue of July 10, 1920, the seventh installment of its &quot;International Jew&quot; series. Also, in 1920–21 the &quot;Independent&quot; carried a series of articles expanding on the themes of financial control by Jews, entitled:

# &quot;Jewish Idea in American Monetary Affairs: The remarkable story of Paul Warburg, who began work on the United States monetary system after three weeks residence in this country&quot;
# &quot;Jewish Idea Molded Federal Reserve System: What Baruch was in War Material, Paul Warburg was in War Finances; Some Curious revelations of money and politics.&quot;
# &quot;Jewish Idea of a Central Bank for America: The evolution of Paul M. Warburg&#x27;s idea of Federal Reserve System without government management.&quot;
# &quot;How Jewish International Finance Functions: The Warburg family and firm divided the world between them and did amazing things which non-Jews could not do&quot;
# &quot;Jewish Power and America&#x27;s Money Famine: The Warburg Federal Reserve sucks money to New York, leaving productive sections of the country in disastrous need.&quot;
# &quot;The Economic Plan of International Jews: An outline of the Protocolists&#x27; monetary policy, with notes on the parallel found in Jewish financial practice.&quot;

The newspaper published &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which was discredited by &quot;The Times&quot; of London as a forgery during the &quot;Independent&quot;″s publishing run. The American Jewish Historical Society described the ideas presented in the magazine as &quot;anti-immigrant, anti-labor, anti-liquor, and antisemitic&quot;. In February 1921, the &quot;New York World&quot; published an interview with Ford in which he said: &quot;The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on.&quot; During this period, Ford emerged as &quot;a respected spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice&quot;, reaching around 700,000 readers through his newspaper.

== Republication in Germany ==
During the Weimar Republic in the early 1920s, the &quot;Protocols&quot; was reprinted and published in Germany, along with anti-Jewish articles first published by &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot; and reprinted in translation in Germany as a set of four bound volumes, cumulatively titled &quot;The International Jew, the World&#x27;s Foremost Problem&quot;.

Steven Watts wrote that Adolf Hitler &quot;revered&quot; Ford. He quotes Hitler as saying, &quot;I shall do my best to put his theories into practice in Germany&quot;, and says that Hitler modeled the Volkswagen, the people&#x27;s car, on the Model T. Several themes from the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; articles appear in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Hitler even quoted the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and Henry Ford was the only American that Hitler specifically named: &quot;Every year they [the Jews] manage to become increasingly the controlling masters of the labor power of a people of 120,000,000 souls; one great man, Ford, to their exasperation still holds out independently there even now.&quot;

On February 1, 1924, Ford received Kurt Lüdecke, a representative of Hitler, at his home. Lüdecke was introduced to Ford by Siegfried Wagner (son of the famous composer Richard Wagner) and his wife Winifred, both Nazi sympathizers and antisemites. Lüdecke asked Ford for a contribution to the Nazi cause, though this is denied by the Ford Motor Company.

In July 1938, prior to the outbreak of war, the German consul at Cleveland gave Ford, on his 75th birthday, the award of the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner. James D. Mooney, vice-president of overseas operations for General Motors, received a similar medal, the Merit Cross of the German Eagle, First Class.

== Reaction to the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; ==
There was much negative press about the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; within Jewish communities, but there was non-Jewish negative press as well.

=== Jewish reaction ===
There are many accounts of Jewish organizations coming together to fight the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot;. The first major antisemitic article about Jews was published on June 19, 1920. There were major repetitions on August 28, then again in February, March, and November 1921. The essay &quot;Anti-Semitism- Will it Appear in the U.S.?&quot; quoted Louis Brandeis, a Justice of the Supreme Court, who advocated for Jewish civil rights and said, &quot;Organize, organize, organize, until every Jew must stand up and be counted.&quot; Louis Marshall noticed that &quot;The Cause of World Unrest&quot; was advertised on the back of one issue of the &quot;Independent&quot;, so he wrote a personal letter to the publisher, Major George Haven Putnam, condemning him for his intolerance. Marshall said that Putnam was using Jews as his scapegoat. Eventually Putnam apologized for his advertisement and for publishing the book.

=== Non-Jewish reaction ===
The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America published a resolution condemning Ford&#x27;s propaganda and beliefs. In January 1921, a statement titled &quot;The Peril of Racial Prejudice&quot; denounced antisemitism as un-American and condemned the &quot;Independent&quot; for its antisemitic campaign. It was signed by more than one hundred prominent citizens of &quot;Gentile birth and Christian faith&quot;, including President Woodrow Wilson, former president William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryan, Clarence Darrow, Nicholas Murray Butler, Robert Frost, Samuel Seabury, Ida Tarbell, Paul Cravath and the presidents of Williams, Oberlin, and Dartmouth colleges as well as Princeton, Cornell, and Syracuse universities. However, this did not stop the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; from their negative press regarding Jews.

== Libel lawsuit ==
While they explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against Jews, Ford&#x27;s articles blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence. San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer Aaron Sapiro filed a libel lawsuit in response. During the trial, the editor of Ford&#x27;s &quot;Own Page&quot;, William Cameron, testified that Ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified that he never discussed the content of the pages with Ford, or sent them to Ford for his approval. Friends and business associates said they warned Ford about the contents of the &quot;Independent&quot; and that Ford probably never read the articles (he claimed he only read the headlines).

Further court testimony alleged that Ford knew about the contents of the &quot;Independent&quot; in advance of publication. Investigative journalist Max Wallace noted that &quot;whatever credibility this absurd claim [Cameron&#x27;s denial] may have had was soon undermined when James M. Miller, a former &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; employee, swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro.&quot;

Michael Barkun observed:

== Action by the Anti-Defamation League ==
The trial prompted the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to begin a concerted effort to oppose the &quot;Independent&quot;. An ADL-led coalition of Jewish groups led the charge, and raised objections to Ford&#x27;s writings in the Detroit press. The ADL also organized a boycott of Ford products, which was supported not only by Jews, but also by several liberal Christian groups. In December 1927, Ford gave in and abolished the paper. News reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the paper&#x27;s content and unaware of its nature. Ford also wrote a public letter to ADL president Sigmund Livingston recanting his antisemitic views.

Ford&#x27;s 1927 apology was generally well-received: &quot;Four-Fifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 were from Jews, and almost without exception they praised the Industrialist.&quot; While most of the major national Jewish and non-Jewish newspapers accepted Ford&#x27;s apology, many local Jewish papers rejected it. In January 1937, a Ford statement to &quot;The Detroit Jewish Chronicle&quot; disavowed &quot;any connection whatsoever with the publication in Germany of a book known as &quot;The International Jew&quot;.&quot;

According to Pool and Pool (1978), Ford&#x27;s retraction and apology (which were written by others) were not signed by him (rather, his signature was forged by Harry Bennett), and Ford never privately recanted his antisemitic views, stating in 1940: &quot;I hope to republish &quot;The International Jew&quot; again some time.&quot;

<text>The Ghent–Terneuzen Canal (Dutch: Kanaal van Gent naar Terneuzen), also known as the &quot;Sea Canal&quot; (Zeekanaal) is a canal linking Ghent in Belgium to the port of Terneuzen on the Westerschelde (Scheldt) Estuary in the Netherlands, thereby providing the former with better access to the sea.


==History==
The canal was constructed between 1823 and 1827 on the initiative of the Dutch King: Belgium (as it subsequently became) and the Netherlands had become a united country under the terms agreed at the Congress of Vienna. After Belgium broke away in 1830, traffic to and from Belgium was blocked by the Dutch until 1841.

Between 1870 and 1885, the canal was enlarged to a depth of six and a half metres at its centre, and to a width of 17 metres at its base and 68 metres at the surface level: bridges being rebuilt accordingly along the Belgian sector.

The famous Cluysen - Ter Donck Regatta was organised here for many decades (1888-1954)
and during the 1913 Expo of Ghent the European Rowing Championships took place on the canal.

Further development and major enlargement took place during the subsequent century, most notably during the early 1960s.

In February 2015, Flanders and the Netherlands signed a treaty for the construction of a new lock at Terneuzen, scheduled for completion in 2021 and costing €920M. The new lock is about the same size as those of the contemporaneous expansion project of the Panama Canal.

==Today==

Today the Ghent-Terneuzen canal is 200 metres wide and long, capable of accommodating ships of up to 125 000 gross tonnage. The largest permitted vessel size has increased, correspondingly, to 265 metres long x 34 metres wide, with a draught of up to 12.5 metres.

<text>Albionbaatar is an extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous Lulworth Formation of England. It was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata and shared the world with the much larger dinosaurs. It is in the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;, family Albionbaataridae. The genus &quot;Albionbaatar&quot; was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Ensom P.C. in 1994 based on a single species.

&quot;Albion&quot; refers to England, while, &quot;baatar&quot; is Mongolian, meaning &quot;hero&quot;. This is due to a recent nomenclatural tradition among specialists who study this group. Many multituberculates are called &quot;something&quot;-baatar, regardless of where they come from. This is in part because the best preserved remains of multis tend to come from the Upper Cretaceous of the Gobi desert.

The primary species, &quot;Albionbaatar denisae&quot;, also named by Kielan-Jaworowska and Ensom, was found in Berriasian (Lower Cretaceous) strata of Durlston Bay, in Dorset. It is a miniature multituberculate from the Isle of Purbeck.

<text>Veronica was a search engine system for the Gopher protocol, released in November 1992 by Steven Foster and Fred Barrie at the University of Nevada, Reno.

During its existence, Veronica was a constantly updated database of the names of almost every menu item on thousands of Gopher servers. The Veronica database could be searched from most major Gopher menus. Although by 1999 the original Veronica database was no longer accessible, various local Veronica installations and at least one complete rewrite (&quot;Veronica-2&quot;) still exist.

The existence of Veronica induced another Gopher search tool from the University of Utah originally called Jughead. While the two were separate search tools, a Jughead instance could be configured with a veronica control file in order to let the Veronica harvester know how to obtain the data file from Jughead.

==Naming==
The search engine was named after the character Veronica Lodge from Archie Comics, an intentional analogy with the naming of the Archie search engine, a search engine for FTP servers. A backronym for Veronica is &quot;Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computer Archives&quot;.

<text>Proalbionbaatar is a small mammal from the Upper Jurassic of Guimarota, Portugal. It&#x27;s the most derived member of the order Multituberculata known from that locality, and shared the world with the much larger dinosaurs. It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Albionbaataridae.

The genus &quot;Proalbionbaatar&quot; was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1998, based on a single species. The name refers to it being both earlier and more basal than &quot;Albionbaatar&quot;, a broadly similar form known from the Lower Cretaceous of Dorset, England.

The species &quot;Proalbionbaatar plagiocyrtus&quot; was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1998. Fossil remains are known from the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal. Remains are presently restricted to two isolated upper molars, which are smaller than the corresponding teeth of paulchoffatiids (Paulchoffatiidae is the best represented multi group from Guimarota). These teeth also have more cusps, which are arranged in two rows. (Hahn &amp; Hahn 2000, p. 106).

<text>Frederick Charles Jones (12 September 1927 – 9 July 2019) was an English actor who had an extensive career in television, theatre and cinema productions for almost sixty years. In theatre, he was best known for originating the role of Sir in &quot;The Dresser&quot;; in film, he was best known for his role as the showman Bytes in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980); and in television, he was best known for playing Sandy Thomas in the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; from 2005 to 2018.

==Early life==
Jones was born on 12 September 1927 in Dresden, a suburb of the town of Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Ida Elizabeth (née Goodwin) and Charles Edward Jones. Charles was a porcelain thrower, Ida a clerk and pub pianist. He worked briefly at Creda, the consumer electrical goods vendors, in Longton before he joined the British Ceramic Research Association in Penkhull, where he worked for ten years. His girlfriend at the time suggested he join a drama course, after which he joined rep in Shelton, Staffordshire, and other local theatre groups.

==Career==
Jones won a scholarship to the Rose Bruford Training College of Speech and Drama—where he shed his Midlands accent. He spent time in repertory theatre in Lincoln, before making his London debut in 1962 with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), performing at the Arts Theatre in &quot;Afore Night Come&quot;. According to the theatre critic Michael Coveney, Jones was &quot;immediately one of the ... [RSC&#x27;s] most distinctive character actors&quot;. In 1963 he played Stanley in the Harold Pinter-directed revival of &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; in 1963, followed by Maxim Gorky&#x27;s play &quot;Lower Depths&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre in 1964. In 1964 he appeared as Cucurucu in the Peter Brook-directed production of Marat/Sade in a production that included Glenda Jackson, Ian Richardson and Patrick Magee. He reprised his role for the Broadway production, and again for the film version (1967).

He became more widely known to British audiences in 1968, after his appearance in the six-episode television series &quot;The Caesars&quot;, in which he played Claudius. For this role, he won the award for the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Television Actor of the Year&quot; at the 1969 Monte-Carlo Television Festival. In 1970 he took the eponymous role in Charles Wood&#x27;s television film &quot;The Emergence Of Anthony Purdy Esquire Farmer&#x27;s Labourer&quot;, directed by Patrick Dromgoole for Harlech TV. Other television work included the 1968 BBC three-part adaptation of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (he also appeared in the 1995 film adaptation), the 1978 series &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; and the ITV children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot; (1976–1978). His cinema career developed, with support roles in the Cold War thriller &quot;Firefox&quot; playing an MI6 spy chief, and in the director David Lynch&#x27;s films &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990). In the 1980s series, &quot;The District Nurse&quot;, he played the senior partner in a father-and-son medical practice in 1930s Wales, with the unrelated Nicholas Jones as his son.

In 1980 he appeared as Sir in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s play &quot;The Dresser&quot;, first in Manchester, then transferring to the London stage; he later reprised the role on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Monday Play&quot; in 1993. Coveney said of Jones in the role: &quot;No subsequent performance in The Dresser – not Albert Finney in the 1983 film, nor Anthony Hopkins on television in 2015, nor Ken Stott in the West End in 2016 – matched the rumbling thunder of Jones&quot;. Apart from a brief spell in 2001, Jones retired from stage work in the early 1990s.

Jones had three appearances in Sherlock Holmes adaptations; as Chester Cragwitch in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985), as Inspector Baynes in the &quot;Wisteria Lodge&quot; episode of &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1988), and as a pedlar in &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; episode of &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1993).

Jones played the character Sandy Thomas in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Emmerdale&quot; from 2005 to 2018, when he left the programme. He said he had been offered a contract extension but he declined as he felt it was the right time to move on.

Jones also performed extensively in radio drama, including:
* &quot;Mr. Pickwick&quot; in the 1977 adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;,
* &quot;The Player&quot; in the 1978 adaptation of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot;
* &quot;The Waiter&quot; in the 1971 adaptation of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;
* &quot;Albert Edward, Prince of Wales&quot; in Lydia Ragosin&#x27;s &quot;Bertie&quot;
* &quot;Rodin&quot; in Jonathan Smith&#x27;s &quot;Abandoned&quot;
* &quot;The Scribe&quot; in the 1992 adaptation of Bruce Bedford&#x27;s &quot;The Gibson&quot;
* &quot;Charlie&quot; in A. L. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Like An Angel&quot;
* &quot;Sir Morton Makepeace&quot; in Martyn Read&#x27;s &quot;The Folly&quot;
* &quot;The Artist&quot; in the adaptations of the Gormenghast novels by Mervyn Peake.

==Personal life==
Jones married actress Jennifer Heslewood in 1965. They had three sons, actor Toby Jones, Rupert, a director, and Casper, an actor. He was a Stoke City fan.

Jones died on 9 July 2019, aged 91, in Bicester, Oxfordshire, following a short illness. Following his death several of the cast members from &quot;Emmerdale&quot; paid tribute to Jones. On 11 July both episodes of a double-bill of the soap were dedicated to Jones.

<doc id="207785" wikidata="Q5277073" url="?curid=207785" title="Dilton Doiley">
<text>Dilton Donald Doiley, originally Dilbert Doiley, is a fictional character in the Archie Comics universe, where he is considered as the smartest teenager in Riverdale High School.

==History==
Characters resembling Dilton (in appearance and personality) appeared early in Archie stories. One can be seen, unnamed, in &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #1 (Winter 1942). The &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #27 (May 1942) featured a Dilton prototype named Theodosius and a character named Dilbert in &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #34 (September–October 1948). On February 16, 1948, Dilton Doiley officially made his first appearance in the &quot;Archie&quot; newspaper comic strip, yet his surname was spelled without today&#x27;s &quot;e&quot;. The name Dilton was first used in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #78 (Mar 1950).

==Character background==
Dilton is depicted as a stereotypical nerdy teenager; he is highly educated, interested in academic subjects, especially science, speaks in detailed and superfluous language, wears glasses, and is shorter than his friends. It is also stated that he has an IQ of 198 when Archie and the gang all take part in a class IQ test. While he is not particularly interested in dating, he is widely admired by Archie and the gang. Dilton uses his garage as a science laboratory. He is a skilled amateur inventor, although many of his creations do not work out as planned. His intelligence has also won him numerous science awards. His teachers, particularly Professor Flutesnoot, are very proud of his achievements.

Though Dilton often spends much of his time in his lab, he has a secret ambition to be a Riverdale High athlete. Coach Kleats rarely has confidence in him, so Dilton more commonly shows his school spirit by wearing the team mascot costume. However, he has been shown to be able to use his mathematical ability to pitch baseballs like a professional. Even when he is relegated to being Riverdale High&#x27;s baseball team scorekeeper, he is still a valuable asset, even though he once disappointed a girl interested in him who thought he was a regular player. This happened when he noticed that a team winning against Riverdale had committed a batting out of turn error and then told Coach Kleats. They then informed the umpire as required in the rules for a judgment, and the umpire declared the offending player was out, which allowed Riverdale to win with the opportunity Dilton made possible.

Writer Alex de Campi was excited to include the character when she wrote the 2015 limited series &quot;Archie vs. Predator&quot;, because she felt he was often overlooked in the regular &quot;Archie&quot; books.

==Family and friends==
Dilton&#x27;s parents appear occasionally, but almost never play a significant role. Both are typically depicted as dark-haired and bespectacled like their son. His mother who is both proud of and perplexed at her son&#x27;s inventiveness, appears more often than his father. Like the teenage characters, many of Dilton&#x27;s relatives were simply created for one particular story and were never seen again.

In one story in the 1970s, it was revealed that Mr. Doiley is actually Dilton&#x27;s stepfather. None of Dilton&#x27;s friends know this except for Chuck Clayton. Dilton, not feeling that he could deal with the shock after it being kept a secret all this time, almost ran away from home. However, after confiding in Chuck about his problem, Chuck made Dilton realize that Mr. Doiley cares about Dilton like a real father and that he would be heartbroken if Dilton ran away from home.

Moose Mason is Dilton&#x27;s closest friend. Despite their completely different personalities, their closeness stems from a mutual understanding of how well they complement each other. Moose considers Dilton his &quot;little buddy&quot; and will do anything to protect him. In current stories, this relationship is increasingly being portrayed as symbiotic, with Dilton standing up in favor of Moose—in one story, he even pounces on Reggie Mantle in defense of Moose, when the latter was insulting Moose.

Dilton&#x27;s other close friends include Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, and Jughead Jones. He has helped the gang many times with his various inventions or with his vast knowledge when they are faced with a problem. He is also willing to help his friends if they have difficulty in school. These are just some of the ways that Dilton manages to fit in with the gang.

==Series==
From May 1989 to May 1990, Dilton was the focus of his own magazine titled &quot;Dilton&#x27;s Strange Science&quot;. The magazine showcased Dilton and his friend Danni Malloy, an amateur inventor with red hair, who shared his interests and intellect. In the publication, they shared various science fiction stories that featured their own inventions.

Dilton features in a recurring one-page gag in the comics called &quot;Open the Door, Dilton&quot;. There are three gags on a page, each covering two panels. On the first panel, Dilton approaches a door with a label saying what is inside. However, the words have a double entendre. On the second panel, looking into the room, he finds that the words do not refer to their usual meaning, which is what he was really looking for. For example:
: Behind a door marked &quot;Hand Bags&quot;, someone is selling bags shaped like hands.
: Behind a door marked &quot;General Trucking&quot;, army generals are dancing.
: Behind a door marked &quot;Flea Collar&quot;, someone is putting tiny collars on fleas&#x27; necks.

Dilton also appears in other spin-offs with the rest of the gang, serving as the &quot;brains&quot; of the group as he does in the main series. He was a member of Archie&#x27;s racing team in &quot;Archie R/C Racers&quot;, and featured in &quot;Explorers of the Unknown&quot; as team inventor Gizmo. He rarely appears in &quot;Archie I&quot; or &quot;Archie 3000&quot;, but in the former, he makes prehistoric discoveries, while in the latter, he makes use of the highly advanced technology.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animated====
* Dilton appeared in &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, a 1968 cartoon series produced by Filmation voiced by Howard Morris. 
* Dilton was promoted to one of the main characters in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, voiced by Ben Beck. Appearing in a majority of the episodes, his scientific knowledge and inventions are often used to solve the titular mysteries, although sometimes they might be the cause of such problems. Unlike most incarnations, this version spends most of his time working in the school lab, as opposed to his own garage.

====Live-action====
* Dilton was planned to appear in the 1990 TV film &quot;&quot;, but his parts were written out due to a combination of time constraints and his actor getting sick during production.
* Dilton appears in &quot;Riverdale&quot;, a drama series for The CW portrayed by Daniel Yang in the pilot and by Major Curda onwards. Daniel Yang reprised the role in Season 7.

===Film===
* Dilton appears in &quot;The Archies&quot;, a musical film adaptation in Hindi, portrayed by Yuvraj Menda. In this rendition, Dilton Doiley harbors a secret attraction to Reggie Mantle; in a scene later in the film, Reggie tells him that he knows about Dilton’s feelings, and even though Reggie does not share them, Reggie admires Dilton and will always be his friend. Dilton’s intellectual hobbies end up helping save the day when he unveils that he has built a radio transmitter.

<doc id="207786" wikidata="Q6908616" url="?curid=207786" title="Moose Mason">
<text>Marmaduke &quot;Moose&quot; Mason (often referred to as Big Moose) is a fictional character in the Archie Comics universe. He attends Riverdale High School where he is typically depicted as the best athlete but the poorest student. His difficulties with school were later attributed to dyslexia. Mason is a Russian-American. The live-action version of Moose is portrayed by Cody Kearsley in &quot;Riverdale&quot;. 

==Character&#x27;s background==
Moose is blessed with great strength. In one sequence, he slides under a car and, from his supine position, lifts it off the ground. As a result, people often have high expectations of him regarding athletics. He has helped Riverdale High School win many matches in basketball, baseball, football, ice hockey, and various other sports, though he seems to have a preference for football. Moose was originally created to serve as the personification and stereotype of the jock—all brawn and no brains. In earlier days, whenever Moose talked he would start off with a &quot;D-uh&quot;, decades before it became a colloquialism indicating something so obvious that everybody should know it. When Moose says it, however, he is not being sarcastic.

In the Spanish version of the comic, Moose is called Gorilón (&quot;Big Gorilla&quot;). Moose&#x27;s given real name is Marmaduke Mason. Other names given for Moose through the early years were Francis &quot;Moose&quot; McGonagal, Merton Matowski and Moose McGee in his very first appearance.

His various tendencies may be inherited from one of his first ancestors to immigrate to the United States. In one story, a Russian named Laslo Kharandashikov befriends Archie Andrews&#x27;s Scottish forefather Andy Andrews when they meet on the same ship immigrating to the US. Laslo protects Andy from another man who wants to thrash Andy. Andy shows gratitude by finding Laslo&#x27;s immigration money for him after Laslo nearly loses it. Laslo&#x27;s difficulty in speaking English leads him to give his name as &quot;Mason&quot; to the immigration officials who let him into the country.

In the Archie I stories, where the gang are depicted as prehistoric cave-dwellers, the character is referred to as the Big Fella or the Big Guy. In such depictions, his hair is long and flowing, he wears a fur loincloth and sometimes carries a club.

In earlier stories, there was a similar character called Lunk who had a reddish crew cut and a slightly leaner build.

In some stories one of the gang, usually Archie, asks for Moose&#x27;s help with a problem that can only be solved by means of the big guy&#x27;s strength or intimidating presence. In &quot;Guardian Devil,&quot; Archie and Betty meet a runaway child whose hospitalized mother left the boy in her brother&#x27;s care, but the uncle locked the boy in his room and had wild parties in the house—until Archie brought Moose over to straighten things out; after manhandling the uncle, the intimidating Moose sends the partygoers running with the simple exclamation &quot;Scat!&quot;. In another story, Archie had tracked down two thugs who robbed the Chok&#x27;lit Shoppe, using a description given by Jughead, whom the cops had found in the store and initially accused. The thugs had just started beating Archie when Moose showed up; he picked the thugs up effortlessly and took them to the police station.

While Moose is easily angered and will threaten to hurt those who upset him, he is very kind, loyal, and compassionate. He is always willing to help somebody in need, and he constantly protects his friends from bullies (often without using punches). He also cares for the well-being of animals and small children. In one story, two young children vandalize a classroom in Riverdale High School but Moose takes the blame for them.

Moose is friends with Archie Andrews who is his teammate in sports and very loyal to him, Jughead Jones, Dilton Doiley and Betty Cooper.

==Family==
Moose is the son of Jerry and Marilyn Mason.

Like most characters, Moose has a sibling who is only featured a few times. Marsha Mason, Moose&#x27;s freshman sister, is featured in &quot;Betty and Veronica Double Digest&quot; #20 in &quot;Moose&#x27;s Sister&quot; (Parts 1 &amp; 2). Marsha starts school at Riverdale High School, and Reggie Mantle began dating her. After two weeks of dating, Moose finds out and beats up Reggie for dating his sister. Marsha has been seen before as a cameo in comics.

In the New Riverdale era, Moose is the oldest of 5 and has 4 younger siblings that appeared in Reggie and Me miniseries and Big Moose one shot comic.

In one story, Moose&#x27;s great-grandfather is revealed as &quot;Lazlo Kharandashikov&quot;. At Ellis Island, afraid of being turned away because of his long name, he gives it as Lazlo Mannson, after a passing ice cream wagon. The official changes this further to Leslie Mason. He departs Ellis Island for Chicago.

In one story Moose is shown to have two large, shaggy hounds as pets.

==Relationships==
Moose is extremely possessive of Midge Klump, his steady girlfriend, and has time and again flattened anybody (Reggie Mantle is his most frequent victim) who seeks her affection. This possessiveness is at times taken to extremes. He&#x27;s wary of any male even speaking to her, and has at times assaulted even his best friends, inflicting injuries that should, by all rights, be life-altering. There are times when Midge cannot stand Moose&#x27;s jealousy and ends up scolding him, but every time he just wants to give Midge some space, she decides that she prefers the old Moose.

He has threatened Archie before for various things, but since he knows that Archie is not anywhere near interested in Midge as a girlfriend, this allows Moose to be more tolerant of Archie. At one time, a computer matched Archie and Midge, to Moose&#x27;s fury, but Archie and Midge both stated that they weren&#x27;t interested in each other, except as friends, which allowed Moose to cool off. At one point, Archie outright asks permission to date Midge, and Moose declined the request, but it showed, that at least Archie has the courtesy to ask him, whereas Reggie will stoop to dating her on the sly-which often results in Moose pounding up Reggie-as a running gag.

Archie was once able to use Moose&#x27;s devotion and genuine concern for Midge to help him defeat a gang of robbers who were stealing office electronics from the school. The robbers managed to bind and gag Archie and Jughead and appeared to be getting away, until Archie spotted Moose playing handball on the school grounds through a window. Archie managed to slip a note out the window to Moose saying Midge was the one being held. An angry Moose quickly subdued the gang and freed Archie and Jughead. Rather than being angry over the deception, Moose showed relief that Midge was not in any danger and joked that stopping the crooks was more exciting than playing handball was.

Moose has a mean streak in many comics, and spends a lot of time hiding behind park benches inhabited by his girlfriend, Midge. He does this so that whenever somebody comes along to talk to her, he can jump out and beat him up. Often, these are false alarms; someone just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also, in earlier days, whenever Moose talked he would start off with a &quot;D-uh&quot;, decades before it became a synonym for something so obvious that everyone should know it. When Moose says it, he is not being sarcastic.

==Intelligence==
It is often said that he consistently scores straight F&#x27;s (which, at one point, he thought meant Fantastic). Moose&#x27;s learning difficulties were later revealed to be dyslexia, which made it harder for him to understand what his teachers, such as Miss Grundy, were writing on the chalkboard. However, Moose&#x27;s friends never want to see him fail and are always willing to help him study. Moose has done better at school when he needs to, and is able to understand complex subjects like algebra if people explain them to him enough—something which nearly drove Reggie Mantle crazy when he acted as Moose&#x27;s math tutor.

A theme used in many stories is based on the Riverdale High rules that failing students are not allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. At such times, Moose has to pass a makeup test, and proves to have difficulty studying. Coach Kleats and Moose&#x27;s teammates depend on Moose to help them win most of their games. Moose can always depend on a friend to tutor him, and he almost always passes the makeup test. However, sometimes their efforts backfire, and they do not win the game even if he did pass.

In today&#x27;s Archie world, Moose isn&#x27;t as dumb as he appears. He was offered a full football scholarship to a university. When he found out that they wanted to place him into &quot;joke classes&quot; so he would get good grades, he turned down the offer. When asked about it, he replied &quot;I may be dumb, but there&#x27;s no reason for me to stay dumb.&quot; He also briefly dropped out of high school, but returned upon realizing he would need a college education to get the jobs he would like to try.

Despite his limited intelligence, Moose has a deeply sensitive side, which many people do not see. The first person he opens up to is Dilton Doiley. Moose has a deep admiration of Dilton because of his intelligence; Moose calls him his &quot;little buddy&quot; and will go to any length to help the diminutive genius. When Moose feels discouraged by other people&#x27;s opinions of him, Dilton is the first to stick up for him. In one story, walking through the snow, the two discuss Moose&#x27;s thoughts and feelings. At this point, Dilton finds that despite what people think of him, Moose has a poetic and philosophical view of certain things.

==Appearance==
Moose is a large, handsome fellow with a muscular build and blond hair. In early stories, he wears his hair in a crew cut. The more modern version of him sports a shaggier hairstyle

==Alternate versions==
In &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Moose attends the Halloween school dance when the zombie apocalypse starts. When a zombified Jughead attacks the school dance, he and the others escape to Veronica Lodge&#x27;s home. They decide to go swimming to take their mind off of things. In private, Midge confides in Moose that she got a cut on her hand during the confusion at the school dance, although she doesn&#x27;t know from whom. Moose tries to convince her to tell the others but she disinfects the wound and reassures him that she won&#x27;t turn by saying it would&#x27;ve already happened by now. She curls up with Moose and tells him that she loves him. When next they are seen, Midge and Moose have both turned into zombies and attack their friends who are in the pool. Smithers activates the aluminum pool cover, trapping the two zombified lovers in there.

<text>In mathematical logic, a Gödel numbering is a function that assigns to each symbol and well-formed formula of some formal language a unique natural number, called its Gödel number. Kurt Gödel developed the concept for the proof of his incompleteness theorems. ()

A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding in which a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, after which a sequence of natural numbers can then represent a sequence of symbols. These sequences of natural numbers can again be represented by single natural numbers, facilitating their manipulation in formal theories of arithmetic.

Since the publishing of Gödel&#x27;s paper in 1931, the term &quot;Gödel numbering&quot; or &quot;Gödel code&quot; has been used to refer to more general assignments of natural numbers to mathematical objects.

== Simplified overview ==
Gödel noted that each statement within a system can be represented by a natural number (its &quot;Gödel number&quot;). The significance of this was that properties of a statement—such as its truth or falsehood—would be equivalent to determining whether its Gödel number had certain properties. The numbers involved might be very large indeed, but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed.

In simple terms, Gödel devised a method by which every formula or statement that can be formulated in the system gets a unique number, in such a way that formulas and Gödel numbers can be mechanically converted back and forth. There are many ways to do this. A simple example is the way in which English is stored as a sequence of numbers in computers using ASCII. Since ASCII codes are in the range 0 to 127, it is sufficient to pad them to 3 decimal digits and then to concatenate them:
* The word is represented by .
* The logical formula is represented by .

== Gödel&#x27;s encoding ==

Gödel used a system based on prime factorization. He first assigned a unique natural number to each basic symbol in the formal language of arithmetic with which he was dealing.

To encode an entire formula, which is a sequence of symbols, Gödel used the following system. Given a sequence formula_1 of positive integers, the Gödel encoding of the sequence is the product of the first &quot;n&quot; primes raised to their corresponding values in the sequence:

:formula_2

According to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any number (and, in particular, a number obtained in this way) can be uniquely factored into prime factors, so it is possible to recover the original sequence from its Gödel number (for any given number n of symbols to be encoded).

Gödel specifically used this scheme at two levels: first, to encode sequences of symbols representing formulas, and second, to encode sequences of formulas representing proofs. This allowed him to show a correspondence between statements about natural numbers and statements about the provability of theorems about natural numbers, the proof&#x27;s key observation ().

There are more sophisticated (and more concise) ways to construct a Gödel numbering for sequences.

=== Example ===
In the specific Gödel numbering used by Nagel and Newman, the Gödel number for the symbol &quot;0&quot; is 6 and the Gödel number for the symbol &quot;=&quot; is 5. Thus, in their system, the Gödel number of the formula &quot;0 = 0&quot; is 26 × 35 × 56 = 243,000,000.

== Lack of uniqueness ==

Infinitely many different Gödel numberings are possible. For example, supposing there are &quot;K&quot; basic symbols, an alternative Gödel numbering could be constructed by invertibly mapping this set of symbols (through, say, an invertible function &quot;h&quot;) to the set of digits of a bijective base-&quot;K&quot; numeral system. A formula consisting of a string of &quot;n&quot; symbols formula_3 would then be mapped to the number

:formula_4

In other words, by placing the set of &quot;K&quot; basic symbols in some fixed order, such that the formula_5-th symbol corresponds uniquely to the formula_5-th digit of a bijective base-&quot;K&quot; numeral system, &quot;each formula may serve just as the very numeral of its own Gödel number.&quot;

For example, the numbering described here has K=1000.

== Application to formal arithmetic ==

===Recursion===

One may use Gödel numbering to show how functions defined by course-of-values recursion are in fact primitive recursive functions.

===Expressing statements and proofs by numbers===

Once a Gödel numbering for a formal theory is established, each inference rule of the theory can be expressed as a function on the natural numbers. If &quot;f&quot; is the Gödel mapping and &quot;r&quot; is an inference rule, then there should be some arithmetical function &quot;gr&quot; of natural numbers such that if formula &quot;C&quot; is derived from formulas &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; through an inference rule &quot;r&quot;, i.e.
:formula_7
then
:formula_8
This is true for the numbering Gödel used, and for any other numbering where the encoded formula can be arithmetically recovered from its Gödel number.

Thus, in a formal theory such as Peano arithmetic in which one can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, one can use a Gödel numbering to indirectly make statements about the theory itself. This technique allowed Gödel to prove results about the consistency and completeness properties of formal systems.

== Generalizations ==

In computability theory, the term &quot;Gödel numbering&quot; is used in settings more general than the one described above. It can refer to:
#Any assignment of the elements of a formal language to natural numbers in such a way that the numbers can be manipulated by an algorithm to simulate manipulation of elements of the formal language.
#More generally, an assignment of elements from a countable mathematical object, such as a countable group, to natural numbers to allow algorithmic manipulation of the mathematical object.

Also, the term Gödel numbering is sometimes used when the assigned &quot;numbers&quot; are actually strings, which is necessary when considering models of computation such as Turing machines that manipulate strings rather than numbers. 
==Gödel sets==
Gödel sets are sometimes used in set theory to encode formulas, and are similar to Gödel numbers, except that one uses sets rather than numbers to do the encoding. In simple cases when one uses a hereditarily finite set to encode formulas this is essentially equivalent to the use of Gödel numbers, but somewhat easier to define because the tree structure of formulas can be modeled by the tree structure of sets. Gödel sets can also be used to encode formulas in infinitary languages.

<text>Riga district () was an administrative division of Latvia, located in Semigallia and Vidzeme regions, in the centre of the country. It was the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the historical Riga county since 1949. 

Beginning from the west and counterclockwise to the east, Riga district bordered the districts of Tukums, Jelgava, Bauska, Ogre, Cēsis and Limbaži. The area of the district was 3,058 km² with a population of 159,247 in January 2009. Riga district was one of the largest regions of Latvia, it was strategically important and also had some of the most developed infrastructure in Latvia. It was a cross-point of 10 major motorways and a junction of 6 important railroad lines.

Districts were eliminated during the .

==History==

One of the first ancient settlements was situated in this district and dates from the 9th century BC. Across time localities of the Riga district had their resurgence and downturns caused by wars and unrest. This land been occupied by German crusaders and Swedish, Polish–Lithuanian, Saxonian, German and Russian armies. More than 300 monuments of cultural and historical significance that are on the list of cultural heritage protection tell us about the most important events of local history. The reasons for the rapid development of Riga district can be found in its geographic position, human and natural resources, and rich heritage of culture and history. For the same reasons this region is valuable for tourism, recreation and business travel.

==Nature==

The larger part of the former region lies in the sand-soil plains of Riga that are covered by pinewoods, low links, marshlands and level countryside that is typical for littoral lowlands. In the northern part, there are ridges of links and many lakes have formed in hollows between them. There are 132 lakes in the Riga Region and the biggest of them is the Babīte Lake, Lielais Baltezers, Mazais Baltezers, Dūņu Lake and Lilaste Lake. The former district is also crossed by three major rivers in Latvia – Daugava, Lielupe and Gauja Rivers.

The north-eastern part of former Riga district is covered by the largest deciduous forests in Latvia. The Gauja National Park is part of these forests and has more than 900 kinds of plants, 48 species of mammals and 149 species of birds.

<text>The Archies are an American fictional rock band featured in media produced by, and related to, Archie Comics. They are best remembered for their appearance in the animated TV series &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. In the context of the series, the band was founded by guitarist/vocalist Archie Andrews, drummer Jughead Jones, bassist Reggie Mantle, percussionist/vocalist Betty Cooper and keyboardist/vocalist Veronica Lodge. 

The music featured in the series was recorded by session musicians, including Ron Dante on lead vocals and Toni Wine on duet and backing vocals. The recordings were released as a series of singles and albums that achieved worldwide chart success. Their most successful song, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, became one of the biggest hits of the bubblegum pop genre that flourished from 1968 to 1973.

In 2020, a new version of the band was introduced in the TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, with Kevin Keller replacing Reggie Mantle. However, the band continues to appear with the five original members in the comic books published by Archie Comics.

A feature film of the Archies was produced for Netflix. It was released on December 7, 2023.

==History==

===Conception===
The Archies first appeared in a comic book, &quot;Life with Archie&quot; #60 (April 1967). The fictional band was inspired by the success of the 1966 TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot;; in particular, Don Kirshner, who had managed the initially fictional band, wanted a musical act that he could fully control: as the Monkees were fictional but still used the real musicians&#x27; names, the musicians themselves became increasingly irritated at being micromanaged, leading to a dispute that culminated in Kirshner being fired. To avoid a repeat of the Monkees fiasco while still allowing himself full control, Kirshner commissioned a band based on cartoon characters—if the session musicians tried to rebel or leave, they could be replaced seamlessly. The early stories copied the TV show&#x27;s fast cuts and action: &quot;There were pages that had no panel-to-panel continuity at all, just pure strings of nonsense, fantasy, fourth-wall breaking, and exasperated commentary from Betty and Veronica.&quot; The feature ended in issue #66.

===Production===
A set of studio musicians was assembled by Don Kirshner in 1968 to perform various songs. Their most famous song is &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, written by Jeff Barry and Andy Kim, which went to number one on the pop chart in 1969, sold over six million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it was ranked as the No. 1 song of that year, the only time a fictional band has ever claimed &quot;Billboard&quot;″s annual Hot 100 top spot. Other Top 40 songs recorded by the Archies include &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Baby?&quot; (U.S. No. 40), &quot;Bang-Shang-A-Lang&quot; (U.S. No. 22), and &quot;Jingle Jangle&quot; (U.S. No. 10). &quot;Jingle Jangle&quot; also sold over one million copies, garnering a second gold disc award. Their records were released on the Calendar Records label, which was shortly thereafter renamed to Kirshner Records.

Male vocals for the fictional Archies group were provided by The Cuff Links&#x27; lead singer Ron Dante and female duet vocals were provided by Toni Wine. Wine, who was only paid for the recording session and quit the group when &quot;Jingle Jangle&quot; became a huge hit, was succeeded in 1970 by Donna Marie, who in turn was replaced on the final recordings by Merle Miller. The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971&#x27;s &quot;Love Is Living In You&quot;, sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released in 1972, was &quot;Strangers In The Morning&quot;.

Jeff Barry, Andy Kim, Ritchie Adams, Bobby Bloom, Ellie Greenwich, Lesley Miller, Susan Morse and Maeretha Stewart contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed by Jughead in the cartoons) on cuts such as &quot;Jingle Jangle&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;, &quot;A Summer Prayer For Peace&quot; (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and &quot;You Little Angel, You&quot;. Musicians on the Archies&#x27; records included guitarists Hugh McCracken and Dave Appell, drummers Gary Chester and Buddy Saltzman, bassists Chuck Rainey and Joey Macho, and keyboard player Ron Frangipane.

The sound engineer was Fred Weinberg, who was Jeff Barry&#x27;s and Andy Kim&#x27;s favorite and also recorded Barry&#x27;s other hits &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, and Kim&#x27;s &quot;Rock Me Gently&quot;. Fred Weinberg is a composer and producer in his own right. However, the music for &quot;The U.S. of Archie&quot;, which aired in 1974, was produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood producer, who also produced Bobby Sherman and the Brady Kids. The vocalist for these shows was Tom McKenzie, who also sang on some &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; segments, and was a regular member of the popular singing group Doodletown Pipers.

According to Ron Dante, over 100 songs were recorded, but at least 40 went unreleased. In 2020, Sunset Blvd Records released &quot;Ron Dante&#x27;s Funhouse!&quot;, which includes some of the unreleased songs and most of the &quot;Dance of the Week&quot; segments, all of them pulled straight from &quot;Archie&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; and &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, respectively.

Some of the group&#x27;s songs have appeared on episodes of the TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot;. The group made its debut in &quot;Riverdale&quot;, in the musical episode &quot;Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town&quot;, for only the second time in a live-action adaptation after the television film &quot;&quot; in 1990. It includes KJ Apa as Archie, Cole Sprouse as Jughead, Lili Reinhart as Betty, Camila Mendes as Veronica and Casey Cott as Kevin Keller. For the first time, Kevin Keller is part of the group, replacing Reggie Mantle (played by Charles Melton). Kevin sings and plays keyboard. The song &quot;Midnight Radio&quot; was included in the series&#x27; musical episode soundtrack, which was released by WaterTower Music on April 15, 2020.

===Live-action adaptation===

On November 10, 2021, Netflix announced the Indian live-action feature film adaptation of the Archies of the same name. The film was produced by Tiger Baby Films and Graphic India with Zoya Akhtar as director, starring Agastya Nanda as Archie, Mihir Ahuja as Jughead, Vedang Raina as Reggie, Khushi Kapoor as Betty and Suhana Khan as Veronica, alongside others. Filming started on April 18, 2022, and then ended on December 19, 2022. The film was released on December 7, 2023.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Sony Music India on November 25, 2023.

==Fictional line-up==
The Archies play a variety of contemporary popular music, consistent with the era in which the comic is drawn. Most of the members sing vocals, with Jughead handling the bass voice on a few tracks. Their singing voices were soft and appropriate for pop vocals, but their speaking voices were much different, as their speaking roles were played by voice actors. The roles that the teens play in the fictional band are:

* Archie Andrews – guitars, vocals
* Jughead Jones – drums
* Reggie Mantle – bass
* Betty Cooper – percussion, vocals
* Veronica Lodge – keyboards, vocals
* Kevin Keller – keyboards, vocals (&quot;Riverdale&quot; only)

One distribution mode for the Archies&#x27; music was embossing cardboard records directly onto the back of cereal boxes, which were cut out and played on a turntable (although their music was also available on standard issue LPs and 45s).

Though the group no longer appears in animation, they are still frequently used in stories published by Archie Comics. In 2020, the group made its second live-action appearance on &quot;Riverdale&quot;, with Kevin Keller replacing Reggie Mantle. In this incarnation, Kevin sings and plays keyboard, and Veronica sings only.

<text>The brothers Arkady Natanovich Strugatsky (; 28 August 1925 – 12 October 1991) and Boris Natanovich Strugatsky (; 14 April 1933 – 19 November 2012) were Soviet and Russian science-fiction authors who collaborated through most of their careers.

==Life and work==

The Strugatsky brothers ( or simply ) were born to Natan Strugatsky, an art critic, and his wife, a teacher. Their father was Jewish and their mother was Russian Orthodox. Their early work was influenced by Ivan Yefremov and Stanisław Lem. Later they went on to develop their own, unique style of science fiction writing that emerged from the period of Soviet rationalism in Soviet literature and evolved into novels interpreted as works of social criticism.

Their best-known novel, &quot;Piknik na obochine&quot;, has been translated into English as &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;. Andrei Tarkovsky adapted the novel for the screen as &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979).

Algis Budrys compared their &quot;An Emergency Case&quot; and Arkady&#x27;s &quot;Wanderers and Travellers&quot; to the work of Eando Binder. Several other of their fiction works were translated into English, German, French, and Italian, but did not receive the same magnitude of critical acclaim as that granted by their Russian audiences. The Strugatsky brothers, however, were and still are popular in many countries, including Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the former republics of Yugoslavia, and Germany, where most of their works were available in both East and West Germany. They are well-known Russian science fiction writers with a well-developed fan base.

The Strugatsky brothers were Guests of Honour at Conspiracy &#x27;87, the 1987 World Science Fiction Convention, held in Brighton, England.

In 1991, Text Publishers brought out the collected works by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.

==Arkady==
Arkady Strugatsky was born 25 August 1925 in Batumi; the family later moved to Leningrad. In January 1942, Arkady and his father were evacuated from the Siege of Leningrad, but Arkady was the only survivor in his train car; his father died upon reaching Vologda. Arkady was drafted into the Soviet army in 1943. He trained first at the artillery school in Aktyubinsk and later at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow, from which he graduated in 1949 as an interpreter of English and Japanese. He worked as a teacher and interpreter for the military until 1955. In 1955, he began working as an editor and writer. In 1958, he began collaborating with his brother Boris, a collaboration that lasted until Arkady&#x27;s death on . Arkady Strugatsky became a member of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1964. In addition to his own writing, he translated Japanese short stories and novels, as well as some English works with his brother.

==Boris==

Born 14 April 1933, Boris Strugatsky remained in Leningrad with his mother during the siege of the city during World War II. He graduated from high school in 1950 and applied to the physics department at Leningrad State University, but studied astronomy instead. After graduating in 1955, he worked as an astronomer and computer engineer at the Pulkovo Observatory. In 1960 he participated in a geodetic and astronomical expedition in the Caucasus. Boris Strugatsky became a member of the writers&#x27; union of the USSR in 1964. In 1966, he became a full-time writer. From 1972 he acted as the head of the Leningrad seminar of young speculative fiction writers, which subsequently became known as the &quot;Boris Strugatsky Seminar&quot;. He established the &quot;Bronze Snail&quot; literary prize. He was an agnostic. After the death of his brother, he published two more novels under a pseudonym. Boris Strugatsky died in Saint Petersburg on .

==Noon Universe==

Several of the Strugatsky brothers&#x27; books take place in the World of Noon, also known unofficially as the Wanderers Universe. The name is derived from the title of one of their texts, &quot;&quot;. The Noon Universe started as a &quot;socialist utopia&quot; in which the conflict is between &quot;the good and the better&quot; while the later books set in the same universe took on darker tones.

The main characteristics of the Noon Universe are: a very high level of social, scientific, and technological development; creativity of the general population; and the very significant level of societal maturity compared to the modern world. For instance, this world knows no monetary stimulation (indeed, money does not exist), and every person is engaged in a profession that interests him or her. The Earth of the Noon Universe is governed by a global meritocratic council composed of the world&#x27;s leading scientists and philosophers.

The Noon Universe was described by the authors as the world in which they would like to live and work. It became highly influential for at least a generation of Soviet people, e.g., a person could quote the Strugatsky books and be sure of being understood. At first the authors thought the Noon Universe would become reality &quot;by itself&quot;, but then they realized that the only way to achieve it was by inventing the High Theory of Upbringing, making the upbringing of each person a unique deed.

One of the important story arcs of those books addresses how the advanced human civilization covertly steers the development of those considered less advanced. Agents of humans are known as progressors. At the same time, some humans suspect that a very advanced spacefaring race called Wanderers exists and is &quot;progressing&quot; humanity itself.

==Adaptations==
The Strugatsky&#x27;s books were often adapted for screen, stage, comics, and video games. Some of the adaptations are very loose, like Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Stalker&quot;, some are not adaptations but rather new scripts written by the Brothers themselves, like &quot;The Sorcerers&quot;.

* &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979) by Andrey Tarkovsky, based on the Strugatsky&#x27;s script, inspired by &quot;The Roadside Picnic&quot;
* &quot;Dead Mountaineer&#x27;s Hotel&quot; (1979) by Grigori Kromanov, based on the novel of the same name
* &quot;The Sorcerers&quot; (1982), by Konstantin Bromberg, based on the Strugatsky&#x27;s script inspired by &quot;Monday Begins on Saturday&quot;
* &quot;Days of Eclipse&quot; (1988) by Alexander Sokurov, inspired by &quot;One billion years before the end of the world&quot;
* &quot;Hard to be a God&quot; (1989) by Peter Fleischmann, based on the novel of the same name
* &quot;Искушение Б.&quot; (&quot;Iskushenie B.&quot;) (1991) by Arkadi Sirenko, based on the play Five Spoons of Elixir 
* &quot;Nesmluvená setkání&quot; (1995 Czech TV movie, English: &quot;Unexpected Encounters&quot;) by Irena Pavlásková, based on the novel &quot;Space Mowgli&quot;
* &quot;The Ugly Swans&quot; (2006) by Konstantin Lopushansky, based on the novel of the same name
* &quot;Обитаемый остров&quot; (2008) is a two-part Russian science fiction film directed by Fyodor Bondarchuk, based on the 1969 novel published in English as &quot;Prisoners of Power&quot;
* &quot;Hard to be a God&quot; (2013) by Alexei German, based on the novel of the same name

==Legacy==
Several writers have to a varying degree paid their tribute to the works of Strugatsky brothers:
* Sergey Lukyanenko in his duology &quot;The Stars Are Cold Toys&quot; has the main character visit a world that is in many aspects strikingly similar to Earth from the Noon Universe but in truth is revealed to be fundamentally different and oppressive. On his website, Lukyanenko commented that he disagreed with the Strugatskys&#x27; views on education and upbringing and conceived his duology partly as a polemic criticism of it.
* The plot of Kir Bulychov&#x27;s novella from the Alisa Selezneva series, &quot;Vacations in Space, or the Planet Five-Four&quot;, is based on finding a secret base of mysterious &quot;Wanderers&quot; (Странники), an extinct highly advanced civilization. He also depicted his own Zone in the story &quot;Save Galya!&quot;
* In the late 1990s, a three-volume collection of fiction by notable contemporary Russian science fiction authors, titled &quot;The Time of the Apprentices&quot; (Время учеников), was published with the endorsement of Boris Strugatsky. Each piece in the collection was a sequel to one of the Strugatskys&#x27; books.
* The asteroid 3054 Strugatskia, discovered by Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977, was named after the Strugatsky brothers.
* The fictional moon Pandora depicted in the movie &quot;Avatar&quot; by James Cameron contains some similarities with the Noon Universe series, where a planet is also called Pandora. Both are filled with jungle, where weird animals and a humanoid race live. Also, the girlfriend of the biologist Sidorov in the Strugatskys&#x27; novel is called &quot;Nava&quot; (as compared with &quot;Na&#x27;vi&quot; as the name of the humanoid race in the film). However, Boris Strugatsky rejected the idea that his works had been plagiarized, despite the similarities.
* In 2014 a square in Saint Petersburg was named after the Strugatsky brothers. A memorial museum is being opened in the same city.
*The brothers are credited with saving humanity from mysterious &quot;visitors&quot; through technology retrieved from a &quot;visitation zone&quot; in the 2016 game &quot;The Final Station&quot;.
* The Polish video game developer Acid Wizard Studio cited the Strugatskys as an influence on their 2017 game &quot;Darkwood&quot;.
* The designers of the 2019 video game &quot;Disco Elysium&quot; cited the Strugatskys&#x27; writing as an influence on the game&#x27;s design and writing.
* The video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R. owes much of its background to the mix of the Strugatsky&#x27;s writing and the Chernobyl disasters&#x27; zone of exclusion.

<doc id="207797" wikidata="Q5115408" url="?curid=207797" title="Chuck Clayton">
<text>Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Clayton is a teenage fictional character published by Archie Comics. Chuck lives in the fictional town of Riverdale, and is the friend of Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones, and other students at Riverdale High School. Chuck first appeared in &quot;Life With Archie&quot; #110 in 1971.

Chuck was created as a means of adding diversity to the cast of Archie characters, although Valerie (of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;) predates him by several years. Jordan Calloway portrayed the character on &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

==History==
Chuck is African American and the son of Floyd Clayton, who works at Riverdale High School as the school&#x27;s coach, and Alice Clayton, a housewife. In earlier stories, including his recurring appearances in &quot;Archie at Riverdale High,&quot; Chuck was usually shown as one of Riverdale High&#x27;s top athletes. Chuck was also depicted as a close friend of Archie, often spending time together or engaging in various adventures.

By the early 1990s, Chuck&#x27;s interest in cartooning was added to round out his character, and also serves to promote the comics he appears in. In modern stories, Chuck is depicted primarily as a cartoonist, whose greatest ambition is to someday become a professional comic book and comic strip illustrator. Despite the long hours he spends practicing his craft, he attempts to be a well-rounded individual by engaging in other pursuits; such as participating in sports, studying his bloodlines, and spending time with his girlfriend, Nancy Woods.

While Chuck is a minor character in most stories, one story showed him as a major character where he competed against Veronica on a game show which was a clear takeoff of &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;. Chuck recruits two men who own the local comic book store to be on his team, while Veronica has two professional artists on hers. Veronica loses when her drawings are not deduced while Chuck&#x27;s are deciphered. (It is then revealed that Veronica unknowingly hired abstract artists). Chuck spends his winnings at the store owned by his two teammates; buying as many comic books in order to further research professional illustrators.

==Relationships==
Chuck&#x27;s steady girlfriend is Nancy Woods, one of the series&#x27; few steady couples. While Nancy shares some of Chuck&#x27;s interests in art, she often berates him for sometimes focusing more on his art than their relationship.

==In other media==
===Animation===
* Chuck appeared in 1974&#x27;s animated Archie series &quot;The U.S. of Archie&quot; and 1977&#x27;s &quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;, voiced by Dal McKennon.
* Chuck also was shown in an Archie parody in an episode of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, where he was derisively called a &quot;token&quot; African-American character.
* Chuck is a minor character in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;; he is often seen alongside Nancy Woods, although their exact relationship is unclear. Both of them only spoke in the episode, &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot;, before being relegated to silent cameos throughout the rest of the series.

===Live action===
* Chuck appears in the TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot; and is portrayed by Jordan Calloway. He takes on a more antagonistic role as a womanizer rather than the considerate and sweet-natured personality of his previous portrayals. Late in the second season, he expressed a desire to reform and demonstrated his artistic side by joining the school play, where his professional, hard-working, and above all, respectful demeanor gained the forgiveness of the other students, and brought him closer to his traditional portrayal. Like his counterpart in the comics, Chuck&#x27;s ambition is to become an artist and illustrate children&#x27;s books.

<doc id="207802" wikidata="Q310545" url="?curid=207802" title="Archy and Mehitabel">
<text>Archy and Mehitabel (styled as archy and mehitabel) are fictional characters created in 1916 by Don Marquis, a columnist for &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; newspaper in New York City. Archy, a cockroach, and Mehitabel, an alley cat, appeared in hundreds of humorous verses and short stories in Marquis&#x27;s daily column, &quot;The Sun Dial&quot;. Their exploits were first collected in the 1927 book &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot;, which remains in print today, and in two later volumes, &quot;archys life of mehitabel&quot; (1933) and &quot;archy does his part&quot; (1935). Many editions are recognized by their distinctive illustrations by George Herriman, the creator of &quot;Krazy Kat.&quot;

==History==
Marquis introduced Archy into his daily newspaper column at New York&#x27;s &quot;Evening Sun&quot;. Archy—whose name was always written in lower case in the book titles, but was upper case when Marquis would write about him in narrative form—was a cockroach who had been a free verse poet in a previous life, and took to writing stories and poems on an old typewriter at the newspaper office when everyone in the building had left. Archy would climb up onto the typewriter and jump on one key at a time, laboriously typing out stories of the daily challenges and travails of a cockroach. Archy&#x27;s best friend was Mehitabel, an alley cat, who thought of herself as a reincarnated Cleopatra and one of &quot;King Tut-ankh-amen&#x27;s favorite queens.&quot; The two of them shared a series of day-to-day adventures that made satiric commentary on daily life in the city during the 1910s and 1920s.

Due to his small size, Archy was unable to operate the shift key on the typewriter and thus wrote his stories entirely in lowercase, with no punctuation. When Marquis wrote in his own persona, though, he always used correct capitalization and punctuation. As E. B. White wrote in his introduction to &quot;The Lives and Times of Archy and Mehitabel&quot;, it would be incorrect to conclude that, &quot;because Don Marquis&#x27;s cockroach was incapable of operating the shift key of a typewriter, nobody else could operate it.&quot;)

There was at least one point in which Archy happened to jump onto the shift lock key—a chapter titled &quot;CAPITALS AT LAST&quot;.

Pete the Pup is another of Marquis&#x27; characters. Pete is a Boston Terrier with a passion for life and devotion to his &quot;master&quot;. Like Marquis&#x27; other animal characters, Pete types his poetry at night on the author&#x27;s typewriter (seldom capitalizing or using punctuation). Unlike many of the other characters&#x27; contributions, Pete writes about his uncomplicated life without strong political or social references.

==Publications==
Collections of the &quot;Archy&quot; stories have been published and re-printed numerous times over the years, usually with all-lowercase titles. Titles in the series include:

* &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot; (1927)
* &quot;archy&#x27;s life of mehitabel&quot; (1933)
* &quot;archy does his part&quot; (1935)
* &quot;the lives and times of archy and mehitabel&quot; (1940) (introduction by E. B. White)
* &quot;Archyology&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Archyology II&quot; (1998)
* &quot;The Annotated Archy and Mehitabel&quot; (2006)
* &quot;The Best of Archy and Mehitabel&quot; (2011)

&quot;Archyology&quot; and &quot;Archyology II&quot; were compiled and published for the first time in the late 1990s, with new illustrations by Ed Frascino. &quot;The Annotated Archy and Mehitabel&quot; was released in July 2006, edited by Michael Sims. &quot;The Best of Archy and Mehitabel&quot; is an abbreviated version of &quot;The Lives and Times of Archy and Mehitabel.&quot;

==Adaptations in other media==
A musical version of the Archy and Mehitabel materials was recorded July 7, 1953, and April 9, 1954, entitled &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot; with Carol Channing as Mehitabel and Eddie Bracken as Archy, and narrated by David Wayne, with Percival Dove as Bill, the fierce tomcat. It was followed by &quot;echoes of archy&quot;, narrated by David Wayne, recorded August 31, 1954. The credits read: Words—Joe Darion, Music—George Kleinsinger. It was originally released as Columbia Masterworks ML 4963 in 1955, and was re-released on CD, combined with the unrelated work &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;, featuring Noël Coward reading the Ogden Nash poems, as part of the Columbia Masterworks series.

The music and lyrics from the album were the basis of a short-lived 1957 loud and brassy Broadway musical titled &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;, starring Eddie Bracken as Archy and Eartha Kitt as Mehitabel. It was based on the columns and on the Columbia Masterworks album, but with additional music by Kleinsinger and dialog by Mel Brooks.

On May 16, 1960, an abridged version of the musical was broadcast under the original title &quot;archy &amp; mehitabel&quot; as part of the syndicated TV anthology series &quot;Play of the Week&quot; presented by David Susskind. The cast included Bracken, Tammy Grimes, and Jules Munshin.

Some of the songs from the album were used in 1971 in an animated film, also called &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;. Directed by John Wilson, produced by Preston M. Fleet (the creator of Fotomat and Omnimax), and starring Eddie Bracken and Carol Channing. It was not a commercial success.

Actor Jeff Culbert toured a solo show to fringe festivals across North America during 2009 to 2011. The show, &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot;, was based on Archy&#x27;s writings and involved Culbert playing the characters of Archy and Mehitabel.

American actor, singer, and clown Gale McNeeley traveled the United States in 2016 with his &quot;Archy and Mehitabel 100th Anniversary Tour&quot;. McNeeley&#x27;s show featured in the introduction to editor Michael Sim&#x27;s &quot;The Annotated Archy and Mehitabel&quot; by Penguin Classics. Lisa Dunseth, Program Manager of Book Arts &amp; Special Collections at San Francisco&#x27;s Main Library said of McNeeley, &quot;His 100th Anniversary Tour is the perfect opportunity to become a fan, if you aren&#x27;t already, and enjoy the still-funny and sometimes wicked humor of Don Marquis&#x27;s famous cockroach and infamous cat.&quot;

Composer Gabriel Lubell wrote a work for baritone, clarinet, cello, and piano called &quot;Archy Speaks&quot; (2009). The work sets four of the original poems to music.

<text>The Grevelingen or Grevelingenmeer (Lake Grevelingen) is a closed off part of the Rhine-Meuse estuary on the border of the Dutch provinces of South Holland and Zeeland.

It is situated between the islands of Goeree-Overflakkee (South Holland) and Schouwen-Duiveland (Zeeland) and was closed off as part of the Delta Works, a huge engineering project designed to protect the southwestern part of the Netherlands from flooding. The Brouwersdam, a dike connecting the two islands on the west, closes off the Grevelingen from the North Sea. The Grevelingendam, the dike on the east, blocks the inflow of the Rhine and Meuse water. 

Since its closure in 1971, the saltwater of the Grevelingen slowly started to become brackish due to rainwater and excess polderwater from the islands, but the Dutch changed their mind and decided that they wanted to preserve the saline biotope. Therefore, in 1978 a sluice was created under the Brouwersdam, partially restoring and maintaining the saline character of the Grevelingen. 

Nevertheless, the water body life remains affected by the changes in water salinity, in the transport of sediments, and by a deficit in oxygen in deep water, caused by the levee since 1971. Benthic life (mussels, oysters and many fixed organisms) is rich in the shallow waters in the photic zone, but the deep sediments are less conducive to marine life, and fishes in open water are rarely observed during diving. 

The Brouwerssluis is open all year round except during storm floods. Brouwerssluis is the home of a seal colony subsisting on fish transported by the seawater stream entering the water body during high tide. 

Connexxion bus service 104 crosses the Brouwersdam, bus service 133 (and others) the Grevelingendam.

The Grevelingenmeer is the largest saltwater water body in Europe and a popular place for holidays and water sports (sailing, surfing, diving).
==Trivia==
Professional freestyle windsurfer Steven Van Broeckhoven refers to the Grevelingenmeer as his homespot.

<text>Jacqueline Mary du Pré (26 January 1945 – 19 October 1987) was a British cellist, widely regarded as one of the prominent cellists of the 20th century. Born in Oxford, she began studying at the Guildhall School of Music in the mid-1950s with William Pleeth, earning the school&#x27;s Gold Medal in 1960. Her musical development was further enhanced by advanced studies with prominent cellists such as Paul Tortelier, Pablo Casals, and Mstislav Rostropovich.

Du Pré gained early recognition, winning Britain&#x27;s most prestigious cello award at age 11 and making her official debut at Wigmore Hall at 16. She achieved international acclaim with her 1965 American debut, where she performed Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a piece closely associated with her. By the age of 20, she was performing with leading orchestras worldwide. In 1967 she married the acclaimed conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, forming a celebrated musical couple. 

Her career was cut short in her late twenties due to illness, forcing her to withdraw from public performance. Du Pré remained active as a teacher and mentor until her death at the age of 42. 

Du Pré&#x27;s musical legacy is celebrated for her passionate and emotive playing and she remains an influential figure in the world of classical music.

== Early years, education ==
Du Pré was born in Oxford, England, the second child of Iris Greep and Derek du Pré. Derek, originally from Jersey where his family had lived for generations, worked as an accountant at Lloyds Bank in St Helier and London before becoming assistant editor and later editor of &quot;The Accountant&quot;. Iris was a talented concert pianist who had studied at the Royal Academy of Music.

At the age of four du Pré is said to have heard the sound of the cello on the radio and asked her mother for &quot;one of those&quot;. She began with lessons from her mother, who composed little pieces accompanied by illustrations, before enrolling at the London Violoncello School at age five, studying with Alison Dalrymple. For her general education, du Pré was enrolled first at Commonweal Lodge, a former independent school for girls in Purley, and then at the age of eight, transferred to Croydon High School, an independent day school for girls in South Croydon. In 1956, at the age of 11, she won the Guilhermina Suggia Award, and was granted renewal of the award each year until 1961. The Suggia award paid for du Pré&#x27;s tuition at the Guildhall School of Music in London, and for private lessons with the celebrated cellist William Pleeth.

In late 1958, the family moved to London, where Derek du Pré took the job of Secretary of the Institute of Cost and Works Accounting. In January 1959, du Pré was enrolled in Queen&#x27;s College, where she fell behind in her schoolwork, and in December du Pré&#x27;s parents withdrew her from the school. This ended du Pré&#x27;s general education; she never took the GCE.

From an early age, du Pré was entering and winning local music competitions alongside her sister, flautist Hilary du Pré. In 1959 she began appearing at children&#x27;s and young musicians&#x27; concerts, including with fellow students at the Guildhall end-of-term concert in March, followed by an appearance on BBC Television, playing the Lalo Cello Concerto. In May she repeated the Lalo concerto with the BBC Welsh Orchestra in Cardiff, with an additional recording of the Haydn Cello Concerto at the BBC Lime Grove Studios with the Royal Philharmonic. In 1960 du Pré won the Gold Medal of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the same year participated in a Pablo Casals masterclass in Zermatt, Switzerland. Pleeth entered her in the Queen&#x27;s Prize competition for outstanding musicians under 30. The panel, chaired by Yehudi Menuhin, unanimously awarded du Pré the prize, and Menuhin subsequently invited her to play trios with him and his sister.

== Career ==
In March 1961, at the age of 16, du Pré made her formal début at Wigmore Hall, London. She was accompanied by Ernest Lush, and played sonatas by Handel, Brahms, Debussy and Falla, and a solo cello suite by Bach. She made her concerto début on 21 March 1962 at the Royal Festival Hall playing the Elgar Cello Concerto with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Rudolf Schwarz; repeating the Elgar at The Proms with the same orchestra on 14 August of the same year, under Sir Malcolm Sargent. In September 1962, du Pré débuted at the Edinburgh Festival with Brahms&#x27; Second Cello Sonata, followed by débuts in Berlin in September and Paris in October, playing the Schumann Cello Concerto. After the Paris début, du Pré enrolled at the Conservatoire de Paris to study for six months with Paul Tortelier, the tuition paid by her final Suggia Award stipend, although she continued to refer to Pleeth as her primary teacher.

In 1963, du Pré performed at The Proms, playing the Elgar Concerto with Sir Malcolm Sargent. Her performance of the concerto proved so popular that she returned three years in succession to perform the work. At her 3 September 1964 Prom Concert, she performed the Elgar concerto as well as the world premiere of Priaulx Rainier&#x27;s Cello Concerto. Du Pré became a favourite at the Proms, returning every year until 1969.

In 1965, at age 20, du Pré recorded the Elgar Concerto for EMI with the London Symphony Orchestra and Sir John Barbirolli, which brought her international recognition. This recording has become a benchmark for the work, and one which has never been out of the catalogue since its release. Du Pré also performed the Elgar with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Antal Doráti for her United States début, at Carnegie Hall on 14 May 1965. In 1966 du Pré studied in Russia with Mstislav Rostropovich, who was so impressed with his pupil that at the end of his tutorship he declared her &quot;the only cellist of the younger generation that could equal and overtake [his] own achievement.&quot;

In 1968, at the suggestion of Ian Hunter, a composition was created by Alexander Goehr specifically for du Pré, &quot;Romanza for cello and orchestra, op.24,&quot; which she premiered at the Brighton Music Festival, with Daniel Barenboim conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra.

In addition to those already mentioned, Du Pré performed with numerous orchestras throughout the world, including the London Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, New Philharmonia Orchestra, BBC Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. She made her debut with the Berliner Philharmoniker in 1968 playing Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto in B minor with Zubin Mehta. She regularly performed with conductors such as Barbirolli, Sargent, Sir Adrian Boult, Daniel Barenboim, and Leonard Bernstein.

Du Pré primarily played on two Stradivarius cellos, one from 1673 and the Davidov Stradivarius of 1712. Both instruments were gifts from her godmother, Isména Holland, the wife of composer Theodore Holland. She performed with the 1673 Stradivarius from 1961 until 1964, when she acquired the Davidov. Many of her most famous recordings were made on this instrument, including the Elgar Concerto with Barbirolli, the Robert Schumann Cello Concerto with Barenboim and the two Brahms cello sonatas. From 1969 to 1970 she (like Casals before her) played on a Francesco Goffriller cello, and in 1970 acquired a modern instrument from the Philadelphia violin maker Sergio Peresson. It was the Peresson cello that du Pré played for the remainder of her career until 1973, using it for a second, live, recording of the Elgar Concerto, and her last studio recording, of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Cello Sonata in G minor and César Franck&#x27;s Violin Sonata in A arranged for cello, in December 1971.

Her friendship with musicians Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak Perlman, Zubin Mehta and Pinchas Zukerman, and marriage to Daniel Barenboim led to many memorable chamber-music performances. In a book review for two biographies about the cellist, Eugenia Zukerman, the flautist and former wife of Pinchas Zukerman, judged du Pré &quot;one of the most stunningly gifted musicians of our time&quot;. The 1969 performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London of the Schubert Piano Quintet in A major, &quot;The Trout&quot;, was the basis of a film, &quot;The Trout&quot;, by Christopher Nupen. Nupen made other films featuring du Pré, including &quot;Jacqueline du Pré and the Elgar Cello Concerto&quot;, a documentary featuring a live performance of the Elgar; and &quot;The Ghost&quot;, with Barenboim and Zukerman in a performance of the &quot;Ghost&quot; Piano Trio in D major, by Beethoven.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
Du Pré met pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim in London on Christmas Eve 1966. Shortly before the Six-Day War of 1967, she cancelled all of her current engagements and flew to Jerusalem with Barenboim. There, she converted to Judaism and they married at the Western Wall on 15 June 1967 after giving concerts around Israel for its troops and citizens. Barenboim and du Pré were highly regarded as a &quot;golden couple&quot; in the music industry during the late 1960s and early 1970s, with their extensive performing and recording collaborations being ranked as some of the finest of their time.

The posthumous memoir &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot; (later renamed &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;) by Jacqueline&#x27;s siblings Hilary du Pré and Piers, published well after her death, alleges that she had an extramarital affair with Christopher Finzi, her brother-in-law, from 1971 to 1972 when she was visiting Hilary&#x27;s family.

=== Disability ===
In 1971, du Pré&#x27;s playing declined as she began to lose sensitivity in her fingers and other parts of her body. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in October 1973. Her last recording, of sonatas by Chopin and Franck (the latter originally for violin), was made in December 1971. She went on sabbatical from 1971 to 1972, and performed only rarely. She started performing again in 1973, but by then her condition had become severe. For her January tour of North America, some of the less-than-complimentary reviews were an indication that her condition had worsened except for brief moments when her playing was without noticeable problems. Her last London concerts were in February 1973, including the Elgar Concerto with Zubin Mehta and the New Philharmonia Orchestra on 8 February.

Her last public concerts took place in New York in February 1973: four performances of the Brahms Double Concerto with Pinchas Zukerman and Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic were scheduled. Du Pré recalled that she had problems judging the weight of the bow, and just opening the cello case had become difficult. As she had lost sensation in her fingers, she had to coordinate her fingering visually. She played only three of the four concerts, cancelling the last, in which Isaac Stern took her place on the programme with Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto.

Whilst definitive diagnosis of du Pré&#x27;s MS type is not available, some speculate that it was relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Use of corticosteroids may have had adverse effects, including Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

== Death ==

Du Pré died in London on 19 October 1987 at age 42, and is buried in Golders Green Jewish Cemetery.

The Vuitton Foundation purchased her Davidov Stradivarius for just over £1 million and made it available on loan to Yo-Yo Ma. After being owned by the Norwegian cellist Øyvind Gimse, the 1673 Stradivarius, named by Lynn Harrell the &quot;Du Pré Stradivarius&quot; in tribute, is now on extended loan to Hungarian cellist István Várdai. Du Pré&#x27;s 1970 Peresson cello is currently on loan to cellist Kyril Zlotnikov of the Jerusalem Quartet.

In 2021, actress Miriam Margolyes claimed in her memoir &quot;This Much is True&quot; that du Pré died in an assisted suicide. She stated that her therapist, Margaret Branch, told her that she assisted the suicide via lethal injection. Du Pré&#x27;s husband, Daniel Barenboim, called the claim &quot;unverifiable&quot; and said it had &quot;absolutely nothing to do with the reality of Jackie&#x27;s passing&quot;.

==Cultural depictions==
=== Book and film ===
The posthumous memoir &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot; by Hilary and Piers du Pré was written at the same time as the 1998 film &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;, directed by Anand Tucker, which was based partially on interviews with Hilary and Piers. The film&#x27;s release promoted the popularity of the memoir. Both the book and the film have been criticised for sensationalising Jacqueline du Pré&#x27;s personal life, although the general claim of an affair was supported by others.

The memoir&#x27;s content in general remains factually unsupported and disputed, and contains significant omissions. The memoir&#x27;s actual description of events is ambiguous, and describes Jacqueline&#x27;s sudden request for sexual &quot;therapy sessions&quot; as occurring within a period of extreme mental depression. The unusual depression (deemed an early symptom of multiple sclerosis) also coincided with a long period in which Finzi took the initiative in verbally comforting Jacqueline. Hilary claims that she was helping her sister through her depression. She also argues, however, that she was victimised by her sister&#x27;s demands, and concludes that her sister had a desire for her husband. The memoir&#x27;s account of the affair with Finzi was contested by Hilary&#x27;s daughter, Clare Finzi, who suggested that her father was a serial adulterer who had seduced her emotionally vulnerable aunt in a time of great need to gratify his own ego. The posthumous allegation of an affair, combined with Hilary&#x27;s claim to be victimised, inevitably generated a controversy over Jacqueline du Pré&#x27;s personal life.

The film &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; differs from the memoir on several key factual points, and has been criticised by some for imposing a scandal on Jacqueline&#x27;s personal life. Clare Finzi, Hilary&#x27;s daughter, charged that the film was a &quot;gross misinterpretation which I cannot let go unchallenged.&quot; It portrays Jacqueline from Hilary&#x27;s point of view before moving to a portrayal of events as imagined from Jacqueline&#x27;s own perspective. The film contains factually disputed elements, portraying Jacqueline as being predatory and actively planning to seduce her sister&#x27;s husband. The director, Anand Tucker, defends the film&#x27;s portrayal of an affair by arguing that extant alternatives amount to canonisation or hagiography, and that he was &quot;deeply moved [by] Hilary&#x27;s sacrifice&quot;. The film and book were also defended for their emotional power and broad authenticity, despite fictional content regarding aspects of Jacqueline&#x27;s personality and the specifics of events.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, however, Hilary defended the film&#x27;s depiction of events and her sister&#x27;s personality, arguing that it accurately portrayed her darker side, the &quot;MS side&quot;; and in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; she argued that detractors simply &quot;want to look only at the pieces of Jackie&#x27;s life they [are ready to] accept&quot;. According to Hilary, &quot;[t]he ravages of MS changed Jackie&#x27;s personality. The Jackie I knew and loved died years before her actual death in 1987, but to be truthful I had to show the MS side of her&quot;. Others, such as Christopher Nupen, took a different view, holding that Jacqueline&#x27;s struggle with multiple sclerosis was more complex, with sustained periods of normality even to the very end.

=== Ballet ===
Choreographer Cathy Marston choreographed a one-act ballet titled &quot;The Cellist&quot;, based on du Pré&#x27;s life, for The Royal Ballet. The ballet premiered in 2020 at the Royal Opera House, with Lauren Cuthbertson as &quot;The Cellist&quot;, Matthew Ball as &quot;The Conductor&quot; and Marcelino Sambé as &quot;The Instrument&quot;.

=== Opera ===
&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; by Luna Pearl Woolf (music) and Royce Vavrek (libretto) had its world premiere at Canada&#x27;s National Ballet School&#x27;s Betty Oliphant Theatre in Toronto, in a production by Tapestry Opera, on 19 February 2020.

== Honours and awards ==

Du Pré received several fellowships from music academies and honorary doctorate degrees from universities for her outstanding contributions to music in general and her instrument in particular. In 1956, at the age of 11, she was the second recipient (after Rohan de Saram in 1955) of the prestigious Guilhermina Suggia Award, and remains the youngest recipient. In 1960, she won the Gold Medal of the Guildhall School of Music in London and the Queen&#x27;s Prize for British musicians. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 New Year Honours. At the 1977 BRIT Awards, she won the award for the best classical soloist album of the past 25 years for Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto.

After her death, a rose cultivar named after her received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. She was made an honorary fellow of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, whose music building bears her name.

There is a blue plaque celebrating her memory at her former home, 27 Upper Montagu Street, Marylebone.

In 2012, she was voted into the first &quot;Gramophone&quot; Hall of Fame.

<text>National parks in Thailand () are defined as areas that contain &quot;natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or flora and fauna of special importance&quot;. Thailand&#x27;s protected areas included 156 national parks, 58 wildlife sanctuaries, 67 non-hunting areas, and 120 forest parks. They cover almost 31 percent of the kingdom&#x27;s territory.

The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP), of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE). The department was created in 2002, and took over the national parks from the Royal Forest Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.

The first national park was Khao Yai in 1961, when the &quot;National Park Act B.E. 2504&quot; was passed. The first marine park was Khao Sam Roi Yot, established in 1966. In 1993 the administration of the national parks was split into two divisions, one for the terrestrial and one for the Marine National Park Division (MNPD).

Controversies about Thailand&#x27;s national parks include complaints over excessive development and allotment of private concessions. Ko Samet, and other island-based national parks, are particularly impacted by the activities of private concessions, often in the form of excessive bungalow developments. Many of the northern parks are greatly impacted by illegal swidden farming and poaching.

<doc id="207820" wikidata="Q368442" url="?curid=207820" title="Compact object">
<text>In astronomy, the term compact object (or compact star) refers collectively to white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. It could also include exotic stars if such hypothetical, dense bodies are confirmed to exist. All compact objects have a high mass relative to their radius, giving them a very high density, compared to ordinary atomic matter.

Compact objects are often the endpoints of stellar evolution and, in this respect, are also called stellar remnants. They can also be called dead stars in public communications. The state and type of a stellar remnant depends primarily on the mass of the star that it formed from. The ambiguous term &quot;compact object&quot; is often used when the exact nature of the star is not known, but evidence suggests that it has a very small radius compared to ordinary stars. A compact object that is not a black hole may be called a degenerate star.

In June 2020, astronomers reported narrowing down the source of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which may now plausibly include &quot;compact-object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core collapse supernovae&quot;.

== Formation ==
The usual endpoint of stellar evolution is the formation of a compact star.

All active stars will eventually come to a point in their evolution when the outward radiation pressure from the nuclear fusions in its interior can no longer resist the ever-present gravitational forces. When this happens, the star collapses under its own weight and undergoes the process of stellar death. For most stars, this will result in the formation of a very dense and compact stellar remnant, also known as a compact star.

Compact objects have no internal energy production, but will—with the exception of black holes—usually radiate for millions of years with excess heat left from the collapse itself.

According to the most recent understanding, compact stars could also form during the phase separations of the early Universe following the Big Bang. Primordial origins of known compact objects have not been determined with certainty.

==Lifetime==
Although compact objects may radiate, and thus cool off and lose energy, they do not depend on high temperatures to maintain their structure, as ordinary stars do. Barring external disturbances and proton decay, they can persist virtually forever. Black holes are however generally believed to finally evaporate from Hawking radiation after trillions of years. According to our current standard models of physical cosmology, all stars will eventually evolve into cool and dark compact stars, by the time the Universe enters the so-called degenerate era in a very distant future.

A somewhat wider definition of &quot;compact objects&quot; may include smaller solid objects such as planets, asteroids, and comets, but such usage is less common. There are a remarkable variety of stars and other clumps of hot matter, but all matter in the Universe must eventually end as dispersed cold particles or some form of compact stellar or substellar object, according to thermodynamics.

==White dwarfs==
The stars called white or degenerate dwarfs are made up mainly of degenerate matter; typically carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. White dwarfs arise from the cores of main-sequence stars and are therefore very hot when they are formed. As they cool they will redden and dim until they eventually become dark black dwarfs. White dwarfs were observed in the 19th century, but the extremely high densities and pressures they contain were not explained until the 1920s.

The equation of state for degenerate matter is &quot;soft&quot;, meaning that adding more mass will result in a smaller object. Continuing to add mass to what begins as a white dwarf, the object shrinks and the central density becomes even greater, with higher degenerate-electron energies. After the degenerate star&#x27;s mass has grown sufficiently that its radius has shrunk to only a few thousand kilometers, the mass will be approaching the Chandrasekhar limit – the theoretical upper limit of the mass of a white dwarf, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun ().

If matter were removed from the center of a white dwarf and slowly compressed, electrons would first be forced to combine with nuclei, changing their protons to neutrons by inverse beta decay. The equilibrium would shift towards heavier, neutron-richer nuclei that are not stable at everyday densities. As the density increases, these nuclei become still larger and less well-bound. At a critical density of about 4 kg/m3 – called the neutron drip line – the atomic nucleus would tend to dissolve into unbound protons and neutrons. If further compressed, eventually it would reach a point where the matter is on the order of the density of an atomic nucleus – about 2 kg/m3. At that density the matter would be chiefly free neutrons, with a light scattering of protons and electrons.

==Neutron stars==

In certain binary stars containing a white dwarf, mass is transferred from the companion star onto the white dwarf, eventually pushing it over the Chandrasekhar limit. Electrons react with protons to form neutrons and thus no longer supply the necessary pressure to resist gravity, causing the star to collapse. If the center of the star is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen then such a gravitational collapse will ignite runaway fusion of the carbon and oxygen, resulting in a Type Ia supernova that entirely blows apart the star before the collapse can become irreversible. If the center is composed mostly of magnesium or heavier elements, the collapse continues. As the density further increases, the remaining electrons react with the protons to form more neutrons. The collapse continues until (at higher density) the neutrons become degenerate. A new equilibrium is possible after the star shrinks by three orders of magnitude, to a radius between 10 and 20 km. This is a &quot;neutron star&quot;.

Although the first neutron star was not observed until 1967 when the first radio pulsar was discovered, neutron stars were proposed by Baade and Zwicky in 1933, only one year after the neutron was discovered in 1932. They realized that because neutron stars are so dense, the collapse of an ordinary star to a neutron star would liberate a large amount of gravitational potential energy, providing a possible explanation for supernovae. This is the explanation for supernovae of types Ib, Ic, and II. Such supernovae occur when the iron core of a massive star exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit and collapses to a neutron star.

Like electrons, neutrons are fermions. They therefore provide neutron degeneracy pressure to support a neutron star against collapse. In addition, repulsive neutron-neutron interactions provide additional pressure. Like the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs, there is a limiting mass for neutron stars: the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, where these forces are no longer sufficient to hold up the star. As the forces in dense hadronic matter are not well understood, this limit is not known exactly but is thought to be between 2 and . If more mass accretes onto a neutron star, eventually this mass limit will be reached. What happens next is not completely clear.

==Black holes==
As more mass is accumulated, equilibrium against gravitational collapse exceeds its breaking point. Once the star&#x27;s pressure is insufficient to counterbalance gravity, a catastrophic gravitational collapse occurs within milliseconds. The escape velocity at the surface, already at least  light speed, quickly reaches the velocity of light. At that point no energy or matter can escape and a black hole has formed. Because all light and matter is trapped within an event horizon, a black hole appears truly black, except for the possibility of very faint Hawking radiation. It is presumed that the collapse will continue inside the event horizon.

In the classical theory of general relativity, a gravitational singularity occupying no more than a point will form. There may be a new halt of the catastrophic gravitational collapse at a size comparable to the Planck length, but at these lengths there is no known theory of gravity to predict what will happen. Adding any extra mass to the black hole will cause the radius of the event horizon to increase linearly with the mass of the central singularity. This will induce certain changes in the properties of the black hole, such as reducing the tidal stress near the event horizon, and reducing the gravitational field strength at the horizon. However, there will not be any further qualitative changes in the structure associated with any mass increase.

==Exotic stars==

An &quot;exotic star&quot; is a hypothetical compact star composed of something other than electrons, protons, and neutrons balanced against gravitational collapse by degeneracy pressure or other quantum properties. These include strange stars (composed of strange matter) and the more speculative preon stars (composed of preons).

Exotic stars are hypothetical, but observations released by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory on April 10, 2002, detected two candidate strange stars, designated RX J1856.5-3754 and 3C58, which had previously been thought to be neutron stars. Based on the known laws of physics, the former appeared much smaller and the latter much colder than they should, suggesting that they are composed of material denser than neutronium. However, these observations are met with skepticism by researchers who say the results were not conclusive.

===Quark stars and strange stars===

If neutrons are squeezed enough at a high temperature, they will decompose into their component quarks, forming what is known as a quark matter. In this case, the star will shrink further and become denser, but instead of a total collapse into a black hole, it is possible that the star may stabilize itself and survive in this state indefinitely, so long as no more mass is added. It has, to an extent, become a very large nucleon. A star in this hypothetical state is called a &quot;quark star&quot; or more specifically a &quot;strange star&quot;. The pulsar 3C58 has been suggested as a possible quark star. Most neutron stars are thought to hold a core of quark matter but this has proven difficult to determine observationally.

===Preon stars===
A &quot;preon star&quot; is a proposed type of compact star made of preons, a group of hypothetical subatomic particles. Preon stars would be expected to have huge densities, exceeding 1023 kilogram per cubic meter – intermediate between quark stars and black holes.
Preon stars could originate from supernova explosions or the Big Bang; however, current observations from particle accelerators speak against the existence of preons.

===Q stars===

&quot;Q stars&quot; are hypothetical compact, heavier neutron stars with an exotic state of matter where particle numbers are preserved with radii less than 1.5 times the corresponding Schwarzschild radius. Q stars are also called &quot;gray holes&quot;.

===Electroweak stars===

An &quot;electroweak star&quot; is a theoretical type of exotic star, whereby the gravitational collapse of the star is prevented by radiation pressure resulting from electroweak burning, that is, the energy released by conversion of quarks to leptons through the electroweak force. This process occurs in a volume at the star&#x27;s core approximately the size of an apple, containing about two Earth masses.

===Boson star===
A boson star is a hypothetical astronomical object that is formed out of particles called bosons (conventional stars are formed out of fermions). For this type of star to exist, there must be a stable type of boson with repulsive self-interaction. As of 2016 there is no significant evidence that such a star exists. However, it may become possible to detect them by the gravitational radiation emitted by a pair of co-orbiting boson stars.

==Compact relativistic objects and the generalized uncertainty principle==
Based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), proposed by some approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory and doubly special relativity, the effect of GUP on the thermodynamic properties of compact stars with two different components has been studied recently. Tawfik et al. noted that the existence of quantum gravity correction tends to resist the collapse of stars if the GUP parameter is taking values between Planck scale and electroweak scale. Comparing with other approaches, it was found that the radii of compact stars should be smaller and increasing energy decreases the radii of the compact stars.

<text>Interliner is an express bus system in the Netherlands. In this country the backbone of medium and long distance public transport is the railroad system. Long distance buses are used complementarily. While most bus lines have many stops or only span small distances (e.g. within cities), Interliner buses travel longer distances with fewer stops, to cover itineraries not served by train, either because the destination is not on the railroad system, or because travel by train would require a considerable detour. 

The Interliner was introduced in 1994 and many different Dutch public companies used this name for express buses.

As of 2009, uniformity has been abandoned with part of the system being renamed Q-Liner (Arriva) and a distinction between grey and green interliner. Only Connexxion still uses the name Interliner. Other variations of the name have been introduced like &quot;Hanzeliner&quot; (Connexxion) and &quot;Brabantliner&quot; (Veolia Transport).

For example they connect:
*North Holland to the northeast using the Afsluitdijk
*Rotterdam to three islands (Zeeland) in the southwest using a tunnel, two dams and a bridge
*Drachten (which is not connected by a railroad)
*Lelystad to the north through the Noordoostpolder to Groningen and to Zwolle
*Groningen to Emmen.

<doc id="207832" wikidata="Q2469966" url="?curid=207832" title="Black sea bass">
<text>The black sea bass (Centropristis striata) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a sea bass from the subfamily Serraninae which is part of the family Serranidae, which also includes the groupers and anthias. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, where it is an important species for commercial and recreational fisheries.

==Description==
The black sea bass has an oblong, laterally compressed body. It has a large mouth, armed with bands of teeth on the jaw and with a triangular patch of teeth in the front part roof of the mouth and more teeth along the sides of that area, the mouth extending as far as below the middle of the eye. The preopercle has fine serrations on its margin and is evenly rounded, while the gill cover bears three flat spines. The dorsal fin has ten spines, the front spines being longer than the rearmost, and 11 soft rays. The membranes between the spines of the dorsal fin are deeply notched. The anal fin has three spines and seven soft rays. The caudal fin has three lobes created by the long and pointed upper, middle and lower rays. The colour pattern is normally smoky grey, dusky brown or blue-black on the back and upper body, fading towards the underside. In the middle of each scale there is a pale blue to white spot and these form longitudinal stripes along the back and flanks. The dorsal fin has a series of white spots and bands along its length. The flanks can frequently appear mottled or have dark and light vertical barring. In the breeding season the males develop bright fluorescent blue and green around the eyes and nape and a hump on the head contrasting with the paler and duller females which are brownish or blue-grey in colour. The juveniles are found in four colour phases; the first is an overall light grey phase which has small dark spots, there is a dark phase which has pale white spots, a striped phase with a longitudinal dark stripe and a barred phase which has six vertical bars. This species attains a maximum total length of , however they are normally found at a total length of around , and a maximum published weight of .

==Distribution==
The black sea bass is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia south along the eastern coast of North America as far as the Florida Keys and into the Gulf of Mexico as far as Louisiana where the western limit is just to the west of the Mississippi Delta.

==Habitat and biology==
The black sea bass is commonly found in the vicinity of rock jetties and over rocky substrates in shallow water, although they have also been recorded in deeper, offshore waters to depths of . They spend most of their time near the bottom where they frequently aggregate around features on the bottom such as piles of rocks, wrecks and man-made structures. It is often encountered resting in either a head-down or head-up position. Normally the dorsal fin is folded down but will be raised and spread out as an aggressive signal to other members of its own species. The juveniles remain in the protected estuarine waters where they are found around man-made structures, wrecks and over shell substrates. This species is a slow growing fish and they reach sexual maturity at between one and three years old. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, the majority of them begin life as females and then change to males. The stimulus for the change is not known but it is thought that the largest females change sex in response to a shortage of males within a spawning group. These fishes spawn from January to July with the smaller females producing as few as 30,000 eggs while the larger females can produce 500,000 eggs. Their eggs are pelagic and have a diameter of 0.9-1.0mm. They hatch 75 hours after laying, in water temperatures of . The larvae are pelagic until they grow to around in length when they change to a demersal or estuarine habit. They are a predatory species with a rather catholic diet which includes crabs, shrimps, barnacles, worms, tunicates, small fish and bivalves. They are also preyed on by larger fish and their known predators include monkfish (&quot;Lophius americanus&quot;), spotted hake (&quot;Urophycis regia&quot;), summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), bluefish (&quot;Pomatomus saltatrix&quot;), weakfish (&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot;), little skate (&quot;Leucoraja erinacea&quot;), spiny dogfish (&quot;Squalus acanthias&quot;), bignose shark (&quot;Carcharhinus altimus&quot;) and dusky shark (&quot;Carcharhinus obscurus&quot;). Females live to around 8 years of age while males can live to 12 years old.

==Taxonomy==
The black sea bass was first formally described as &quot;Labrus striatus&quot; by Carolus Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1758, Linnaeus gave the type locality as America. When the French anatomist and zoologist Georges Cuvier created the genus &quot;Centropristis&quot; he used Bloch and Schneider&#x27;s 1801 &quot;Coryphaenus nigrescens&quot; as the type species for the new genus, this is a synonym of Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Labrus striatus&quot; so the black sea bass is the type species of the genus &quot;Centropristis&quot;. The generic name is a compound of the Greek words &quot;kentron&quot; meaning &quot;sting&quot; and &quot;pristis&quot; which means &quot;saw&quot;.

==Utilisation==
Black sea bass are highly sought after by recreational and commercial fisherman, There are two populations identified for fisheries management. NOAA Fisheries, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission cooperate in the management of the black sea bass fishery in the seas north of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina while NOAA Fisheries and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council manage the fishery south of Cape Hatteras. Management includes catch limits, permits and a close season. This species has lean, white flesh which has a relatively firm texture, breaks into small flakes and has a delicate flavour. These small size of most of the fish available means that they are often cooked whole. They are caught using otter trawls, hook and line and in pots or traps. They have shown some promise in aquaculture but have not been farmed commercially yet. In sheltered environments the black sea bass can attain a high growth rate but this does not lead to long-term survival of their populations.

<doc id="207833" wikidata="Q240105" url="?curid=207833" title="Radial velocity">
<text>The radial velocity or line-of-sight velocity of a target with respect to an observer is the rate of change of the vector displacement between the two points. It is formulated as the vector projection of the target-observer relative velocity onto the relative direction or line-of-sight (LOS) connecting the two points. 

The radial speed or range rate is the temporal rate of the distance or range between the two points. It is a signed scalar quantity, formulated as the scalar projection of the relative velocity vector onto the LOS direction. Equivalently, radial speed equals the norm of the radial velocity, modulo the sign.

In astronomy, the point is usually taken to be the observer on Earth, so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from the Earth (or approaches it, for a negative radial velocity).

==Formulation==

Given a differentiable vector formula_1 defining the instantaneous relative position of a target with respect to an observer.

Let the instantaneous relative velocity of the target with respect to the observer be

The magnitude of the position vector formula_2 is defined as in terms of the inner product

The quantity range rate is the time derivative of the magnitude (norm) of formula_2, expressed as

Substituting () into ()

: formula_4

Evaluating the derivative of the right-hand-side by the chain rule

: formula_5

: formula_6

using () the expression becomes

: formula_7

By reciprocity, formula_8.
Defining the unit relative position vector formula_9 (or LOS direction), 
the range rate is simply expressed as

: formula_10

i.e., the projection of the relative velocity vector onto the LOS direction.

Further defining the velocity direction formula_11, with 
the relative speed formula_12, we have:
: formula_13
where the inner product is either +1 or -1, for parallel and antiparallel vectors, respectively.
A singularity exists for coincident observer target, i.e., formula_14; in this case, range rate is undefined.

==Applications in astronomy==
In astronomy, radial velocity is often measured to the first order of approximation by Doppler spectroscopy. The quantity obtained by this method may be called the &quot;barycentric radial-velocity measure&quot; or spectroscopic radial velocity. However, due to relativistic and cosmological effects over the great distances that light typically travels to reach the observer from an astronomical object, this measure cannot be accurately transformed to a geometric radial velocity without additional assumptions about the object and the space between it and the observer. By contrast, &quot;astrometric radial velocity&quot; is determined by astrometric observations (for example, a secular change in the annual parallax).

===Spectroscopic radial velocity===

Light from an object with a substantial relative radial velocity at emission will be subject to the Doppler effect, so the frequency of the light decreases for objects that were receding (redshift) and increases for objects that were approaching (blueshift).

The radial velocity of a star or other luminous distant objects can be measured accurately by taking a high-resolution spectrum and comparing the measured wavelengths of known spectral lines to wavelengths from laboratory measurements. A positive radial velocity indicates the distance between the objects is or was increasing; a negative radial velocity indicates the distance between the source and observer is or was decreasing.

William Huggins ventured in 1868 to estimate the radial velocity of Sirius with respect to the Sun, based on observed redshift of the star&#x27;s light.

In many binary stars, the orbital motion usually causes radial velocity variations of several kilometres per second (km/s). As the spectra of these stars vary due to the Doppler effect, they are called spectroscopic binaries. Radial velocity can be used to estimate the ratio of the masses of the stars, and some orbital elements, such as eccentricity and semimajor axis. The same method has also been used to detect planets around stars, in the way that the movement&#x27;s measurement determines the planet&#x27;s orbital period, while the resulting radial-velocity amplitude allows the calculation of the lower bound on a planet&#x27;s mass using the binary mass function. Radial velocity methods alone may only reveal a lower bound, since a large planet orbiting at a very high angle to the line of sight will perturb its star radially as much as a much smaller planet with an orbital plane on the line of sight. It has been suggested that planets with high eccentricities calculated by this method may in fact be two-planet systems of circular or near-circular resonant orbit.

===Detection of exoplanets===
The radial velocity method to detect exoplanets is based on the detection of variations in the velocity of the central star, due to the changing direction of the gravitational pull from an (unseen) exoplanet as it orbits the star. When the star moves towards us, its spectrum is blueshifted, while it is redshifted when it moves away from us. By regularly looking at the spectrum of a star—and so, measuring its velocity—it can be determined if it moves periodically due to the influence of an exoplanet companion.

===Data reduction===
From the instrumental perspective, velocities are measured relative to the telescope&#x27;s motion. So an important first step of the data reduction is to remove the contributions of
*the Earth&#x27;s elliptic motion around the Sun at approximately ± 30 km/s,
*a monthly rotation of ± 13 m/s of the Earth around the center of gravity of the Earth-Moon system,
*the daily rotation of the telescope with the Earth crust around the Earth axis, which is up to ±460 m/s at the equator and proportional to the cosine of the telescope&#x27;s geographic latitude,
*small contributions from the Earth polar motion at the level of mm/s,
*contributions of 230 km/s from the motion around the Galactic Center and associated proper motions.
*in the case of spectroscopic measurements corrections of the order of ±20 cm/s with respect to aberration.
*Sin i degeneracy is the impact caused by not being in the plane of the motion.

<text>Iberodon is a small, extinct mammal of the Lower Cretaceous from Portugal. It was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, and led its obscure and plant-eating existence in the company of dinosaurs. It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Pinheirodontidae.

The genus &quot;Iberodon&quot; was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1999 based on a single species. The species, known as &quot;Iberodon quadrituberculatus&quot;, is known from teeth found in Berriasian (Lower Cretaceous)-age strata of Portugal.

<doc id="207840" wikidata="Q271226" url="?curid=207840" title="Donella Meadows">
<text>Donella Hager &quot;Dana&quot; Meadows (March 13, 1941 – February 20, 2001) was an American environmental scientist, educator, and writer. She is best known as lead author of the books &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; and &quot;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Elgin, Illinois, Meadows was educated in science, receiving a B.A. in chemistry from Carleton College in 1963 and a PhD in biophysics from Harvard in 1968. After a yearlong trip from England to Sri Lanka and back, she became a research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a member of a team in the department created by Jay Forrester, the inventor of system dynamics as well as the principle of magnetic data storage for computers.

== Career ==
Meadows taught at Dartmouth College for 29 years, beginning in 1972.

She was honored both as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and Environment (1991) and as a MacArthur Fellow (1994). She received the Walter C. Paine Science Education Award in 1990. Posthumously, she received the John H. Chafee Excellence in Environmental Affairs Award for 2001, presented by the Conservation Law Foundation.

Meadows wrote &quot;The Global Citizen,&quot; a weekly column on world events from a systems point of view. Many of these columns were compiled and published as a book of the same name. Her work is recognized as a formative influence on hundreds of other academic studies, government policy initiatives, and international agreements.

She was a longtime member of the United States Association for the Club of Rome, which instituted an award in her memory, the US Association for the Club of Rome Donella Meadows Award in Sustainable Global Actions. The award is given to an outstanding individual who has created actions in a global framework toward the sustainability goals Meadows expressed in her writings.

== Work ==

=== &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; ===
In 1972, Meadows was on the MIT team that produced the global computer model &quot;World3&quot; for the Club of Rome, providing the basis for &quot;The Limits to Growth.&quot; The book reported a study of long-term global trends in population, economics, and the environment. The book made headlines around the world and began a debate about the limits of Earth&#x27;s capacity to support human economic expansion—a debate that continues to this day. Meadows was the book&#x27;s lead author, and it had three coauthors: her husband Dennis Meadows, Jørgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III.

===The Balaton Group===
In 1982, Donella and Dennis Meadows created an international &quot;network of networks&quot; for leading researchers on resource use, environmental conservation, systems modeling, and sustainability. Since its foundation, the members have met at Lake Balaton, Hungary, every autumn. While the formal name for the network was the International Network of Resource Information Centres (INRIC), it became more popularly known as the Balaton Group, after the location of its meetings.

=== The Academy for Systems Change ===
Meadows founded the Sustainability Institute in 1996, which combined research in global systems with practical demonstrations of sustainable living, including the development of a cohousing (or ecovillage) and organic farm at Cobb Hill in Hartland, Vermont. In 2011, the Sustainability Institute, originally adjacent to Cobb Hill, was renamed the Donella Meadows Institute and moved to Norwich, Vermont. Additional organizations that sprang from the Sustainability Institute include Sustainable Food Lab, Climate Interactive, and Sustainability Leaders Network. In 2016, the Donella Meadows Institute was renamed for a second time, and now operates as the Academy for Systems Change: https://www.academyforchange.org

=== State of the Village report ===
In 1990, Meadows published the State of the Village report under the title, &quot;Who lives in the &#x27;Global Village&#x27;?&quot; which likened the world to a village of 1,000 people. Since then, &quot;If the world were a village of 100 people&quot;, derived from her work but further reducing the numbers to those of a village of 100 people, has been published by others in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

=== Twelve leverage points ===

Meadows published &quot;Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System&quot;, one of her best-known essays, in 1999. It describes the most and least effective types of interventions in a system (of any kind).

== Personal life ==
Meadows died of cerebral meningitis in 2001 at the age of 59.

<doc id="207843" wikidata="Q76948" url="?curid=207843" title="Caroline Herschel">
<text>Caroline Lucretia Herschel ( , ; 16 March 1750 – 9 January 1848) was a German astronomer, whose most significant contributions to astronomy were the discoveries of several comets, including the periodic comet 35P/Herschel–Rigollet, which bears her name. She was the younger sister of astronomer William Herschel, with whom she worked throughout her career.

She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist and the first woman in England to hold a government position. She was also the first woman to publish scientific findings in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society, to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846).

==Early life==
Caroline Lucretia Herschel was born in the town of Hanover Germany on 16 March 1750. She was the eighth child and fourth daughter of Isaak Herschel (1707–1767), a self-taught oboist, and his wife, Anna Ilse Moritzen (1710–1789). The Herschel family originated from Pirna in Saxony, near Dresden. Isaak became a bandmaster in the Hanoverian Foot Guards, whom he first joined in 1731, and was away with his regiment for substantial periods. He became ill after the Battle of Dettingen (in the War of the Austrian Succession) in 1743 and never recovered fully; he suffered a weak constitution, chronic pain, and asthma for the remainder of his life. The oldest of their daughters, Sophia Elizabeth Herschel (1733–1803), was sixteen years older, and the only surviving girl besides Caroline. She married violinist Johann Heinrich Griesbach (1730–1773) when Caroline was five, which resulted in the younger girl being tasked with much of the household drudgery. Caroline and the other children received a cursory education, learning to read and write and little more. Her father attempted to educate her at home but his efforts were more successful with the boys.

At the age of ten Caroline was struck with a severe case of typhus, which so stunted her growth that she never grew more than tall; she also lost vision in her left eye as a result of the illness. Her family assumed that she would never marry and her mother thought better that she train to be a house servant than be educated in accordance with her father&#x27;s wishes. However, her father sometimes took advantage of her mother&#x27;s absence by tutoring her individually, or including her in her brother&#x27;s lessons, such as violin. Caroline was briefly allowed to learn dress-making. Though she learned to do needlework from a neighbour, her efforts were stymied by long hours of household chores. To prevent her from becoming a governess and earning her independence that way, she was forbidden to learn French or more advanced needlework than what she could pick up from neighbours.

Following her father&#x27;s death, her brothers William and Alexander proposed that she join them in Bath, England, to have a trial period as a singer for musician brother William&#x27;s church performances. Caroline eventually left Hanover on 15 August 1772 after her brothers intervened with their recalcitrant mother. On the journey to England, she was first introduced to astronomy by way of the constellations and opticians&#x27; shops.

In Bath, she took on the responsibilities of running William&#x27;s household, and began learning to sing. William had established himself as an organist and music teacher at 19 New King Street, Bath (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy). He was also the choirmaster of the Octagon Chapel. William was busy with his musical career and became fairly busy organising public concerts.

Caroline did not blend into the local society and made few friends, but was finally able to indulge her desire to learn, and took regular singing, English, and arithmetic lessons from her brother, and dance lessons from a local teacher. She also learned to play the harpsichord, and eventually became an integral part in William&#x27;s musical performances at small gatherings. She became the principal singer at his oratorio concerts, and acquired such a reputation as a vocalist that she was offered an engagement for the Birmingham festival after a performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in April 1778, where she was the first soloist. She declined to sing for any conductor but William, and after that performance, her career as a singer began to decline. Caroline was subsequently replaced as a performer by distinguished soloists from outside the area because William wished to spend less time in rehearsals to focus on astronomy.

==Transition to astronomy==
When William became increasingly interested in astronomy, transforming himself from a musician to an astronomer, Caroline again supported his efforts. She said somewhat bitterly, in her Memoir, &quot;I did nothing for my brother but what a well-trained puppy dog would have done, that is to say, I did what he commanded me.&quot; Ultimately, though, she became interested in astronomy and enjoyed her work.

In the 1770s, as William became more interested in astronomy, he started to build his own telescopes from lenses he had ground, unhappy with the quality of lenses he was able to purchase. Caroline would feed him and read to him as he worked, despite her desire to burnish her career as a professional singer.

She became a significant astronomer in her own right as a result of her collaboration with him. The Herschels moved to a new house in March 1781 after their millinery business failed, and Caroline was guarding the leftover stock on 13 March, the night that William discovered the planet Uranus. Though he mistook it for a comet, his discovery proved the superiority of his new telescope. Caroline and William gave their last musical performance in 1782, when her brother accepted the private office of court astronomer to King George III; the last few months of their musical career had been in shambles and were critically panned.

==Astronomical career==

===First discoveries and catalogue===

William&#x27;s interest in astronomy started as a hobby to pass time at night. At breakfast the next day he would give an impromptu lecture on what he had learned the night before. Caroline became as interested as William, stating that she was &quot;much hindered in my practice by my help being continually wanted in the execution of the various astronomical contrivances.&quot; William became known for his work on high performance telescopes, and Caroline found herself supporting his efforts. Caroline spent many hours polishing mirrors and mounting telescopes in order to maximize the amount of light captured. She learned to copy astronomical catalogues and other publications that William had borrowed. She also learned to record, reduce, and organize her brother&#x27;s astronomical observations. She recognized that this work demanded speed, precision and accuracy.

Caroline was asked to move from the high culture of Bath to the relative backwater of Datchet in 1782, a small town near Windsor Castle where William would be on hand to entertain royal guests. He presumed that Caroline would become his assistant, a role she did not initially accept. She was unhappy with the accommodations they had taken; the house they rented for three years had a leaky ceiling and Caroline described it as &quot;the ruins of a place&quot;. She was also aghast at the prices in the city and the fact that their domestic servant was imprisoned for theft at the time of her arrival. While William worked on a catalogue of 3,000 stars, studied double stars, and attempted to discover the cause of Mira&#x27;s and Algol&#x27;s variability, Caroline was asked to &quot;sweep&quot; the sky, meticulously moving through the sky in strips to search for interesting objects. She was unhappy with this task at the beginning of her work, longing for the culture of Bath and feeling isolated and lonely, but gradually developed a love for the work.

On 28 August 1782, Caroline initiated her first record book. She inscribed the first three opening pages: &quot;This is what I call the Bills &amp; Rec.ds of my Comets&quot;, &quot;Comets and Letters&quot;, and &quot;Books of Observations&quot;. This, along with two subsequent books, currently belong to the Herschel trove at the Royal Astronomical Society in London.

On 26 February 1783, Caroline made her first discovery: she had found a nebula that was not included in the Messier catalogue. That same night, she independently discovered Messier 110 (NGC 205), the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. William then began to search himself for nebulae, sensing that there were many discoveries to be made. Caroline was relegated to a ladder on William&#x27;s 20-foot reflector, attempting impossible measurements of double stars. William quickly realized his method of searching for nebulae was inefficient and he required an assistant to keep records. Naturally, he turned to Caroline.

In the summer of 1783, William finished building a comet-searching telescope for Caroline, which she began to use immediately. Beginning in October 1783, the Herschels used a 20-foot reflecting telescope to search for nebulae. Initially, William attempted to both observe and record objects, but this too was inefficient and he again turned to Caroline. She sat by a window inside, William shouted his observations, and Caroline recorded. This was not a simple clerical task, however, because she would have to use John Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue to identify the star William used as a reference point for the nebulae. In 1798 Caroline presented to the Royal Society an index to John Flamsteed&#x27;s observations, together with a catalog of 560 stars omitted from the &quot;British Catalogue&quot; and a list of the errata in that publication. Because Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue was organized by constellation, it was less useful to the Herschels, so Caroline created her own catalogue organized by north polar distance. The following morning, Caroline would go over her notes and write up formal observations, which she called &quot;minding the heavens.&quot;

===Comets===

During 1786–1797 she discovered eight comets, the first on 1 August 1786 while her brother was away and she was using his telescope. She had unquestioned priority as discoverer of five of the comets and rediscovered Comet Encke in 1795. Five of her comets were published in Philosophical Transactions. A packet of paper bearing the superscription, &quot;This is what I call the Bills and Receipts of my Comets&quot; contains some data connected with the discovery of each of these objects. William was summoned to Windsor Castle to demonstrate Caroline&#x27;s comet to the royal family. William recorded this phenomenon, himself, terming it &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Comet.&quot; Caroline Herschel is often credited as the first woman to discover a comet; however, Maria Kirch discovered a comet in the early 1700s, but is often overlooked because at the time, the discovery was attributed to her husband, Gottfried Kirch.

Caroline Herschel wrote a letter to the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne to announce the discovery of her second comet. In December 1788, Maskelyne wrote back congratulating her. The third comet was discovered on 7 January 1790, and the fourth one on 17 April 1790. She announced both of these to Sir Joseph Banks, and all were discovered with her 1783 telescope. In 1791, Caroline began to use a 9-inch telescope for her comet-searching, and discovered three more comets with this instrument. Her fifth comet was discovered on 15 December 1791 and the sixth on 7 October 1795. Caroline wrote in her journal during this time &quot;My brother wrote an account of it to Sir J. Banks, Dr. Maskelyne, and to several astronomical correspondents&quot; for the discovery of her fifth comet. Two years later, her eighth and last comet was discovered on 6 August 1797, the only comet she discovered without optical aid. She announced this discovery by sending a letter to Banks. In 1787, she was granted an annual salary of £50 (equivalent to £ in 2025) by George III for her work as William&#x27;s assistant. Caroline&#x27;s appointment made her the first woman in England honoured with an official government position, and the first woman to be paid for her work in astronomy.

In 1797 William&#x27;s observations had shown that there were a great many discrepancies in the star catalogue published by John Flamsteed, which was difficult to use because it had been published as two volumes, the catalogue proper and a volume of original observations, and contained many errors. William realised that he needed a proper cross-index to properly explore these differences but was reluctant to devote time to it at the expense of his more interesting astronomical activities. He therefore recommended to Caroline that she undertake the task, which ultimately took 20 months. The resulting &quot;Catalogue of Stars, Taken from Mr. Flamsteed&#x27;s Observations Contained in the Second Volume of the&quot; Historia Coelestis, &quot;and Not Inserted in the British Catalogue&quot; was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included. In 1825, Caroline donated the works of Flamsteed to the Royal Academy of Göttingen.

=== Relationship with William ===
Throughout her writings, she repeatedly made it clear that she desired to earn an independent wage and be able to support herself. When the crown began paying her for her assistance to her brother in 1787, she became the first woman—at a time when even men rarely received wages for scientific enterprises—to receive a salary for services to science. Her pension was £50 a year, and it was the first money that Caroline had ever earned in her own right.

When William married a rich widow, Mary Pitt (née Baldwin) in 1788, the union caused tension in the brother-sister relationship. Caroline has been referred to as a bitter, jealous woman who worshipped her brother and resented those who invaded their domestic lives.

In his book &quot;The Age of Wonder&quot;, Richard Holmes is more sympathetic to Caroline&#x27;s position, noting that the change was in many respects negative for Caroline. With the arrival of William&#x27;s wife, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household and accompanying status. She also moved from the house to external lodgings, returning daily to work with her brother. She no longer held the keys to the observatory and workroom, where she had done much of her own work. As she destroyed her journals from 1788 to 1798, her feelings about the period are not entirely known. In August 1799, Caroline was independently recognized for her work, when she spent a week in Greenwich as a guest of the royal family.

Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond indicated she and her brother continued working well during this period. When her brother and his family were away from home, she often returned there to take care of it for them. In later life, she and Lady Herschel exchanged affectionate letters, and she became deeply attached to her nephew, astronomer John Herschel.

William&#x27;s marriage likely led to Caroline becoming more independent of her brother and more a figure in her own right. Caroline made many discoveries independently of William and continued to work solo on many of the astronomical projects which contributed to her rise to fame.

===New General Catalogue===
In 1802, the Royal Society published Caroline&#x27;s catalogue in its Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A under William&#x27;s name. This listed around 500 new nebulae and clusters to the already known 2,000.

Toward the end of Caroline&#x27;s life, she arranged 2,500 nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances so that her nephew, John Herschel, could re-examine them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number.

== Later life and legacy ==

After her brother died in 1822, Caroline was grief-stricken and moved back to Hanover, Germany, continuing her astronomical studies to verify and confirm William&#x27;s findings and producing a catalogue of nebulae to assist her nephew John Herschel in his work. Her nephew thought highly of her, in fact he was quoted in 1832 as saying “She runs about the town with me and skips up her two flights of stairs as wonderfully fresh at least as some folks I could name who are not a fourth of her age… In the morning till eleven or twelve she is dull and weary, but as the day advances she gains life, and is quite ‘fresh and funny’ at ten or eleven p.m. and sings old rhymes, nay, even dances to the great delight of all who see her.&quot; John Herschel spent long periods with his aunt during the vacations and was greatly influenced by Caroline. She saw him educated at Cambridge, make a name for himself as a mathematician, become elected to the Royal Society, join his father in research in astronomy and be awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for his achievements. Caroline continued to assist William with his observations but her status had greatly improved from the housekeeper she had been in her young days. She was the guest of Maskelyne at the Royal Observatory in 1799 and a guest of members of the Royal Family at various times in 1816, 1817 and 1818. However, her observations were hampered by the architecture in Hanover, and she spent most of her time working on the catalogue. In 1828 the Royal Astronomical Society presented her with their Gold Medal for this work—no woman would be awarded it again until Vera Rubin in 1996. Upon William&#x27;s death, her nephew, John Herschel, took over observing at Slough. Caroline had given him his first introduction into astronomy, when she showed him the constellations in Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Atlas.&quot; Caroline added her final entry to her observing book on 31 January 1824 about the Great Comet of 1823, which had already been discovered on 29 December 1823. Throughout the twilight of her life, Caroline remained physically active and healthy, and regularly socialized with other scientific luminaries. She spent her last years writing her memoirs and lamenting her body&#x27;s limitations, which kept her from making any more original discoveries.

Caroline Herschel died peacefully in Hanover on 9 January 1848. She is buried at 35 Marienstrasse in Hanover at the cemetery of the Gartengemeinde, next to her parents and with a lock of William&#x27;s hair. Her tombstone inscription reads, &quot;The eyes of her who is glorified here below turned to the starry heavens.&quot; With her brother, she discovered over 2,400 astronomical objects over twenty years.

==Honours==
Herschel was honoured by the King of Prussia and the Royal Astronomical Society. The gold medal from the Astronomical Society was awarded to her in 1828 &quot;for her recent reduction, to January, 1800, of the [2,500] Nebulæ discovered by her illustrious brother, which may be considered as the completion of a series of exertions probably unparalleled either in magnitude or importance in the annals of astronomical labour.&quot; She completed this work after her brother&#x27;s death and her move to Hanover.

The Royal Astronomical Society elected her an honorary member in 1835, along with Mary Somerville; they were the first female members. She was also elected as an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin in 1838.

In 1846, at the age of 96, she was awarded a Gold Medal for Science by the King of Prussia, conveyed to her by Alexander von Humboldt, &quot;in recognition of the valuable services rendered to Astronomy by you, as the fellow-worker of your immortal brother, Sir William Herschel, by discoveries, observations, and laborious calculations&quot;.

The asteroid 281 Lucretia (discovered 1888) was named after Caroline&#x27;s second given name, and the crater C. Herschel on the Moon is named after her. The open clusters NGC 2360 (Caroline&#x27;s Cluster) and NGC 7789 (Caroline&#x27;s Rose) are unofficially nicknamed in her honour. On 6 November 2020, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 10 or &quot;Caroline&quot;, COSPAR 2020-079B) was launched into space.

Adrienne Rich&#x27;s 1968 poem &quot;Planetarium&quot; celebrates Caroline Herschel&#x27;s life and scientific achievements. Judy Chicago&#x27;s 1969 artwork &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, which celebrates historical women who have made extraordinary contributions, features a place setting for Caroline Herschel. Google honoured her with a Google Doodle on her 266th birthday (16 March 2016).

In 2023, the 57 densely handwritten pages of her diary were put on display in the music room of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy in Bath, the same place that Herschel resided. The documents cost the museum £108,000, making it by far the institution&#x27;s most expensive acquisition. Her earned salary from King George III made her the first known professional female astronomer. The diary documents her life in the years 1755 to 1775, the years of Herschel&#x27;s childhood in Hanover that included a large family which produced an ample number of musicians, and leading up to her first years living in Bath.

In 2024, UK musician and singer-songwriter Jay Anderson released the single &#x27;Moving&#x27; on Real Kind Records, a song dedicated to the life and times of Caroline Herschel. He filmed a live acoustic version of the song at The Herschel Museum in Bath, sat in the old music room where Caroline and her brother used to rehearse for local concerts.
