<text>15 (fifteen) is the natural number following 14 and preceding 16.

==Mathematics==


15 is:
* The eighth composite number and the sixth semiprime and the first odd and fourth discrete semiprime; its proper divisors are , , and , so the first of the form (3.q), where q is a higher prime.
* a deficient number, a lucky number, a bell number (i.e., the number of partitions for a set of size 4), a pentatope number, and a repdigit in binary (1111) and quaternary (33). In hexadecimal, and higher bases, it is represented as F.
* with an aliquot sum of 9; within an aliquot sequence of three composite numbers (15,9,4,3,1,0) to the Prime in the 3-aliquot tree.
* the second member of the first cluster of two discrete semiprimes (14, 15); the next such cluster is (21, 22).
* the first number to be polygonal in 3 ways: it is the 5th triangular number, a hexagonal number, and pentadecagonal number.
* a centered tetrahedral number.
* the number of partitions of 7.
* the smallest number that can be factorized using Shor&#x27;s quantum algorithm.
* the magic constant of the unique order-3 normal magic square.
* the number of supersingular primes.
* the smallest positive number that can be expressed as the difference of two positive squares in more than one way: formula_1 or formula_2 (see image).

Furthermore,

* 15&#x27;s prime factors, (3 and 5), form the first twin-prime pair.
*The first 15 superabundant numbers are the same as the first 15 colossally abundant numbers.
* In decimal, 15 contains the digits 1 and 5 and is the result of adding together the integers from 1 to 5 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15). The only other number with this property (in decimal) is 27.
* There are 15 truncatable primes that are both right-truncatable and left-truncatable: 
:2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 37, 53, 73, 313, 317, 373, 797, 3137, 3797, 739397 
* There are 15 perfect matchings of the complete graph &quot;K&quot;6 and 15 rooted binary trees with four labeled leaves, both of these being among the types of objects counted by double factorials.
* With only two exceptions, all prime quadruplets enclose a multiple of 15, with 15 itself being enclosed by the quadruplet (11, 13, 17, 19).
* If a positive definite quadratic form with integer matrix represents all positive integers up to 15, then it represents all positive integers via the 15 and 290 theorems.
* 15 is the product of distinct Fermat primes, 3 and 5; hence, a regular pentadecagon is constructible with a compass and unmarked straightedge, and formula_3 is expressible in terms of square roots.
* There are 15 monohedral convex pentagonal tilings, with eight being edge-to-edge.
* There are 15 regular and semiregular tilings when infinite (improper) apeirogonal forms are counted: three are regular (with one self-dual), eight are semiregular (with one chiral), and four are apeirogonal (from a total of 8, in-which 4 are duplicates). 
* Full icosahedral symmetry contains 15 mirror planes (2-fold axes). Specifically, the symmetry order for both the regular icosahedron and regular dodecahedron (which is made of regular pentagons) is 120: equal to sum of the first 15 integers, and the factorial of 5, wherein the sum of the first 5 integers itself is 15. Expressed mathematically:
*: formula_4, while formula_5, and formula_6.
* There are 15 Archimedean solids and 15 Catalan solids when enantiomorphic forms are counted separately.
* There are 15 regular honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space: four are compact, and 11 are paracompact.
* It is the smallest non-trivial Surprise Number. When 15 is partitioned into 2 parts of digits- smaller part 1 and larger part 5, adding numbers from smaller 1 to larger 5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = Original Number.

==Religion==
===Sunnism===
The Hanbali Sunni madhab states that the age of fifteen of a solar or lunar calendar is when one&#x27;s taklif (obligation or responsibility) begins and is the stage whereby one has his deeds recorded.

===Judaism===
* In the Hebrew numbering system, the number 15 is not written according to the usual method, with the letters that represent &quot;10&quot; and &quot;5&quot; (י-ה, &quot;yodh&quot; and &quot;heh&quot;), because those spell out one of the Jewish names of God. Instead, the date is written with the letters representing &quot;9&quot; and &quot;6&quot; (ט-ו, &quot;teth&quot; and &quot;vav&quot;)

<text>16 (sixteen) is the natural number following 15 and preceding 17. It is the fourth power of two.

In English speech, the numbers 16 and 60 are sometimes confused, as they sound very similar.

== Mathematics ==
16 is the ninth composite number, and a square number: 42 = 4 × 4 (the first non-unitary fourth-power prime of the form &quot;p&quot;4). It is the smallest number with exactly five divisors, its proper divisors being , , and .

Sixteen is the only integer that equals &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot;&quot;m&quot;, for some unequal integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; (formula_1, formula_2, or vice versa). It has this property because formula_3. It is also equal to 32 (see tetration).

The aliquot sum of 16 is 15, within an aliquot sequence of four composite members (16, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0) that belong to the prime 3-aliquot tree. 

*Sixteen is the largest known integer , for which formula_4 is prime.
*It is the first Erdős–Woods number.
*There are 16 partially ordered sets with four unlabeled elements.

16 is the only number that can be both the perimeter and area of the same square, due to formula_5 being equal to formula_6

The sedenions form a 16-dimensional hypercomplex number system.

=== Hexadecimal ===
Sixteen is the base of the hexadecimal number system, which is used extensively in computer science.

== Technology ==
* In some computer programming languages, the size in bits of certain data types
* 16-bit computing
* A 16-bit integer can represent up to 65,536 values.
* In the 16-bit era, 16-bit microprocessor ran 16-bit applications

== Culture ==
=== As a unit of measurement ===
A low power of two, 16 was used in weighing light objects in several cultures. Early civilizations utilized the weighing scale as a means to measure mass, which made splitting resources into equal parts a simple task. In the imperial system, 16 ounces equivalates to one pound. Until the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China decreed a decimal conversion for currency in 1959, China equivalated 16 &quot;liǎng&quot; to one &quot;jīn&quot;. Chinese Taoists did finger computation on the trigrams and hexagrams by counting the finger tips and joints of the fingers with the tip of the thumb. Each hand can count up to 16 in such manner. The Chinese abacus uses two upper beads to represent the 5s and 5 lower beads to represent the 1s, the 7 beads can represent a hexadecimal digit from 0 to 15 in each column.

=== Age 16 ===
* A &quot;sweet sixteen&quot; is celebrated by many sixteen-year-old girls in the United States and Canada. It is a coming-of-age celebration that traditionally marks a girl&#x27;s transition into womanhood.
* In the United States and Canada, 16 is the most common age of sexual consent, as well as the age in the United Kingdom and several European countries. Sixteen is also the minimum age for being allowed a beginner&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license with parental consent in many US states and in Canada.

The largest number of faces a Platonic solid can have is twenty faces, which make up a regular icosahedron. A dodecahedron, on the other hand, has twenty vertices, likewise the most a regular polyhedron can have. This is because the icosahedron and dodecahdron are duals of each other.

== Other fields ==
=== Science ===
20 is the third magic number in physics.

==== Biology ====
In some countries, the number 20 is used as an index in measuring visual acuity. 20/20 indicates normal vision at 20 feet, although it is commonly used to mean &quot;perfect vision&quot; in countries using the Imperial system. (The metric equivalent is 6/6.) When someone is able to see only after an event how things turned out, that person is often said to have had &quot;20/20 hindsight&quot;

==== Psychology ====

In many disciplines of developmental psychology, adulthood starts at age 20.

=== Culture ===
==== Age 20 ====
The traditional age of majority in Japan, although the voting age has been reduced to 18. Japanese people commemorate the twentieth birthday with personal ceremonies, and it comes with a number of legal rights like the right to marry. To represent this, the Japanese language has a special word for &quot;20-years-old&quot; that does not follow the rest of their numbering system. Accordingly, the word 二十歳 is read all at once as &quot;はたち&quot; (&quot;hatachi&quot;) rather than the expected pronunciation of the three characters as &quot;にじゅうさい&quot; (&quot;nijyuusai&quot;, which is literally &quot;two,&quot; &quot;ten,&quot; and the counter for &quot;years old&quot;).

==== Number systems ====
20 is the basis for vigesimal number systems, used by several different civilizations in the past (and to this day), including the Maya.

== Indefinite number ==
A &#x27;score&#x27; is a group of twenty (often used in combination with a cardinal number, e.g. &quot;fourscore&quot; to mean 80), but also often used as an indefinite number (e.g. the newspaper headline &quot;Scores of Typhoon Survivors Flown to Manila&quot;).

<text>Main-Kinzig-Kreis is a Kreis (district) in the east of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Wetteraukreis, Vogelsbergkreis, Fulda, Bad Kissingen, Main-Spessart, Aschaffenburg, Offenbach and the district-free cities of Offenbach and Frankfurt.

==History==
The district was created in 1974 by merging the former districts of Hanau, Schlüchtern, Gelnhausen and the former urban district of Hanau. It is basically the former territory of the county of Hesse-Hanau.

==Geography==
The district is named after the two primary rivers: the Main flows along the south-west corner of the district. The Kinzig, a tributary of the Main, flows through the district.

According to the from 1 January 2007 until July 2013 the geographic centre of the European Union was located on a wheat field outside of Gelnhausen.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €34,185. This places the district 15th out of 26 districts (rural and urban) in Hesse (overall average: €45,107).

==Towns and municipalities==

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is a combination of the coat of arms of the previous districts which were merged in 1974. The swan in top comes from the defunct Hanau district, and is the old crest of the Counts of Hanau. The eagle in the left is taken from the town of Gelnhausen. The bars in the right are taken from the coat of arms of the Lords of Hutten, who owned the area around Bad Soden and Salmünster, formerly part of the defunct Schlüchtern district.

==Partnerships==
The oldest partnership was inherited from the previous district Hanau, and was formed in 1972 with the Croatian municipality of Kutina – however it took till the 20th anniversary in 1992 that this partnership was officially signed. In 1986 the district parliament decided to start a developing project with the Diriamba region in Nicaragua.

Since 1990 the district has a partnership with the Thuringian district Gotha. Also in 1990 first contacts with the Russian Rayon Istra were started, which resulted in an official partnership in 1992. In 1993 the partnership with the Hungarian Komárom-Esztergom County was signed, with the first contacts also dating back to 1990.

A friendship was signed in 1997 with the Russian city Troitsk, together with the partnership of the city Wächtersbach with Troitsk. In 2000 a treaty of friendship was signed with the Italian province Belluno, as well as a partnership with the Israeli city Ramat Gan.
Main-Kinzig-Kreis is twinned with:
* Ramat Gan, Israel since 1990
* Kutina, Croatia

<doc id="208264" wikidata="Q4928259" url="?curid=208264" title="Parabolic antenna">
<text>A parabolic antenna is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it has high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently sized reflectors can be used.

Parabolic antennas are used as high-gain antennas for point-to-point communications, in applications such as microwave relay links that carry telephone and television signals between nearby cities, wireless WAN/LAN links for data communications, satellite communications, and spacecraft communication antennas. They are also used in radio telescopes.

The other large use of parabolic antennas is for radar antennas, which need to transmit a narrow beam of radio waves to locate objects like ships, airplanes, and guided missiles. They are also often used for weather detection. With the advent of home satellite television receivers, parabolic antennas have become a common feature of the landscapes of modern countries.

The parabolic antenna was invented by German physicist Heinrich Hertz during his discovery of radio waves in 1887. He used cylindrical parabolic reflectors with spark-excited dipole antennas at their foci for both transmitting and receiving during his historic experiments.

==Design==
The operating principle of a parabolic antenna is that a point source of radio waves at the focal point in front of a paraboloidal reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the reflector. Conversely, an incoming plane wave parallel to the axis will be focused to a point at the focal point.

A typical parabolic antenna consists of a metal parabolic reflector with a small feed antenna suspended in front of the reflector at its focus, pointed back toward the reflector. The reflector is a metallic surface formed into a paraboloid of revolution and usually truncated in a circular rim that forms the diameter of the antenna. In a transmitting antenna, radio frequency current from a transmitter is supplied through a transmission line cable to the feed antenna, which converts it into radio waves. The radio waves are emitted back toward the dish by the feed antenna and reflect off the dish into a parallel beam. In a receiving antenna the incoming radio waves bounce off the dish and are focused to a point at the feed antenna, which converts them into electric currents which travel through a transmission line to the radio receiver.

===Parabolic reflector===
The reflector can be constructed from sheet metal, a metal screen, or a wire grill, and can be either a circular dish or various other shapes to create different beam shapes. A metal screen reflects radio waves as effectively as a solid metal surface if its holes are smaller than one-tenth of a wavelength, so screen reflectors are often used to reduce weight and wind loads on the dish. To achieve the maximum gain, the shape of the dish needs to be accurate within a small fraction of a wavelength, around one sixteenth wavelength, to ensure the waves from different parts of the antenna arrive at the focus in phase. Large dishes often require a supporting truss structure behind them to provide the required stiffness.

A reflector made of a grill of parallel wires or bars oriented in one direction acts as a polarizing filter as well as a reflector. It only reflects linearly polarized radio waves, with the electric field parallel to the grill elements. This type is often used in radar antennas. Combined with a linearly polarized feed horn, it helps filter out noise in the receiver and reduces false returns.

A shiny metal parabolic reflector can also focus the sun&#x27;s rays. Since most dishes could concentrate enough solar energy on the feed structure to severely overheat it if they happened to be pointed at the sun, solid reflectors are always given a coat of flat paint.

===Feed antenna===
The feed antenna at the reflector&#x27;s focus is typically a low-gain type, such as a half-wave dipole or (more often) a small horn antenna called a feed horn. In more complex designs, such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, a secondary reflector is used to direct the energy into the parabolic reflector from a feed antenna located away from the primary focal point. The feed antenna is connected to the associated radio-frequency (RF) transmitting or receiving equipment by means of a coaxial cable transmission line or waveguide.

At the microwave frequencies used in many parabolic antennas, waveguide is required to conduct the microwaves between the feed antenna and transmitter or receiver. Because of the high cost of waveguide runs, in many parabolic antennas the RF front end electronics of the receiver is located at the feed antenna, and the received signal is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) so it can be conducted to the receiver through cheaper coaxial cable. This is called a low-noise block downconverter. Similarly, in transmitting dishes, the microwave transmitter may be located at the feed point.

An advantage of parabolic antennas is that most of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies (i.e. a wide bandwidth). All that is necessary to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that operates at the desired frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.

==Types==
Parabolic antennas are distinguished by their shapes:
* Paraboloidal or dish – The reflector is shaped like a paraboloid truncated with a circular rim. This is the most common type. It radiates a narrow pencil-shaped beam along the axis of the dish.
** Shrouded dish – Sometimes a cylindrical metal shield is attached to the rim of the dish. The shroud shields the antenna from radiation from angles outside the main beam axis, reducing the sidelobes. It is sometimes used to prevent interference in terrestrial microwave links, where several antennas using the same frequency are located close together. The shroud is coated inside with microwave absorbent material. Shrouds can reduce back lobe radiation by 10 dB.
* Cylindrical – The reflector is curved in only one direction and flat in the other. The radio waves come to a focus not at a point but along a line. The feed is sometimes a dipole antenna located along the focal line. Cylindrical parabolic antennas radiate a fan-shaped beam, narrow in the curved dimension, and wide in the uncurved dimension. The curved ends of the reflector are sometimes capped by flat plates, to prevent radiation out the ends, and this is called a &quot;pillbox antenna&quot; or &quot;cheese antenna&quot;.
* Shaped-beam antennas – Modern reflector antennas can be designed to produce a beam or beams of a particular shape, rather than just the narrow &quot;pencil&quot; or &quot;fan&quot; beams of the simple dish and cylindrical antennas mentioned above. Two techniques are used, often in combination, to control the shape of the beam:
:* Shaped reflectors – The reflector can be given a noncircular shape, or different curvatures in the horizontal and vertical directions, to alter the shape of the beam. This is often used in radar antennas. As a general principle, the wider the antenna is in a given transverse direction, the narrower the radiation pattern will be in that direction.
::* &quot;Orange peel&quot; antenna – Used in search radars, this is a long narrow antenna shaped like the letter &quot;C&quot;. It radiates a narrow vertical fan-shaped beam.

:* Arrays of feeds – In order to produce an arbitrary shaped beam, instead of one feed horn, an array of feed horns clustered around the focal point can be used. Array-fed antennas are often used on communication satellites, particularly direct broadcast satellites, to create a downlink radiation pattern to cover a particular continent or coverage area. They are often used with secondary reflector antennas such as the Cassegrain.

Parabolic antennas are also classified by the type of feed, that is, how the radio waves are supplied to the antenna:
* Axial, prime focus, or front feed – This is the most common type of feed, with the feed antenna located in front of the dish at the focus, on the beam axis, pointed back toward the dish. A disadvantage of this type is that the feed and its supports block some of the beam, which limits the aperture efficiency to only 55–60%.
* Off-axis or offset feed – The reflector is an asymmetrical segment of a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located to one side of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.
* Cassegrain – In a Cassegrain antenna, the feed is located on or behind the dish, and radiates forward, illuminating a convex hyperboloidal secondary reflector at the focus of the dish. The radio waves from the feed reflect off the secondary reflector to the dish, which reflects them forward again, forming the outgoing beam. An advantage of this configuration is that the feed, with its waveguides and &quot;front end&quot; electronics does not have to be suspended in front of the dish, so it is used for antennas with complicated or bulky feeds, such as large satellite communication antennas and radio telescopes. Aperture efficiency is on the order of 65–70%.
* Gregorian – Similar to the Cassegrain design except that the secondary reflector is concave (ellipsoidal) in shape. Aperture efficiency over 70% can be achieved.

==Feed pattern==

The radiation pattern of the feed antenna has to be tailored to the shape of the dish, because it has a strong influence on the &quot;aperture efficiency&quot;, which determines the antenna gain (see gain section below). Radiation from the feed that falls outside the edge of the dish is called &quot;spillover&quot; and is wasted, reducing the gain and increasing the backlobes, possibly causing interference or (in receiving antennas) increasing susceptibility to ground noise. However, maximum gain is only achieved when the dish is uniformly &quot;illuminated&quot; with a constant field strength to its edges. Therefore, the ideal radiation pattern of a feed antenna would be a constant field strength throughout the solid angle of the dish, dropping abruptly to zero at the edges. However, practical feed antennas have radiation patterns that drop off gradually at the edges, so the feed antenna is a compromise between acceptably low spillover and adequate illumination. For most front feed horns, optimum illumination is achieved when the power radiated by the feed horn is 10 dB less at the dish edge than its maximum value at the center of the dish.

===Polarization===
The pattern of electric and magnetic fields at the mouth of a parabolic antenna is simply a scaled-up image of the fields radiated by the feed antenna, so the polarization is determined by the feed antenna. In order to achieve maximum gain, both feed antennas (transmitting and receiving) must have the same polarization. For example, a vertical dipole feed antenna will radiate a beam of radio waves with their electric field vertical, called vertical polarization. The receiving feed antenna must also have vertical polarization to receive them; if the feed is horizontal (horizontal polarization) the antenna will suffer a severe loss of gain.

To increase the data rate, some parabolic antennas transmit two separate radio channels on the same frequency with orthogonal polarizations, using separate feed antennas; this is called a &quot;dual polarization antenna&quot;. For example, satellite television signals are transmitted from the satellite on two separate channels at the same frequency using right and left circular polarization. In a home satellite dish, these are received by two small monopole antennas in the feed horn, oriented at right angles. Each antenna is connected to a separate receiver.

If the signal from one polarization channel is received by the oppositely polarized antenna, it will cause crosstalk that degrades the signal-to-noise ratio. The ability of an antenna to keep these orthogonal channels separate is measured by a parameter called &quot;cross polarization discrimination&quot; (XPD). In a transmitting antenna, XPD is the fraction of power from an antenna of one polarization radiated in the other polarization. For example, due to minor imperfections a dish with a vertically polarized feed antenna will radiate a small amount of its power in horizontal polarization; this fraction is the XPD. In a receiving antenna, the XPD is the ratio of signal power received of the opposite polarization to power received in the same antenna of the correct polarization, when the antenna is illuminated by two orthogonally polarized radio waves of equal power. If the antenna system has inadequate XPD, cross polarization interference cancelling (XPIC) digital signal processing algorithms can often be used to decrease crosstalk.

===Dual reflector shaping===
In the Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas, the presence of two reflecting surfaces in the signal path offers additional possibilities for improving performance. When the highest performance is required, a technique called &quot;dual reflector shaping&quot; may be used. This involves changing the shape of the sub-reflector to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, to map the known pattern of the feed into a uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central &quot;hole&quot; to reduce feed shadowing.

==Gain==
The directive qualities of an antenna are measured by a dimensionless parameter called its gain, which is the ratio of the power received by the antenna from a source along its beam axis to the power received by a hypothetical isotropic antenna. The gain of a parabolic antenna is:

:formula_1

where:
*formula_2 is the area of the antenna aperture, that is, the mouth of the parabolic reflector. For a circular dish antenna, formula_3, giving the second formula above.
*formula_4 is the diameter of the parabolic reflector, if it is circular.
*formula_5 is the wavelength of the radio waves.
*formula_6 is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 called the &quot;aperture efficiency. &quot;The aperture efficiency of typical parabolic antennas is 0.55 to 0.70.

It can be seen that, as with any &quot;aperture antenna&quot;, the larger the aperture is, compared to the wavelength, the higher the gain. The gain increases with the square of the ratio of aperture width to wavelength, so large parabolic antennas, such as those used for spacecraft communication and radio telescopes, can have extremely high gain. Applying the above formula to the 25-meter-diameter antennas often used in radio telescope arrays and satellite ground antennas at a wavelength of 21 cm (1.42 GHz, a common radio astronomy frequency), yields an approximate maximum gain of 140,000 times or about 52 dBi (decibels above the isotropic level). The largest parabolic dish antenna in the world is the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope in southwest China, which has an effective aperture of about 300 meters. The gain of this dish at 3 GHz is roughly 90 million, or 80 dBi.

Aperture efficiency &quot;e&quot;A is a catchall variable which accounts for various losses that reduce the gain of the antenna from the maximum that could be achieved with the given aperture. The major factors reducing the aperture efficiency in parabolic antennas are: 
*&quot;Feed spillover&quot; – Some of the radiation from the feed antenna falls outside the edge of the dish and so does not contribute to the main beam.
*&quot;Feed illumination taper&quot; – The maximum gain for any aperture antenna is only achieved when the intensity of the radiated beam is constant across the entire aperture area. However, the radiation pattern from the feed antenna usually tapers off toward the outer part of the dish, so the outer parts of the dish are &quot;illuminated&quot; with a lower intensity of radiation. Even if the feed provided constant illumination across the angle subtended by the dish, the outer parts of the dish are farther away from the feed antenna than the inner parts, so the intensity would drop off with distance from the center. Hence, the intensity of the beam radiated by a parabolic antenna is maximum at the center of the dish and falls off with distance from the axis, reducing the efficiency.
*&quot;Aperture blockage&quot; – In front-fed parabolic dishes where the feed antenna is located in front of the dish in the beam path (and in Cassegrain and Gregorian designs as well), the feed structure and its supports block some of the beam. In small dishes such as home satellite dishes, where the size of the feed structure is comparable with the size of the dish, this can seriously reduce the antenna gain. To prevent this problem these types of antennas often use an &quot;offset feed&quot;, where the feed antenna is located to one side, outside the beam area. The aperture efficiency for these types of antennas can reach 0.7 to 0.8.
*&quot;Shape errors&quot; – Random surface errors in the shape of the reflector reduce efficiency. This loss is approximated by Ruze&#x27;s Equation.
For theoretical considerations of mutual interference (at frequencies between 2 and approximately 30 GHz; typically in the Fixed Satellite Service) where specific antenna performance has not been defined, a &quot;reference antenna&quot; based on Recommendation ITU-R S.465 is used to calculate the interference, which will include the likely sidelobes for off-axis effects.

==Radiation pattern==
In parabolic antennas, virtually all the power radiated is concentrated in a narrow main lobe along the antenna&#x27;s axis. The residual power is radiated in sidelobes, usually much smaller, in other directions. Since the reflector aperture of parabolic antennas is much larger than the wavelength, diffraction usually causes many narrow sidelobes, so the sidelobe pattern is complex. There is also usually a backlobe, in the opposite direction to the main lobe, due to the spillover radiation from the feed antenna that misses the reflector.

===Beamwidth===
The angular width of the beam radiated by high-gain antennas is measured by the &quot;half-power beam width&quot; (HPBW), which is the angular separation between the points on the antenna radiation pattern at which the power drops to one-half (-3 dB) its maximum value. For parabolic antennas, the HPBW &quot;θ&quot; is given by:

:formula_7

where &quot;k&quot; is a factor which varies slightly depending on the shape of the reflector and the feed illumination pattern. For an ideal uniformly illuminated parabolic reflector and &quot;θ&quot; in degrees, &quot;k&quot; would be 57.3 (the number of degrees in a radian). For a typical parabolic antenna, &quot;k&quot; is approximately 70.

For a typical 2 meter satellite dish operating on C band (4 GHz), this formula gives a beamwidth of about 2.6°. For the Arecibo antenna at 2.4 GHz, the beamwidth was 0.028°. Since parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams, aiming them can be a problem. Some parabolic dishes are equipped with a boresight so they can be aimed accurately at the other antenna.

There is an inverse relation between gain and beam width. By combining the beamwidth equation with the gain equation, the relation is:

:formula_8

=== Radiation pattern formula ===
The radiation from a large paraboloid with uniform illuminated aperture is essentially equivalent to that from a circular aperture of the same diameter formula_9 in an infinite metal plate with a uniform plane wave incident on the plate.

The radiation-field pattern can be calculated by applying Huygens&#x27; principle in a similar way to a rectangular aperture. The electric field pattern can be found by evaluating the Fraunhofer diffraction integral over the circular aperture. It can also be determined through Fresnel zone equations.

formula_10

where formula_11. Using polar coordinates, formula_12 and formula_13. Taking account of symmetry,

formula_14

and using first-order Bessel function gives the electric field pattern formula_15,
where formula_9 is the diameter of the antenna&#x27;s aperture in meters, formula_5 is the wavelength in meters, formula_18 is the angle in radians from the antenna&#x27;s symmetry axis as shown in the figure, and formula_19 is the first-order Bessel function. Determining the first nulls of the radiation pattern gives the beamwidth formula_20. The term formula_21 whenever formula_22. Thus,

formula_23.

When the aperture is large, the angle formula_20 is very small, so formula_25 is approximately equal to formula_26. This gives the common beamwidth formulas,

==History==

The idea of using parabolic reflectors for radio antennas was taken from optics, where the power of a parabolic mirror to focus light into a beam has been known since classical antiquity. The designs of some specific types of parabolic antenna, such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, come from similarly named analogous types of reflecting telescope, which were invented by astronomers during the 15th century.

German physicist Heinrich Hertz constructed the world&#x27;s first parabolic reflector antenna in 1888. The antenna was a cylindrical parabolic reflector made of zinc sheet metal supported by a wooden frame, and had a spark-gap excited 26 cm dipole as a feed antenna along the focal line. Its aperture was 2 meters high by 1.2 meters wide, with a focal length of 0.12 meters, and was used at an operating frequency of about 450 MHz. With two such antennas, one used for transmitting and the other for receiving, Hertz demonstrated the existence of radio waves which had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell some 22 years earlier. However, the early development of radio was limited to lower frequencies at which parabolic antennas were unsuitable, and they were not widely used until World War II, when microwave frequencies began to be employed.

After World War I when short waves began to be used, interest grew in directional antennas, both to increase range and make radio transmissions more secure from interception. Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi used parabolic reflectors during the 1930s in investigations of UHF transmission from his boat in the Mediterranean. In 1931, a 1.7 GHz microwave relay telephone link across the English Channel was demonstrated using diameter dishes. The first large parabolic antenna, a 9 m dish, was built in 1937 by pioneering radio astronomer Grote Reber in his backyard, and the sky survey he did with it was one of the events that founded the field of radio astronomy.

The development of radar during World War II provided a great impetus to parabolic antenna research. This led to the evolution of shaped-beam antennas, in which the curve of the reflector is different in the vertical and horizontal directions, tailored to produce a beam with a particular shape. After the war, very large parabolic dishes were built as radio telescopes. The 100-meter Green Bank Radio Telescope at Green Bank, West Virginia—the first version of which was completed in 1962—is currently the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable parabolic dish.

During the 1960s, dish antennas became widely used in terrestrial microwave relay communication networks, which carried telephone calls and television programs across continents. The first parabolic antenna used for satellite communications was constructed in 1962 at Goonhilly in Cornwall, England, to communicate with the Telstar satellite. The Cassegrain antenna was developed in Japan in 1963 by NTT, KDDI, and Mitsubishi Electric. The Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 is currently 24.2 billion kilometers from Earth, the furthest manmade object in space, and it&#x27;s 3.7 meter S and X-band Cassegrain antenna &quot;(see picture above)&quot; is still able to communicate with ground stations. The advent of computer design tools in the 1970s—such as NEC, capable of calculating the radiation pattern of parabolic antennas—has led to the development of sophisticated asymmetric, multi-reflector and multi-feed designs in recent years.

<doc id="208265" wikidata="Q651323" url="?curid=208265" title="Rideau Canal">
<text>The Rideau Canal is a 202-kilometre long canal that links the Ottawa River at Ottawa with the Cataraqui River and Lake Ontario at Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Its 46 locks raise boats from the Ottawa River 83 metres (272 feet) upstream along the Rideau River to the Rideau Lakes, and from there drop 50 metres (164 feet) downstream along the Cataraqui River to Kingston.

The Rideau Canal opened in 1832 for commercial shipping. Freight was eventually moved to railways and the St. Lawrence Seaway, but the canal remains in use today for pleasure boating, operated by Parks Canada from May through October. It is the oldest continuously operated canal system in North America, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

==Toponymy==
It is named for the Rideau River, which was in turn named for Rideau Falls. The name &quot;Rideau&quot;, French for &quot;curtain&quot;, is derived from the curtain-like appearance of the falls where they join the Ottawa River.

== History ==

===Plan===
After the War of 1812, information was received about the United States&#x27; plans to invade the British colony of Upper Canada from upstate New York by following the St. Lawrence River. This would have severed the lifeline between Montreal and a major naval base at Kingston. To protect against such an attack in the future, the British began the construction or reinforcement of a number of defences including Citadel Hill in Halifax, La Citadelle in Quebec City, and Fort Henry in Kingston.

To ensure safe passage for military vessels between Montreal and Kingston, a route was planned that would proceed westward from Montreal, up the Ottawa River to the mouth of the Rideau River, later the site of Bytown (now Ottawa), then southwest via a series of short canals connecting natural water bodies (rivers and lakes) to Kingston which is located on Lake Ontario. The Rideau would form the last portion of this route, along with shorter canals at Grenville, Chute-à-Blondeau and Carillon to bypass rapids and other hazards along the route.

The Rideau Route portion of this safe miliary supply route from Montreal to Kingston was first surveyed in 1783 by Lt. Gershom French, not as a canal route but as potential area for Loyalist settlement. At that time, there was no water connection to Kingston, the route, a long used indigenous water travel route, led from Rideau Falls up the Rideau River to Rideau Lake, over the watershed divide at Newboro and into the lower Rideau lakes, and then, via the White Fish River (now drowned), to Lower Beverley Lake and then by way of the Gananoque River to the St. Lawrence River. 

The first survey for a canal route was done in 1816 by Sir Joshua Jebb. Jebb, then a young 22 year-old Royal Engineer, surveyed the main route by way of the Rideau Lakes and also a shortcut route from the mouth of Irish Creek on the Rideau River to Morton Bay where it would return to the main Rideau Route. At the time of Jebb&#x27;s survey, a water connection to Kingston had been established due to flooding created by mill dams located at White Fish Falls (today&#x27;s Morton) and the Round Tail (just north of Upper Brewers), which flooded a previously non navigable area, the Cranberry floodplain. 

Jebb&#x27;s shortcut proposal became known as the Irish Creek Route and it was the route Jebb recommended in his report. The next Rideau Route survey by civilian surveyor Samuel Clowes (1823-24) discounted the Irish Creek Route, in part because it contained a 5 mile (8 km) overland section. Clowes preferred route was by way of the Rideau lakes since, although a longer route, the summit of the proposed canal was a body of water (Rideau Lake). 

In 1819, Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, who was the Governor-in-Chief of British North America, planned to make an inspection of the planned route for the Canal. However, Richmond had been bitten by a fox, and died in a settlement near Richmond after experiencing symptoms of rabies. Richmond had earlier convinced the Duke of Wellington, at the time Master-General of the Ordnance, to become interested in the project. On 1 March, 1819, Wellington wrote a memorandum which, in part, advocated that the Rideau Canal should be built as part of the defence system for Canada.

When Lt. Colonel John By was brought out of retirement in 1826 to be the Superintending Engineer for the Rideau Canal project he had both Lt. Joshua Jebb&#x27;s 1816 survey and Samuel Clowes&#x27; 1823-24 surveys and canal proposals. With Jebb&#x27;s Irish Creek shortcut route discounted by Clowes, Colonel By only considered the Rideau lakes route.

===Construction===
The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers. Private contractors such as future sugar refining entrepreneur John Redpath, Thomas McKay, Robert Drummond, Thomas Phillips, Andrew White and others were responsible for much of the construction, and the majority of the actual work was done by thousands of Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian labourers. Colonel John By decided to create a slackwater canal system using dams to raise the water level to sink rapids instead of constructing new channels around them. This was a better approach as it required fewer workers, was more cost effective, and would have been easier to build.

The canal work started in the fall of 1826, and it was completed by the spring of 1832. The first full steamboat transit of the canal was made by Robert Drummond&#x27;s steamboat, &quot;Rideau&quot; (aka &quot;Pumper&quot;), leaving Kingston on May 22, 1832, with Colonel By and family on board, and arriving in Bytown on May 29, 1832.

The final cost of the canal&#x27;s construction was £822,804 when all the costs, including land acquisition, were accounted for (January 1834). Because of the unexpected cost overruns, John By was recalled to London and was retired; he received no accolades or recognition for his tremendous accomplishment.
===Commercial use===
Since the canal was completed, no further military engagements have taken place between Canada and the United States. Although the Rideau was not put to defensive use, it played a pivotal role in the early development of Canada and encouraged shipping, trade, and settlement of Upper Canada by tens of thousands of immigrants.

The canal was easier to navigate than the St. Lawrence River because of significant rapids in the river between Montreal and Kingston. As a result, the Rideau Canal became a busy commercial artery between Montreal and the Great Lakes. It was also used by tens of thousands of immigrants from the British Isles heading westward into Upper Canada in this period.

It was a major route for shipping heavy goods (timber, minerals, grain) from Canada&#x27;s hinterland east to Montreal. Hundreds of barge loads of goods were shipped each year along the Rideau; in 1841, for instance, some 19 steamboats, 3 self-propelled barges, and 157 unpowered or tow barges used the Rideau Canal. The canal had to compete with the Erie Canal through New York State. Some of the shipments that might have been made from Kingston east, instead were taken to the opposite side of the St. Lawrence River to Oswego, New York. There they traveled by the Oswego Canal to reach the Erie and, via the Hudson River, New York City markets.

Businessmen in Kingston studied the issue. They considered building another canal to Lake Simcoe and on to the French River and Georgian Bay, thereby enabling traffic on the upper Great Lakes to use canals all the way to Montreal and avoid shipping through the entire lakes system. This plan eventually emerged as the Trent-Severn Waterway. It had originally been surveyed as a military route but never built. A simpler plan was to route around the dangerous parts of the St. Lawrence to allow direct shipping from Kingston to Montreal, and this was soon underway.

By 1849, the rapids of the St. Lawrence were made navigable by a series of locks, and commercial shippers were quick to switch to this more direct route. But commercial use of the Rideau largely ended after the Prescott and Bytown Railway was opened in December 1854. It provided faster service than shipping by the canal.

Further work improving the direct route continued along the St. Lawrence River. In the 1950s it was developed as the current Saint Lawrence Seaway, which allowed ocean-going ships access to the Great Lakes.

===Current use===
After the arrival of railway routes into Ottawa, most use of the canal was for pleasure craft. The introduction of the outboard motor led to an increase in small pleasure craft and increasing use of inland waterways like the Rideau and Trent-Severn. Today the Rideau forms part of the Great Loop, a major waterway route connecting a large area of the eastern United States and Canada.

=== Construction deaths ===
As many as one thousand of the workers died during the construction of the canal. Most deaths were from disease, principally complications from malaria (&quot;P. vivax&quot;), which was endemic in Ontario within the range of the &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito, and other diseases of the day. Accidents were fairly rare for a project of this size; in 1827 there were seven accidental deaths recorded. Inquests were held for each accidental death. The men, women and children who died were buried in local cemeteries, either burial grounds set up near work sites or existing local cemeteries. Funerals were held for the workers and the graves marked with wooden markers (which have since rotted away—leading to a misconception that workers were buried in unmarked graves).

Some of the dead remain unidentified as they had no known relatives in Upper Canada. Memorials have been erected along the canal route, most recently the Celtic Cross memorials in Ottawa, Kingston and Chaffeys Lock. The first memorial on the Rideau Canal acknowledging deaths among the labour force was erected in 1993 by the Kingston and District Labour Council and the Ontario Heritage Foundation at Kingston Mills.

Three canal era cemeteries are open to the public today: Chaffey&#x27;s Cemetery and Memory Wall at Chaffey&#x27;s Lock—this cemetery was used from 1825 to the late 19th century; the Royal Sappers and Miners Cemetery (originally called the Military and Civilian Cemetery and then as the Old Presbyterian Cemetery) near Newboro—used from 1828 to the 1940s; and McGuigan Cemetery near Merrickville—used from the early 19th century (c. 1805) to the late 1890s.

=== Recognition ===
The Rideau Canal was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1925, and marked with a federal plaque the next year, and again in 1962 and 2013.

The canal has been featured on postage stamps issued by Canada Post. Two 45-cent stamps—&#x27;Rideau Canal, Summer Boating at Jones Falls&#x27; and &#x27;Rideau Canal, Winter Skating by Parliament&#x27;—were issued on June 17, 1998, as part of the Canals and Recreational Destinations series. The stamps were designed by Carey George and Dean Martin, based on paintings by Vincent McIndoe.
In 2014, the canal appeared on a $2.50 international rate stamp as part of a Canada Post set honoring World Heritage Sites. The same design was reprised on a 2016 domestic-rate stamp.


In 1993, British Waterways and Parks Canada agreed to twin the canal with the Caledonian Canal in Scotland.

In 2000 the Rideau Waterway was designated a Canadian Heritage River in recognition of its outstanding historical and recreational values.

In 2007 it was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognizing it as a work of human creative genius. The Rideau Canal was recognized as the best preserved example of a slack water canal in North America demonstrating the use of European slackwater technology in North America on a large scale. It is the only canal dating from the great North American canal-building era of the early 19th century that remains operational along its original line with most of its original structures intact. It was also recognized as an extensive, well preserved and significant example of a canal which was used for military purposes linked to a significant stage in human history – that of the fight to control the north of the American continent.

A plaque was erected by the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board at Jones Falls Lockstation commemorating Lieutenant Colonel John By, Royal Engineer, the superintending engineer in charge of the construction of the Rideau Canal. The plaque notes the Rideau Canal, built as a military route and incorporating 47 locks, 16 lakes, two rivers, and a , dam at Jones Falls (Jones Falls Dam), was completed in 1832.

Other plaques to the canal erected by the Ontario Heritage Trust are at Kingston Mills, Smiths Falls, and Rideau Lakes.

== Waterway ==
The of the Rideau Canal incorporate sections of the Rideau and Cataraqui rivers, as well as several lakes, including the Lower, Upper and Big Rideau lakes. About of the route is artificial. Communities along the waterway include Ottawa, Manotick, Kars, Burritts Rapids, Merrickville, Smiths Falls, Rideau Ferry, Portland, Westport, Newboro, Seeleys Bay and Kingston. Communities connected by navigable waterways to the Rideau Canal include Kemptville and Perth.

Since World War I and the construction of more extensive rail lines into rural Ontario, only pleasure craft make use of the Rideau Canal. It takes 3–5 days to travel one way through the Rideau Canal system by motor boat. Boat tours of the canal are offered in Ottawa, Kingston, Merrickville, and Chaffeys Lock. A cruise line operates the ship &quot;Kawartha Voyageur&quot;. Recreational boaters can use it to travel between Ottawa and Kingston.

Most of the locks are still hand-operated. There are a total of 45 locks at 23 stations along the canal, plus two locks (locks 33 and 34) at the entrance to the Tay Canal (leading to Perth). The elevation between the Ottawa River and its summit at Upper Rideau Lake, is 83 metres (273 feet), the elevation change from Upper Rideau Lake to Lake Ontario is 50 metres (164 feet). Furthermore, there are four blockhouses and some of the original 16 defensible lockmasters residences along the waterway. The original Commissariat Building and foundation of the Royal Engineers&#x27; barracks remain at the Ottawa Lock Station. The waterway is home to many species of birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and fish.

In 1973–74 a new Smiths Falls Combined Lock, 29a, was built a few dozen metres to the north of the original flight of three locks (locks 28–30). The original locks were bypassed but left in place.

=== Locks ===

The Rideau Canal uses a lock system that is still fully functioning. The gates that let boats in and out of the locks last approximately 12–15 years. When the canal was constructed, the gates were made at the lock sites by carpenters and blacksmiths, but presently they are made in Smiths Falls, Ontario, and sometimes it takes up to two months to build a set of gates. The gates used on the Rideau Canal are made of Douglas Fir and are mitre-shaped to ensure a tight seal due to water pressure. The average Rideau Canal lock lift uses 1.3 million litres ( or ) of water.

==== Rideaumax ====
In normal operations the canal can handle boats up to in length, in width, and in height with a draft of up to (boats drafting over . In special circumstances a boat up to in length by in width can be handled.

=== Blockhouses ===

Four blockhouses were built from 1826 to 1832 to provide protection for the canal which was under the control of the British Forces:
* Merrickville Blockhouse – used briefly during 1837 Rebellion, it became a residence for the lockmaster, upper floor removed in 1909 and restored in 1960 as a museum
* Kingston Mills Blockhouse – used in 1837–1838, then enlarged to use as a residence, more alterations made in 1909 and restored to 1830 layout in the 1960s
* Newboro Blockhouse – built by the British Ordnance Department, it was also used briefly for its intended military role in the 1830s and then converted to home for lockmaster; restored in 1960s to original blockhouse configuration.
* Rideau Narrows Blockhouse – built by William H. Tett it was also altered in the 19th century to become lockmaster&#x27;s residence and restored from 1967 to 1970 to its original layout.

A fifth blockhouse at Burritts Rapids was partially built in 1832 before work was stopped with only the foundation and walls completed, then rebuilt in 1914–1915 and finally demolished to be replaced by the current lock station in 1969.

=== Commissariat Building ===
The Commissariat Building is the oldest stone building still standing in Ottawa. It was built in 1827 as a storehouse and offices for the Commissariat, the supply and services division of the British Military. The building has three floors, a secure vault, two sets of staircases, and a block and tackle on the front for hauling goods into the upper floors. After being divided into workshops and residential apartments, the Commissariat Building has housed the Bytown Museum since 1917.

Parliament Hill was intended to be the site of a fortress, to be called Citadel Hill, where the canal ended at the Ottawa River.

== Skateway ==

Since the winter of 1970–71, the section of the Rideau Canal passing through central Ottawa has been re-purposed as what is officially the world&#x27;s largest and second longest skating rink. The cleared length is and has the equivalent surface area of 90 Olympic ice hockey rinks. It runs from the Hartwells Lockstation at Carleton University to the locks between the Parliament Buildings and the Château Laurier, including Dow&#x27;s Lake in between. It serves as a popular tourist attraction and recreational area and is also the focus of the Winterlude festival in Ottawa. In the winter of 2022-2023, unseasonably mild weather prevented the opening of the Skateway for Winterlude. Beaver Tails, a fried dough pastry, are sold along with other snacks and beverages, in kiosks on the skateway. Kiosks were removed in early 2023 due to the resulting lack of tourism.In January 2008, Winnipeg, Manitoba, achieved the record of the world&#x27;s longest skating rink at a length of 8.54 kilometres but with a width of only 2 to 3 metres wide on its Assiniboine River and Red River at The Forks. In response, the Rideau Canal was rebranded as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest skating rink&quot;. The Rideau Canal Skateway was added to the Guinness Book of World Records in 2005 for being the largest naturally frozen ice rink in the world. As of 2023, the Streetview feature of Google Maps allows you to &quot;skate&quot; the length of the skateway.

The Skateway is open 24 hours a day. The length of the season depends on the weather, but typically the Rideau Canal Skateway opens in January and closes in March. Because of global warming, the region&#x27;s average winter temperature has risen at an accelerating rate since the 1970s, which has gradually pushed back the opening day of skating and shortened the skating season. In 1971–1972, the Skateway&#x27;s second winter, the skating season was 90 days long, which was its longest season. By 2022–23, warm temperatures combined with snow and rain led to the first ever season with zero skating days. Before then, the 2015–2016 season was the shortest in which the Skateway was opened, being a mere 34 days long (and with only 18 skating days). On January 21, 2024, the canal opened for the first time in nearly two years, yet was only open for 10 days of skating before it closed for the season on February 25, marking the shortest skating season in which the canal actually opened.

Although some residents of Ottawa used the canal as an impromptu skating surface for years, the official use of the canal as a skateway and tourist attraction is a more recent innovation. As recently as 1970, however, city government of Ottawa considered paving over the canal to make an expressway. The federal government&#x27;s ownership of the canal, however, prevented the city from pursuing this proposal. When Doug Fullerton was appointed chair of the National Capital Commission, he proposed a recreational corridor around the canal, including the winter skateway between Carleton University and Confederation Park. The plan was implemented on January 18, 1971, despite opposition by city council. A small section of ice near the National Arts Centre was cleared by NCC employees with brooms and shovels, and 50,000 people skated on the canal the first weekend. Today the skating area of the canal is larger because of the equipment available for ice resurfacing and 24/7 maintenance crews. The skateway now has an average of one million visits per year. City councillor and author Clive Doucet credits this transformation of the canal with reinvigorating the communities of the Glebe, Old Ottawa East and Old Ottawa South.
=== Preparation and maintenance ===

The preparation for the Skateway starts as early as mid-October. At the end of the boating season, the water is drained at the Ottawa locks near Parliament by Parks Canada. Facilities on the ice such as shelters, chalets, and access ramps for vehicles are then installed. Next, &quot;beams are placed at the locks, and the water is raised to skating level.&quot; After this step, the essentials are added such as stairs to access the ice, and hookups for both plumbing and electricity. The ice cap that forms as the canal freezes becomes the Rideau Canal Skateway. When the canal has built up a sufficient ice thickness, snow is removed from the ice surface and it is flooded in order to make the ice even more thick and smooth. Samples of ice are tested for quality and thickness. When it is safe to skate on, the Rideau Canal Skateway is opened for the season.

The Rideau Canal Skateway is maintained by the NCC (National Capital Commission). The ice is maintained by crews 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The snow and ice shavings are cleared off the surface every day and the ice surface is flooded each night with a &quot;water dispersion machine&quot; (weather permitting) to fill in any cracks caused by the contracting and expanding ice. These machines, known as Frosters, were unveiled in 2011 and were created because Zamboni ice resurfacers that are traditionally used in hockey rinks were too small and narrow for the Rideau Canal. There are approximately 20 holes along the side of the Skateway that flood the ice surface to make it smoother for skaters.

Two types of ice can form on the Rideau Canal Skateway, which are &quot;white ice&quot; and &quot;clear ice&quot;. White ice has a milky appearance with air bubbles, and is formed when snow and water mix and then freeze. White ice can also be formed by mechanically flooding the ice surface with water to increase the thickness of the ice cap. The other type of ice is called &quot;clear ice&quot;, which has a colourless appearance and is formed when ice crystals build up below the frozen surface in cold temperatures. If snow accumulates on the ice it can negatively impact the conditions for skating. Snow depresses the ice surface and slows down the formation of ice crystals beneath the surface.

Ice conditions can be classified as very good, good, fair or poor. They are updated twice daily by the NCC. The ideal (&quot;very good&quot;) conditions mean there are &quot;a limited number of pressure cracks&quot;, the ice is very hard and durable overall, the ice surface is clean and smooth, there are a &quot;limited number of rough areas&quot;, and there is a &quot;very good gliding surface.&quot;

<doc id="208270" wikidata="Q177792" url="?curid=208270" title="Capo (musical device)">
<text>A capo ( ; short for &quot;capodastro&quot;, &quot;capo tasto&quot; or &quot;capotasto&quot; , Italian for &quot;head of fretboard&quot;) is a device a musician uses on the neck of a stringed (typically fretted) instrument to transpose and shorten the playable length of the strings—hence raising the pitch. It is a common tool for players of guitars, mandolins, mandolas, banjos, ukuleles and bouzoukis. The word derives from the Italian &quot;capotasto&quot;, which means the nut of a stringed instrument. The earliest known use of &quot;capotasto&quot; is by Giovanni Battista Doni who, in his &quot;Annotazioni&quot; of 1640, uses it to describe the nut of a viola da gamba. The first patented capo was designed by James Ashborn of Wolcottville, Connecticut year 1850.

Musicians commonly use a capo to raise the pitch of a fretted instrument so they can play in a different key using the same fingerings as playing &quot;open&quot; (i.e., without a capo). In effect, a capo uses a fret of an instrument to create a new nut at a higher note than the instrument&#x27;s actual nut.

There are various capo designs, but most commercial capos consist of a rubber-covered bar that clamps to the instrument&#x27;s neck in some way to hold down the strings. Capos come in different sizes and shapes for different instruments and fretboard curvatures. Factors that vary by type of capo are ease of use, size, degree of interference with the player&#x27;s hands, and ability to hold down strings uniformly without affecting tuning. All types of capo should be applied after a fresh tuning by laying the barre, descending from above, and directly behind the fret, so that all of the strings have uniform position and pressure. If the strings are bent or mispositioned, the instrument sounds out of tune in the new key. Some types of capo can mar the neck of the guitar if applied incorrectly.

==Use==
Song arrangements may cite capo position just as they cite alternative tunings. When referencing fingerings for a song that uses a capo, the player determines whether the chart references absolute finger positions, or positions relative to the capo. In tablature, for example, a note played on the fifth fret of an instrument capoed at the second fret can be listed as &quot;5&quot; (absolute) or &quot;3&quot; (relative to capo). Similarly, a D-shaped chord can be referred to as &quot;D&quot; (based on the shape relative to the capo), or E (based on the absolute audible chord produced). Neither method strongly prevails over the other. For this reason, the phrase &quot;chord-shape&quot; is commonly used to clarify that the fingering shape and not the audible pitch is being referred to.

With this concept in mind, if two players want to play a chord progression in a more interesting way, one can play first position chord-shapes with no capo, while the second player places the capo further up the fretboard and plays different voicings of the same chords. This creates a fuller sound than two guitars playing in unison. For example, if they play a simple I IV V chord progression together in E the first guitarist plays E A B7 while the second plays the same progression capoed at the fourth fret using C F G7 chord-shapes.

Playing with a capo creates the same musical effect as retuning all strings up the same number of steps. However, using a capo only affects the open note of each string. Every other fret remains unaffected (e.g., the seventh fret of an E-string still plays a B note for any capo position at or below the seventh fret), and thus a performer does not need to adjust for or relearn the entire fretboard as they might with retuning. The scale length of the strings of an instrument affects the timbre of the strings, and thus the use of a capo may alter the tone of the instrument.

Musicians also use capos to bring a guitar tuned below standard up to standard tuning. Manufacturers sometimes recommend tuning a twelve-string guitar a whole-step or more below standard to offset the additional stress of the additional strings. A capo can raise it to standard tuning. However, through improved manufacturing techniques, many modern 12-strings are tuned to standard pitch.

===In different music styles===
Some guitar styles—such as flamenco, Irish traditional music, and British and American folk music—frequently use a capo. Others—such as classical and jazz—rarely use a capo. Many rock and roll musicians who are influenced by folk and blues, such as Richard Thompson, Keith Richards, Ry Cooder, Ian Anderson, Steve Earle, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Noel Gallagher, Steve Rothery, Johnny Marr, and others also use the capo. In many cases, they have extended its use past the traditional purpose of changing the key, and broken new ground, employing it in new ways.

==Mechanisms and styles==

A strap-on capo&#x27;s rubber-covered bar is held to the strings by a strap attached to either end of the bar. A strap-on capo commonly features either an elastic strap, or an adjustable fabric strap.

Modern variations on the strap-on capo include a semi-flexible plastic &quot;strap&quot; connected to the bar on one side and adjustable on the other side by a ratchet system. Strap-on capos differ from other capos in that most other capos contain only rigid parts, and most other styles do not wrap entirely around the neck of the instrument. This full wrap provides fairly even pressure of the capo bar across all strings. The strap-on capo is commonly a low-cost capo option, and is one of the earlier designs. Because they stretch to create a tight fit, the straps on these capos can be prone to stretch-fatigue and wear.
One common modern capo style is the spring-clamp capo (sometimes called &quot;trigger-style&quot; after the Dunlop trademarked Trigger capo). The most common of this type of capo has two bars: a rubber-covered bar to barre the strings, and another that presses against the back of the instrument neck to hold the first bar to the strings. The second bar is commonly curved to match the contour of the back of the neck. The two bars attach on a pivot at one end, and a spring presses them together.

Each bar has a &#x27;grip&#x27; attached at a right angle to the bar; the two grips, when squeezed together by the user, pull the two bars apart, allowing the user to quickly release the capo&#x27;s grip, apply or adjust the capo, then release the grips, allowing the spring to pull the bars together again. The look of the grips, and the action of squeezing them is akin to a gun&#x27;s trigger, leading to the name of this capo. These are the most common design referred to as &quot;quick-release&quot; capos.

Though other styles also use that term, the spring clamp capo, because it can be operated by one hand in one single squeezing motion, is typically the quickest capo to apply or move on the instrument; other capos can be quicker and easier to remove from the instrument. One disadvantage to the spring clamp capo is that the pressure of the spring is not adjustable. The spring applies its maximum pressure to hold the strings down, which could have an effect on the tuning of some guitars if not applied properly. These capos can typically be applied either to the treble or bass side of the instrument, depending on the player&#x27;s preference. Three of the most recognizable models of spring clamp capos are manufactured by Dunlop, Kyser and Thalia.

Manufacturers have tried to create the ideal capo. One of the more recognized capos is the Shubb capo. A musician applies the Shubb capo by holding it in place and closing a lever. The unique aspect of this capo is that the lever presses against a second arm that presses against the back of the instrument neck. The amount of pressure the lever exerts is adjustable by a screw, so that the capo can exert the minimal amount of pressure required to fret the strings.

Proponents claim this has the least impact on tuning. The Shubb capo has the disadvantage of requiring two hands to properly apply or move, and its adjustment is more complicated than some other capos. However, because of the lever design, the capo can be removed very quickly by simply releasing the lever. This is particularly true if the capo is applied from the treble side of the instrument, which facilitates quick removal.

===Variations===


Numerous other capos types are variations on the designs above:
* A screw-on capo has some form of surface that presses against the back of the neck of the instrument to hold the bar in place against the strings. This back surface is held to the neck by a screw tightened to apply direct pressure. One form of this capo is effectively a rubber-covered bar built into a C-clamp.
* A rolling capo facilitates quick key changes in the middle of tunes or sets. A roller holds down the strings and another roller behind the neck holds it in place, so the player can roll the capo along the neck. People who prefer it feel it improves on fixed capos, as they can move it with the fretting hand without interrupting a performance. There are two such rolling capos. the Bennett Glider, from a 1974 US Patent, is still made in the U.S., and in an inexpensive &quot;knock-off&quot; version by a Chinese company. The more advanced Sixth Finger capo, patented in 2013, is presently hand-made in Spain, and is difficult to find due to limited production. 

* &quot;Fifth-string capo&quot;: The five-string banjo, with its short fifth string, poses a particular problem for using the capo. For many years now Shubb has had available a &quot;fifth-string capo&quot;, consisting of a narrow metal strip fixed to the side of the neck of the instrument, with a sliding stopper for the string. Other options are to use model railroad spikes to hold the string down at higher frets or simply to retune the string to fit with the pitch of the other strings with the capo applied.

===Decorative variations===
For centuries capos have been utilitarian devices, but in recent years capo manufacturers have started to focus on enhancing capo aesthetics. The G7th Capo Company released the Performance 2 Celtic Special Edition design, Kyser&#x27;s Capos come in many different colors and patterns &amp; Thalia Capos took it a step further and now offers hundreds of exotic wood and shell inlays on their capos, designed to match the various tonewoods and inlays found on fine guitars.
===Partial capo===

Though most capos are designed to raise all strings, partial capos specifically capo only some of the strings. This may appear to have a similar effect to alternate tunings, but there are differences. A common example is a capo that covers the top five strings of a guitar and omitting the bass E string. When played at the second fret, this appears to create a drop D tuning (in which the bass E string is detuned to a D) raised one full tone in pitch. In fact, these are often marketed as &quot;drop D capos&quot;. However, the same difference applies with a drop D capo as with a regular capo; namely, only the open tuning of the strings is affected, and thus, when used at the second fret, an E chord using the D shape has the &quot;Drop D sound&quot; with a low E note. However, a G-shape chord can be played as well, as the fretted E string is not as affected as it would be if the string was retuned.

Partial capos are a relatively recent design. Until their creation, some innovative players used their standard capos (or altered capos) to cover only some of the strings of their instruments. The above-mentioned drop D design was previously achieved, for example, by applying a spring clamp capo to the treble side of the fretboard but leaving the bass E string uncovered. Similarly, users of the Shubb capo altered their capos by cutting off some of the rubber-covered bar&#x27;s length or by altering the rubber covering to leave certain strings unaffected. The Thalia Capo&#x27;s interchangeable fretpads can provide a partial fretpad set as an accessory that converts a standard Thalia capo into a partial capo. This design has two different configurations, depending on how the musician places the capo on the fretboard. Installing from the bass side of the neck capos strings 3-4-5. Installing from the treble side capos strings 2-3-4.

Other common partial capo designs press the second fret of the third, fourth and fifth strings (producing the effect of DADGAD tuning raised two semitones), or on the second fret of the second, third and fourth strings (open A major). Again, this creates no change of fingering above the capo.

American guitarist Dominic Frasca uses single string &quot;mini capos&quot; that attach by drilling through the neck of his customized 10-string guitar. These are similar to the single-string &quot;capos&quot; many Eastern instruments use, in which the player hooks a string under the head of a &quot;nail&quot; to capo it. This is a common capo practice during the performance of a musical piece, so that the tuning at the end of the piece sounds different from the one at the beginning.

This is a common method to capo the fifth string of a five-string banjo. The fifth string begins at the corresponding fret and players often need to capo it individually.

==Natural inlets called canals==
Behm Canal, Duncan Canal, Lynn Canal, and Portland Canal in Alaska, and Hood Canal in Washington are natural inlets that use the name &quot;canal&quot;.

==Canals by state==

These are man made canals in each state that have been given a name and may consist of a narrow irrigation or drainage ditch to a large ship, municipal water and/or irrigation canal. States with extensive agricultural acreage may have many hundred to thousands of canals. USGS Topographical map numbers and latitudes and longitudes of each canal, usable as inputs into Google, Bing, etc. maps, are usually given.

<doc id="208283" wikidata="Q407502" url="?curid=208283" title="Lewisite">
<text>Lewisite (L) (A-243) is an organoarsenic compound. It was once manufactured in the U.S., Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union for use as a chemical weapon, acting as a vesicant (blister agent) and lung irritant. Although the substance is colorless and odorless in its pure form, impure samples of lewisite are a yellow, brown, violet-black, green, or amber oily liquid with a distinctive odor that has been described as similar to geraniums.

Lewisite is named after the US chemist and soldier Winford Lee Lewis (1878–1943). Apart from its use as a weapon of war, the compound is useless; a chemist from the United States Army&#x27;s chemical warfare laboratories said that &quot;no one has ever found any use for the compound&quot;.

==Chemical reactions==
The compound is prepared by the addition of arsenic trichloride to acetylene in the presence of a suitable catalyst:

This chemical process can occur a second or third time, giving lewisite 2 and lewisite 3 as byproducts.

Lewisite, like other arsenous chlorides, hydrolyses in water to form hydrochloric acid and chlorovinylarsenous oxide (a less-powerful blister agent):

This reaction is accelerated in alkaline solutions, and forms acetylene and trisodium arsenate.

Lewisite reacts with metals to form hydrogen gas. It is combustible, but difficult to ignite.

==Applications==
Apart from deliberately injuring and killing people, lewisite has no commercial, industrial, or scientific applications. In a 1959 paper regarding the development of a batch process for lewisite synthesis, Gordon Jarman of the United States Army Chemical Warfare Laboratories said:
While the compound itself has no useful application, a 1993 report from the US Defense Nuclear Agency detailed attempts by Russian chemists in &quot;exploring processes for the conversion of these agents to marketable products&quot;, including the extraction of high-purity arsenic for use in semiconductor doping (as gallium arsenide). The report, however, concluded that &quot;the engineering and scale up of the process to a production level may be prohibitively difficult&quot; and that &quot;unless other metallic impurities which are likely to be found in Lewisite are removed, the high purity required for chip application may require additional steps&quot;, noting that worldwide demand for arsenic compounds (already declining at the time) was projected to shrink further, and that the proposed economics of the conversion process did not align with then-current prices for gallium arsenide.

==Mechanism of action==
Lewisite is a suicide inhibitor of the E3 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase. As an efficient method to produce ATP, pyruvate dehydrogenase is involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. The latter subsequently enters the TCA cycle. Peripheral nervous system pathology usually arises from Lewisite exposure as the nervous system essentially relies on glucose as its only catabolic fuel.

It can easily penetrate ordinary clothing and latex rubber gloves. Upon skin contact it causes immediate stinging, burning pain and itching that can last for 24 hours. Within minutes, a rash develops and the agent is absorbed through the skin. Large, fluid-filled blisters (similar to those caused by mustard gas exposure) develop after approximately 12 hours and cause pain for 2–3 days. These are severe chemical burns and begin with small blisters in the red areas of the skin within 2–3 hours and grow worse, encompassing the entire red area, for the ensuing 12–18 hours after initial exposure. Liquid lewisite has faster effects than lewisite vapor. Sufficient absorption can cause deadly liver necrosis.

Those exposed to lewisite can develop refractory hypotension (low blood pressure) known as Lewisite shock, with some features of arsenic toxicity. Lewisite damages capillaries, which then become leaky, reducing blood volume required to maintain blood pressure, a condition called hypovolemia. When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be damaged.

Inhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, nosebleed (epistaxis), laryngitis, sneezing, coughing, vomiting, difficult breathing (dyspnea), and in severe cases of exposure, can cause fatal pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, or respiratory failure. Ingestion results in severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and tissue damage. The results of eye exposure can range from stinging, burning pain and strong irritation to blistering and scarring of the cornea, along with blepharospasm, lacrimation, and edema of the eyelids and periorbital area. The eyes can swell shut, which can keep the eyes safe from further exposure. The most severe consequences of eye exposure to lewisite are globe perforation and blindness. Generalised symptoms also include restlessness, weakness, hypothermia and low blood pressure.

It is possible that Lewisite is carcinogenic: arsenic is categorized as a respiratory carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, though it has not been confirmed that lewisite is a carcinogen.

Lewisite causes damage to the respiratory tract at levels lower than the odor detection threshold. Early tissue damage causes pain.

Hydrolysis leads to chlorovinylarsonous acid, CVAA.

=== Treatment ===
British anti-lewisite, also called dimercaprol, is the antidote for lewisite. It can be injected to prevent systemic toxicity, but will not prevent injury to the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Chemically, dimercaprol binds to the arsenic in lewisite. It is contraindicated in those with peanut allergies.

Other treatment for lewisite exposure is primarily supportive. First aid of lewisite exposure consists of decontamination and irrigation of any areas that have been exposed. Other measures can be used as necessary, such as airway management, assisted ventilation, and monitoring of vital signs. In an advanced care setting, supportive care can include fluid and electrolyte replacement. Because the tube may injure or perforate the esophagus, gastric lavage is contraindicated.

=== Long-term effects ===
From one acute exposure, someone who has inhaled lewisite can develop chronic respiratory disease; eye exposure to lewisite can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness.

Chronic exposure to lewisite can cause arsenic poisoning (due to its arsenic content) and development of a lewisite allergy. It can also cause long-term illnesses or permanent damage to organs, depending on where the exposure has occurred, including conjunctivitis, aversion to light (photophobia), visual impairment, double vision (diplopia), tearing (lacrimation), dry mucous membranes, garlic breath, burning pain in the nose and mouth, toxic encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, nausea, vomiting, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, dermatitis, skin ulcers, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

==Chemical composition==
Lewisite can be a mixture of molecules with a different number of vinylchloride groups on the arsenic chloride: lewisite itself (2-chlorovinylarsonous dichloride), along with &quot;bis&quot;(2-chlorovinyl)arsinous chloride (lewisite 2) and &quot;tris&quot;(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (lewisite 3). In addition, there are sometimes isomeric impurities: lewisite itself is mostly &quot;trans&quot;-2-chlorovinylarsonous dichloride, but the &quot;cis&quot; stereoisomer and the constitutional isomer (1-chlorovinylarsonous dichloride) may also be present.

Experimental and computational studies both find that the &quot;trans&quot;-2-chloro isomer is the most stable, and that the carbon–arsenic bond has a conformation in which the lone pair on the arsenic is approximately aligned with the vinyl group.

==History==

Lewisite was synthesized in 1904 by Julius Arthur Nieuwland during studies for his PhD. In his thesis, he described a reaction between acetylene and arsenic trichloride, which led to the formation of lewisite. Exposure to the resulting compound made Nieuwland so ill he was hospitalized for several days.

Lewisite is named after the US chemist and soldier Winford Lee Lewis (1878–1943). In 1918, John Griffin, Julius Arthur Nieuwland&#x27;s thesis advisor, drew Lewis&#x27;s attention to Nieuwland&#x27;s thesis at Maloney Hall, then a chemical laboratory at The Catholic University of America, Washington D.C. Lewis then attempted to purify the compound through distillation but found that the mixture exploded on heating until it was washed with hydrochloric acid.

Lewisite was developed into a secret weapon at a facility located in Cleveland, Ohio (The Cleveland Plant) at East 131st Street and Taft Avenue, and given the name &quot;G-34&quot;, which had previously been the code for mustard gas, in order to confuse its development with mustard gas. On November 1, 1918, production began at a plant in Willoughby, Ohio.
It was not used in World War I, but Britain experimented with it in the 1920s as the &quot;Dew of Death&quot;.

After World War I, the US became interested in lewisite because it was not flammable. Up until World War II, it had the military symbol of &quot;M1&quot;, after which it was changed to &quot;L&quot;. Field trials with lewisite during World War II demonstrated that casualty concentrations were not achievable under high humidity, due to the rate of hydrolysis and the characteristic odor of the chemical, and the formation of tears forced troops to don masks and avoid contaminated areas. The United States produced about 20,000 tons of lewisite, keeping it on hand primarily as an antifreeze for mustard gas, or to penetrate protective clothing in special situations.

Lewisite was replaced by the mustard gas variant HT (a 60:40 mixture of sulfur mustard and O-Mustard), and was declared obsolete in the 1950s. Lewisite poisoning can be treated effectively with British anti-lewisite (dimercaprol). Most stockpiles of lewisite were neutralised with bleach and dumped into the Gulf of Mexico. The last remaining U.S. stockpiles at the Deseret Chemical Depot located outside Salt Lake City, Utah were destroyed in January 2012.

Production of quantities greater than 100 grams per year per facility were banned by Schedule 1 of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. When the convention entered force in 1997, the parties declared world-wide stockpiles of 6,747 tonnes. By the end of 2015, 98% of the declared stockpiles had been destroyed.

In 2001, lewisite was found in a World War I weapons dump in Washington, D.C.

In July 2023 a spokesman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claimed that during the battle of Bakhmut a Russian artillery attack against Ukrainian forces had included lewisite, causing symptoms of nausea, vomiting and in some cases loss of consciousness. However, no information from any sample analysis were published.

==Controversy over Japanese deposits of lewisite in China==
In mid-2006, China and Japan were negotiating disposal of lewisite stockpile in northeastern China, left by the Japanese military during World War II. People had died over the preceding twenty years from accidental exposure to these stockpiles.

<text>A banknote or bank notealso called a bill (North American English) or simply a noteis a type of paper money that is made and distributed (&quot;issued&quot;) by a bank of issue, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, which were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks or monetary authorities. 

By extension, the word &quot;banknote&quot; is sometimes used (including by collectors) to refer more generally to paper money, but in a strict sense notes that have not been issued by banks, e.g. government notes, are not banknotes.

National banknotes are often, but not always, legal tender, meaning that courts of law are required to recognize them as satisfactory payment of money debts. Historically, banks sought to ensure that they could always pay customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of &quot;backing&quot; notes with something of substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver. Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat. With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.

==History==
==Issue of banknotes==

Today, a central bank or treasury is generally solely responsible within a state or currency union for the issue of banknotes. However, this is not always the case, and historically, private banks frequently handled all of a country&#x27;s paper currency. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes before there was a national currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these series, the issuing bank would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and cashier on a preprinted note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from Federal Reserve Notes.

In a small number of countries, private banknote issuing continues to this day. For example, by virtue of the complex constitutional setup in the United Kingdom, certain commercial banks in two countries (Scotland and Northern Ireland) continue to print their own banknotes for domestic circulation, even though they are not fiat money or declared in law as legal tender anywhere. The UK&#x27;s central bank, the Bank of England, prints notes which are legal tender in England and Wales; these notes are also usable as money (but not legal tender) in Scotland and Northern Ireland (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). The Bank of Scotland was the first bank in Europe to successfully print its own paper banknotes, and entered circulation in 1696. The Bank of Scotland is currently the longest continuous issuer of banknotes in the world.

In the two Special Administrative Regions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, arrangements are similar to those in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue Hong Kong dollar notes, and in Macau, banknotes of the Macanese pataca are issued by two different commercial banks. In Luxembourg, the Banque Internationale à Luxembourg was entitled to issue its own Luxembourgish franc notes until the introduction of the Euro in 1999.

As well as commercial issuers, other organizations may have note-issuing powers; for example, until 2002, the Singapore dollar was issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore, a government agency that was later taken over by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

As with any printing, there is also a chance for banknotes to have printing errors. For U.S. banknotes, these errors can include board break errors, butterfly fold errors, cutting errors, dual denomination errors, fold over errors, and misalignment errors.

==Materials used for banknotes==

===Paper banknotes===

Until recently, most banknotes were made from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90 grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: it is much more resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a paper banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (&quot;Edgeworthia chrysantha&quot;) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).

Most banknotes are made using the mould-made process, in which a watermark and thread are incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple-looking security component found in most banknotes. It is, however, often rather complex in construction, comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic, and microprint elements. By combining it with watermarking technology, the thread can be made to surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking to reduce the number of corner folds by strengthening this part of the note. Varnishing and coatings reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note for longer durability in circulation.

Another security feature is based on windows in the paper, which are covered by holographic foils to make it very hard to copy. Such technology is applied as a &quot;portrait window&quot; for the higher denominations of the Europa series (ES2) of the euro banknotes. Windows are also used with the Hybrid substrate from Giesecke+Devrient which is composed of an inner layer of paper substrate with thin outer layers of plastic film for high durability.

===History of counterfeiting and security measures===
When paper bank notes were first introduced in England, they resulted in a dramatic rise in counterfeiting. The attempts by the Bank of England and the Royal Mint to stamp out currency crime led to new policing strategies, including the increased use of entrapment.

The characteristics of banknotes, their materials and production techniques (as well as their development over history) are topics that are not usually thoroughly examined by historians, even though there are now a number of works detailing how bank notes were actually constructed. This is mostly because historians tend to be more interested in a theoretical understanding of how money worked rather than how it was produced. The first great deterrent against counterfeiting was the death penalty for forgers, but this was not enough to stop the rise of counterfeiting. Over the 18th century, far fewer banknotes were circulating in England compared to the boom of bank notes in the 19th century; because of this, improved note-making techniques were not considered a compelling issue.

In the 18th century, banknotes were produced mainly by copper-plate engraving and printing, and they were single-sided. Note-making technologies remained largely unchanged during the 18th century. The first banknotes were produced by intaglio printing: this involved engraving a copper plate by hand and then covering it in ink to print the bank notes. Only with this technique, at that time, could one force the paper into the lines of the engraving to make suitable banknotes. Another difficulty in counterfeiting banknotes was the paper, as the type of paper used for banknotes was rather different from the paper commercially available at that time. Despite this, some forgers successfully forged notes by dealing with and consulting paper makers, in order to make a similar kind of paper themselves. Furthermore, watermarked paper has also been used since banknotes first appeared; it involved the sewing of a thin wire frame into paper mould. Watermarks for notes were first used in 1697, by Rice Watkins, a Berkshire paper maker. Watermarks and special paper made it harder and more expensive to forge banknotes, since more complex and expensive paper-making machines were needed.

In the early 19th century (the so-called Bank Restriction Period, 1797–1821), the dramatically increased demand for bank notes slowly forced the banks to refine the technologies employed. In 1801, watermarks, which previously were straight lines, became wavy—an idea of William Brewer, a watermark mould maker. This made counterfeiting bank notes harder still, at least in the short term, and in 1803 the number of forged bank notes fell to just 3000, compared to 5000 the previous year. Banks asked skilled engravers and artists to help them make their notes more difficult to counterfeit during the same time period, which historians refer to as &quot;the search for the inimitable banknote.&quot; During this time, bank notes also began to be double-sided and have more intricate patterns.

The ease with which paper money can be created, by both legitimate authorities and counterfeiters, has led to a temptation in times of crisis such as war or revolution, or merely a spendthrift government, to produce paper money which was not supported by precious metal or other goods; this often led to hyperinflation and a loss of faith in the value of paper money, e.g. the Continental Currency produced by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, the Assignats produced during the French Revolution, the paper currency produced by the Confederate States of America and the individual states of the Confederate States of America, the financing of World War I by the Central Powers (by 1922 1 gold Austro-Hungarian krone of 1914 was worth 14,400 paper Kronen), the devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar in the 1990s, etc. Banknotes may also be overprinted to reflect political or economic changes that occur faster than new currency can be printed.

In 1988, Austria produced the 5000 Schilling banknote (Mozart), which is the first foil application (Kinegram) to a paper banknote in the history of banknote printing. The application of optical features is now common throughout the world. Many countries&#x27; banknotes now have embedded holograms.

===Polymer banknotes===
In 1983, Costa Rica and Haiti issued the first Tyvek and the Isle of Man issued the first Bradvek polymer (or plastic) banknotes; these were printed by the American Banknote Company and developed by DuPont. These early plastic notes were plagued with issues such as ink wearing off, and they were discontinued. In 1988, after significant research and development in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia produced the first polymer banknote made from biaxially-oriented polypropylene (plastic), and in 1996, Australia became the first country to have a full set of circulating polymer banknotes of all denominations, completely replacing its paper banknotes. Since then, many other countries have adopted circulating polymer banknotes, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Hong Kong SAR (China), Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Zambia. Other countries have issued commemorative polymer notes, including China, Kuwait, the Northern Bank of Northern Ireland, the Bank of Scotland in Scotland, and Taiwan. In 2005, Bulgaria issued the world&#x27;s first hybrid paper-polymer banknote.

Polymer banknotes were developed to improve durability and prevent counterfeiting through incorporated security features, such as optically variable devices that are extremely difficult to reproduce.

===Other materials===
Over the years, a number of materials other than paper have been used to print banknotes. This includes various textiles, including silk, and materials such as leather.

Silk and other fibers have been commonly used in the manufacture of various banknote papers, intended to provide both additional durability and security. Crane and Company patented banknote paper with embedded silk threads in 1844 and has supplied paper to the United States Treasury since 1879. Banknotes printed on pure silk &quot;paper&quot; include &quot;emergency money&quot; Notgeld issues from a number of German towns in 1923 during a period of fiscal crisis and hyperinflation. Most notoriously, Bielefeld produced a number of silk, leather, velvet, linen and wood issues. These issues were produced primarily for collectors, rather than for circulation. They are in demand by collectors. Banknotes printed on cloth include a number of Communist Revolutionary issues in China from areas such as Xinjiang, or Sinkiang, in the United Islamic Republic of East Turkestan in 1933. Emergency money was also printed in 1902 on khaki shirt fabric during the Boer War.

Cotton fibers, together with 25% linen, are the material of the banknotes in the United States. Leather banknotes (or coins) were issued in a number of sieges, as well as in other times of emergency. During the Russian administration of Alaska, banknotes were printed on sealskin. A number of 19th-century issues are known in Germanic and Estonia, including the places of Dorpat, Pernau, Reval, Werro, and Woiseck. In addition to the Bielefeld issues, other German leather Notgeld from 1923 is known from Borna, Osterwieck, Paderborn and Pößneck.

Other issues from 1923 were printed on wood, which was also used in Canada in 1763–1764 during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, and by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In 1848, in Bohemia, wooden checkerboard pieces were used as money.

Even playing cards were used for currency in France in the early 19th century, and in French Canada from 1685 until 1757, the Colony of Louisiana, Dutch Guiana, and in the Isle of Man in the beginning of the 19th century, and again in Germany after World War I.

Most recently, Bisphenol S (BPS), has been frequently used in the production of banknotes worldwide. BPS is an endocrine disruptor that is subject to human dermal absorption through handling banknotes.

===Vertical orientation===
Vertical currency is a type of currency in which the orientation has been changed from the conventional horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation. Dowling Duncan, a self-touted multidisciplinary design studio, conducted a study in which they determined people tend to handle and deal with money vertically rather than horizontally, especially when the currency is processed through ATM and other money machines. They also note how money transactions are conducted vertically, not horizontally. Bermuda, Cape Verde, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, Switzerland, and Venezuela have adopted vertically oriented currency, though Cape Verde has now reverted to horizontal orientation.

Since 1979, Sri Lanka has printed the reverse of its banknotes vertically. Between 1993 and 2013, Brazil has printed banknotes of 5000 and 50000 cruzeiros reais and the first Brazilian real series of banknotes has the obverse in traditional horizontal layout, while the reverse is in vertical format. The 2018 Hong Kong dollar banknotes series too has the obverse in traditional horizontal layout, while the reverse is in vertical format.

Early Chinese banknotes were also vertical, due to the direction of Chinese writing.

The 2018 Canadian $10 bill featuring a portrait of Canadian civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond is presented in a vertical format. The Northern Irish £5 and £10 notes issued by Ulster Bank for 2019 were also presented in this way.

==Vending machines and banknotes==

In the late 20th century, vending machines were designed to recognize banknotes of smaller values long after they were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where inflation has not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to make dollar coins popular in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by people that they would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.

==Destruction==
A banknote is removed from circulation because of everyday wear and tear from its handling. Banknotes are passed through a banknote sorting machine to assess their authenticity and fitness for circulation, or may be classified unfit for circulation if they are worn, dirty, soiled, damaged, mutilated or torn. Unfit notes are returned to the central bank for secure online destruction by high-speed banknote sorting machines using a cross-cut shredder device similar to a paper shredder with security level P-5 (pieces smaller than 30 mm2) according to the standard DIN 66399–2. This small size decomposes a banknote into typically more than 500 tiny pieces and rules out reconstruction like a jigsaw puzzle because the shreds from many banknotes are commingled.

A subsequent briquettor compresses shredded paper material into a small cylindrical or rectangular form for disposal (e.g. landfill or burning). Before the 1990s, unfit banknotes were destroyed by incineration, with a higher risk of manipulations.

When a Federal Reserve Bank of the United States receives a cash deposit from a commercial bank or another financial institution, it checks the individual notes to determine whether they are fit for future circulation. About one-third of the notes that the Fed receives are unfit, and the Fed destroys them. US dollar banknotes last an average of more than five years.

Contaminated banknotes are also decommissioned and removed from circulation, primarily to prevent the spread of diseases. A Canadian government report indicates:

In the US, the nickname &quot;Fed Shreds&quot; refers to paper money which has been shredded after becoming unfit for circulation. Although these shredded banknotes are generally landfilled, they are sometimes sold or given away in small bags as souvenirs or as briquettes. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has also donated shredded banknotes to local farms for use in composting.

Polymer banknotes may be shredded and then melted down and recycled to form plastic products like building components, plumbing fittings, or compost bins.

==Intelligent banknote neutralisation systems==
Intelligent banknote neutralisation systems (IBNS) are security systems which render banknotes unusable by marking them permanently as stolen with a degradation agent. Marked (stained) banknotes cannot be brought back into circulation easily and can be linked to the crime scene. Today&#x27;s most used degradation agent is a special security ink which cannot be removed from the banknote easily and not without destroying the banknote itself, but other agents also exist. Today IBNSs are used to protect banknotes in automated teller machines, retail machines, and during cash-in-transit operations.

==Dynamic Intelligent Currency Encryption==
Dynamic Intelligent Currency Encryption (DICE) is a security technology introduced in 2014 by the British company EDAQS that devalues banknotes remotely that are illegal or have been stolen. The technology is based on identifiable banknotes—that could be an RFID chip or a barcode—and connects to a digital security system to verify the validity of the banknote. The company claims that the banknotes are unforgeable and contribute to solving cash-related problems as well as fighting crime and terrorism. On a related note, governments consider the DICE benefits to be a driving force behind the progressive abolition of cash because they cover and resolve almost all cash-related issues.

==Confiscation and asset forfeiture==
In the United States, there are many laws that allow the confiscation of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity. Because a significant amount of U.S. currency contains traces of cocaine and other illegal drugs, it is not uncommon for innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many people simply forfeit the money. In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of &quot;United States of America v. U.S. Currency, $30,060.00&quot; (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created a situation where the reaction of a drug-sniffing dog would not create probable cause for civil forfeiture.

<text>17 (seventeen) is the natural number following 16 and preceding 18. It is a prime number.

17 was described at MIT as &quot;the least random number&quot;, according to the Jargon File. This is supposedly because, in a study where respondents were asked to choose a random number from 1 to 20, 17 was the most common choice. This study has been repeated a number of times.

== Mathematics ==
17 is a Leyland number and Leyland prime, using 2 &amp; 3 (23 + 32) and using 4 and 5, using 3 &amp; 4 (34 - 43). 17 is a Fermat prime. 17 is one of six lucky numbers of Euler.

Since seventeen is a Fermat prime, regular heptadecagons can be constructed with a compass and unmarked ruler. This was proven by Carl Friedrich Gauss and ultimately led him to choose mathematics over philology for his studies.

The minimum possible number of givens for a sudoku puzzle with a unique solution is 17.

=== Geometric properties ===
==== Two-dimensions ====
*There are seventeen crystallographic space groups in two dimensions. These are sometimes called wallpaper groups, as they represent the seventeen possible symmetry types that can be used for wallpaper.
*Also in two dimensions, seventeen is the number of combinations of regular polygons that completely fill a plane vertex. Eleven of these belong to regular and semiregular tilings, while 6 of these (3.7.42, 3.8.24, 3.9.18, 3.10.15, 4.5.20, and 5.5.10) exclusively surround a point in the plane and fill it only when irregular polygons are included.
*Seventeen is the minimum number of vertices on a two-dimensional graph such that, if the edges are colored with three different colors, there is bound to be a monochromatic triangle; see Ramsey&#x27;s theorem.
*Either 16 or 18 unit squares can be formed into rectangles with perimeter equal to the area; and there are no other natural numbers with this property. The Platonists regarded this as a sign of their peculiar propriety; and Plutarch notes it when writing that the Pythagoreans &quot;utterly abominate&quot; 17, which &quot;bars them off from each other and disjoins them&quot;.

17 is the least formula_1 for the Theodorus Spiral to complete one revolution. This, in the sense of Plato, who questioned why Theodorus (his tutor) stopped at formula_2 when illustrating adjacent right triangles whose bases are units and heights are successive square roots, starting with formula_3. In part due to Theodorus’s work as outlined in Plato’s &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, it is believed that Theodorus had proved all the square roots of non-square integers from 3 to 17 are irrational by means of this spiral.

==== Enumeration of icosahedron stellations ====
In three-dimensional space, there are seventeen distinct fully supported stellations generated by an icosahedron. The seventeenth prime number is 59, which is equal to the total number of stellations of the icosahedron by Miller&#x27;s rules. Without counting the icosahedron as a &quot;zeroth&quot; stellation, this total becomes 58, a count equal to the sum of the first seven prime numbers (2 + 3 + 5 + 7 ... + 17). Seventeen distinct fully supported stellations are also produced by truncated cube and truncated octahedron.

==== Four-dimensional zonotopes ====
Seventeen is also the number of four-dimensional parallelotopes that are zonotopes. Another 34, or twice 17, are Minkowski sums of zonotopes with the 24-cell, itself the simplest parallelotope that is not a zonotope.

==== Abstract algebra ====

Seventeen is the highest dimension for paracompact Vineberg polytopes with rank formula_4 mirror facets, with the lowest belonging to the third.

17 is a supersingular prime, because it divides the order of the Monster group. If the Tits group is included as a &quot;non-strict&quot; group of Lie type, then there are seventeen total classes of Lie groups that are simultaneously finite and simple (see classification of finite simple groups). In base ten, (17, 71) form the seventh permutation class of permutable primes.

=== Other notable properties ===
* The sequence of residues (mod ) of a googol and googolplex, for formula_5, agree up until formula_6.
* Seventeen is the longest sequence for which a solution exists in the irregularity of distributions problem.

== Other fields ==
=== Music ===
Where Pythagoreans saw 17 in between 16 from its Epogdoon of 18 in distaste, the ratio 18:17 was a popular approximation for the equal tempered semitone (12-tone) during the Renaissance.

<text>19 (nineteen) is the natural number following 18 and preceding 20. It is a prime number.

== Mathematics ==
Nineteen is the eighth prime number.

=== Number theory ===
19 forms a twin prime with 17, a cousin prime with 23, and a sexy prime with 13. 19 is the fifth central trinomial coefficient, and the maximum number of fourth powers needed to sum up to any natural number (see, Waring&#x27;s problem). It is the number of compositions of 8 into distinct parts.

19 is the eighth strictly non-palindromic number in any base, following 11 and preceding 47. 19 is also the second octahedral number, after 6, and the sixth Heegner number. 

In the Engel expansion of pi, 19 is the seventh term following and preceding . The sum of the first terms preceding 17 is in equivalence with 19, where its prime index (8) are the two previous members in the sequence.

==== Prime properties ====
19 is the seventh Mersenne prime exponent. It is the second Keith number, and more specifically the first Keith prime. In decimal, 19 is the third full reptend prime, and the first prime number that is not a permutable prime, as its reverse (91) is composite (where 91 is also the fourth centered nonagonal number).
* 19 × 91 = 1729, the first Hardy-Ramanujan number or taxicab number, also a Harshad number in base-ten, as it&#x27;s divisible by the sum of its digits, 19.
: 1729 is also the nineteenth dodecagonal number.

19, alongside 109, 1009, and 10009, are all prime (with 109 also full reptend), and form part of a sequence of numbers where inserting a digit inside the previous term produces the next smallest prime possible, up to scale, with the composite number 9 as root. 100019 is the next such smallest prime number, by the insertion of a 1.
* Numbers of the form 10&quot;n&quot;9 equivalent to 10&quot;x&quot; + 9 with &quot;x&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + 1, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of zeros in the term, are prime for , and probably prime for .

Otherwise, formula_1 is the second base-10 repunit prime, short for the number formula_2. 

The sum of the squares of the first nineteen primes is divisible by 19.

==== Figurate numbers and magic figures ====

19 is the third centered triangular number as well as the third centered hexagonal number.
* The 19th triangular number is 190, equivalently the sum of the first 19 non-zero integers, that is also the sixth centered nonagonal number. 
: 19 is the first number in an infinite sequence of numbers in decimal whose digits start with 1 and have trailing 9&#x27;s, that form triangular numbers containing trailing zeroes in proportion to 9s present in the original number; i.e. 19900 is the 199th triangular number, and 1999000 is the 1999th. 
* Like 19, 199 and 1999 are also both prime, as are 199999 and 19999999. In fact, a number of the form 19&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of nines that terminate in the number, is prime for: 

The number of nodes in regular hexagon with all diagonals drawn is nineteen.
* Distinguishably, the only nontrivial normal magic hexagon is composed of nineteen cells, where every diagonal of consecutive hexagons has sums equal to 38, or twice 19. 
* A hexaflexagon is a strip of nineteen alternating triangular faces that can &quot;flex&quot; into a regular hexagon, such that any two of six colorings on triangles can be oriented to align on opposite sides of the folded figure.
* Nineteen is also the number of &quot;one-sided&quot; hexiamonds, meaning there are nineteen ways of arranging six equiangular triangular polyforms edge-to-edge on the plane without turn-overs (and where holes are allowed). 

formula_3 can be used to generate the first full, non-normal prime reciprocal magic square in decimal whose rows, columns &quot;and&quot; diagonals — in a 18 x 18 array — all generate a magic constant of 81 = 92. 
* The next prime number to generate a like-magic square in base-ten is 383, the seventy-sixth prime number (where 19 × 4 = 76). A regular 19 x 19 magic square, on the other hand, has a magic constant formula_4 of 3439 = 19 × 181.

==== Collatz problem ====
The Collatz sequence for nine requires nineteen steps to return to one, more than any other number below it. On the other hand, nineteen requires twenty steps, like eighteen. Less than ten thousand, only thirty-one other numbers require nineteen steps to return to one: 

=== In abstract algebra ===

The projective special linear group formula_5 represents the abstract structure of the 57-cell: a &quot;universal&quot; 4-polytope with a total of one hundred and seventy-one (171 = 9 × 19) edges and vertices, and fifty-seven (57 = 3 × 19) hemi-icosahedral cells that are self-dual.

In total, there are nineteen Coxeter groups of non-prismatic uniform honeycombs in the fourth dimension: five Coxeter honeycomb groups exist in Euclidean space, while the other fourteen Coxeter groups are compact and paracompact hyperbolic honeycomb groups. 
* There are also specifically nineteen uniform honeycombs inside the Euclidean formula_6 tesseractic honeycomb group in 4-space. In 5-space, there are nineteen uniform polytopes with formula_7 simplex symmetry. 

There are infinitely many finite-volume Vinberg polytopes up through dimension nineteen, which generate hyperbolic tilings with degenerate simplex quadrilateral pyramidal domains, as well as prismatic domains and otherwise.
* Vinberg polytopes of lowest rank mirrors exist up through the seventeenth dimension, where there exists a unique figure with nineteen facets. It is expressed with the simple Dynkin diagram, .
On the other hand, a cubic surface is the zero set in formula_8 of a homogeneous cubic polynomial in four variables formula_9 a polynomial with a total of twenty coefficients, which specifies a space for cubic surfaces that is 19-dimensional.

==== Finite simple groups ====

19 is the eighth consecutive supersingular prime. It is the middle indexed member in the sequence of fifteen such primes that divide the order of the Friendly Giant formula_10, the largest sporadic group: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71}.
* Janko groups formula_11 and formula_12 are the two-smallest of six &quot;pariah groups&quot; that are not subquotients of formula_10, which contain 19 as the largest prime number that divides their orders.
: formula_11 holds as standard generators that yield a &quot;semi-presentation&quot; where , while formula_12 holds as standard generators , where .
* formula_16 is the dimensionality of the minimal faithful complex representation of O&#x27;Nan group formula_17 — the second-largest after formula_10 of like-representation in formula_19 and largest amongst the six pariahs — whose value lies midway between primes (10939, 10949), the latter with a prime index of formula_20, which is the nineteenth tetrahedral number. 
* On the other hand, the Tits group formula_21, as the only &quot;non-strict&quot; group of Lie type that can loosely categorize as sporadic, has group order , whose prime factors (inclusive of powers) generate a sum equal to 54, which is the smallest non-trivial 19-gonal number. 

In the Happy Family of sporadic groups, nineteen of twenty-six such groups are subquotients of the Friendly Giant, which is also its own subquotient. If the Tits group is indeed included as a group of Lie type, then there are nineteen classes of finite simple groups that are not sporadic groups.

=== Heegner number ===
19 is the sixth Heegner number. 67 and 163, respectively the 19th and 38th prime numbers, are the two largest Heegner numbers, of nine total.

The sum of the first six Heegner numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, and 19 sum to the seventh member and fourteenth prime number, 43. All of these numbers are prime, aside from the unit. In particular, 163 is relevant in moonshine theory.

==Science==

* The James Webb Space Telescope&#x27;s optical elements are in an array of 19 hexagons, wherein 18 segmented primary mirrors focus light into a centered secondary mirror situated above the collecting mirrors, that in-turn reflects back onto the telescope&#x27;s central imagers. It is a shape akin to the order-3 magic hexagon.

==Religion==
===Islam===
* A group called United Submitter International claim the Quran has mathematical structure based on the number 19. The gematrical value of WAHD = 6+1+8+4=19, Wahd means &#x27;One&#x27; (God) to the first verse (1:1), known as Bas-malah, consists of 19 Arabic letters or the Quran consists of 114 (19x6) surat etc.
* The number of angels guarding Hell (&quot;Hellfire&quot;) (&quot;Saqar&quot;) according to the Qur&#x27;an: &quot;Over it are nineteen&quot; (74:30), after which the Qur&#x27;an describes this number as being &quot;a trial for those who disbelieve&quot; (74:31), a sign for people of the scripture to be &quot;convinced&quot; (74:31) and that believers &quot;will increase in faith&quot; (74:31) due to it.
* The Number of Verse and Sura together in the Qur&#x27;an which announces Jesus son of Maryam&#x27;s (Mary&#x27;s) birth (Qur&#x27;an 19:19).

===Baháʼí Faith===
In the Bábí and Baháʼí Faiths, a group of 19 is called a &quot;Váhid&quot;, a Unity (). The numerical value of this word in the Abjad numeral system is 19.
* The Baháʼí calendar is structured such that a year contains 19 months of 19 days each (along with the intercalary period of Ayyám-i-Há), as well as a 19-year cycle and a 361-year (19x19) supercycle.
*The Báb and his disciples formed a group of 19.
*There were 19 Apostles of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh.

===Celtic paganism===
19 is a sacred number of the goddess Brigid because it is said to represent the 19-year cycle of the Great Celtic Year and the amount of time it takes the Moon to coincide with the winter solstice.

==Music==
*Nineteen has been used as an alternative to twelve for a division of the octave into equal parts. This idea goes back to Salinas in the sixteenth century, and is interesting in part because it gives a system of meantone tuning, being close to 1/3 comma meantone. &quot;See 19 equal temperament.&quot;
*Some organs use the 19th harmonic to approximate a minor third.

==Literature==
*Stephen King&#x27;s eight-book epic &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; saga employs the number 19 in books &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla&quot;, &quot;The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah&quot;, &quot;The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Through the Keyhole&quot; as a mysterious and important number. They refer to the &quot;ka-tet of 19&quot;, &quot;Directive Nineteen,&quot; many names add up to 19, 19 seems to permeate every aspect of Roland and his traveler&#x27;s lives. In addition, the number ends up being a powerful key.

==Games==
*Though the maximum score for a cribbage hand is 29, there is no combination of cards that adds up to 19 points. Many cribbage players, therefore, jokingly refer to a zero-point hand as &quot;a 19 hand&quot;.

==Age 19==
*In four countries, 19 is the age of majority.
*In two countries, 19 is the minimum legal drinking age.
*In three countries, 19 is the minimum legal smoking age.
*The minimum age for the NBA draft is 19 years old.

==In sports==
* In golf, the &#x27;19th hole&#x27; is the clubhouse bar and in match play, if there is a tie after 18 holes, an extra hole(s) is played. In miniature golf, it is an extra hole on which the winner earns an instant prize.

<text>18 (eighteen) is the natural number following 17 and preceding 19. It is an even composite number.

==Mathematics==
18 is a semiperfect number and an abundant number. It is a largely composite number, as it has 6 divisors and no smaller number has more than 6 divisors. There are 18 one-sided pentominoes. In the classification of finite simple groups, there are 18 infinite families of groups. 

==In science==
===Chemistry===
* The 18-electron rule is a rule of thumb in transition metal chemistry for characterising and predicting the stability of metal complexes.

==In religion and literature==
* The Hebrew word for &quot;life&quot; is (&quot;chai&quot;), which has a numerical value of 18. Consequently, the custom has arisen in Jewish circles to give donations and monetary gifts in multiples of 18 as an expression of blessing for long life.
* In Judaism, in the Talmud; Pirkei Avot (5:25), Rabbi Yehudah ben Teime gives the age of 18 as the appropriate age to get married (&quot;Ben shmonah esra lechupah&quot;, at eighteen years old to the Chupah (marriage canopy)). (See Coming of age, Age of majority).
* Shemoneh Esrei (sh&#x27;MOH-nuh ES-ray) is a prayer that is the center of any Jewish religious service. Its name means &quot;eighteen&quot;. The prayer is also known as the Amidah.
* In Ancient Roman custom the number 18 can symbolise a blood relative.

==As lucky or unlucky number==
* In Chinese tradition, 18 is pronounced and is considered a lucky number due to similarity with &#x27;definitely get rich&#x27;, &#x27;to get rich for sure&#x27;.
*According to applications of numerology in Judaism, the letters of the word &quot;chai&quot; (&quot;living&quot;) add up to 18. Thus, 18 is considered a lucky number and many gifts for B&#x27;nai Mitzvot and weddings are in $18 increments.

==Age 18==

In most countries, 18 is the age of majority, in which a minor becomes a legal adult. It is also the voting age, marriageable age, drinking age and smoking age in most countries, though sometimes these ages are different than the age of majority. Many websites restrict adult content to visitors who claim to be at least 18 years old.

*In the United States, 18 is the:
**Age for sexual consent in eleven states and under federal law.
**Minimum age to purchase firearms in thirty-eight states with the exception of handguns (21 under federal law).
**Marriageable age without parental consent except for Nebraska (19), Mississippi, (19) and Puerto Rico (21).
**The minimum age at which one can purchase, rent, or buy tickets to NC-17-rated films or buy video games with an Adults Only rating.
*In the UK, 18 is the legal age to purchase a BBFC &quot;18&quot; rated film.
*In Japan, 18 is the minimum age at which one can purchase, rent, or buy tickets to R18+ rated movies or buy video games with a Z rating, although 20 is their cultural age of adulthood.

==In sports==
* In association football (soccer), &quot;the 18&quot; is a slang term for the penalty area.
* In Nippon Professional Baseball (Japanese baseball), No.18 is known as the Ace number.

<doc id="208296" wikidata="Q217484" url="?curid=208296" title="Screamer">
<text>The screamers are three South American bird species placed in family Anhimidae. They were thought to be related to the Galliformes because of similar bills, but are more closely related to the family Anatidae, i.e. ducks and allies, and the magpie goose, within the clade Anseriformes. The clade is exceptional within the living birds in lacking uncinate processes of ribs. The three species are: The horned screamer (&quot;Anhima cornuta&quot;); the southern screamer or crested screamer (&quot;Chauna torquata&quot;); and the northern screamer or black-necked screamer (&quot;Chauna chavaria&quot;).

==Systematics and evolution==
Screamers have a poor fossil record. A putative Eocene specimen is known from Wyoming, while the more modern &quot;Chaunoides antiquus&quot; is known from the late Oligocene to early Miocene in Brazil. Anhimids are most similar to presbyornithids, with which they form a clade to the exclusion of the rest of Anseriformes. Given the presence of lamelae in the otherwise fowl-like beaks of screamers, it is even possible that they evolved from presbyornithid-grade birds, reverting from a filter-feeding lifestyle to an herbivorous one.
==Distribution and habitat==
The three species occur only in South America, ranging from Colombia to northern Argentina. The horned screamer was once present on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, but is now extirpated from there. They are large, bulky birds, with a small downy head, long legs and large feet which are only partially webbed. They have large spurs on their wings which are used in fights over mates and territorial disputes; these can break off in the breast of other screamers, and are regularly renewed. Unlike ducks, they have a partial moult and are able to fly throughout the year. They live in open areas and marshes with some grass and feed on water plants. One species, the southern screamer, is considered a pest as it raids crops and competes with farm birds.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Screamers typical lay 4–5 white eggs, with clutches ranging between 2 and 7 . Like most Anseriformes, the chicks can run as soon as they are hatched. They can swim better than they can run, so young screamers are usually raised in or near water, where they can better avoid predators. Like ducks, screamer chicks imprint early in life. That, and their unspecialized omnivorous diet makes them amenable to domestication. They can be excellent guard animals, due to their loud alarm calls (&quot;screams&quot;) when encountering anything new and possibly threatening.

==Status and conservation==
Both the southern and the horned screamer remain widespread and are overall fairly common. In contrast, the northern screamer is relatively rare and consequently considered near threatened. They are seldom hunted, in spite of their conspicuous nature, because their flesh has a spongy texture and is riddled with air-sacs, making it highly unpalatable. The main threats are habitat destruction and increased intensification of agriculture.

<text>In ecology, primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from atmospheric or aqueous carbon dioxide. It principally occurs through the process of photosynthesis, which uses light as its source of energy, but it also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy. Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as &quot;primary producers&quot; or autotrophs, and form the base of the food chain. In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly plants, while in aquatic ecoregions algae predominate in this role. Ecologists distinguish primary production as either &quot;net&quot; or &quot;gross&quot;, the former accounting for losses to processes such as cellular respiration, the latter not.

==Overview==
Primary production is the production of chemical energy in organic compounds by living organisms. The main source of this energy is sunlight but a minute fraction of primary production is driven by lithotrophic organisms using the chemical energy of inorganic molecules.Regardless of its source, this energy is used to synthesize complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide () and water (H2O). The following two equations are simplified representations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) chemosynthesis (bottom):

::: + H2O + &quot;light&quot; → CH2O + O2
::: + O2 + 4 H2S → CH2O + 4 S + 3 H2O

In both cases, the end point is a polymer of reduced carbohydrate, (CH2O)n, typically molecules such as glucose or other sugars. These relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules, including proteins, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, or be respired to perform work. Consumption of primary producers by heterotrophic organisms, such as animals, then transfers these organic molecules (and the energy stored within them) up the food web, fueling all of the Earth&#x27;s living systems.

==Gross primary production and net primary production==
Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy, typically expressed as carbon biomass, that primary producers create in a given length of time. Some fraction of this fixed energy is used by primary producers for cellular respiration and maintenance of existing tissues (i.e., &quot;growth respiration&quot; and &quot;maintenance respiration&quot;). The remaining fixed energy (i.e., mass of photosynthate) is referred to as net primary production (NPP).

::: NPP = GPP - respiration [by plants]

Net primary production is the rate at which all the autotrophs in an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy. Net primary production is available to be directed toward growth and reproduction of primary producers. As such it is available for consumption by herbivores.

Both gross and net primary production are typically expressed in units of mass per unit area per unit time interval. In terrestrial ecosystems, mass of carbon per unit area per year (g C m−2 yr−1) is most often used as the unit of measurement. Note that a distinction is sometimes drawn between &quot;production&quot; and &quot;productivity&quot;, with the former the quantity of material produced (g C m−2), the latter the rate at which it is produced (g C m−2 yr−1), but these terms are more typically used interchangeably.

==Terrestrial production==

On the land, almost all primary production is now performed by vascular plants, with a small fraction coming from algae and non-vascular plants such as mosses and liverworts. Before the evolution of vascular plants, non-vascular plants likely played a more significant role. Primary production on land is a function of many factors, but principally local hydrology and temperature (the latter covaries to an extent with light, specifically photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the source of energy for photosynthesis). While plants cover much of the Earth&#x27;s surface, they are strongly curtailed wherever temperatures are too extreme or where necessary plant resources (principally water and PAR) are limiting, such as deserts or polar regions.

Water is &quot;consumed&quot; in plants by the processes of photosynthesis (see above) and transpiration. The latter process (which is responsible for about 90% of water use) is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants. Transpiration allows plants to transport water and mineral nutrients from the soil to growth regions, and also cools the plant. Diffusion of water vapour out of a leaf, the force that drives transpiration, is regulated by structures known as stomata. These structures also regulate the diffusion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the leaf, such that decreasing water loss (by partially closing stomata) also decreases carbon dioxide gain. Certain plants use alternative forms of photosynthesis, called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C4. These employ physiological and anatomical adaptations to increase water-use efficiency and allow increased primary production to take place under conditions that would normally limit carbon fixation by C3 plants (the majority of plant species).

As shown in the animation, the boreal forests of Canada and Russia experience high productivity in June and July and then a slow decline through fall and winter. Year-round, tropical forests in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia have high productivity, not surprising with the abundant sunlight, warmth, and rainfall. However, even in the tropics, there are variations in productivity over the course of the year. For example, the Amazon basin exhibits especially high productivity from roughly August through October - the period of the area&#x27;s dry season. Because the trees have access to a plentiful supply of ground water that builds up in the rainy season, they grow better when the rainy skies clear and allow more sunlight to reach the forest.

==Oceanic production==

In a reversal of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups. Algae encompass a diverse range of organisms, ranging from single floating cells to attached seaweeds. They include photoautotrophs from a variety of groups. Eubacteria are important photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea are phototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis. A number of eukaryotes are significant contributors to primary production in the ocean, including green algae, brown algae and red algae, and a diverse group of unicellular groups. Vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses.

Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the majority of primary production in the ocean is performed by free-living microscopic organisms called phytoplankton. Larger autotrophs, such as the seagrasses and macroalgae (seaweeds) are generally confined to the littoral zone and adjacent shallow waters, where they can attach to the underlying substrate but still be within the photic zone. There are exceptions, such as &quot;Sargassum&quot;, but the vast majority of free-floating production takes place within microscopic organisms.

The factors limiting primary production in the ocean are also very different from those on land. The availability of water, obviously, is not an issue (though its salinity can be). Similarly, temperature, while affecting metabolic rates (see Q10), ranges less widely in the ocean than on land because the heat capacity of seawater buffers temperature changes, and the formation of sea ice insulates it at lower temperatures. However, the availability of light, the source of energy for photosynthesis, and mineral nutrients, the building blocks for new growth, play crucial roles in regulating primary production in the ocean. Available Earth System Models suggest that ongoing ocean bio-geochemical changes could trigger reductions in ocean NPP between 3% and 10% of current values depending on the emissions scenario.

===Light===

The sunlit zone of the ocean is called the photic zone (or euphotic zone). This is a relatively thin layer (10–100 m) near the ocean&#x27;s surface where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur. For practical purposes, the thickness of the photic zone is typically defined by the depth at which light reaches 1% of its surface value. Light is attenuated down the water column by its absorption or scattering by the water itself, and by dissolved or particulate material within it (including phytoplankton).

Net photosynthesis in the water column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean&#x27;s surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer). The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being much deeper than the photic zone. When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur. The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth. As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth.

Both the magnitude of wind mixing and the availability of light at the ocean&#x27;s surface are affected across a range of space- and time-scales. The most characteristic of these is the seasonal cycle (caused by the consequences of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt), although wind magnitudes additionally have strong spatial components. Consequently, primary production in temperate regions such as the North Atlantic is highly seasonal, varying with both incident light at the water&#x27;s surface (reduced in winter) and the degree of mixing (increased in winter). In tropical regions, such as the gyres in the middle of the major basins, light may only vary slightly across the year, and mixing may only occur episodically, such as during large storms or hurricanes.

===Nutrients===

Mixing also plays an important role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients. Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery. Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or fecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone, and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water. This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water. Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light). However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant.

===Iron===
Another factor relatively recently discovered to play a significant role in oceanic primary production is the micronutrient iron. This is used as a cofactor in enzymes involved in processes such as nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation. A major source of iron to the oceans is dust from the Earth&#x27;s deserts, picked up and delivered by the wind as aeolian dust.

In regions of the ocean that are distant from deserts or that are not reached by dust-carrying winds (for example, the Southern and North Pacific oceans), the lack of iron can severely limit the amount of primary production that can occur. These areas are sometimes known as HNLC (High-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll) regions, because the scarcity of iron both limits phytoplankton growth and leaves a surplus of other nutrients. Some scientists have suggested introducing iron to these areas as a means of increasing primary productivity and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

== Measurement ==
The methods for measurement of primary production vary depending on whether gross vs net production is the desired measure, and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus. Gross production is almost always harder to measure than net, because of respiration, which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production (i.e. sugars) before they can be accurately measured. Also, terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to below-ground organs and tissues, where it is logistically difficult to measure. Shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem.

Scale also greatly affects measurement techniques. The rate of carbon assimilation in plant tissues, organs, whole plants, or plankton samples can be quantified by biochemically based techniques, but these techniques are decidedly inappropriate for large scale terrestrial field situations. There, net primary production is almost always the desired variable, and estimation techniques involve various methods of estimating dry-weight biomass changes over time. Biomass estimates are often converted to an energy measure, such as kilocalories, by an empirically determined conversion factor.

===Terrestrial===
In terrestrial ecosystems, researchers generally measure net primary production (NPP). Although its definition is straightforward, field measurements used to estimate productivity vary according to investigator and biome. Field estimates rarely account for below ground productivity, herbivory, turnover, litterfall, volatile organic compounds, root exudates, and allocation to symbiotic microorganisms. Biomass based NPP estimates result in underestimation of NPP due to incomplete accounting of these components. However, many field measurements correlate well to NPP. There are a number of comprehensive reviews of the field methods used to estimate NPP. Estimates of ecosystem respiration, the total carbon dioxide produced by the ecosystem, can also be made with gas flux measurements.

The major unaccounted pool is belowground productivity, especially production and turnover of roots. Belowground components of NPP are difficult to measure. BNPP (below-ground NPP) is often estimated based on a ratio of ANPP:BNPP (above-ground NPP:below-ground NPP) rather than direct measurements.

Gross primary production can be estimated from measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide made by the eddy covariance technique. During night, this technique measures all components of ecosystem respiration. This respiration is scaled to day-time values and further subtracted from NEE.

====Grasslands====

Most frequently, peak standing biomass is assumed to measure NPP. In systems with persistent standing litter, live biomass is commonly reported. Measures of peak biomass are more reliable if the system is predominantly annuals. However, perennial measurements could be reliable if there were a synchronous phenology driven by a strong seasonal climate. These methods may underestimate ANPP in grasslands by as much as 2 (temperate) to 4 (tropical) fold. Repeated measures of standing live and dead biomass provide more accurate estimates of all grasslands, particularly those with large turnover, rapid decomposition, and interspecific variation in timing of peak biomass. Wetland productivity (marshes and fens) is similarly measured. In Europe, annual mowing makes the annual biomass increment of wetlands evident.

====Forests====

Methods used to measure forest productivity are more diverse than those of grasslands. Biomass increment based on stand specific allometry plus litterfall is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of above-ground net primary production (ANPP). Field measurements used as a proxy for ANPP include annual litterfall, diameter or basal area increment (DBH or BAI), and volume increment.

===Aquatic===
In aquatic systems, primary production is typically measured using one of six main techniques:
# variations in oxygen concentration within a sealed bottle (developed by Gaarder and Gran in 1927)
# incorporation of inorganic carbon-14 (14C in the form of sodium bicarbonate) into organic matter
# Stable isotopes of Oxygen (16O, 18O and 17O)
# fluorescence kinetics (technique still a research topic)
# Stable isotopes of Carbon (12C and 13C)
# Oxygen/Argon Ratios

The technique developed by Gaarder and Gran uses variations in the concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production. Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and stoppered. The first is analysed immediately and used to determine the initial oxygen concentration; usually this is done by performing a Winkler titration. The other two vessels are incubated, one each in under light and darkened. After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured. As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration. The light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration, so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e. oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration). Gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel.

The technique of using 14C incorporation (added as labelled Na2CO3) to infer primary production is most commonly used today because it is sensitive, and can be used in all ocean environments. As 14C is radioactive (via beta decay), it is relatively straightforward to measure its incorporation in organic material using devices such as scintillation counters.

Depending upon the incubation time chosen, net or gross primary production can be estimated. Gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times (1 hour or less), since the loss of incorporated 14C (by respiration and organic material excretion / exudation) will be more limited. Net primary production is the fraction of gross production remaining after these loss processes have consumed some of the fixed carbon.

Loss processes can range between 10 and 60% of incorporated 14C according to the incubation period, ambient environmental conditions (especially temperature) and the experimental species used. Aside from those caused by the physiology of the experimental subject itself, potential losses due to the activity of consumers also need to be considered. This is particularly true in experiments making use of natural assemblages of microscopic autotrophs, where it is not possible to isolate them from their consumers.

The methods based on stable isotopes and O2/Ar ratios have the advantage of providing estimates of respiration rates in the light without the need of incubations in the dark. Among them, the method of the triple oxygen isotopes and O2/Ar have the additional advantage of not needing incubations in closed containers and O2/Ar can even be measured continuously at sea using equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS) or a membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). However, if results relevant to the carbon cycle are desired, it is probably better to rely on methods based on carbon (and not oxygen) isotopes. It is important to notice that the method based on carbon stable isotopes is not simply an adaptation of the classic 14C method, but an entirely different approach that does not suffer from the problem of lack of account of carbon recycling during photosynthesis.

===Global===
As primary production in the biosphere is an important part of the carbon cycle, estimating it at the global scale is important in Earth system science. However, quantifying primary production at this scale is difficult because of the range of habitats on Earth, and because of the impact of weather events (availability of sunlight, water) on its variability. Using satellite-derived estimates of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for terrestrial habitats and sea-surface chlorophyll for the oceans, it is estimated that the total (photoautotrophic) primary production for the Earth was 104.9 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr−1; equivalent to the non-SI Gt C yr−1). Of this, 56.4 Pg C yr−1 (53.8%), was the product of terrestrial organisms, while the remaining 48.5 Pg C yr−1, was accounted for by oceanic production.

Scaling ecosystem-level GPP estimations based on eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (see above) to regional and global values using spatial details of different predictor variables, such as climate variables and remotely sensed fAPAR or LAI led to a terrestrial gross primary production of 123±8 Gt carbon (NOT carbon dioxide) per year during 1998-2005 

In areal terms, it was estimated that land production was approximately 426 g C m−2 yr−1 (excluding areas with permanent ice cover), while that for the oceans was 140 g C m−2 yr−1. Another significant difference between the land and the oceans lies in their standing stocks - while accounting for almost half of total production, oceanic autotrophs only account for about 0.2% of the total biomass.

===Present and Past Estimates===
Present day primary productivity can be estimated through a variety of methodologies including ship-board measurements, satellites and terrestrial observatories. Historical estimates have relied on biogeochemical models and geochemical proxies. One example is using barium, where barite concentrations in marine sediments rise in line with carbon export production at the surface. 
Another example is using the triple oxygen isotopes of sulfate. 
Together these records suggest large shifts in primary production throughout Earth&#x27;s past with notable rises associated with Earth&#x27;s Great Oxidation Event (approximately 2.4 to 2.0 billion years ago) and the Neoproterozoic (approximately 1.0 to 0.54 billion years ago).

== Human impact and appropriation ==
Human societies are part of the Earth&#x27;s NPP cycle but disproportionately influence it. In 1996, Josep Garí designed a new indicator of sustainable development based precisely on the estimation of the human appropriation of NPP: he coined it &quot;HANPP&quot; (Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production) and introduced it at the inaugural conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics. HANPP has since been further developed and widely applied in research on ecological economics and in policy analysis for sustainability. HANPP represents a proxy of the human impact on nature and can be applied to different geographical and global scales.

The extensive degree of human use of the Planet&#x27;s resources, mostly via land use, results in various levels of impact on &quot;actual NPP&quot; (NPPact). Although in some regions, such as the Nile valley, irrigation has resulted in a considerable increase in primary production, in most of the Planet, there is a notable trend of &quot;NPP reduction due to land changes&quot; (ΔNPPLC) of 9.6% across global land-mass. In addition to this, end consumption by people raises the total HANPP to 23.8% of &quot;potential vegetation&quot; (NPP0). It is estimated that, in 2000, 34% of the Earth&#x27;s ice-free land area (12% cropland; 22% pasture) was devoted to human agriculture. This disproportionate amount reduces the energy available to other species, having a marked impact on biodiversity, flows of carbon, water, and energy, and ecosystem services. Scientists have questioned how large this fraction can be before these services break down. Reductions in NPP are also expected in the ocean as a result of ongoing climate change, potentially impacting marine ecosystems (~10% of global biodiversity) and goods and services (1-5% of global total) that the oceans provide.

<text>The R-S-T system is used by amateur radio operators, shortwave listeners, and other radio hobbyists to exchange information about the quality of a radio signal being received. The code is a three digit number, with one digit each for conveying an assessment of the signal&#x27;s readability, strength, and tone. The code was developed in 1934 by Amateur radio operator Arthur W. Braaten, W2BSR, and was similar to that codified in the ITU Radio Regulations, Cairo, 1938.

==Readability==
The R stands for &quot;Readability&quot;. Readability is a qualitative assessment of how easy or difficult it is to correctly copy the information being sent during the transmission. In a Morse code telegraphy transmission, readability refers to how easy or difficult it is to distinguish each of the characters in the text of the message being sent; in a voice transmission, readability refers to how easy or difficult it is for each spoken word to be understood correctly. Readability is measured on a scale of 1 to 5.

# Unreadable
# Barely readable, occasional words distinguishable
# Readable with considerable difficulty
# Readable with practically no difficulty
# Perfectly readable

==Strength==
The S stands for &quot;Strength&quot;. Strength is an assessment of how powerful the received signal is at the receiving location. Although an accurate signal strength meter can determine a quantitative value for signal strength, in practice this portion of the RST code is a qualitative assessment, often made based on the S meter of the radio receiver at the location of signal reception. &quot;Strength&quot; is measured on a scale of 1 to 9.

# Faint—signals barely perceptible
# Very weak signals
# Weak signals
# Fair signals
# Fairly good signals
# Good signals
# Moderately strong signals
# Strong signals
# Extremely strong signals

For a quantitative assessment, quality HF receivers are calibrated so that S9 on the S-meter corresponds to a signal of 50 μV at the antenna standard terminal impedance 50 ohms. One &quot;S&quot; difference should correspond to 6 dB at signal strength (2x voltage = 4x power). On VHF and UHF receivers used for weak signal communications, S9 often corresponds to 5 μV at the antenna terminal 50 ohms. Amateur radio (ham) operators may also use a signal strength of &quot;20 to 60 over 9&quot;, or &quot;+20 to +60 over 9.&quot; This is in reference to a signal that exceeds S9 on a signal meter on a HF receiver.

==Tone==
The T stands for &quot;Tone&quot; and is measured on a scale of 1 to 9. Tone only pertains to Morse code and other digital transmission modes and is therefore omitted during voice operations. With modern technology, imperfections in the quality of transmitters’ digital modulation severe enough to be detected by human ears are rare.

Suffixes were historically added to indicate other signal properties, and might be sent as 599K to indicate a clear, strong signal but with bothersome key clicks.
==Variations==
An example RST report for a voice transmission is &quot;59&quot;, usually pronounced &quot;five nine&quot; or &quot;five by nine&quot;, a report that indicates a perfectly readable and very strong signal. Exceptionally strong signals are designated by the quantitative number of decibels, in excess of &quot;S9&quot;, displayed on the receiver&#x27;s S meter. Example: &quot;Your signal is 30 dB over S9,&quot; or more simply, &quot;Your signal is 30 over 9.&quot;

Because the N character in Morse code requires less time to send than the 9, during amateur radio contests where the competing amateur radio stations are all using Morse code, the nines in the RST are typically abbreviated to N to read 5NN. In general, this practice is referred to as abbreviated or &quot;cut&quot; numbers.

The RSQ system has also been proposed for digital modes as an alternative to the RST system. The Q replaces &quot;Tone&quot; with &quot;Quality&quot; on a similar 1-9 scale indicating presence or number of unwanted &#x27;sidebar pairs&#x27; in a narrow-band digital mode, such as PSK31 or RTTY.

<text>Shyness (also called diffidence) is the feeling of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness especially when a person is around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people; a shy person may simply opt to avoid these situations. Although shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem, the primary defining characteristic of shyness is a fear of what other people will think of a person&#x27;s behavior. This fear of negative reactions such as being mocked, humiliated or patronized, criticized or rejected can cause a shy person to retreat. Stronger forms of shyness can be referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.

== Origins ==

The initial cause of shyness varies. Scientists believe that they have located genetic data supporting the hypothesis that shyness is, at least, partially genetic. However, there is also evidence that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their shyness. This includes child abuse, particularly emotional abuse such as ridicule. Shyness can originate after a person has experienced a physical anxiety reaction; at other times, shyness seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. Shyness differs from social anxiety, which is a narrower, often depression-related psychological condition including the experience of fear, apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing panic.

Shyness may come from genetic traits, the environment in which a person is raised and personal experiences. Shyness may be a personality trait or can occur at certain stages of development in children.

=== Genetics and heredity ===

Shyness is often seen as a hindrance to people and their development. The cause of shyness is often disputed but it is found that fear is positively related to shyness, suggesting that fearful children are much more likely to develop being shy as opposed to children less fearful. Shyness can also be seen on a biological level as a result of an excess of cortisol. When cortisol is present in greater quantities, it is known to suppress an individual&#x27;s immune system, making them more susceptible to illness and disease. The genetics of shyness is a relatively small area of research that has been receiving an even smaller amount of attention, although papers on the biological bases of shyness date back to 1988. Some research has indicated that shyness and aggression are related—through long and short forms of the gene DRD4, though considerably more research on this is needed. Further, it has been suggested that shyness and social phobia (the distinction between the two is becoming ever more blurred) are related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. As with other studies of behavioral genetics, the study of shyness is complicated by the number of genes involved in, and the confusion in defining, the phenotype. Naming the phenotype – and translation of terms between genetics and psychology — also causes problems.

Several genetic links to shyness are current areas of research. One is the serotonin transporter promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), the long form of which has been shown to be modestly correlated with shyness in grade school children. Previous studies had shown a connection between this form of the gene and both obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism. Mouse models have also been used, to derive genes suitable for further study in humans; one such gene, the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene (which encodes an enzyme that functions in GABA synthesis), has so far been shown to have some association with behavioral inhibition.

Another gene, the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III polymorphism, had been the subject of studies in both shyness and aggression and is currently the subject of studies on the &quot;novelty seeking&quot; trait. A 1996 study of anxiety-related traits (shyness being one of these) remarked that, &quot;Although twin studies have indicated that individual variation in measures of anxiety-related personality traits is 40-60% heritable, none of the relevant genes has yet been identified&quot;, and that &quot;10 to 15 genes might be predicted to be involved&quot; in the anxiety trait. Progress has been made since then, especially in identifying other potential genes involved in personality traits, but there has been little progress made towards confirming these relationships. The long version of the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is now postulated to be correlated with shyness, but in the 1996 study, the short version was shown to be related to anxiety-based traits.

Thalia Eley, professor of developmental behavioural genetics at King&#x27;s College London, argues that only about 30% of shyness as a trait is genetically inherited, while the rest emerges as a response to the environment.

=== As a symptom of mercury poisoning ===

Excessive shyness, embarrassment, self-consciousness and timidity, social-phobia and lack of self-confidence are also components of erethism, which is a symptom complex that appears in cases of mercury poisoning.

=== Prenatal development ===

The prevalence of shyness in some children can be linked to day length during pregnancy, particularly during the midpoint of prenatal development. An analysis of longitudinal data from children living at specific latitudes in the United States and New Zealand revealed a significant relationship between hours of day length during the midpoint of pregnancy and the prevalence of shyness in children. &quot;The odds of being classified as shy were 1.52 times greater for children exposed to shorter compared to longer daylengths during gestation.&quot; In their analysis, scientists assigned conception dates to the children relative to their known birth dates, which allowed them to obtain random samples from children who had a mid-gestation point during the longest hours of the year and the shortest hours of the year (June and December, depending on whether the cohorts were in the United States or New Zealand).

The longitudinal survey data included measurements of shyness on a five-point scale based on interviews with the families being surveyed, and children in the top 25th percentile of shyness scores were identified. The data revealed a significant co-variance between the children who presented as being consistently shy over a two-year period, and shorter day length during their mid-prenatal development period. &quot;Taken together, these estimates indicate that about one out of five cases of extreme shyness in children can be associated with gestation during months of limited daylength.&quot;

=== Low birth weights ===

In recent years correlations between birth weight and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at low birth weights are more likely to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights. These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.

== Personality trait ==
Shyness is most likely to occur during unfamiliar situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself. Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a child who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when older and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong character trait. Longitudinal data suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy – easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult – tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency to internalize or externalize problems. This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend to internalize their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety. Humans experience shyness to different degrees and in different areas.

Shyness can also be seen as an academic determinant. It has been determined that there is a negative relationship between shyness and classroom performance. As the shyness of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.

Shyness may involve the discomfort of difficulty in knowing what to say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves a combination of both symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.

Those who are shy are perceived more negatively, in cultures that value sociability, because of the way they act towards others. Shy individuals are often distant during conversations, which can result in others forming poor impressions of them and considering them stand-offish, egoist or snobbish. People who are not shy may be up-front, aggressive, or critical towards shy people in an attempt &quot;to get them out of their shell&quot;. Even when an attempt to draw out a shy person is conducted in a kindly and well-intentioned manner the exercise may still backfire, as by focusing attention on the individual it increases their self-consciousness and sense of awkwardness.

== Concepts ==

=== Versus introversion ===

The term shyness may be implemented as a lay blanket-term for a family of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including timidity (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one&#x27;s low confidence). Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or introversion, a character trait which causes an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence. Introversion is commonly mistaken for shyness. However, introversion is a personal preference, while shyness stems from distress.

Rather, according to professor of psychology Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts &quot;choose&quot; to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations. Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of shyness or introversion may reinforce a shy or introverted individual&#x27;s low self-confidence.

Both shyness and introversion can outwardly manifest with socially withdrawn behaviors, such as tendencies to avoid social situations, especially when they are unfamiliar. A variety of research suggests that shyness and introversion possess clearly distinct motivational forces and lead to uniquely different personal and peer reactions and therefore cannot be described as theoretically the same, with Susan Cain&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2012) further discerning introversion as involving being &quot;differently&quot; social (preferring one-on-one or small group interactions) rather than being &quot;anti&quot;-social altogether.

Research suggests that no unique physiological response, such as an increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively as a threat to group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.

=== Versus social phobia (social anxiety disorder) ===
An extreme case of shyness is identified as a psychiatric illness, which made its debut as social phobia in DSM-III in 1980, but was then described as rare. By 1994, however, when DSM-IV was published, it was given a second, alternative name in parentheses (social anxiety disorder) and was now said to be relatively common, affecting between 3 and 13% of the population at some point during their lifetime. Studies examining shy adolescents and university students found that between 12 and 18% of shy individuals meet criteria for social anxiety disorder.

Shyness affects people mildly in unfamiliar social situations where one feels anxiety about interacting with new people. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, is a strong irrational fear of interacting with people, or being in situations which may involve public scrutiny, because one feels overly concerned about being criticized if one embarrasses oneself. Physical symptoms of social phobia can include blushing, shortness of breath, trembling, increased heart rate, and sweating; in some cases, these symptoms are intense enough and numerous enough to constitute a panic attack. Shyness, on the other hand, may incorporate many of these symptoms, but at a lower intensity, infrequently, and does not interfere tremendously with normal living.

=== Social versus behavioral inhibition ===

Those considered shy are also said to be &quot;socially inhibited&quot;. Social inhibition is the conscious or unconscious constraint by a person of behavior of a social nature. In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe. Being socially inhibited is good when preventing one from harming another and bad when causing one to refrain from participating in class discussions.

&quot;Behavioral inhibition&quot; is a temperament or personality style that predisposes a person to become fearful, distressed and withdrawn in novel situations. This personality style is associated with the development of anxiety disorders in adulthood, particularly social anxiety disorder.

== Misconceptions and negative aspects ==

Many misconceptions/stereotypes about shy individuals exist in Western culture and negative peer reactions to &quot;shy&quot; behavior abound. This takes place because individualistic cultures place less value on quietness and meekness in social situations, and more often reward outgoing behaviors. Some misconceptions include viewing introversion and social phobia synonymous with shyness, and believing that shy people are less intelligent.

=== Intelligence ===

No correlation (positive or negative) exists between intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy children have a harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize), and because they do not engage actively in discussions teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that whereas shyness may limit academic engagement, it is unrelated to actual academic knowledge. Depending on the level of a teacher&#x27;s own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies may be used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals&#x27; intelligence more positively.

== Benefits ==

Thomas Benton claims that because shy people &quot;have a tendency toward self-criticism, they are often high achievers, and not just in solitary activities like research and writing. Perhaps even more than the drive toward independent achievement, shy people long to make connections to others often through altruistic behavior.&quot; Susan Cain describes the benefits that shy people bring to society that US cultural norms devalue. Without characteristics that shy people bring to social interactions, such as sensitivity to the emotions of others, contemplation of ideas, and valuable listening skills, there would be no balance to society. In earlier generations, such as the 1950s, society perceived shyness as a more socially attractive trait, especially in women, indicating that views on shyness vary by culture.

Sociologist Susie Scott challenged the interpretation and treatment of shyness as being pathological. &quot;By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that this is also a &quot;socially oriented&quot; state of mind that is &quot;socially&quot; produced and managed.&quot; She explores the idea that &quot;shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual&quot;, and concludes that, to some extent, &quot;we are all impostors, faking our way through social life&quot;. One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: &quot;Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, &#x27;hey, it&#x27;s not MY problem, it&#x27;s society&#x27;s&#x27;. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than &#x27;normals&#x27;. I shouldn&#x27;t have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs.&quot;

== Different cultural views ==

In cultures that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can be perceived as weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people may be perceived as being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.

In cultures that value autonomy, shyness is often analyzed in the context of being a social dysfunction, and is frequently contemplated as a personality disorder or mental health issue. Some researchers are beginning to study comparisons between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, to examine the role that shyness might play in matters of social etiquette and achieving group-oriented goals. &quot;Shyness is one of the emotions that may serve as behavioral regulators of social relationships in collectivistic cultures. For example, social shyness is evaluated more positively in a collectivistic society, but negatively evaluated in an individualistic society.&quot;

In a cross-cultural study of Chinese and Canadian school children, researchers sought to measure several variables related to social reputation and peer relationships, including &quot;shyness-sensitivity.&quot; Using peer nomination questionnaire, students evaluated their fellow students using positive and negative playmate nominations. &quot;Shyness-sensitivity was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of peer acceptance in the Canadian sample. Inconsistent with Western results, it was found that items describing shyness-sensitivity were separated from items assessing isolation in the factor structure for the Chinese sample. Shyness-sensitivity was positively associated with sociability-leadership and with peer acceptance in the Chinese sample.&quot;

=== Western perceptions ===

In some Western cultures shyness-inhibition plays an important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.

British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is not mere self-consciousness, but a primitive suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which needs to be uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.

For Charles Darwin shyness was an &quot;odd state of mind&quot;, appearing to offer no benefit to our species, and since the 1970s the modern tendency in psychology has been to see shyness as pathology. However, evolutionary survival advantages of careful temperaments over adventurous temperaments in dangerous environments have also been recognized.

=== Eastern perceptions ===
In Eastern cultures shyness-inhibition in school-aged children is seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well by peers and are accepted. They tend to be seen as competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals are also more likely to attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness or depression as in the West. In Eastern cultures, being shy and inhibited is perceived as a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.

=== Examples of shyness and inhibition ===

In Hispanic cultures shyness and inhibition with authority figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers in front of others, because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy when they are not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore it is common for Hispanic students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.

Cultures in which the community is closed and based on agriculture (Kenya, India, etc.) experience lower social engagement than those in more open communities (United States, Okinawa, etc.) where interactions with peers are encouraged. Children in Mayan, Indian, Mexican, and Kenyan cultures are less expressive in social styles during interactions and they spend little time engaged in socio-dramatic activities. They are also less assertive in social situations. Self-expression and assertiveness in social interactions are related to shyness and inhibition in that when one is shy or inhibited one exhibits little or no expressive tendencies. Assertiveness is demonstrated in the same way, being shy and inhibited lessen one&#x27;s chances of being assertive because of a lack of confidence.

In Italian culture emotional expressiveness during interpersonal interaction is encouraged. From a young age children engage in debates or discussions that encourage and strengthen social assertiveness. Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.

== Intervention and treatment ==

Psychological methods and pharmaceutical drugs are commonly used to treat shyness in individuals who feel crippled because of low self-esteem and psychological symptoms, such as depression or loneliness. According to research, early intervention methods that expose shy children to social interactions involving team work, especially team sports, decrease their anxiety in social interactions and increase their all around self-confidence later on. Implementing such tactics could prove to be an important step in combating the psychological effects of shyness that make living normal life difficult for anxious individuals.

One important aspect of shyness is social skills development. If schools and parents implicitly &quot;assume&quot; children are fully capable of effective social interaction, social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing). As a result, shy students are not given an opportunity to develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.

<text>A zeppelin bend (also known as the Rosendahl Bend) is an end-to-end joining knot formed by two symmetrically interlinked overhand knots. It is stable, secure, and highly resistant to jamming. It is also resistant to the effects of slack shaking and cyclic loading.
==History==

The name &quot;Zeppelin&quot; was given to this knot in a Boating (1976 March) article by editors Bob &amp; Lee Paine, ostensibly reporting the testimony of someone claiming knowledge of the knot&#x27;s history in the USNavy. The article asserts that then Cmdr. Charles Rosendahl, commander of the airship Los Angeles, insisted that only this knot was to be used in joining airship ropes. However, in a note a newsletter editor seeking permission to re-publish their article, Lee Paine wrote that then-retired Vice Admiral Rosendahl commented on the Boating article to say that he knew nothing of the knot (and he also corrected where airship training occurred). Dr Giles Camplin, a student of airships, notes that a rolling hitch (#1735) is a more likely method used by ground handlers to join ropes. And other historical sources show that a &#x27;toggle&#x27; was used to connect mooring lines with fixed eye splice terminations. Dr Camplin&#x27;s report was published in issue #60 of &#x27;Dirigible&#x27; in 2010. In a small publication, Potomac Caver, Bob Thrun published his discovery in 1966, calling it --his article title-- simply &#x27;An easily untied bend&#x27;. Bob Thrun was well known in the caving community as fastidious for details in mapping caves.
Although some users regard (what might be better named) &quot;Thrun&#x27;s Joint&quot; as a nearly ideal rope joining knot, it is not very well known; it is not added into the (1944) &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abok_bend_note&quot;&gt; (although &quot;Hunter&#x27;s/Rigger&#x27;s&quot; bend was added ca. 1983).

==Tying==
Fundamentally, the zeppelin bend is formed from two superposed loops of &quot;opposite&quot; chirality. This is in contrast to the rigger&#x27;s bend (AKA Hunter&#x27;s bend, #1425A) which is formed from two inter-linked loops of the &quot;same&quot; chirality. 

Chirality refers to the &quot;handedness&quot; of the loop, which can be either left (designated &quot;S&quot;) or right (designated &quot;Z&quot;). The chirality of a loop cannot be changed by flipping or turning it over – in the same way, a left shoe cannot be transformed into a right shoe by flipping or turning it over (it is always a left shoe).

The zeppelin bend is difficult to tie while ropes are under tension (which is further obvious evidence that it wasn&#x27;t used with mooring lines during ground handling of airships). In fact, with any &#x27;end-to-end joining knot&#x27; (i.e. bend), existing tension in the ropes makes the tying process extremely difficult (if not impossible). The zeppelin is therefore tied with two loose ends (i.e. no existing tension) ending with a simple knot on each, but woven to each other in a pattern specific to zeppelin. Butterfly bend, Hunter&#x27;s bend, and Ashley&#x27;s bend also weave one simple knot on either end but use their own different patterns. 

# Form a loop in each of the ends of rope (one loop must be &quot;S&quot; and the other must be &quot;Z&quot; chirality)
# Superpose (overlay) one loop over the other, orienting each loop so that both working ends face outwards/away from the central overlap.
# Feed each working end though the central overlap of the two loops, ensuring that each working end goes in &quot;opposite&quot; directions.
# Dress and set the knot by sequentially pulling on all four rope segments.
# To untie, loosen the collars that form around each Standing Part (SPart).
Another method of remembering this knot is to visualize a &quot;69&quot;. To tie the knot with this method, follow the steps below:
# Make a &quot;6&quot; with one line (rope) end. It is important that the working end (the free, short end) winds up on top of the standing end for the &quot;6&quot;. 
# Make a &quot;9&quot; with the other line end. Make sure that the working end (the free, short end) winds up on the bottom of the standing end
# While keeping the 6 and the 9 intact, place the &quot;6&quot; over the &quot;9&quot;, with the holes of each number lining up, making absolutely sure the working ends are on opposite sides of the holes, and both working ends are outside, not in between the standing ends. 
# wrap the &quot;tail&quot; of the &quot;6&quot; first down, around both lines/hole edges, and up through the middle (circle) part of your &quot;69&quot;.
# wrap the &quot;tail&quot; part of the &quot;9&quot; up, around both lines/hole edges, and down through the middle (circle) part of your &quot;69&quot;, it should pass along to the other working end in the opposite direction.
# Pull each standing end while ensuring that the working ends are not pulled back out from the &quot;69&quot; holes to tighten. Pull each working end to tighten even more.

==Variants==

===Corresponding eye (loop) knots===
Every end-to-end joining knot, or &#x27;bend&#x27;, has four corresponding eye knots.

The usual method of creating an eye knot from a bend is by linking a tail with a Standing Part (SPart). Eye knots formed by linking of the two tails or the two SParts are usually of less utility due to the loading profile thus created.

The Zeppelin loop is quite useful and is also jam resistant, being formed by linking a tail to an SPart.
An example of a Zeppelin loop is found at this website: https://knots.neocities.org/zeppelinloop.html 

===Slipped===
Having on both ends, an elbow of the end rather than the end itself, cross the knot center, gives a single or double slipped version. It is still easier to untie by pulling the opposing bridges away from each other rather than by pulling the slipped end(s). The slipped Zeppelin bend can also be locked by pushing ends respectively through the eye of its own slip on the opposite side.
===Tied with bights===
If instead of two ends, one forms two bights of the same rope, then three reliable loops are created; a loop at each of the two bights, and a third formed by the rope section connecting the two bights. These versions also have the same advantage with less curvature nearest the main ropes, thus having a higher break strength and being as easy to untie. This is also a way to shorten the rope, and/or to isolate up to three weak rope sections near each other.

<doc id="208309" wikidata="Q5299975" url="?curid=208309" title="Double bowline">
<text>A double bowline (or round turn bowline) is a type of loop knot. Instead of the single turn of the regular bowline, the double bowline uses a round turn. This forms a more secure loop than a standard bowline.

==Naming==
Though called &quot;double bowline&quot; by Clifford Ashley, this name is also reasonably descriptive of a different knot: the bowline on a bight. Because of this ambiguity
some sources differentiate by using one of the alternate names above. And at least one other source uses the name &quot;double bowline&quot; for a mid-line loop knot made by tying a basic bowline with a bight of rope instead of the end.

==Tying==
First, learn to tie the bowline by laying the working end on the standing part and twisting to form a loop (the &quot;hole&quot; that the rabbit comes out of). Wrap the loop once more around the working end. Then pass the working end behind the standing part and back down through the double loop.

==Uses==
The double bowline is one of the typical tie-in knots used in climbing, along with the figure eight follow through and the Yosemite bowline. The advantage of the double bowline over the figure 8 is that it is easier to untie after being weighted in a fall, and so is used by sport climbers who take multiple lead falls and then have trouble untying their figure eights. The disadvantages of the double bowline are that it is less secure than a figure eight knot, takes longer to tie, and is not as easy to check. Unlike the figure eight, there are many variations of the bowline, with ambiguous names, and some are not safe for climbing.

The Bowline on a bight, when re-threaded instead of being tied on a bight, can also be used for tying into a climbing harness and provides more strength and security than the double bowline.

<doc id="208311" wikidata="Q1402851" url="?curid=208311" title="Chorioretinitis">
<text>Chorioretinitis is an inflammation of the choroid (thin pigmented vascular coat of the eye) and retina of the eye. It is a form of posterior uveitis. Inflammation of these layers can lead to vision-threatening complications. If only the choroid is inflamed, not the retina, the condition is termed choroiditis. The ophthalmologist&#x27;s goal in treating these potentially blinding conditions is to eliminate the inflammation and minimize the potential risk of therapy to the patient.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms may include the presence of floating black spots, blurred vision, pain or redness in the eye, sensitivity to light, or excessive tearing.

==Causes==
Chorioretinitis is often caused by toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus infections (mostly seen in immunodeficient subjects such as people with HIV/AIDS or on immunosuppressant drugs). Congenital toxoplasmosis via transplacental transmission can also lead to sequelae such as chorioretinitis along with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Other possible causes of chorioretinitis are syphilis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, onchocerciasis, or West Nile virus. Chorioretinitis may also occur in presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS); despite its name, the relationship of POHS to &quot;Histoplasma&quot; is controversial.

==Diagnosis==
In general, the diagnosis of chorioretinitis is based on direct examination of active chorioretinal inflammation and/or by detection of leukocytes in the vitreous humor on ophthalmic examination.

==Treatment==
Chorioretinitis is usually treated with a combination of corticosteroids and antibiotics. However, if there is an underlying cause such as HIV, specific therapy can be started as well.

A 2012 Cochrane Review found weak evidence suggesting that ivermectin could result in reduced chorioretinal lesions in patients with onchocercal eye disease. More research is needed to support this finding.

<text>Vatche Arslanian (1955 – April 8, 2003) was a member of the Canadian Red Cross and head of logistics for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Iraq. He was one of the six ICRC delegates who chose to stay in the country during the 2003 Iraq war and continue helping local relief workers. He was killed by gunfire in Baghdad while travelling with two local Red Cross workers, who were able to escape. Five other civilian vehicles were caught in crossfire, and thirteen people were killed in total.

Arslanian was a Canadian-Armenian citizen who emigrated from Syria. He worked for the Canadian military for a number of years and moved to Oromocto, New Brunswick when he was transferred to CFB Gagetown to serve as captain at the artillery school. He was released from service in 1995 when he refused a transfer to CFB Shilo in Manitoba. He insisted on remaining in Oromocto to continue his efforts to reunite his family.

From 1992 to 1998 Arslanian served on the Oromocto town council; he served as deputy mayor for part of this period.

In 1999, Arslanian began his association with the Red Cross. He volunteered to help at CFB Gagetown which was receiving over 1,000 Kosovar refugees. He did his first overseas work with the ICRC in 2000, when he served as a logistician in the former Soviet Union republic of Georgia.

Since July 17, 2001, Arslanian had been in charge of logistics for the ICRC in Iraq. Balthasar Staehelin, ICRC delegate-general for the Middle East and North Africa, said &quot;the courageous decision by six ICRC expatriates to stay in Baghdad voluntarily and work alongside their local colleagues during the worst of the fighting made a marked difference to the lives of thousands of people. Arslanian was one of those six, and we can find some solace in knowing that he helped to make that difference.&quot;

<text>The Coalition Provisional Authority (; , CPA) was a transitional government of Iraq established following the invasion of the country on 19 March 2003 by U.S.-led Coalition forces. The invasion marked the fall of the Ba&#x27;athist regime led by Saddam Hussein.

Citing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003) and the laws of war, the CPA was established in May 2003 and vested itself with executive, legislative, and judiciary authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA&#x27;s inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.

The CPA was admonished for its mismanagement of funds allocated to the reconstruction of post-invasion Iraq, with over $8 billion of these unaccounted for, including over $1.6 billion in cash that emerged in a basement in Lebanon.

== History of the CPA ==
The Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (; , ORHA) was established on 20 January 2003 by the United States government two months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It was intended to act as a caretaker administration in Iraq until the creation of a democratically elected civilian government.

Retired United States Army Lieutenant General Jay Garner was appointed as the Director of ORHA, along with three deputies, including British Major-General Tim Cross, in 2003. Upon the dissolution of ORHA and the creation of the CPA, he then became the first chief executive of the CPA. Due to his past military experiences in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and his reconstruction efforts in northern Iraq during Operation Provide Comfort, Garner&#x27;s credentials and close ties to the U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made him an obvious choice for the task. His term, however, lasted only from 21 April 2003 until he was replaced abruptly less than a month later by Paul Bremer on 11 May 2003.

Garner&#x27;s swift dismissal from his post by U.S. authorities came as a surprise to many within the CPA. In an interview with the BBC program &quot;Newsnight&quot; Garner publicly stated that his preference was to put the Iraqi people in charge as soon as possible and to do it with some form of elections.

Upon assuming the post of chief executive of the CPA in May 2003, Paul Bremer also assumed the title of U.S. Presidential Envoy and Administrator in Iraq. He was frequently called Ambassador by numerous media organizations and the White House because it was the highest government rank he had achieved (Ambassador to Netherlands). But Bremer was not ambassador to Iraq, and there was no U.S. diplomatic mission in Iraq until June 2004, after the CPA transferred sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government. At the CPA, Bremer moved quickly to install opaque and corruption-prone methods for the withdrawal and transportation of extremely large amounts of cash often transported from the US to Iraq by C-17 transport plane.

The CPA was created and funded as a division of the United States Department of Defense, and as Administrator, Bremer reported directly to the Secretary of Defense. Although troops from several of the coalition countries were present in Iraq at this time, the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) was the primary military apparatus charged with providing direct combat support to the CPA to enforce its authority during the occupation of Iraq.

While many of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ornate palaces were looted in the days immediately following the invasion, most of the physical structures themselves survived relatively intact. It is in these numerous palaces situated throughout the country that the CPA chose to set up office in order to govern. Several of these palaces were retained by the U.S. government even after the transition of power back to the Iraqi people. The administration was centered in a district of Baghdad known as the Green Zone, which eventually became a highly secure walled-off enclave.

The CPA was also responsible for administering the Development Fund for Iraq during the year following the invasion. This fund superseded the earlier UN Oil-for-food programme, and provided funding for Iraq&#x27;s wheat purchase program, the currency exchange program, the electricity and oil infrastructure programs, equipment for Iraq&#x27;s security forces, Iraqi civil service salaries, and the operations of the various government ministries.

The first act of the CPA under Bremer, Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1, was to order the de-Ba&#x27;athification of Iraqi society. On 23 May, Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2 formally disbanded the Iraqi army, as well as other public servants including nurses and doctors and eventually led to the direct unemployment of more than 500,000 Iraqi citizens. On 22 July 2003, the CPA formed the Iraqi Governing Council and appointed its members. The Council membership consisted largely of Iraqi expatriates who had previously fled the country during the rule of Saddam Hussein and also with many outspoken dissidents who had been persecuted by the former Ba&#x27;athist regime. The CPA under Bremer then went on to privatise and sell off publicly owned assets and companies to multinational companies, whilst setting about issuing unilaterally developed decrees such as Order 37 and Order 39, which reduced Iraq&#x27;s corporation tax from 40% to 15% and allowed foreign entities to enjoy 100% ownership of Iraqi assets.

Though still subordinate to the CPA, the Iraqi Governing Council had several key responsibilities of its own: appointing representatives to the United Nations, appointing interim ministers to Iraq&#x27;s vacant cabinet positions, and drafting a temporary constitution known as the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), which would be used to govern Iraq until a permanent constitution could be written and approved by the general electorate.

In the late afternoon of 14 December 2003, the CPA held a press conference at the Iraqi Forum convention center within Baghdad&#x27;s Green Zone to announce that former President of Iraq Saddam Hussein had been taken into custody the previous night from a foxhole in a town near Saddam&#x27;s home town of Tikrit, Iraq. Present at the announcement was Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez of the U.S. Army, Administrator Bremer, members of the British and American intelligence agencies, several members of the Iraqi Governing Council, and a large room full of journalists representing news organizations from around the world.

In order to defeat possible insurgent planning and under pressure from the Bush White House which wanted the occupation to end by the 2004 presidential election, the CPA transferred power to the newly appointed Iraqi Interim Government at 10:26 AM local time on 28 June 2004. The transfer of power was originally scheduled for 30 June 2004, but because of a concern that the transfer would lead to insurgent attacks the ceremony was held, unannounced, two days ahead of schedule. The transfer took place behind closed doors with little fanfare. With the CPA disbanded, Bremer left Iraq that same day.

The United States hoped that Iraq could be reconstructed and democratized in much the same way as Japan and Germany were after the Second World War, using them as &quot;examples or even models of successful military occupations.&quot;

==Structure of the CPA==
The CPA was divided into four geographic regions. CPA North was headquartered in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, CPA Central in Baghdad at Saddam&#x27;s former Republican Palace, CPA South Central in the Iraqi city of Hillah near the ruins of Babylon and CPA South in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Each region operated semi-autonomously, and all four had the same common goals for reconstruction of the country. Throughout the existence of the CPA, the security situation and levels of civil unrest throughout the country varied by region, and these variances were reflected in the different levels of program
successes within the CPA divisions.

===Non-government organizations and private charities and the CPA===

====Role of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB)====
United Nations resolution 1483 transferred the authority to authorize expenditures from Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue from the United Nations to the Coalition Provisional Authority—under certain conditions, including:
* The expenditures were made in an open, transparent manner.
* The expenditures were subject to the supervision of a blue ribbon panel of international financial experts, the IAMB.
* Spending decisions were to be made with meaningful Iraqi input.

The International Advisory and Monitoring Board consisted of senior financial experts from the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development.

The IAMB had serious concerns over the CPA&#x27;s lack of transparency and lack of adequate financial controls, which were never resolved. The IAMB still exists and is playing a role in the investigations into the CPA&#x27;s financial management.

===The CPA&#x27;s Program Review Board===
The Program Review Board (PRB) was an eleven-member board that consisted of ten staff members from the CPA and one member of the Iraqi Governing Council. The chair of the board was also the CPA&#x27;s senior advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance.

It was the board&#x27;s responsibility to review and make recommendations to the CPA administrator on which contracts should be awarded. In order to ensure transparency, all key discussions regarding the pros and cons of the programs under consideration were to be made public. The CPA administrator was supposed to make decisions on the awarding of contracts only after receiving a recommendation from this committee.

The Notes on Internal Control from KPMG&#x27;s audit of DFI expenditures was particularly critical of PRB record-keeping&#x27;s failing to fulfill the CPA&#x27;s transparency obligation. In particular:
* Meetings were held in which attendance was not recorded.
* Meetings were held in which decisions were made in the absence of quorums.
* The Program Review Board never recorded the motions to approve expenditures, who seconded motions, or which members were for or against those motions.
* In the 43 meetings held in 2003, the single Iraqi member of the board attended only two meetings.
* The minutes failed to contain sufficient detail for readers to understand why programs were approved.
* Program decisions that had been tabled were later approved informally outside the meetings, with no recording of the reasoning behind the decision.
* The board chair refused to certify the accuracy of the Board&#x27;s bookkeeping.

== Privatization of Iraq&#x27;s economy ==
Prior to US occupation, Iraq had a centrally planned economy. Among other things, it prohibited foreign ownership of Iraqi businesses, ran most large industries as state-owned enterprises, and imposed large tariffs to keep out foreign goods. After the invasion of Iraq, the CPA quickly began issuing many binding orders privatizing Iraq&#x27;s economy and opening it up to foreign investment.

CPA Order 39, entitled &quot;Foreign Investment,&quot; provided that &quot;A foreign investor shall be entitled to make foreign investments in Iraq on terms no less favorable than those applicable to an Iraqi investor,&quot; and that &quot;[t]he amount of foreign participation in newly formed or existing business entities in Iraq shall not be limited...&quot; Additionally, the foreign investor &quot;shall be authorized to... transfer abroad without delay all funds associated with its foreign investment, including shares or profits and dividends...&quot;. Critics assert that the CPA drastically altered Iraq&#x27;s economy, allowing virtually unlimited and unrestricted foreign investment and placing no limitations on the expatriation of profit. These policies were in accord with international standards on foreign direct investment to which most of the richer countries adhered to at the time. The order concluded, &quot;Where an international agreement to which Iraq is a party provides for more favorable terms with respect to foreign investors undertaking investment activities in Iraq, the more favorable terms under the international agreement shall apply.&quot; According to critics, this order was designed to create as favorable an environment for foreign investors as possible, thereby allowing American and multinational corporations to dominate Iraq&#x27;s economy. Others argue the CPA considered free market reform essential for Iraq&#x27;s oil wealth to generate sustainable growth and development, instead of consigning Iraq to a resource trap by maintaining the laws of the previous totalitarian regime.

CPA Order 17 granted all foreign contractors operating in Iraq immunity from &quot;Iraqi legal process,&quot; effectively granting immunity from any kind of suit, civil or criminal, for actions the contractors engaged in within Iraq. CPA Order 49 provided a tax cut for corporations operating within Iraq. It reduced the rate from a maximum of 40% to a maximum of 15% on income. Corporations working with the CPA were exempted from owing any tax. CPA Order 12, amended by Order 54, suspended all tariffs, thus removing the advantage that domestic Iraqi producers had over foreign producers. However, a 5% &quot;reconstruction levy&quot; on all imported goods was later reimposed to help finance Iraqi-initiated reconstruction projects.

CPA Order 57 provided for the appointment of &quot;Inspectors General&quot; to operate within each Iraqi government ministry, for the purposes of rooting out corruption. These Inspectors General were to be &quot;appointed to a 5-year term by the Administrator [Paul Bremer],&quot; and were given sweeping powers &quot;to conduct investigations, audits, evaluations, inspections, and other reviews...&quot;
Critics contend this is a mechanism for ensuring continuing American influence in Iraqi governance even after the transfer of all sovereignty to the country.

=== Legitimacy under international law ===

Critics contend that the controversial policies are fundamentally anti-democratic, or illegal under international law, because significant economic reform can only be legitimate if passed initially by an elected Iraqi government free of foreign occupation and domination, and because an occupying power is prohibited from rewriting the laws of the occupied country.

The CPA argued that imposing Order 39 was permitted under Resolution 1483, because it required the CPA to &quot;promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory,&quot; and to create &quot;conditions in which the Iraqi people can freely determine their own political future.&quot; Proponents of this position state Resolution 1483 necessarily requires radical economic restructuring, so it allowed an exception to international law regarding occupation. However, others point out that Resolution 1483 &quot;calls upon all concerned to comply with international law including in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949&quot;, which would require an occupying force to respect the laws in force in the country unless absolutely prevented.

== Criticism of financial management ==
In May 2003, the CPA took over the responsibility for administering the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). Established from the earlier UN oil-for-food program, the CPA was authorized to manage the DFI, which took in approximately $20 billion in the year after the invasion. The CPA also administered $18.4 billion that the United States Congress allocated for Iraqi reconstruction in November 2003, known as the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF).
By June 2004, the CPA had spent, or allocated, $19.1 billion of the DFI funds—while spending only $400 million from the IRRF. Critics suggest that Bremer selectively spent from the DFI because it was more free from accounting oversight by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

This balance between DFI and IRRF expenditures might be justifiable by the argument that the IRRF was not intended to finance the Iraqi government ministries or the Public Distribution System (state food rations from the Oil-for-food program), which the DFI was intended to cover. The $18.4 billion authorized by the U.S. congress was intended to finance large reconstruction projects such as power and sewage plants, not to provide the day-to-day operating expenses of the Iraqi government. Expenditure on the IRRF projects could be seen as delayed by the projects being in their planning and early site preparation stages and it could be said that it is not surprising that little money had been disbursed at that point, or that so much of the Development Fund for Iraq had been expended as that fund was the primary source of revenue the Iraqi government had. However, by reviewing reports from Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) and other reviews and audits, it becomes clear that DFI funds were expended on projects that clearly would have been appropriate for management under IRRF. What has been troubling to auditors and inspectors general is that large amounts of DFI funding is as yet unaccounted for and was expended in reconstruction projects that failed to provide a return on investment for the Iraqi people. By funding projects under DFI the CPA avoided legal requirements to comply with US Federal Acquisition Regulations (USFARS) as required for the administration of IRRF and other US taxpayer provided funding. It is also pertinent that expenditures under IRRF were also not administered strictly according to USFARS thereby causing severe waste, fraud and abuse as documented by SIGIR and other auditing agencies.

===Audits of the CPA&#x27;s expenditures of Iraqi funds===

When authority to manage the revenue from Iraq&#x27;s oil on behalf of the Iraqi people through United Nations resolution, that authority was transferred under certain conditions.
* The funds were to be managed in an open, transparent fashion.
* The CPA was to submit to oversight from the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, a blue ribbon panel of senior international banking experts.

The IAMB tried to insist on certain financial controls, with limited success.

With input from the IAMB accounting firm KPMG was appointed to audit the CPA&#x27;s expenditures from the DFI.

On 20 June 2005 the staff of the Committee on Government Reform prepared a report for Congressman Henry Waxman on the CPA&#x27;s expenditures from the DFI that raised additional causes for concern. Further criticism was leveled at the CPA when it was revealed that $12 billion of cash had been delivered by C-130 planes on shrinkwrapped pallets of $100 bills. The cash deliveries were described in a memo prepared for the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which concluded that &quot;Many of the funds appear to have been lost to corruption and waste... Some of the funds could have enriched both criminals and insurgents...&quot; Henry Waxman, the chair of the House committee commented, &quot;Who in their right mind would send 363 tons of cash into a war zone?&quot; A single flight to Iraq on 12 December 2003 which contained $1.5 billion in cash is said to be the largest single Federal Reserve payout in US history according to Henry Waxman.

In 2011, a new American audit found that almost all of the missing $6.6 billion had been transferred to the Central Bank of Iraq. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen said that &quot;Any doubts about how the money was handled after it left U.S. control is an Iraqi -- not U.S. government -- question&quot;.

== Reconstruction ==

Although the CPA awarded contracts for essential reconstruction to American firms, some critics claim those firms did relatively little work. Bechtel, for instance, was awarded the contract to repair the Iraqi sewage and drinking water plants. Yet today many Iraqis remain without safe drinking water or adequate supplies of electricity. Coalition military forces were too heavily tasked to provide requisite security for all contractors in Iraq. Contract funds therefore had to be partially shifted from reconstruction activities to meet security requirements that had not been envisioned when the contracts were initially let. Moreover, progress in reconstruction frequently faced setbacks due to insurgency activities designed to disrupt rebuilding of the infrastructure. This insurgent activity significantly slowed reconstruction and required adjustment of project goals due to funds consumed by providing necessary security in excess of that originally planned.

According to USAID, as of October 2003, peak electrical generation had reached pre-war levels of 4,500 MW, and they were then collaborating with Bechtel as well as the Iraqi Interior Ministry and others on some 2,000 MW of projected capacity. The CPA set a goal of 6,000 MW generation capacity for the summer of 2004, which has never been reached. Peak generation capacity of 5,365 MW was achieved in August 2004, six weeks after the transfer of sovereignty. Current generation stands at approximately 13,000 MW. Weekly updates and financial summaries are provided by USAID&#x27;s Iraq homepage as currently as is possible.

<text>Phalacrocoracidae is a family of approximately 42 species of aquatic birds commonly known as cormorants and shags. Several different classifications of the family have been proposed, but in 2021 the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOU) adopted a consensus taxonomy of seven genera. The great cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;) and the common shag (&quot;Gulosus aristotelis&quot;) are the only two species of the family commonly encountered in Britain and Ireland and &quot;cormorant&quot; and &quot;shag&quot; appellations have been later assigned to different species in the family somewhat haphazardly.

Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large birds, with body weight in the range of and wing span of . The majority of species have dark feathers. The bill is long, thin and hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. All species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. They are excellent divers, and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings; some cormorant species have been found to dive as deep as . They have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have among the highest flight costs of any flying bird.

Cormorants nest in colonies around the shore, on trees, islets or cliffs. They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters. The original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a fresh-water bird. They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands.

== Names ==
&quot;Cormorant&quot; is a contraction probably derived from Latin &quot;corvus marinus&quot;, &quot;sea raven&quot;. Cormoran is the Cornish name of the sea giant in the tale of Jack the Giant Killer. Indeed, &quot;sea raven&quot; or analogous terms were the usual terms for cormorants in Germanic languages until after the Middle Ages. The French explorer André Thévet commented in 1558: &quot;the beak [is] similar to that of a cormorant or other corvid&quot;, which demonstrates that the erroneous belief that the birds were related to ravens lasted at least to the 16th century.

No consistent distinction exists between cormorants and shags. The names &quot;cormorant&quot; and &quot;shag&quot; were originally the common names of the two species of the family found in Great Britain &quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot; (now referred to by ornithologists as the great cormorant) and &quot;Gulosus aristotelis&quot; (the European shag). &quot;Shag&quot; refers to the bird&#x27;s crest, which the British forms of the great cormorant lack. As other species were encountered by English-speaking sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, sometimes depending on whether they had crests or not. Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant in one part of the world and a shag in another; for example, all species in the family which occur in New Zealand are known locally as shags, including four non-endemic species known as cormorant elsewhere in their range. Van Tets (1976) proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name &quot;cormorant&quot; to one and &quot;shag&quot; to the other, but this nomenclature has not been widely adopted.

== Description ==

Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large seabirds. They range in size from the pygmy cormorant (&quot;Microcarbo pygmaeus&quot;), at as little as and , to the flightless cormorant (&quot;Nannopterum harrisi&quot;), at a maximum size and . The recently extinct spectacled cormorant (&quot;Urile perspicillatus&quot;) was rather larger, at an average size of . The majority, including nearly all Northern Hemisphere species, have mainly dark plumage, but some Southern Hemisphere species are black and white, and a few (e.g. the spotted shag of New Zealand) are quite colourful. Many species have areas of coloured skin on the face (the lores and the gular skin) which can be bright blue, orange, red or yellow, typically becoming more brightly coloured in the breeding season. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes, as in their relatives.

== Habitat ==

Habitat varies from species to species: some are restricted to seacoasts, while others occur in both coastal and inland waters to varying degrees. They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands.

== Behaviour ==
All cormorants and shags are fish-eaters, dining on small eels, fish, and even water snakes. They dive from the surface, though many species make a characteristic half-jump as they dive, presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water. Under water they propel themselves with their feet, though some also propel themselves with their wings (see the picture, commentary, and existing reference video). Imperial shags fitted with miniaturized video recorders have been filmed diving to depths of as much as to forage on the sea floor.
After fishing, cormorants go ashore, and are frequently seen holding their wings out in the sun. All cormorants have preen gland secretions that are used ostensibly to keep the feathers waterproof. Some sources state that cormorants have waterproof feathers while others say that they have water-&quot;permeable&quot; feathers. Still others suggest that the outer plumage absorbs water but does not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin. The wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but not in the Antarctic shags or red-legged cormorants. Alternate functions suggested for the spread-wing posture include that it aids thermoregulation or digestion, balances the bird, or indicates presence of fish. A detailed study of the great cormorant concluded there is little doubt that is serves to dry the plumage.

Cormorants are colonial nesters, using trees, rocky islets, or cliffs. The eggs are a chalky-blue colour. There is usually one brood a year. Parents regurgitate food to feed their young.

== Taxonomy ==

The genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, from which the family name Phalacrocoracidae is derived, is Latinised from Ancient Greek &quot;phalakros&quot; &quot;bald&quot; and &quot;korax&quot; &quot;raven&quot;. This is thought to refer to the creamy white patch on the cheeks of adult great cormorants, or the ornamental white head plumes prominent in Mediterranean birds of this species, but is certainly not a unifying characteristic of cormorants.

The cormorant family was traditionally placed within the Pelecaniformes or, in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of the 1990s, the expanded Ciconiiformes. Pelecaniformes in the traditional sense—all waterbird groups with totipalmate foot webbing—are not a monophyletic group, even after the removal of the distantly-related tropicbirds. Their relationships and delimitation – apart from being part of a &quot;higher waterfowl&quot; clade which is similar but not identical to Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s &quot;pan-Ciconiiformes&quot; – remain mostly unresolved. Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and Sulidae (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the pelicans or even penguins, than to all other living birds.

In recent years, three preferred treatments of the cormorant family have emerged: either to leave all living cormorants in a single genus, &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, or to split off a few species such as the imperial shag complex (in &quot;Leucocarbo&quot;) and perhaps the flightless cormorant. Alternatively, the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the great, white-breasted and Japanese cormorants. In 2014, a landmark study proposed a 7 genera treatment, which was adopted by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International, and later by the IOC in 2021, standardizing it.
The cormorants and the darters have a unique bone on the back of the top of the skull known as the &quot;os nuchale&quot; or occipital style which was called a xiphoid process in early literature. This bony projection provides anchorage for the muscles that increase the force with which the lower mandible is closed. This bone and the highly developed muscles over it, the M. adductor mandibulae caput nuchale, are unique to the families Phalacrocoracidae and Anhingidae.

Several evolutionary groups are still recognizable. However, combining the available evidence suggests that there has also been a great deal of convergent evolution; for example the cliff shags are a convergent paraphyletic group. The proposed division into &quot;Phalacrocorax sensu stricto&quot; (or subfamily &quot;Phalacrocoracinae&quot;) cormorants and &quot;Leucocarbo sensu lato&quot; (or &quot;Leucocarboninae&quot;) shags does have some degree of merit. The resolution provided by the mtDNA 12S rRNA and ATPase subunits six and eight sequence data is not sufficient to properly resolve several groups to satisfaction; in addition, many species remain unsampled, the fossil record has not been integrated in the data, and the effects of hybridisation – known in some Pacific species especially – on the DNA sequence data are unstudied.

A multigene molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 provided a genus-level phylogeny of the family.

===List of genera===

As per the IOU, the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International, the family contains 7 genera:

Prior to 2021, the IOU (or formerly the IOC) classified all these species in just three genera: &quot;Microcarbo&quot;, &quot;Leucocarbo&quot;, and a broad &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; containing all remaining species; however, this treatment rendered &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; deeply paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Leucocarbo&quot;. Other authorities, such as the Clements Checklist, formerly recognised only &quot;Microcarbo&quot; as a separate genus from &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;.

For details, see the article &quot;List of cormorant species&quot;.

===Evolution and fossil record===

The details of the evolution of the cormorants are mostly unknown. Even the technique of using the distribution and relationships of a species to figure out where it came from, biogeography, usually very informative, does not give very specific data for this probably rather ancient and widespread group. However, the closest living relatives of the cormorants and shags are the other families of the suborder Sulae—darters and gannets and boobies—which have a primarily Gondwanan distribution. Hence, at least the modern diversity of Sulae probably originated in the southern hemisphere.

While the Leucocarbonines are almost certainly of southern Pacific origin—possibly even the Antarctic which, at the time when cormorants evolved, was not yet ice-covered—all that can be said about the Phalacrocoracines is that they are most diverse in the regions bordering the Indian Ocean, but generally occur over a large area.

Similarly, the origin of the family is shrouded in uncertainties. Some Late Cretaceous fossils have been proposed to belong with the Phalacrocoracidae:
A scapula from the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, about 70 mya (million years ago), was found in the Nemegt Formation in Mongolia; it is now in the PIN collection. It is from a bird roughly the size of a spectacled cormorant, and quite similar to the corresponding bone in &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;. A Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, c. 66 mya) right femur, AMNH FR 25272 from the Lance Formation near Lance Creek, Wyoming, is sometimes suggested to be the second-oldest record of the Phalacrocoracidae; this was from a rather smaller bird, about the size of a long-tailed cormorant. However, cormorants likely originated much later, and these are likely misidentifications.

As the Early Oligocene &quot;&quot;Sula&quot; ronzoni&quot; cannot be assigned to any of the sulid families—cormorants and shags, darters, and gannets and boobies—with certainty, the best interpretation is that the Phalacrocoracidae diverged from their closest ancestors in the Early Oligocene, perhaps some 30 million years ago, and that the Cretaceous fossils represent ancestral sulids, &quot;pelecaniforms&quot; or &quot;higher waterbirds&quot;; at least the last lineage is generally believed to have been already distinct and undergoing evolutionary radiation at the end of the Cretaceous. What can be said with near certainty is that AMNH FR 25272 is from a diving bird that used its feet for underwater locomotion; as this is liable to result in some degree of convergent evolution and the bone is missing indisputable neornithine features, it is not entirely certain that the bone is correctly referred to this group.

Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the cormorants diverged from their closest relatives, the darters, during the Late Oligocene, indicating that most of the claims of Cretaceous or early Paleogene cormorant occurrences are likely misidentifications.

During the late Paleogene, when the family presumably originated, much of Eurasia was covered by shallow seas, as the Indian Plate finally attached to the mainland. Lacking a detailed study, it may well be that the first &quot;modern&quot; cormorants were small species from eastern, south-eastern or southern Asia, possibly living in freshwater habitat, that dispersed due to tectonic events. Such a scenario would account for the present-day distribution of cormorants and shags and is not contradicted by the fossil record; as remarked above, a thorough review of the problem is not yet available.

Even when &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; was used to unite all living species, two distinct genera of prehistoric cormorants became widely accepted today:
* &quot;Limicorallus&quot; (Indricotherium middle Oligocene of Chelkar-Teniz, Kazakhstan)
* &quot;Nectornis&quot; (Late Oligocene/Early Miocene of Central Europe – Middle Miocene of Bes-Konak, Turkey) – includes &quot;Oligocorax miocaenus&quot;

The proposed genus &quot;Oligocorax&quot; appears to be paraphyletic – the European species have been separated in &quot;Nectornis&quot;, and the North American ones placed in the expanded &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;; the latter might just as well be included in &quot;Nannopterum&quot;. A Late Oligocene fossil cormorant foot from Enspel, Germany, sometimes placed in &quot;Oligocorax&quot;, would then be referable to &quot;Nectornis&quot; if it proves not to be too distinct. &quot;Limicorallus&quot;, meanwhile, was initially believed to be a rail or a dabbling duck by some. There are also undescribed remains of apparent cormorants from the Quercy Phosphorites of Quercy (France), dating to some time between the Late Eocene and the mid-Oligocene. All these early European species might belong to the basal group of &quot;microcormorants&quot;, as they conform with them in size and seem to have inhabited the same habitat: subtropical coastal or inland waters. While this need not be more than convergence, the phylogeny of the modern (sub)genus &quot;Microcarbo&quot; – namely, whether the Western Eurasian &quot;M. pygmaeus&quot; is a basal or highly derived member of its clade – is still not well understood at all as of 2022.

Some other Paleogene remains are sometimes assigned to the Phalacrocoracidae, but these birds seem rather intermediate between cormorants and darters (and lack clear autapomorphies of either). Thus, they may be quite basal members of the Palacrocoracoidea. The taxa in question are:
* &quot;Piscator&quot; (Late Eocene of England)
* &quot;Pelecaniformes&quot; gen. et sp. indet. (Jebel Qatrani Early Oligocene of Fayum, Egypt) – similar to &quot;Piscator&quot;?
* &quot;Borvocarbo&quot; (Late Oligocene of C Europe)

The supposed Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene &quot;Valenticarbo&quot; is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; and given its recent age probably not a separate genus.

The remaining fossil species are not usually placed in a modern phylogenetic framework. While the numerous western US species are most likely prehistoric representatives of the coastal &quot;Urile&quot; or inland &quot;Nannopterum&quot;, the European fossils pose much more of a problem due to the singular common shag being intermediate in size between the other two European cormorant lineages, and as of 2022 still of mysterious ancestry; notably, a presumably lost collection of Late Miocene fossils from the Odesa region may have contained remains of all three (sub)genera inhabiting Europe today. Similarly, the Plio-Pleistocene fossils from Florida have been allied with &quot;Nannopterum&quot; and even &quot;Urile&quot;, but may conceivably be &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;; they are in serious need of revision since it is not even clear how many species are involved. Provisionally, the fossil species are thus all placed in &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; here:
* &quot;Phalacrocorax marinavis&quot; (Oligocene – Early Miocene of Oregon, US) – formerly &quot;Oligocorax&quot;; &quot;Urile&quot; or &quot;Nannopterum&quot;?

==In human culture==

===Cormorant culling===
===Cormorant fishing===
Humans have used cormorants&#x27; fishing skills in various places in the world. Archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing was practised in Ancient Egypt, Peru, Korea and India, but the strongest tradition has remained in China and Japan, where it reached commercial-scale level in some areas. In Japan, cormorant fishing is called and is performed by a fisherman known as an &quot;usho.&quot; Traditional forms of &quot;ukai&quot; can be seen on the Nagara River in the city of Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, where cormorant fishing has continued uninterrupted for 1300 years, or in the city of Inuyama, Aichi. In Guilin, Guangxi, cormorants are famous for fishing on the shallow Li River. In Gifu, the Japanese cormorant (&quot;P. capillatus&quot;) is used; Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants (&quot;P. carbo&quot;). In Europe, a similar practice was also used on Doiran Lake in the region of Macedonia. James VI and I appointed a keeper of cormorants, John Wood, and built ponds at Westminster to train the birds to fish.

In a common technique, a snare is tied near the base of the bird&#x27;s throat, which allows the bird only to swallow small fish. When the bird captures and tries to swallow a large fish, the fish is caught in the bird&#x27;s throat. When the bird returns to the fisherman&#x27;s raft, the fisherman helps the bird to remove the fish from its throat. The method is not as common today, since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed, but is still practised as a cultural tradition.

In Japan, environmental changes threaten traditional &quot;ukai&quot; because of reduced numbers of the ayu river fish that cormorants are used to catch.

===In folklore, literature, and art===

Cormorants feature in heraldry and medieval ornamentation, usually in their &quot;wing-drying&quot; pose, which was seen as representing the Christian cross, and symbolizing nobility and sacrifice. For John Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, the cormorant symbolizes greed: perched atop the Tree of Life, Satan took the form of a cormorant as he spied on Adam and Eve during his first intrusion into Eden.

In some Scandinavian areas, they are considered good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants. For example, the Norwegian municipalities of Røst, Loppa and Skjervøy have cormorants in their coat of arms. The symbolic liver bird of Liverpool is commonly thought to be a cross between an eagle and a cormorant.

In Homer&#x27;s epic poem The Odyssey, Odysseus (Ulysses) is saved by a compassionate sea nymph who takes the form of a cormorant.

In 1853, a woman wearing a dress made of cormorant feathers was found on San Nicolas Island, off the southern coast of California. She had sewn the feather dress together using whale sinews. She is known as the Lone Woman of San Nicolas and was later baptised &quot;Juana Maria&quot; (her original name is lost). The woman had lived alone on the island for 18 years before being rescued. When removed from San Nicolas, she brought with her a green cormorant dress she made; this dress is reported to have been removed to the Vatican. Her story, which includes the feather dress, was fictionalized in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot;.

The bird has inspired numerous writers, including Amy Clampitt, who wrote a poem called &quot;The Cormorant in its Element&quot;. The species she described may have been the pelagic cormorant, which is the only species in the temperate U.S. with the &quot;slim head ... vermilion-strapped&quot; and &quot;big black feet&quot; that she mentions.

A cormorant representing Blanche Ingram appears in the first of the fictional paintings by Jane in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;:

One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet, set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.

In the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot;, Dr. Watson warns that if there are further attempts to get at and destroy his private notes regarding his time with Holmes, &quot;the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. There is at least one reader who will understand.&quot;

A cormorant is humorously mentioned as having had linseed oil rubbed into it by a wayward pupil during the &quot;Growth and Learning&quot; segment of the 1983 Monty Python movie &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;.

The cormorant served as the hood ornament for the Packard automobile brand.

Cormorants (and books about them written by a fictional ornithologist) are a recurring fascination of the protagonist in Jesse Ball&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Census&quot;.

The Pokémon Cramorant, featured in the 8th generation of the video game series, closely resembles a cormorant in both design and name.

The cormorant was chosen as the emblem for the Ministry of Defence Joint Services Command and Staff College at Shrivenham. A bird famed for flight, sea fishing and land nesting was felt to be particularly appropriate for a college that unified leadership training and development for the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force.

After a member produced a mock magazine cover from a photograph of roosting cormorants, the bird became the unofficial mascot of the Pentax Discuss Mailing List with many posts dedicated to discussion of the photography of the species.

<text>Southcourt is a housing estate in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. Building commenced in the early 1920s through to the mid-1930s and only stopped because of the Second World War. It was turned into a post war housing estate during the years of 1946 and 1955. The area is named after the pig farm over which the housing estate was built.

==History==
The oldest house in Southcourt is in Cottesloe Road on the junction of Clover Lane. This was the original farmhouse built at the start of the 20th century. The first sod for the rest of the estate was cut in 1922 by The Duke of York: hence one of the first roads of the estate was named York Place in his honour. At the time the housing was publicised as &quot;Homes for Heroes&quot;, and the first houses on the estate were reserved solely for veterans of the First World War.

Until 1967, there used to be a &#x27;Halt&#x27; at what was the pedestrian crossing from Old Stoke Road, Southcourt to Mandeville Road (closed in 2016). The &#x27;Aylesbury South Halt&#x27; as it used to be known, was on the ex GWR (originally broad gauge) line to Princes Risborough and High Wycombe, a stop for the train into Aylesbury to pause for any passengers who wanted a short train journey into the centre of town. It comprised a small wooden platform and shelter.

The pre-war part of the estate consists of terraced and semi-detached redbrick and rendered houses, as well as blocks of low rise flats. The post war houses are built at a higher density and of brick, concrete and steel with timber (now plastic) cladding.
The secondary school located in Southcourt is Mandeville School. The primary school is Oak Green School, which is a mixed community school that takes approximately 430 pupils from the age of four through to the age of eleven. In the 2001 census the population of Southcourt was 5,849 people.

== Demography ==

At the 2001 UK census, the Southcourt electoral ward had a population of 5,849. The ethnicity was 86.2% white, 2.3% mixed race, 9% Asian, 1.9% black and 0.6% other. The place of birth of residents was 90.2% United Kingdom, 1.2% Republic of Ireland, 1.2% other Western European countries, and 7.4% elsewhere. Religion was recorded as 62.9% Christian, 0.1% Buddhist, 0.7% Hindu, 0.3% Sikh, 0.1% Jewish, and 8% Muslim. 19.6% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 8% did not state their religion.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 43.9% in full-time employment, 13.3% in part-time employment, 4.8% self-employed, 4.4% unemployed, 2.3% students with jobs, 2.9% students without jobs, 9.9% retired, 8.4% looking after home or family, 6.6% permanently sick or disabled and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons.

<text>David Halberstam (April 10, 1934 April 23, 2007) was an American writer, journalist, and historian, known for his work on the Vietnam War, politics, history, the Civil Rights Movement, business, media, American culture, Korean War, and later, sports journalism. He won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1964. Halberstam was killed in a car crash in 2007 while doing research for a book.

==Early life and education==
Halberstam was born in New York City, the son of Blanche (nee Levy) and Charles A. Halberstam, schoolteacher and Army surgeon. His family was Jewish. He was raised in Winsted, Connecticut, where he was a classmate of Ralph Nader. Halberstam moved to Yonkers, New York, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1951. 
In 1955, he graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. degree after serving as managing editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. Halberstam had a rebellious streak and as editor of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; engaged in a competition to see which columnist could most offend readers.

==Career==
Halberstam&#x27;s journalism career began at the &quot;Daily Times Leader&quot; in West Point, Mississippi, the smallest daily newspaper in Mississippi. He covered the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement for &quot;The Tennessean&quot; in Nashville. John Lewis later stated that Halberstam was the only journalist in Nashville who would cover the Nashville sit-ins, organized by the Nashville Student Movement which Halberstam focused on in his 1998 book &quot;The Children&quot;. Halberstam&#x27;s fiery, rebellious streak first came out when covering the civil rights movement as he protested against the lies of the authorities who portrayed the civil rights protesters as violent and dangerous.

===Republic of the Congo===
In August 1961 ,&quot;The New York Times&quot; dispatched Halberstam to the Republic of the Congo to report on the Congo Crisis. Although initially eager to cover the events in the country, over time he grew jaded over the demanding working conditions and the difficulty in handling Congolese officials&#x27; lack of truthfulness. In July 1962 he quickly accepted an opportunity to move to Vietnam to report on the Vietnam War for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===Vietnam===
Halberstam arrived in Vietnam in the middle of 1962. A tall and well built man, he conveyed much self-confidence and initially the American embassy approved of him. However, Halberstam was openly hostile to any hint of deception, and he soon came into conflict with American officials. When the chief American officer in South Vietnam, General Paul D. Harkins, launched an operation with 45 helicopters flown by American pilots landing a battalion of South Vietnamese infantry to attack a Viet Cong base, Halberstam was forbidden from doing any direct reporting; he was simply told to report the operation as a victory. Halberstam was enraged by this media control, as he expressed in a letter to Frederick Nolting, the Ambassador to South Vietnam. Halberstam wrote about the media blackout: &quot;The reason given is security. This is, of course, stupid, naive and indeed insulting to the patriotism and intelligence of every American newspaperman, and every American newspaper represented here.&quot; Halberstam argued that the operation could not have been the victory that Harkins had claimed as the Viet Cong must have heard the helicopters coming and accordingly retreated as guerrillas normally do when faced with superior force, leading him to write: &quot;You can bet the V.C. knew what was happening. You can bet Hanoi knew what was happening. Only American reporters and American readers were kept ignorant.&quot;

With the help of military sources like John Paul Vann, an active duty officer in Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), Halberstam, along with colleagues Neil Sheehan of UPI and Malcolm Brown of the AP, challenged the upbeat reporting of the United States mission in South Vietnam. They reported the defeat of government troops at the first major battle of the Vietnam War known as the Battle of Ap Bac. Vann presented Halberstam with a one sided narrative of the events that omitted his own malfeasance in the Battle of Ap Bac. As an air controller, he instructed paratroopers to be inserted in an area which was almost on top of North Vietnamese troops, leading to many unnecessary deaths. President John F. Kennedy tried to get &quot;The New York Times&quot; to replace Halberstam with a more compliant journalist. The &quot;Times&quot; refused.

During the Buddhist crisis in 1963, Halberstam and Neil Sheehan debunked the claim by the Diệm regime that the Army of the Republic of Vietnam regular forces had perpetrated the brutal raids on Buddhist temples, which the American authorities had initially believed, but that the Special Forces, loyal to Diệm&#x27;s brother and strategist Nhu, had done so to frame the army generals. However, this claim proved to be false. On August 18, 1963 ten of the South Vietnamese Army&#x27;s most senior generals, which included Buddhist and Catholics met to discuss the crises involving the Buddhist protests. They concluded that the protests had gone on too long and presented a clear danger to the war effort against the communists and that communist had ingrained themselves amongst the Buddhist protest movement. He was also involved in a scuffle with Nhu&#x27;s secret police after they punched fellow journalist Peter Arnett while the news men were covering a Buddhist protest. Seeing Arnett lying on the ground being punched and kicked by policemen, Halberstam ran to his rescue, shouting in fury: &quot;Go back, get back you sons of bitches or I&#x27;ll beat the shit out of you!&quot; As Halberstam spoke in English, the policemen did not understand him, but as he was much taller than the diminutive Vietnamese, the sight of him running at them, red-faced and furious, was enough to cause them to run away.

Halberstam&#x27;s reporting led to a feud with journalists Marguerite Higgins and Joseph Alsop, and &quot;TIME&quot; Magazine publisher Henry Luce, who all championed the Diem regime. All three had been members of the &quot;China Lobby&quot;, who had been, in the 1930s and 1940s, passionately committed to supporting the Kuomintang regime and believed that the only reason the Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949 was because a few American officials and journalists had chosen to &quot;betray&quot; Chiang Kai-shek, who otherwise would have defeated the Communists. Reporters like Theodore White, who saw and exposed Chiang&#x27;s corruption and indifference to China&#x27;s peasants, were – to the China Lobby – defeatists and traitors. (White&#x27;s insistence on covering the Chiang regime as he saw it would eventually destroy his relationship with Luce, who had been his patron and a close friend.)

The China Lobby tended to approve of Diem for the same reasons that they approved of Chiang, seeing both as pro-Western, modernizing Christian leaders who made their respective nations into copies of the United States. In the same way the China Lobby portrayed Chiang as China&#x27;s Christian savior because of his conversion to Methodism, and as someone who would presumably convert the rest of the Chinese to Christianity, they saw the Catholic Diem as Vietnam&#x27;s Christian savior who likewise would convert the Vietnamese to Christianity. Both Higgins and Luce had been born in China to Protestant missionary parents and were very attracted to the idea of one day converting all of the Chinese to Christianity; Chiang&#x27;s defeat in 1949 had caused them much bitterness. For many members of the China Lobby, South Vietnam was a sort of consolation prize for the &quot;loss of China&quot; in 1949. Halberstam&#x27;s criticism of Diem sounded very similar to American journalists&#x27; criticism of Chiang in the 1940s, and it threatened the possibility of “losing” South Vietnam. This led to their furious attacks on Halberstam. 

Before going to South Vietnam, Higgins was briefed by Marine General, Victor &quot;Brute&quot; Krulak, about what line she was to take. In her first column from Saigon, Higgins called the younger American journalists like Halberstam and Sheenan, &quot;typewriter strategists&quot; who rarely went into battle, further adding: &quot;Reporters here would like to see us lose the war to prove they&#x27;re right.&quot; In response to editors of &quot;The New York Times&quot; who told Halberstam to change his coverage to gain Higgins&#x27;s approval, he wrote back: &quot;If you mention that woman&#x27;s name to me one more time I will resign, repeat resign, and I mean it, repeat, mean it.&quot; More dangerous to Halberstam was criticism of Alsop owing to his friendship with the Kennedy brothers. In his columns, Alsop, without naming Halberstam explicitly, mentioned a young reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot; who was a &quot;defeatist&quot; who never reported the good news from &quot;Vietnam&#x27;s fighting front.&quot; Halberstam ridiculed Alsop&#x27;s statement about the &quot;fighting front&quot; as reflecting the ignorance of someone who did not understand guerrilla warfare, where there was no &quot;front&quot; in the sense that Alsop had used the word.

In Halberstam&#x27;s view, Higgins and Alsop weren&#x27;t doing any reporting on the ground, they were merely flying into Saigon occasionally to interview US officials and transmit those comments to their American readers. In effect, Halberstam wrote, Higgins and Alsop came to Vietnam &quot;not so much to report on the war as to strengthen policy.&quot; Halberstam saw the official, optimistic view of the war as inaccurate – and therefore fundamentally dishonest: &quot;Among lower- and middle-ranking American and Vietnamese officials, there was the working level view,&quot; he wrote in his book, &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;. &quot;It was a view shared by the American reporters. They could see what was really going on, and they refused, in their reporting, to fake it... The American government was fighting less a war than a public relations campaign.&quot;

Halberstam tried to visit North Vietnam. Halberstam asked Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission, if he would be able to arrange for him to visit North Vietnam. However, Maneli had to tell him that the message from Premier Phạm Văn Đồng was that &quot;We are not interested in building up the prestige of American journalists&quot;. Maneli suspected the real reason for refusing Halberstam permission to enter North Vietnam was the belief by the North Vietnamese that he might be an American spy.

Halberstam received the George Polk Award for Foreign Reporting in 1963 for his reporting for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, including his eyewitness account of the self-immolation of Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thích Quảng Đức.

Halberstam left Vietnam in 1964, at age 30, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting that year. He is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film on the Vietnam War, titled &quot;In the Year of the Pig&quot;.

===Civil Rights Movement and Poland===

In the mid-1960s, Halberstam covered the Civil Rights Movement for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was sent on assignment to Poland, where he soon became &quot;an attraction from behind the Iron Curtain&quot; to the artistic boheme in Warsaw. The result of that fascination was a 12-year marriage to one of the most popular young actresses of that time, Elżbieta Czyżewska, on June 13, 1965.

Initially well received by the communist regime, two years later he was expelled from the country as persona non grata for publishing an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing the Polish government. Czyżewska followed him, becoming an outcast herself; that decision disrupted her career in the country where she was a big star, adored by millions. In the spring of 1967, Halberstam traveled with Martin Luther King Jr. from New York City to Cleveland and then to Berkeley, California for a &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; article, &quot;The Second Coming of Martin Luther King&quot;. While at the &quot;Times&quot;, he gathered material for his book &quot;The Making of a Quagmire: America and Vietnam during the Kennedy Era&quot; (which developed the Quagmire theory).

===Foreign policy, media works===
Halberstam next wrote about President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s foreign-policy decisions on the Vietnam War in &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot;. In 1972 Halberstam went to work on his next book, &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;, published in 1979 and featuring profiles of media titans like William S. Paley of CBS, Henry Luce of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and Phil Graham of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In 1980 his brother, cardiologist Michael J. Halberstam, was shot and killed during a home invasion by escaped convict and prolific burglar Bernard C. Welch Jr. His only public comment related to his brother&#x27;s murder came when he and Michael&#x27;s widow castigated &quot;Life&quot; magazine, then published monthly, for paying Michael&#x27;s killer $9,000 to pose in jail for color photographs that appeared on inside pages of the February 1981 edition of &quot;Life&quot;.

In 1991 Halberstam wrote &quot;The Next Century&quot;, in which he argued that, after the end of the Cold War, the United States was likely to fall behind economically to other countries such as Japan and Germany.

===Sportswriting===

Later in his career, Halberstam turned to sports, publishing &quot;The Breaks of the Game&quot;, an inside look at Bill Walton and the 1979–80 Portland Trail Blazers basketball team; &quot;Summer of &#x27;49&quot;, on the baseball pennant race battle between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox; &quot;October 1964&quot;, on the 1964 World Series between the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals; &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, an ambitious book on Michael Jordan in 1999; &quot;The Teammates: A Portrait of a Friendship&quot;, focusing on the relationships among several members of the Boston Red Sox in the 1940s; and &quot;The Education of a Coach&quot;, about New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Much of his sportswriting, particularly his baseball books, focuses on the personalities of the players and the times they lived in as much as on the games themselves.

In particular, Halberstam depicted the 1949 Yankees and Red Sox as symbols of a nobler era, when blue-collar athletes modestly strove to succeed and enter the middle class rather than making millions and defying their owners and talking back to the press. In 1997, Halberstam received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College.

===Later years===

After publishing four books in the 1960s, including the novel &quot;The Noblest Roman&quot;, &quot;The Making of a Quagmire&quot; and &quot;The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy&quot;, he wrote three books in the 1970s, four books in the 1980s, and six books in the 1990s including his 1998 &quot;The Children&quot; which chronicled the 1959–1962 Nashville Student Movement. He wrote four more books in the 2000s, and was working on at least two others at the time of his death.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Halberstam wrote the book &quot;Firehouse&quot; about the lives of the men from Engine 40, Ladder 35 of the New York City Fire Department. The last book Halberstam completed, &quot;The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War&quot;, was published posthumously in September 2007.

==Death==
Halberstam died in a traffic collision on April 23, 2007, in Menlo Park, California, at the age of 73. He was en route to an interview with former San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants quarterback Y. A. Tittle for a book about the 1958 championship game between the Giants and the Baltimore Colts, when the journalism student driving Halberstam to the interview illegally turned into oncoming traffic.

After Halberstam&#x27;s death, the book project was taken over by Frank Gifford, who had played for the losing New York Giants in the 1958 game, and was titled &quot;The Glory Game&quot;, published by HarperCollins in October 2008 with an introduction dedicated to Halberstam.

==Mentor to other authors==
Howard Bryant in the Acknowledgments section of &quot;Juicing the Game&quot;, his 2005 book about steroids in baseball, said of Halberstam&#x27;s assistance: &quot;He provided me with a succinct road map and the proper mind-set.&quot; Bryant went on to quote Halberstam on how to tackle a controversial non-fiction subject: &quot;Think about three or four moments that you believe to be the most important during your time frame. Then think about what the leadership did about it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be complicated. What happened, and what did the leaders do about it? That&#x27;s your book.&quot; 

==Criticism==
Pulitzer Prize-winning Korean War correspondent Marguerite Higgins was pro-Diệm and frequently clashed with Halberstam and his colleagues. She claimed they had ulterior motives, saying &quot;reporters here would like to see us lose the war to prove they&#x27;re right.&quot;

In the Vietnam conflict, Halberstam&#x27;s reporting for &quot;The New York Times&quot; led many, including &quot;Times&quot; editors, to believe that Buddhists were a majority of the Vietnamese population and that the Diệm administration was therefore a minority suppressing a majority. In fact, only 30% of Vietnamese were practicing Buddhists at the time. &quot;The myth of the gravity of the Buddhist crisis was also a point of contention.&quot; Halberstam&#x27;s reporting made the crisis seem much more mainstream than it was.

Historian Mark Moyar claimed that Halberstam, along with fellow journalists Neil Sheehan and Stanley Karnow, helped to bring about the 1963 South Vietnamese coup against President Diệm by sending negative information on Diệm to the U.S. government in news articles and in private, all because they decided Diệm was unhelpful in the war effort. Moyar claims that much of this information was false or misleading. Moyar argues that Halberstram and Karnow relied too heavily on Pham Ngoc Thao and Pham Xuan An as sources: both men were undercover communist spies assigned to mislead journalists. 

Newspaper opinion editor Michael Young posits that Halberstam saw Vietnam as a moral tragedy, with America&#x27;s hubris bringing about its downfall. Young writes that Halberstam reduced everything to human will, turning his subjects into agents of broader historical forces and coming off like a Hollywood movie with a fated and formulaic climax.

<doc id="208326" wikidata="Q5009395" url="?curid=208326" title="CB radio in the United Kingdom">
<text>Citizens band radio (often shortened to CB radio) is a system of short-distance radio communications between individuals on a selection of 40 channels within the 27-MHz (11 m) band. In the United Kingdom, CB radio was first legally introduced in 1981, but had been used illegally for some years prior to that.

In December 2006, CB radio became licence-free or exempt of the fee. However Ofcom still regulate CB radio under CEPT and MPT specifications. Although the use of CB radios in the UK has declined from its peak, it is still popular, especially with the farming community, Land Rover owners and Mini-Cab services. It is also fitted as standard to &#x27;Street Glide&#x27; and &#x27;Electra Glide&#x27; models of Harley Davidson touring motorcycles sold in the UK.

==History==
CB radio was first introduced into the United Kingdom around 1968. Early use was known around the international shipping ports in the UK, particularly Liverpool, London and Southampton in 1968. As citizens band radio has been advertised in the US since before 1962, it is possible that a number of these radios were brought into the UK and used illegally. In the period 1976–1978, CB radio in Britain was much popularised by novelty hit songs and its use in the film &quot;Convoy&quot; and the usage of illegal CB radio peaked in 1980. Companies in Britain sold US equipment quite openly, and equipment was readily available in car accessory shops. During this time, a great many CB clubs emerged in the UK and they became centres of protest in the march towards legalisation, in the hope that existing equipment could be used legally. 
In 1980 to 1981 a Magazine was launched called &#x27;CB 27 Anglia&#x27;, by a Great Yarmouth based CB enthusiast (Author: Myke Symonds). This became so popular that it was in demand outside of East Anglia. The magazine was A5 sized, locally printed, and featured how to articles and other related features.
In response to the popularity of CB Radio, the government commissioned a white paper proposing a CB service called &quot;Open Channel&quot; around 860 MHz.

The big problem for the UK was that the 27 MHz band was already licensed legally to radio control model aircraft users. They were paying for a licence to use the band, and interference resulted in loss of control of the aircraft. Many expensive models were written off, and the safety implications were obvious, but there was no practical way to police a separation, and the government did not rate the protection of model flying as an important issue.

The UK Government eventually legalised CB radio, and on 2 November 1981 a CB service was introduced on a frequency band and offset that is incompatible with the imported American radios. At the same time the ownership of non-UK approved 27 MHz transceivers was made illegal except for those obtained by UK radio amateurs holding a UK &quot;A&quot; (HF) licence, for conversion to the 28 MHz (10-metre) amateur allocation. Given that virtually all illegal CB radios were contraband, this concession required the licensed amateur to pay outstanding import duty and VAT. A licence to operate these new radios became compulsory, and this could be purchased from most Post Office counters for £10. The original licence permitted three CB Radios to be operated at one time. One person would be the licence holder and there could be two others in communications with the holder. A few years later the licence was increased to £15 p.a. and required any operator to have a licence except those sitting and using a radio in the company of a CB Radio licence. Unlike that required to qualify for a radio amateur licence, no proof of technical competence was needed. As of 8 December 2006, a licence is no longer required to own or operate a CB radio providing it complies with one of the 3 type approval conditions currently permitted by Ofcom: FM only, 4 watts power output and operating on either or both UK and CEPT (EU) 27 MHz bands only.

In the early stages of the run up to the final legislation, most of the pro-CB lobby wanted the government to legislate around the US standard CB system, primarily due to the large user base that already existed. The UK government made it clear from the outset that legislation for use of this equipment would be unlikely. Interference problems associated with badly calibrated amplitude modulated (AM) or Single-Side-Band (SSB) equipment were cited as the main factor, and it was made clear that if any system was legalised it would be frequency modulated (FM). The CB lobby argued that interference from AM was unlikely to occur from the use of original unmodified AM radio equipment, a view initially rejected but later accepted by the Ministry of Defence. 
Many active and potential users continued in their insistence on a 27 MHz system, although for a locally available Citizen&#x27;s Band system, the 27 MHz concept was not universally endorsed.

The government initially proposed an FM system on a 928 MHz band with an RF input power not exceeding 500 mW. This was unacceptable to the CB lobby partly because the low power would give a short range but mainly because the cost of equipment to operate in this band would be prohibitive.

The more knowledgeable CB enthusiasts made a counter proposal to use a frequency around 220 MHz. This was immediately dismissed by the government who pointed out that it was a reserved military frequency band. It was subsequently discovered that the frequency had been unused since the Second World War. The government initially refused to relent and continued their insistence on legalising the 928 MHz band. The CB lobby continued to insist that any CB system had to use the 27 MHz band, be AM and a maximum output power of 4 watts (i.e. the US system).

Ultimately, the government hinted that they were going to give in to the CB lobby but, as it turned out, only up to a point. CB was eventually legalised on a 27 MHz band but not the band used in the US. Whereas the US used a band occupying the range 26.965 to 27.405 MHz, the UK system was to operate on 27.60125 to 27.99125 MHz. These awkward frequencies would prevent illegal US sets from being modified outside of the type approval system, though it was possible to have existing A.M. radios modified to comply with the new F.M. standard. The choice of frequency would also give the UK electronics industry a head start in the production of unique UK only radios. The system was FM as expected, but one initial surprise was that the power limit was set at 4 watts. The surprise was short lived when it was realised that antenna restrictions would limit the real radiated power to little more than a 500 mW system. A further restriction on power applied if the antenna was elevated by more than 7 metres (23&#x27;) from the ground. The antenna restrictions were largely ignored and, in the main, unpoliced.

The government of the day had hoped that UK-based manufacturers would be able to compete on a level playing field with foreign (notably Japanese) manufacturers for a share of the potential market. As it happened: the awkward choice of frequencies conspired against this ideal. The frequencies were such that, initially, only one manufacturer in Japan had the capability of producing the frequency synthesiser chips capable of producing the transmission frequencies and the local oscillator signals for use in receive mode. This manufacturer, not surprisingly, refused to supply any UK based manufacturer while it was attempting to keep Japanese manufacturers supplied. In the event, the UK market saturated within a few months and many Japanese manufacturers and UK importers were left with vast amounts of unwanted stock. Within a year of the introduction of CB to the UK, CB radio sets were being given away free with some purchase or other by many of the major retailers.

In addition 20 channels in the 934 MHz band were also legalised, but equipment was considerably more expensive than the well established 27 MHz sets. At first the range was limited, but as antenna restrictions were lifted and better equipment started to appear, the number of UHF CB operators grew. In 1988, it was announced that the manufacture of 934 MHz equipment would be prohibited, though the use of existing equipment would remain legal. Its use largely confined to enthusiasts and amateur radio operators, the type approval specification for this band was finally withdrawn on 1 January 1999 and it is now illegal to use this equipment in the UK.

An additional frequency band was introduced on 1 September 1987 giving a further 40 channels in the CEPT Band, (26.965 MHz to 27.405 MHz) also some antenna restrictions were lifted, over the past few years all antenna restrictions have been removed and planning constraints now restrict antenna size rather than regulatory compliance. It is not permitted to add the CEPT channels to existing 27/81 equipment, the only radios permitted to operate on this band are purpose-made 80-channel or CEPT-only sets.

==Associations and groups==

Countless CB related clubs and groups have existed over the years, including some more notable organisations:
* NATCOLCIBAR (NATional COmmittee for the Legalisation of CItizens BAnd Radio)
* REACT UK (Radio Emergency Associate Communications Team – later changed to Radio Emergency And Citizens Teams)
* MSGB (Monitoring Services of Great Britain)
* THAMES (Traffic Help And Monitoring Emergency Service)
* REVCOM (Radio Emergency Volunteer Communications)

NATCOLCIBAR

The National Committee for the Legalisation Of Citizens&#x27; Band Radio was a pro CB lobby consisting of interested parties and (at one point) up to 60 members of Parliament.

REACT UK
REACT UK was formed in 1982, under licence from REACT INTERNATIONAL in the United States, its teams were located across the UK. It was noted for its members signing on and off monitoring on Channel 9.
REACT UK also provided members equipped with mobiles and handheld to provide radio coverage for marathons, fun runs, county shows – it also obtained a Private Mobile Radio (PMR) licence so its members had a secure private radio channel.

The national committee of REACT UK was beset by scandals and arguments from about 1986, and the National Communications secretary was arrested and charged with financial irregularities with regards to receipts from PMR licences. REACT UK members decided to split following much in-fighting in the national committee, and in 1986 many became affiliated directly with REACT International.
Some REACT units provided search volunteers to assist the police with searching for missing persons (something that still occurs today with ALSAR and RAYNET albeit without CB radios).

(* Addendum: The author of CB 27 Anglia informs that REACT was active, unofficially, using the illegally imported AM Radios, from as early as April 1981. It was &quot;manned&quot; by volunteers in 3 hour shifts, on Channel 9, 24/7 days. It worked well and all CB was self-governed by the operators and a National Network was functioning very well before BT &amp; Customes Excise forced changes.)

From 2007 there was only one REACT International team based in Britain, operating under the name of REACT UK Dundee. Some teams became overseas members of REACT International whilst others chose to join splinter group REVCOM (Radio Emergency Volunteer Communications).

MSGB
MSGB Although the name suggested operating in Great Britain, but it actually operated throughout the United Kingdom, incorporating the region of Northern Ireland. Also, there were members but not teams in the Channel Islands

THAMES
THAMES mainly operated in the south of England, especially around east and north London, and provided similar services to REACT.

A perceived heavy-handed attitude by the bigger branches of THAMES caused a number of smaller groups to be formed in response. In 1983 the majority of THAMES in Greater London was reformed into the Association of Independent Monitors (AIM).

REVCOM
Another group originally formed with the use of CB radio in mind are REVCOM. REVCOM was formed by a breakaway from the American controlled REACT. REACT UK was encouraging people to form area REACT teams with annual fees per member, with the cash going straight to REACT HQ in the USA, with nothing hardly coming back. REVCOM no longer uses the CB service.

==Methods of transmission==
The originally imported equipment used AM amplitude modulation and SSB single-sideband modulation modes of transmission.

The UK channels that were legalised on 2 November 1981 were on two blocks of frequencies: 40 channels on the 27 MHz band and 20 channels on the 934 MHz band, both of which used FM (frequency modulation) and both unique to the UK. Equipment conforming with the 27 MHz CB27/81 Bandplan was identified as &quot;CB27/81&quot;. In 1987 40 additional frequencies were added, which were the same as the US allocation – but again using FM. This additional band is often referred to as the CEPT or EU band. As with the original 40 channels, this band is affected by the same atmospheric characteristics, especially towards the maxima of the 11-year sunspot cycle.

The formerly illegal SSB mode has its enthusiasts and adopted a different style of call-sign (instead of a &#x27;handle&#x27;) in the manner of radio amateurs.

CB clubs may issue call signs for their members. One scheme uses a numerical country or region prefix, two letters, and a membership number. For example, a prefix of &quot;26&quot; for England, club initials CT and membership number 100 would be &quot;Twenty Six Charlie Tango One Zero Zero&quot; when used on air, using phonetic alphabet to clarify the sound of the letters.

Three channels are listed in the Ofcom publication &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Band (CB) Radio Spectrum Use - Information and Operation&quot; for specific uses within the UK: 
* Channel 9: The emergency calling channel. There is no 24-hour monitoring service in the UK, but local CB users may be listening.
* Channel 14: Calling channel
* Channel 19: Mobile use

CB users may use the phonetic alphabet and ten-codes.

===UHF CB===
The first steps towards creating UHF CB a licence-free short range radio communications were taken in April 1997 when the European Radio Communications Committee decided on a 446 MHz frequency band to be used for the new radios. In November 1998, ERC Decision (98)25 allocated frequency band 446.0-446.1 MHz for analogue PMR446; another two decisions established licence exemption for PMR446 equipment and free circulation of the PMR446 equipment. The first country which introduced these frequencies for licence-free use was Ireland on 1 April 1998. The United Kingdom introduced PMR446 service in April 1999; since 2003, it has replaced the former short-range business radio (SRBR) service. Although not officially named as Citizens Band radio, users in the United Kingdom have considered it as low power UHF CB radio

In October 2005, ECC Decision (05)02 added unlicensed band 446.1–446.2 MHz for use by digital DMR/dPMR equipment.

In July 2015, ECC Decision (15)05 doubled the number of analogue channels to 16 by extending analogue operation onto the 446.1–446.2 MHz band previously used by digital DMR/dPMR equipment, effective January 2016; from January 2018, the number of digital channels will also be doubled by extending onto the 446.0–446.1 MHz band used by analogue FM.

==The CB craze and legalisation==
The new system was taken up enthusiastically by all those who had held back using an illegal system, and it was one of the biggest selling gifts for Christmas in 1981. The system suffered from many nuisance users who denied the use of the recognised calling channels to other users by transmitting a blank carrier and/or music. With the fight won, albeit with a considerable compromise and particularly with the many nuisance users, interest rapidly waned, the CB clubs gradually dwindled in membership, many disappearing altogether within a year or so.

==Nuisance==
There are some notable anti-social aspects to the hobby. It is possible to increase power output to very high levels using power amplifiers, and in some cases this can cause interference to and affect the operation of other equipment such as television and radio, and also to other CB radio users.

The band used for CB was already allocated in the UK to radio controlled models. While this was usually little more than a frustrating and expensive nuisance for boat and car modellers, it did pose a genuine danger for aircraft models, which can kill or seriously injure. As a result of the CB craze, an alternative band of 35 MHz. was offered to modellers to use, for which they would have to buy new equipment. Their old equipment could still be used if they wished to risk it, and 27 MHz remains legal for remote control to this day. Many cheap toys and household remote control equipment also use the frequency, adding to the interference and lack of reliability which is still a feature of this band.

==CB terminology==

There is a diverse vocabulary associated with the hobby, many words and phrases having been copied from the original American service. Few of these words are used in general conversation in the UK, and they serve equally as a reminder of the hobby’s American origins.

==QSL&#x27;ing==
QSL&#x27;ing is the exchange of contact confirmation reports, adapted from Q codes used by the military and amateur radio. Amateur radio operators would often follow up contacts around the world by sending specially printed qsl cards. This was adapted by CBers and colourful cards featuring &#x27;handles&#x27;, pictures and so on appeared.

==Fall from popularity==
From the inception of legalised CB radio, there has been much abuse of the system, with frequent complaints that CB radio was not policed properly in spite of the licence revenues.

CB channels still remained busy in many areas, despite mobile phones becoming increasingly common and feature rich. Many of the original advantages of mobile CB have been surpassed by the development of mobile internet access, satellite navigation systems, and the proliferation of other instant communication technologies such as text messaging.

The introduction of a new licence free handheld PMR 446 radio service has provided much of the features of traditional CB, in a small handheld format. This service is not directly comparable with CB, as PMR446 was intended to provide a short range service.

Changes to the UK&#x27;s amateur radio licensing system mean that it is now possible for people under the age of 14, and anyone else, to gain legal access to most of the UK amateur frequency allocation after sitting an exam to demonstrate basic technical knowledge.

==Licence-free CB brings rise in popularity==
As of 8 December 2006, CB Radio now joins PMR446, LPD433 and SRD860 under the category of licence-free personal communications.

In June 2011, the EU announced another change in technical specifications for CB use which, if implemented, would introduce a type approval for both AM and SSB operation. The introduction was originally delayed by the 2012 Olympics, and was scheduled to take effect in 2014.

==SSB and AM legalisation==
Following most other European countries, Ofcom proposed to adopt European Communication Committee Decision (11)031 in October 2013. This would permit the use of Single-Sideband and AM operation on the CEPT CB radio band, and Ofcom proceeded with legislation to this effect on 27 June 2014.

The new AM/SSB legislation permits the use of only new and approved sets, not &#x27;legacy&#x27; multimode sets.

<doc id="208334" wikidata="Q349967" url="?curid=208334" title="Mountain rescue">
<text>Mountain rescue refers to search and rescue activities that occur in a mountainous environment, although the term is sometimes also used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness environments. This tends to include mountains with technical rope access issues, snow, avalanches, ice, crevasses, glaciers, alpine environments and high altitudes. The difficult and remote nature of the terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs has resulted in the development of a number of specific pieces of equipment and techniques. Helicopters are often used to quickly extract casualties, and search dogs may be deployed to find a casualty.

Mountain rescue services may be paid professionals or volunteer professionals. Paid rescue services are more likely to exist in places with a high demand such as the Alps, national parks with mountain terrain and many ski resorts. However, the labor-intensive and occasional nature of mountain rescue, along with the specific techniques and local knowledge required for some environments, means that mountain rescue is often undertaken by voluntary teams. These are frequently made up of local climbers and guides. Often paid rescue services may work in co-operation with voluntary services. For instance, a paid helicopter rescue team may work with a volunteer mountain rescue team on the ground. Mountain rescue is often free, although in some parts of the world rescue organizations may charge for their services. But there are also exceptions, e.g. Switzerland, where mountain rescue is highly expensive (some 2,000 to US$4,000) and will be charged to the patient. In more remote or less-developed
parts of the world organized mountain rescue services are often negligible or non-existent.

==By country==

===Austria===
Österreichischer Bergrettungsdienst (ÖBRD) performs mountain rescue operations in the Austrian Alps and in Waldviertel.

Alpiner Rettungsausschuß Wien (ARAW) was founded in 1896 after an avalanche on Rax killed three mountaineers. In 1938 the organization was merged with the Deutsche Bergwacht. In 1946 (after World War II) the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service was (re)founded as Österreichischer Bergrettungsdienst.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Due to its mountainous terrain, following the Second World War, Bosnia and Herzegovina saw a need for the development and organization of a modern-day equivalent of the mountain rescue service. The first mountain rescue &quot;station&quot;, which consisted of professionally trained and semi-professional volunteers was founded in 1952 in Sarajevo and is the oldest continuously-functioning organization of such type in the present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the need arose even further, stations in additional cities were established as well. The Bosnian Mountain Rescue Union, although existent, acts merely as a supervisory-organization, as each station acts and finances itself independently, mostly relying on their distinguished municipal offices of Civil Defense.

===Canada===

In the five mountain national parks of the Canadian Rockies, mountain rescue is solely the responsibility of Parks Canada&#x27;s visitor safety rescue specialists.

Large areas in all Canadian national parks do not have reliable two-way radio or cellular coverage. The use of SOS, satellite phone or two-way communicating send devices like Garmin InReach or Spot is recommended.

There is no charge to park visitors who require help as search and rescue costs are part of the visitor&#x27;s park entrance fee. Parks Canada visitor safety specialists also manage highway avalanche control programs and publish a daily public avalanche bulletin between November and May.

===Croatia===
=== Czech Republic ===

The Mountain Rescue Service (Horská služba České republiky, HS ČR) of the Czech Republic provides nationwide mountain rescue operations and search and rescue operations in difficult terrains in close cooperations with the Air Rescue Service and Police of the Czech Republic. It is a part of the integrated rescue system in the Czech Republic and can be reached under the phone number 1210 (paid number) or under 112 - EU standard integrated emergency service.

===France===

The &quot;Gendarmerie Nationale&quot; and the &quot;Police nationale&quot; are in charge of mountain rescuing. Being a paramilitary police force with law-enforcement assignments, the gendarmerie has a wide variety of missions, mainly:
*search and rescue
*surveillance of mountain areas
*law enforcement
*prevention of accidents and safety of public
*deliver expert reports before the courts

The gendarmerie employs 260 &quot;gendarmes&quot;, divided in 20 units nationwide;
* 15 &quot;Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne&quot; (PGHM) sprinkled in the Alps and the Pyrénées, in addition to the islands of Réunion in the Indian Ocean and Corsica.
* 5 &quot;Peloton de Gendarmerie de Montagne&quot;, in the Massif central and Vosges areas.
90 per cent of interventions are made by air.

The police &quot;Compagnie républicaine de sécurité&quot; also provides mountain search and rescue in the French Alps and Pyrenees alongside the PGHM.

===Germany===
===Hong Kong===

The Civil Aid Service, Mountain Rescue Unit (M.R.U.) was established in 1967 due to the demand for a mountain rescue service. At first, the M.R.U. had two separate command centres, one in Hong Kong Island, and the other in the Kowloon Peninsula. The two command centres merged in 1972 to a single centre based at the Civil Aid Service headquarters in Kowloon. In 2005, the M.R.U. was renamed the &quot;Mountain Search and Rescue Company&quot; (MSaR). The Mountain Search and Rescue Company of the Civil Aid Service is responsible for rescue operations in the hills and hiking trails of Hong Kong. As of 2014 the Company has 13 officers and 128 members. The unit works alongside the Government Flying Service in the air and Hong Kong Fire Services on the ground. Besides rescue operations, MSaR also help promote mountaineering safety.

===Ireland===
Mountain rescue services in Ireland operate under the umbrella association of Mountain Rescue Ireland (&quot;Cumann Tarrthála Sléibhte na h-Éireann&quot;). Mountain Rescue Ireland covers areas across the island of Ireland, both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

===Israel===
Unit 669 &quot;Airborne Combat Rescue And Evacuation Unit&quot; is the Israel Defense Forces heliborne combat search and rescue extraction unit, subordinate to 7 Wing (special forces) of the Israeli Air Force. It is considered one of the four premier elite units of unit the IDF.
The mandate of the unit is to rescue downed pilots and execute airborne medical evacuation of critical casualties.
Due to its unique capabilities, the unit participates in IDF&#x27;s and other security bodies special operations.
In addition, the unit&#x27;s teams are rushed to complex rescue events for which civilian emergency services are unable to provide an adequate response.

===Italy===

Mountain rescue in Italy is provided by CNSAS (&quot;Corpo Nazionale Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico&quot;, En. The National Alpine Cliff and Cave Rescue Corps), a voluntary agency that provides nationwide mountain search and rescue operations in difficult terrains in close cooperations with the Medical Air Rescue Service 118, with Meteomont army team and Police of Italy under the phone number 112- EU standard integrated emergency service. The main missions are search and rescue, avalanche response, first aid, surveillance of mountain areas, prevention of accidents, and public safety.

=== Kyrgyzstan ===
Rescue service in mountains of Kyrgyzstan is a non commercial specialized organization. Rescue teams use modern rescue equipment and a helicopter. The team consists of experienced climbers and rescuers. Works are conducted on a mountain relief of any complexity, at any heights and routes. The organization has been accredited in Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Kyrgyz Republic in accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic and has the right to conduct rescue operations.

===Pakistan===
Mountain rescues at high elevations in Pakistan are usually carried out by the Pakistan Army Aviation Corps. On July 30, 2018, a Russian climber was rescued from Latok Peak at an elevation of 20,650 feet, a record for the highest mountain rescue in Pakistan.

===Poland===
=== Slovakia ===

The Mountain Rescue Service (&quot;Horská záchranná služba&quot;, HZS) of Slovakia is a civilian agency that provides nationwide mountain rescue operations and search and rescue operations in difficult terrains in close cooperation with the Air Rescue Service. It is a part of the integrated rescue system in Slovakia and can be reached under the phone number 18300 or under 112 - EU standard integrated emergency service.

===Spain===
Since 1981 the Guardia Civil&#x27;s Search and Rescue Group (&quot;Grupo de Rescate e Intervención en Montaña-GREIM&quot;) has been responsible for mountain rescue in all of Spain except for Catalonia. Before 1981 mountain rescue was provided by volunteers.

The unit is divided into:
*Special Mountain Unit
*Expeditionary Alpine Group
*Competition Team
*Special Mountain training Center

The group comprises 250 members who undergo ten months training in a specialized training center in Candanchu. The unit is divided into five regions (Jaca, Cangas de Onís, Navacerrada, Granada, Vielha e Mijaran). In 2011 they carried out 761 missions.

In Catalonia a special division of the fire department, GRAE (Support Group for Special Actions), are responsible for mountain rescue.

===Switzerland===

Switzerland has an incredibly dense network of alpine rescue and relief organisations. Most of the rescue are operated by Swiss Air-Rescue Rega (, ), a non-profit organisation that provide alpine rescue with its fleet of 17 medical helicopters, including 11 Agusta A109 SP Grand &quot;Da Vinci&quot;, used both in ground support of paramedical personnel and frontline alpine rescue. 
Swiss Air-Rescue Rega has two very distinctive characteristics: they can reach any place in Switzerland under 15 minutes, due to their ten bases, and they are medicalized. This means an emergency physician (mostly an anesthetist) will be on the flight to provide advanced treatment.

The Swiss canton of Valais doesn&#x27;t use Rega, they have their own rescue fleet, named Air Glacier and Air Zermatt. They have similar colours, procedures and personnel.

The Swiss army is also used in frontline rescue of civilians. Their many mountain battalions are commonly used in collaboration with the Rega, due to their manpower, heavy equipment and proven experience of collaboration with civilian authorities.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, mountain rescue is a free service, provided by volunteers. Each team is an independent charity, and are linked together by regional organizations and national bodies. In England and Wales this is Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW) and in Scotland, Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland, now known as Scottish Mountain Rescue (SMR). Prince William is the patron of MREW. Mountain rescue services are also provided by the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS).

===United States of America===

In the United States, mountain search and rescue is a technical specialty within general search and rescue. It is handled by &#x27;career, on-duty and on-call paid&#x27; teams within the national parks, and supplemented by other paid and volunteer assets/resources as needed. For areas outside the national parks, there are approximately 20 agencies, mostly sheriff&#x27;s departments, in the U.S. which provide paid or career members of a mountain SAR team. Most of those supplement with volunteer professionals. The bulk of mountain SAR operations in the U.S. are provided by &#x27;volunteer professional&#x27; teams (are not career positions or paid but must meet minimum industry-accepted standards at or above their paid counterparts), who may also respond via mutual aid or automatic aid to incidents out-of-county, out-of-state and into national parks, via intrastate, interstate, and national park agreements, as well as via the FEMA NIMS national mutual aid deployment system.
Parks with paid teams include Denali National Park, Yosemite National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park. Many paid and volunteer professional mountain SAR teams are part of the Mountain Rescue Association (MRA) and operate under the authority of the local sheriff&#x27;s department (approximately 42 of the 50 states) or state police or emergency management agency. Member teams are required to regularly reaccredit in three disciplines: technical rope rescue, snow and ice rescue operations, and search management/tracking. While teams are primarily responsible to operate in one county which could be from 50 square miles to 20,000 square miles, they typically respond to adjoining counties and states.
Under the National Incident Management System, mountain rescue unit qualifications are standardized for those units which choose to be deployable for national disasters and national mutual aid outside their jurisdiction.

<text>The Second Geneva Convention, officially the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (), is one of the four treaties of the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea was first adopted in 1949, replacing the Hague Convention (X) of 1907. It adapts the main protective regime of the First Geneva Convention to combat at sea.

==Summary of provisions==
The treaty is a lengthy document consisting of 63 articles. The most essential provisions of the treaty are:
*Articles 12 and 18 requires all parties to protect and care for the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked.
*Article 14 clarifies that although a warship cannot capture a hospital ship&#x27;s medical staff, it can hold the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked as prisoners of war.
*Article 21 allows appeals to be made to neutral vessels to help collect and care for the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. The neutral vessels cannot be captured.
*Articles 36 and 37 protect religious and medical personnel serving on a combat ship.
*Article 22 states that hospital ships cannot be used for any military purpose, and owing to their humanitarian mission, they cannot be attacked or captured.

For a detailed discussion of each article of the treaty, see the original text and the commentary. There are currently 196 countries party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including this second treaty but also including the other three.

<doc id="208342" wikidata="Q5229890" url="?curid=208342" title="USS South Dakota (ACR-9)">
<text>The first USS &quot;South Dakota&quot; (ACR-9/CA-9), also referred to &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 9&quot;, and later renamed Huron, was a United States Navy armored cruiser.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; was laid down on 30 September 1902 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, she was launched on 21 July 1904; sponsored by Grace Herreid, daughter of Charles N. Herreid, Governor of South Dakota, and commissioned on 27 January 1908.

==Design==
An act of Congress authorized &quot;South Dakota&quot; on 7 June 1900. The ship&#x27;s hull and machinery cost a contract total of $3,750,000. Her plant consisted of vertical triple expansion engines and 16 Babcock and Wilcox boilers, which powered two propellers. Four funnels, one cage mast, and one military mast provided a distinctive silhouette. One Type J submarine signal receiving set equipped the ship. Capt. Charles E. Fox reported on board as the ship&#x27;s General Inspector on 30 August 1907. The cruiser completed her preliminary acceptance on 19 November.

==Shakedown cruise==
&quot;South Dakota&quot; began her shakedown on 3 March 1908. The ship sailed from San Francisco to Mexican waters, carrying out trials in Magdalena Bay from 8 to 10 March, and on 11 and 12 March off Isla Cedros—the ship reported her movements off the Anglicized spelling of Cerros Island, contributing to debate among international navigators concerning the designation of the island. She came about and visited San Diego, California (13–24 March). &quot;South Dakota&quot; then made a brief voyage northward along the Californian coast and put into San Pedro through the end of the month, followed by a visit to Long Beach (1–5 April), returning to San Pedro on 5 and 6 April. On 8 and 9 April, the cruiser lay off the Mare Island Light, and then visited San Francisco. &quot;South Dakota&quot; attained a speed of on trials.

She then made for the Pacific Northwest to accomplish work associated with her shakedown, reaching Port Angeles, Washington, on 12 April 1908, and (13–23 April) entering drydock at Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington. &quot;South Dakota&quot; floated from the drydock and then anchored off Anacortes, Washington, from 23 to 25 April. Assigned to the Armored Cruiser Squadron, Pacific Fleet, &quot;South Dakota&quot; visited &quot;Seattle, Washington&quot;, (25–27 April). The ship returned to Puget Sound to participate in a reception for the Atlantic Fleet through 1 May. Following the reception, the cruiser completed her final acceptance trials off San Francisco through the end of May. &quot;South Dakota&quot; cruised off the west coast of the United States into August. She departed San Francisco in company with on 24 August, arriving on 23 September at Pago Pago, Samoa.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
&quot;South Dakota&quot; sailed easterly courses to operate in Central and South American waters in September. In the autumn of 1909, she deployed westward with the Armored Cruiser Squadron. The force called at ports in the Admiralty Islands, the Philippines, Japan, and China, before returning to Honolulu on 31 January 1910.

In February, &quot;South Dakota&quot; joined to form a Special Service Squadron which cruised off the Atlantic coast of South America and then returned to the Pacific late in the year.

Following operations along the Pacific coast during much of 1911, &quot;South Dakota&quot; began a cruise in December with the Armored Cruiser Squadron which took her from California to the Hawaiian Islands, the Marianas, the Philippines, and Japan. After returning to the west coast in August 1912, she participated in periodic squadron exercises until she was placed in reserve on 30 December 1913 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

Detached from the Reserve Force, Pacific Fleet on 17 April 1914, &quot;South Dakota&quot; made a cruise southward into Mexican waters in May and another westward to the Hawaiian Islands in August. She returned to Bremerton on 14 September and reverted to reserve status on 28 September. She was the flagship of the Reserve Force, Pacific Fleet, from 21 January 1915 until relieved by the protected cruiser on 5 February 1916. She remained in reduced commission through 1916, and on 5 April 1917 she was again placed in full commission.

===World War I===

Transferred to the Atlantic after the United States entered World War I, &quot;South Dakota&quot; departed Bremerton on 12 April. She joined sister ships , , and at Colón, Panama, on 29 May; thence proceeded to the South Atlantic for patrol duty operating from Brazilian ports. On 2 November 1918, she escorted troop convoys from the east coast to the mid-Atlantic rendezvous point where British cruisers joined the convoy. Following the Armistice, &quot;South Dakota&quot; made two voyages from Brest, France, to New York, returning troops to the U.S.

===Post-war===
In the summer of 1919, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was ordered back to the Pacific to serve as flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, arriving at Manila on 27 October. &quot;South Dakota&quot; was renamed Huron---in order to free up her original name for use with the projected , ---on 7 June 1920 and was designated CA-9 on 17 July 1920. She served in the Asiatic Fleet for the next seven years, operating in Philippine waters during the winter and out of Shanghai and Yantai during the summer. On 25 February 1925, she ran aground off Palawayan Island in the Netherlands East Indies; she was refloated the next day.

Ordered home, &quot;Huron&quot; departed Manila on 31 December 1926 and arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 3 March 1927. She was decommissioned on 17 June and remained in reserve until she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 November 1929. She was sold on 11 February 1930 for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament, for scrapping to Abe Goldberg and Co., Seattle, Wash.

&quot;Huron&quot; was stripped down to the waterline and then sold to the Powell River Company, Ltd. In August 1931, the ship was towed to Powell River, British Columbia, Canada, to serve as a floating breakwater for a large logging mill. She was preceded the previous year by the former cruiser . &quot;Huron&quot; was anchored into position and rainwater was periodically pumped out to ensure she remained afloat. On 18 February 1961, a storm flooded the hulk of the old cruiser, and she sank in of water, where she remains to this day. Coincidentally, some of the iron for her hull came from Texada Island, merely from her Powell River resting place.

<doc id="208349" wikidata="Q2529416" url="?curid=208349" title="Ten-code">
<text>Ten-codes, officially known as ten signals, are brevity codes used to represent common phrases in voice communication, particularly by US public safety officials and in citizens band (CB) radio transmissions. The police version of ten-codes is officially known as the APCO Project 14 Aural Brevity Code.

The codes, developed during 1937–1940 and expanded in 1974 by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), allow brevity and standardization of message traffic. They have historically been widely used by law enforcement officers in North America, but in 2006, due to the lack of standardization, the U.S. federal government recommended they be discontinued in favor of everyday language.

==History==
APCO first proposed Morse code brevity codes in the June 1935 issue of The APCO Bulletin, which were adapted from the procedure symbols of the U.S. Navy, though these procedures were for communications in Morse code, not voice.

In August 1935, the APCO Bulletin published a recommendation that the organization issue a handbook that described standard operating procedures, including:
# A standard message form for use by all police departments.
# A simple code for service dispatches relating to corrections, repetitions, etc.
# A standard arrangement of the context of messages, (for example, name and description of missing person might be transmitted as follows: Name, age, height, weight, physical characteristics, clothing; if car used, the license, make, description and motor number. This information would actually be transmitted in the text of the message as follows: John Brown 28-5-9-165 medium build brown eyes dark hair dark suit light hat Mich. 35 lic. W 2605 Ford S 35 blue red wheels 2345678 may go to Indiana).
# A standard record system for logging the operation of the station.
# Other important records in accordance with the uniform crime reporting system sponsored by the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
The development of the APCO Ten Signals began in 1937 to reduce use of speech on the radio at a time when police radio channels were limited. Credit for inventing the codes goes to Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Hopper, communications director for the Illinois State Police, District 10 in Pesotum, Illinois. Hopper had been involved in radio for years and realized there was a need to abbreviate transmissions on State Police bands. Experienced radio operators knew the first syllable of a transmission was frequently not understood because of quirks in early electronics technology. Radios in the 1930s were based on vacuum tubes powered by a small motor-generator called a dynamotor. The dynamotor took from 1/10 to 1/4 of a second to &quot;spin up&quot; to full power. Police officers were trained to push the microphone button, then pause briefly before speaking; however, sometimes they would forget to wait. Preceding each code with &quot;ten-&quot; gave the radio transmitter time to reach full power. An APCO Bulletin of January 1940 lists codes assigned as part of standardisation.

In 1954, APCO published an article describing a proposed simplification of the code, based on an analysis conducted by the San Diego Police Department. In the September 1955 issue of the APCO Bulletin, a revision of the Ten-Signals was proposed, and it was later adopted.

The Ten Signals were included in APCO Project Two (1967), &quot;Public Safety Standard Operating Procedures Manual&quot;, published as study cards in APCO Project 4 (1973), &quot;Ten Signal Cards&quot;, and then revised in APCO Project 14 (1974).

===In popular culture===
Ten-codes, especially &quot;10-4&quot; (meaning &quot;understood&quot;) first reached public recognition in the mid- to late-1950s through the television series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, with Broderick Crawford.

Ten-codes were adapted for use by CB radio enthusiasts. C. W. McCall&#x27;s hit song &quot;Convoy&quot; (1975), depicting conversation among CB-communicating truckers, put phrases like &quot;10-4&quot; and &quot;what&#x27;s your twenty?&quot; (10-20 for &quot;where are you?&quot;) into common use in American English.

The movie &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), loosely based on McCall&#x27;s song, further entrenched ten-codes in casual conversation, as did the movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit.

The New Zealand reality television show &quot;Ten 7 Aotearoa&quot; (formerly &quot;Police Ten 7&quot;) takes its name from the New Zealand Police ten-code 10-7, which means &quot;Unit has arrived at job&quot;.

==Police officer retirement==
Often when an officer retires, a call to dispatch is made. The officer gives a 10-7 code (Out of service) and then a 10-42 code (ending tour of duty).

==Signals by era==
== Replacement with plain language ==
While ten-codes were intended to be a terse, concise, and standardized system, the proliferation of different meanings can render them useless in situations when officers from different agencies and jurisdictions need to communicate.

In the fall of 2005, responding to inter-organizational communication problems during the rescue operations after Hurricane Katrina, the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) discouraged the use of ten-codes and other codes due to their wide variation in meaning. The Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s SAFECOM program, established in response to communication problems experienced during the September 11 attacks also advises local agencies on how and why to transition to plain language, and their use is expressly forbidden in the nationally standardized Incident Command System, as is the use of other codes.

APCO International stated in 2012 that plain speech communications over public safety radio systems is preferred over the traditional 10-Codes and dispatch signals. Nineteen states had changed to plain English by the end of 2009. , ten-codes remained in common use in many areas, but were increasingly being phased out in favor of plain language.

=== Phrase Word Brevity Code ===
About 1979, APCO created the Phrase Word Brevity Code as a direct replacement for the Ten-code.
=== ICS Clear Text ===
In 1980, the National Incident Management System published a document, ICS Clear Text Guide, which was another attempt to create a replacement for Ten-codes. The list of code words was republished in the 1990 Montana Mutual Aid and Common Frequencies document.

==Related codes==

Brevity codes other than the APCO 10-code are frequently used, and include several types:

*The California Highway Patrol uses ten-codes, along with an additional set of eleven- and higher codes.
*California Penal Code sections were in use by the Los Angeles Police Department as early as the 1940s, and these Hundred Code numbers are still used today instead of the corresponding ten-code. Generally these are given as two sets of numbers
*The New York Fire Department uses its own ten-code system.
*The New Zealand Fire Service uses a system of &quot;K-codes&quot; to pass fire appliance availability statuses as well as operational messages. For example, &quot;K1&quot; means &quot;proceeding to incident&quot;, &quot;K99&quot; means &quot;Structure fire, well involved&quot;, and &quot;K41&quot; means &quot;fatality&quot; (a reference to the Ballantyne&#x27;s fire, New Zealand&#x27;s deadliest, which killed 41 people). The New Zealand Police also use some K-codes, with completely unrelated meanings to those used by NZFS; Police code &quot;K1&quot; means &quot;no further police action required&quot;.
*Telegraph and teletype procedures
**Q code and prosigns for Morse code are used in amateur radio, aviation, and marine radio. They provide specific abbreviations for concepts related to aviation, shipping, RTTY, radiotelegraph, and amateur radio. In radiotelegraph operation, a Q code is often shorter, and provides codes standardized by meaning in all languages – essential for international shortwave radio communications.
**Z codes are used for military radio communications NATO countries, and like Q codes are standardized across languages.

<doc id="208350" wikidata="Q610272" url="?curid=208350" title="First Geneva Convention">
<text>The First Geneva Convention, officially the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field (), held on 22 August 1864, is the first of four treaties of the Geneva Conventions. It defines &quot;the basis on which rest the rules of international law for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts.&quot; 

After the first treaty was adopted in 1864, it was significantly revised and replaced in 1906, 1929, and finally 1949. It is inextricably linked to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is both the instigator for the inception and enforcer of the articles in these conventions.

==History==
The 1864 Geneva Convention was instituted during a critical period in European politics and the military. The American Civil War had been raging elsewhere since 1861, and would ultimately claim between 750,000 and 900,000 lives. Between the fall of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the rise of his nephew in the Italian campaign of 1859, the powers had maintained peace in western Europe. 

Yet, with the 1853–1856 conflict in the Crimea, war had returned to Europe, and while those troubles were &quot;in a distant and inaccessible region&quot; northern Italy was &quot;so accessible from all parts of western Europe that it instantly filled with curious observers;&quot; while the bloodshed was not excessive the sight of it was unfamiliar and shocking. Despite its intent of ameliorating the ravages of war, the inception of the 1864 Geneva Convention inaugurated &quot;a renewal of military activity on a large scale, to which the people of western Europe…had not been accustomed since the first Napoleon had been eliminated.&quot;

The movement for an international set of laws governing the treatment and care for the wounded and prisoners of war began when relief activist Henry Dunant witnessed the Battle of Solferino in 1859, fought between French-Piedmontese and Austrian armies in Northern Italy. The subsequent suffering of 40,000 wounded soldiers left on the field due to lack of facilities, personnel, and truces to give them medical aid moved Dunant into action. Upon return to Geneva, Dunant published his account &quot;Un Souvenir de Solferino&quot;. He urged the calling together of an international conference and soon co-founded with the Swiss lawyer Gustave Moynier, the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), while recognising that it is &quot;primarily the duty and responsibility of a nation to safeguard the health and physical well-being of its people&quot;, knew there would always, especially in times of war, be a &quot;need for voluntary agencies to supplement…the official agencies charged with these responsibilities in every country.&quot; To ensure that its mission was widely accepted, it required a body of rules to govern its activities and those of the involved belligerent parties.

Only one year later, the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries and the United States, Brazil, and Mexico to attend an official diplomatic conference. Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty-six delegates to Geneva. The meeting was presided over by General Guillaume Henri Dufour. The conference occurred in the Alabama room at Geneva&#x27;s Hotel de Ville (city hall) on 22 August 1864. The conference adopted the first Geneva Convention &quot;for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field&quot;. Representatives of 12 states signed the convention:
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

The United Kingdom of Norway and Sweden signed in December. The United Kingdom signed a year later in 1865. The Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Bavaria and Austria signed in 1866 following the conclusion of the Austro-Prussian War. The United States of America signed in 1882.

The original document is preserved in the Swiss Federal Archives in Bern. In the past it has been loaned to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva.

==Application ==
The convention &quot;derived its obligatory force from the implied consent of the states which accepted and applied them in the conduct of their military operations.&quot; Despite its basic mandates, listed below, it was successful in effecting significant and rapid reforms. This first effort provided only for:
# the immunity from capture and destruction of all establishments for the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers,
# the impartial reception and treatment of all combatants,
# the protection of civilians providing aid to the wounded, and
# the recognition of the Red Cross symbol as a means of identifying persons and equipment covered by the agreement.

==Summary of provisions and revisions==
The original ten articles of the 1864 treaty have been expanded to the current 64 articles. This lengthy treaty protects soldiers that are hors de combat (out of the battle due to sickness or injury), as well as medical and religious personnel, and civilians in the zone of battle. Among its principal provisions:
* Article 12 mandates that wounded and sick soldiers who are out of the battle should be humanely treated, and in particular should not be killed, injured, tortured, or subjected to biological experimentation. This article is the keystone of the treaty, and defines the principles from which most of the treaty is derived, including the obligation to respect medical units and establishments (Chapter III), the personnel entrusted with the care of the wounded (Chapter IV), buildings and material (Chapter V), medical transports (Chapter VI), and the protective sign (Chapter VII).
* Article 15 mandates that wounded and sick soldiers should be collected, cared for, and protected, though they may also become prisoners of war.
* Article 16 mandates that parties to the conflict should record the identity of the dead and wounded, and transmit this information to the opposing party.
* Article 9 allows the International Red Cross &quot;or any other impartial humanitarian organization&quot; to provide protection and relief of wounded and sick soldiers, as well as medical and religious personnel.

Due to significant ambiguities in the articles with certain terms and concepts and even more so to the rapidly developing nature of war and military technology, the original articles had to be revised and expanded, largely at the Second Geneva Conference in 1906 and Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 which extended the articles to maritime warfare. The 1906 version was updated and replaced by the 1929 version when minor modifications were made to it. It was again updated and replaced by the 1949 version, better known as the Final Act of Geneva Conference, 1949. 

However, as Jean S. Pictet, Director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, noted in 1951, &quot;the law, however, always lags behind charity; it is tardy in conforming with life&#x27;s realities and the needs of humankind&quot;, as such it is the duty of the Red Cross &quot;to assist in the widening the scope of law, on the assumption that…law will retain its value&quot;, principally through the revision and expansion of these basic principles of the original Geneva Convention.

For a detailed discussion of each article of the treaty, see the original text and the commentary. There are currently 196 countries party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including this first treaty but also including the other three.

<doc id="208353" wikidata="Q5308430" url="?curid=208353" title="Drop the Dead Donkey">
<text>Drop the Dead Donkey is a British television sitcom that was first shown on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom between 1990 and 1998. It is set in the offices of &quot;GlobeLink News&quot;, a fictional TV news company. Recorded close to transmission, it made use of contemporary news events to give the programme a greater sense of realism. It was created by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin. The series had an ensemble cast, making stars of Haydn Gwynne, Stephen Tompkinson and Neil Pearson.

The show was awarded the Best Comedy (Programme or Series) Award at the 1994 BAFTA Awards. At the British Comedy Awards the show won Best New TV Comedy in 1990, Best Channel 4 Comedy in 1991, and Best Channel 4 Sitcom in 1994.

In 2000, the show was ranked 94 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, a list compiled by the British Film Institute.

== Development ==

According to Swedish comedian Kryddan Petersson, he and the group behind &quot;Helt Apropå&quot; had come up with an idea for a show like this, which they presented to British colleagues some time around 1989–90. Most of them were not impressed, but two of them took the idea seriously and wrote this show. Later on, the Swedish group brought the material rights to the show back to Sweden, and created the show &quot;Döda danskar räknas inte&quot; (&quot;Dead Danes don&#x27;t count&quot;), which aired on SVT in 1994.

The series&#x27; story began with the acquisition of GlobeLink by media mogul Sir Roysten Merchant, an allusion to either Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin note on their DVDs that it was fortunate for their libel lawyers that the two men shared the same initials. The series is mostly based on the ongoing battle between the staff of GlobeLink, led by editor George Dent, as they try to maintain the company as a serious news organisation, and Sir Roysten&#x27;s right-hand man Gus Hedges, trying to make the show more sensationalist and suppress stories that might harm Sir Roysten&#x27;s business empire.

One of the original working titles was &quot;Dead Belgians Don&#x27;t Count&quot;. &quot;Dead Kuwaitis Don&#x27;t Count&quot; was also considered for a short time but was ultimately replaced by &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;:

== Characters ==

=== Major characters ===
* Gus Hedges (Robert Duncan) – Series One to Six— The unctuous Chief Executive of the company, yes-man to Sir Roysten Merchant and an unwavering supporter of then Conservative Prime Minister John Major is a management stereotype, complete with clichés. He transforms GlobeLink from a serious news network to a ratings-chasing tabloid channel. He is notable for management jargon, such as, &quot;Are we cooking with napalm? You bet!&quot; In light of what he refers to as his &quot;hands-off&quot; role, he frequently prefaces his interference in editorial matters with the opening, &quot;Now, as you all know, I’m not here...&quot; He is disliked and distrusted by the staff, who treat him with contempt. Outside the office, Gus is lonely. He has no real friends, and his occasional attempts to make friends at work fail, largely because of his insistence on behaving like an &quot;executive management module&quot;. George appears to be the closest thing Gus has to a friend, but while Gus heavily leans on George for emotional support he shows no interest in reciprocating and frequently over-rides George&#x27;s opinions and concerns. Some of these personality traits stem from his childhood; his older brother was his parents’ favourite and Gus has terrible feelings of inadequacy. He is sexually inexperienced and fears advances from women. He is afraid of illness, and thoughts of his own mortality terrify him. Despite his executive position, he fears that he has not really achieved anything and will be quickly forgotten. Gus is alleged to have been based on Channel 4&#x27;s controller at the time, Michael Grade, although the original idea was first pitched to the BBC, with Channel Four only picking up the series after the BBC refused to broadcast it. In series 6, terrified by the news of Globelink&#x27;s upcoming closure, Gus comes up with unlikely schemes to keep the company afloat and becomes increasingly comically desperate in his attempts to get reassurance from Sir Roysten, who ignores all his phone calls. 
* George Dent (Jeff Rawle) – Series One to Six— The station&#x27;s editor. George is a nervous wreck and hypochondriac who frequently finds himself in conflict with Gus over editorial decisions, but he is usually too afraid to argue with the Chief Executive. George is generally a moral man, who has a good sense of what a news company should really be doing and what stories are important, but he is frequently bullied by Gus and distracted by his staff. He suffers from a number of anxiety disorders and apparently psychosomatic symptoms, which he will often relate apprehensively to his colleagues. George once remarked that his doctor had suggested that he stop visiting the surgery and simply fax his new symptoms in every day. In earlier series, George comes across as broadly competent if a bit weak willed before troubles in his personal life take their toll and the job becomes out of his depth with Henry remarking in Series 3 &#x27;George seems particularly out of it these days&#x27;. George also suffers from appalling bad luck, such as when he buys Henry&#x27;s car, whose gearbox almost immediately fails; Damien has the car stolen so George can claim it on insurance, but George has already spent £2,000 on a new gearbox, and before Damien can get the car back it rolls off a cliff. George does become noticeably more confident and extroverted when drunk, although this rarely happens. On the rare occasions when George develops some confidence without alcohol such as after a paintballing weekend away where he got to take out some of his frustrations on Gus, he finds himself able to competently handle his job and manage his hypochondria. However, this is short-lived and he is quickly confronted with another insecurity. Earlier scripts followed the deterioration of George&#x27;s marriage to his somewhat exploitative and vindictive wife, Margaret, and following their divorce, George&#x27;s problems at home generally revolved around the antisocial and increasingly criminal behaviour of his daughter Deborah. He meets a woman from Poland called Anna (played by his real-life wife, Nina Marc) who wants to marry him but he believes it is out of love when all she wants is a passport. In spite of the general view that George is useless and inept he is commonly sought out by the other members of Globelink for advice on their personal problems. George appears particularly close to Dave despite their vast differences, George has loaned Dave significant sums of money and tries to advise and help Dave through his troubles despite his advice often making things worse. 
* Alex Pates (Haydn Gwynne) – Series One and Two— Assistant editor and George&#x27;s second-in-command. The token &quot;normal&quot; person, Alex is determined, skilled and professional, if very cynical. She has a fierce temper, and can be violent when provoked. Married and divorced before the series begins, her ex-husband – now a slum landlord — reappears on one occasion to use Alex to thwart the broadcasting of a news story about his unlawful business practices. In response to this, Alex breaks his nose. Alex&#x27;s mother (known only as &quot;Mummy&quot; or &quot;Mrs. Pates&quot; and until the final episode of series 2 an unseen character) repeatedly interrupts important meetings with frivolous and bizarre telephone enquiries, such as whether she should stockpile petrol in the bath in response to rising fuel prices or whether signing up to the Social Chapter would mean having to use a squat toilet. At the end of Series 2, the final series in which Alex appears, Ms. Pates suffers an excruciating moment while trying to humiliate Dave, who she had a one-night stand with in the Emmy-Award winning Christmas episode. Between Series 2 and 3, Alex leaves GlobeLink for the BBC.
* Helen Cooper (Ingrid Lacey) – Series Three to Six— Replacing Alex as Assistant Editor from the beginning of Series 3, Helen is extremely efficient and organised, and is frequently annoyed and frustrated by the general inefficiency of GlobeLink. At home, she is the single mother of a daughter called Chloe (Jocelyn Barker), and is a lesbian – a fact she has been keeping secret from her daughter and her parents despite a powerful sense that she really ought to tell them. When George admits that he has fallen in love with her and asks her out, she discloses her sexuality to him in an attempt to let him down gently. George assumes she is lying to spare his feelings – a suspicion reinforced when Helen has a drunken one-night stand with Dave while the staff are on a team-building weekend. Dedicated to the service of &quot;proper&quot; news, Helen often clashes with Gus, but is usually supported, if ineffectually, by George. Helen quickly earns the nickname of Stalin from other staff due to her obsession with organisation. She does join in with some of the zanier antics of the office and has been seen to be the only source of support for Joy and Sally despite the latter&#x27;s vindictive behaviour. In the final series, Helen finally comes to grips with the idea of coming out to her parents, and has to contemplate a less-than-glamorous job offer from her girlfriend. 
* Henry Davenport (David Swift) – Series One to Six – One of the station&#x27;s news anchors. Apparently a dignified veteran reporter, he is deeply contemptuous of Sir Roysten, Gus, and everything about the &quot;modern&quot; news industry. He is in constant conflict with his newsreading counterpart Sally, the two of them taking any opportunity to make jokes and jibes at the other&#x27;s expense. However, very infrequently, particularly in later episodes, the viewer gets the impression that Henry and Sally have become rather fond of each other – although neither would admit it. They also on one occasion work together to prevent an up-and-coming presenter from potentially replacing either of them by getting her to badmouth Sir Roysten, unaware she is in earshot of a newspaper journalist. Henry frequently derides younger presenters on other stations as &quot;androids&quot; and &quot;holograms&quot;, and bemoans the loss of what he considers to be the more interesting personalities of the past. In contrast to his stately on-screen persona, he spends much of his spare time drinking, gambling and womanising, often in cahoots with Dave. The tabloids occasionally report these activities, but Henry&#x27;s image seems oddly untarnished by these articles. Married and divorced several times, with two daughters, Henry is constantly struggling with alimony repayments and the demands of his ex-wives. Henry also believed for a short time that he had an illegitimate son, although the &quot;son&quot; later proved to be a fraud who was out for Henry&#x27;s money. His extramarital affairs in the past have included wives of so-called friends in the industry. Henry may have been based, at least in part, on Reginald Bosanquet, and indeed at one point he owned a yacht named &quot;Bosanquet&quot;. Although Henry has made some remarkable contributions to TV news, and met many of the great leaders of the modern world, it often transpires that his achievements were intertwined with or as a result of his drink- or sex-related excesses. After GlobeLink closed at the end of series six in 1998, Henry found a new role well suited to his outspoken nature – as a late-night radio host on the fictional Radio Gab.
* Sally Smedley (Victoria Wicks) – Series One to Six – GlobeLink&#x27;s second news anchor, handpicked by Sir Roysten when he acquired the company. Sally is noted for her snobbishness and vapidity, and tends to view newsreading merely as a means to boost her public image and attract fashionable promotional contracts. All her views are conservative and it is much to her chagrin that she is a pin-up for so many gay men. She always has a problem with at least one member of the staff, and complains incessantly, usually prefacing her gripes with &quot;I’m not one to complain...&quot;. She is generally disliked and mocked by her colleagues, mainly due to her obsession with fashion and her own image to the exclusion of any real awareness of current affairs. Helen occasionally tries to sympathise with her, and there are infrequent incidents that reveal Sally&#x27;s vulnerability. She was raised by her grandmother, who clearly abused her as a child – incidents are recounted in which Sally is locked in a rat-infested cellar; or abandoned in a forest, ostensibly to cure her fear of trees. Sally lives alone with her Filipina maid, whom she views (and treats) as little more than a slave. Sally is infamous throughout the GlobeLink offices and elsewhere for her supposedly secret liaisons with dockers, soldiers, sailors, sportsmen and, in particular, lorry drivers. During one encounter with a sound engineer, her colleagues were delighted to discover she had left her radio microphone on, and tapes of her experience were quickly circulated around the office. The episode where Sally miscarries her baby and agrees to conduct a magazine interview suggests that Sally&#x27;s sexual preferences are something of a defence mechanism to ensure that she is devoid of emotional feeling because she fears being overwhelmed by them. Sally – who is 42 at the end of the final series in 1998 and no longer wanted by many television companies echoing many of the complaints by middle-aged female news readers such as Selena Scott, Jan Leeming and Anna Ford — she makes a bid to become a trophy wife of various senior-aged businessmen who are on the World&#x27;s Richest list. Despite appearing in the starting title for the first episode of series one, she does not actually appear until the second episode. 
* Damien Day (Stephen Tompkinson) – Series One to Six— GlobeLink&#x27;s star field reporter, whose goal is always to make his stories as sensational as possible, even where doing so requires the use of exaggeration or misrepresentation. Damien&#x27;s unorthodox (and unethical) methods are undeniably a hit with the viewers, and therefore he is popular with Sir Roysten and Gus, making it impossible for George to fire him, despite his frequent desire to do so. Damien is quite happy to stage incidents for the camera, arguing when challenged that he is making &quot;reconstructions&quot; of what would have happened. When filming a firing-squad execution in a South American dictatorship, Damien asked the officer for a retake so he could make the execution look better. When filming in a war-torn country he punched a small boy in the face to make sure he had a crying child in shot, and threw a hand-grenade over a wall to create panic before delivering his piece to camera. Perhaps surprisingly, he is generally open-minded about other cultures, expressing interest in Tarot cards and the predictions of Nostradamus. He likes to keep himself fit, does not drink or smoke, drives a Porsche and is considered to be sociopathic. A psychologist who visits the office to carry out a study of workplace stress describes Damien&#x27;s personality as &quot;completely stress-free. Psychotic, but stress-free&quot;. Some indication as to why Damien became the driven, amoral individual he is, was provided when his mother, Professor Avril Day (Rosemary Martin), made a one-off appearance: she was a nuclear physicist who had unrealistically high expectations of her son, rarely if ever praised him and constantly pressured him to achieve. Damien gets his kicks from danger and excitement, and has virtually no interest in actual sex, except in one episode at the end of Series 4, in which he loses his virginity to a similarly danger-obsessed GlobeLink weather girl. Despite his high opinion of himself, Damien&#x27;s frequent breaches of ethical standards do not go unnoticed by other stations and he fails job interviews in the final series. After hearing the news of Globelink&#x27;s imminent closure, Damien suffers from a stress-related illness and becomes obsessed by the quest of travelling to South America to film an obscure tribe in order to &quot;prove&quot; he&#x27;s a great reporter.
* Dave Charnley (Neil Pearson) – Series One to Six – The deputy sub-editor and general dogsbody. As a compulsive womaniser and gambler, he gets on very well with Henry, owing to these shared interests, and Damien, owing to his willingness to bet on outrageously tasteless things. Dave also appears to have a very strong relationship with George and steadfastly supports him in editorial meetings and when the other characters get frustrated with him. Dave is often the one to ask George how he is despite the inevitable negative response and often goes for drinks with George. Dave and Henry have the only friendship that appears to significantly extend beyond the office, although it can occasionally turn volatile – usually over gambling matters or women. Dave runs a large number of office books and sweepstakes, although outside the office his gambling has landed him in debt to the tune of several tens of thousands of pounds. Dave has occasionally been very successful in his gambling but usually through his own actions manages to squander his good fortune. He is also addicted to one-night stands with married women, and sees any married female colleague or acquaintance as a challenge. These involvements rarely last long enough to qualify as affairs, since Dave seems to relish the chase. As a colleague put it, &quot;[Dave doesn&#x27;t] want to get involved with anyone who could conceivably want to get involved back.&quot; Although Dave clearly has the potential to be a highly competent professional, his career progress is continually hampered by these many weaknesses and addictions, and his generally irresponsible and childish behaviour. On rare occasions, however, Dave does develop real feelings for others. After seducing a drunken Helen – initially just for the challenge of winning over a lesbian – he finds that he has a genuine attraction to her, and it takes him some time to recover when she tells him that their brief fling has simply helped her to reassure her of her homosexuality. He also gets engaged – despite serious doubts – in series 5; however he is shocked when his fiancée breaks up with him, claiming she had had no idea he would get so serious. In the final series, Dave becomes even more financially desperate, and has a highly questionable new job delivering packages for an underworld figure, causing a fall-out between himself and best friend Henry.
* Joy Merryweather (Susannah Doyle) – Series Two to Six – Joy Merryweather is entirely wrongly named; she is in no way joyful or merry. She began in series 2 as a cynical and surly personal assistant; in later series, she becomes increasingly aggressive and vindictive. There are a few occasions throughout the series when she shows sensitivity, however. Her beauty and ease in getting on with everybody when she&#x27;s not being vindictive towards them makes her a key member of the team, with a weird sort of popularity, tinged with apprehension, and participates in all their schemes, sweepstakes, etc. George often remarks that she is the most-efficient production assistant GlobeLink has ever had. Joy began as a background character, intended to feed topical gags; however her popularity with audiences was such that she took an increasingly prominent role and eventually had a number of storylines of her own. Perhaps the most significant of these in terms of character development was the Series 5 episode &quot;The Graveyard Shift&quot;, in which it is revealed that her father, (already established as an alcoholic, and, according to Joy, &quot;&quot;wanted to be Peter Stringfellow&quot;) abandoned the family; her mother &quot;went from Valium addiction to nervous breakdown to attempted suicide&quot;,&quot; and all of her brothers and sisters were affected by psychological problems, (except, at least in her own mind, Joy herself); her brothers are named &quot;&quot;Jolly&quot; (who is in &quot;Wormwood Scrubs&quot;) and &quot;Happy&quot;, (who was &quot;released into the care of the doorway&quot;), and her sister&#x27;s name is &quot;Merrily&quot; (who is &quot;in a detox centre&quot;&quot;). In the last series, some of her violent and disturbing office doodles are discovered by a modern art dealer which makes for unexpected sudden success, but leaves her feeling ambivalent about the real &quot;value&quot; of her work. Joy&#x27;s childhood nickname was &quot;Flopsy&quot;, which she put an end to by force-feeding worms to the boys in question, an action she repeats when Dave and Damien decide to continue the practice.

=== Recurring characters ===
* Sir Roysten Merchant — Sir Roysten Merchant is a wealthy businessman, unofficially based on a combination of Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch – the initials RM are no coincidence – who buys out GlobeLink News in the first episode and remains the owner of the company throughout all six series. He is unseen on screen until a brief appearance in the final show, in which he is played by Roger Hammond and suggests that he does not know who Gus is. Sir Roysten is a terrifying figure, with a large business empire. He is also involved in housing, shipping, and sundry more shady enterprises which, based on the information that occasionally comes to the attention of the GlobeLink News team, border on (if not specifically involve) the illegal. On buying the company Sir Roysten installs Gus Hedges (see above) to prevent any potentially damaging information being leaked out in news stories. Sir Roysten is a right-wing figure, supporting both Margaret Thatcher and John Major. However, when Major and the Conservative government begin to weaken from 1994, his support starts to shift, and with the Labour victory in 1997 Sir Roysten defects to Tony Blair. In private, it is known that Sir Roysten visits prostitutes and that his wife, Lady Caroline, also has many affairs. He has a daughter, Octavia, who works for a brief time in the GlobeLink office, and a son, Roy Merchant Junior, who lives in fear of his father. Other offspring are not named, aside from one reference from Gus to a &quot;Roystonia&quot; — however no further information is provided. Persistent rumours circulate to the effect that Sir Royston&#x27;s father, who was also a businessman, was a Nazi sympathiser and war profiteer. Sir Roysten has several pet rottweilers and an armed personal security team who guard his mansion.
* Gerry (voiced by Andy Hamilton) – One of GlobeLink&#x27;s outside broadcast cameramen, Gerry is regularly assigned to work with Damien and frequently suffers injuries and mishaps as a result. His footage would normally end with something unpleasant happening to Gerry, while Damien yells at him to keep filming. Gerry is an unseen character, but incidents are frequently shown from the point of view of his camera as it disappears down holes, off cliffs or into rivers. His only on-screen appearance (of sorts) is at the office Christmas party, but on this occasion, he is covered head to toe in bandages. Gerry seems to have a decent sense of both morals and safety standards but is usually overruled by a determined Damien.
* Deborah Dent (Louisa Milwood-Haigh) — George&#x27;s daughter, and one of the main problems at home. A juvenile delinquent, Deborah frequently runs away from home, steals cars and other vehicles (including a fully laden car transporter and an InterCity 125), sells drugs (George&#x27;s prescription medication), sets fire to supply teachers, and attacks her school classmates with a pickaxe handle. She once attempted to sue her school for failing to provide her with an education – having previously burned the school buildings down, and on one occasion is mentioned as having found her way to a Middle East guerrilla training camp. She expresses love (as well as pity) for her father, and they bond in one episode over getting revenge on Damien by taking a hammer to his Porsche.
* Chloe Cooper (Jocelyn Barker) — Helen&#x27;s self-obsessed and attention-seeking daughter in several episodes. Helen, who worries constantly over the time she spends at work and away from her daughter, agonises over Chloe&#x27;s upbringing and doubts her own abilities as a mother. She is particularly alarmed when she discovers that Chloe has written a school essay entitled &quot;The Invisible Mummy&quot;. Chloe eventually admits, however, that she is entirely happy with arrangements at home and wrote the essay merely in an attempt to gain sympathy from a new teacher.
* Alfred and Bernice Cooper (Geoffrey Hutchings &amp; Paula Jacobs) — Helen&#x27;s supposedly conservative parents, from whom she spends years concealing her lesbianism – even going to the extent of persuading Dave to impersonate her boyfriend while they visited for an evening. In Series 6, Helen has to deal with the death of one of her parents.
* Amanda (Saira Todd) — Helen&#x27;s much-mentioned girlfriend in the later series. Her only on-screen appearance is in Series 5, where she arrives at the office while working as a despatch rider – a job she took to help pay for her university course, but which causes Helen some social embarrassment. The pair break up after a dinner at their house with Helen&#x27;s friends from the office (Series 5, episode 5) ends in disaster, but they are later back together. In the last series, Helen&#x27;s daughter mentions a time she had to make excuses for her appearing while Helen&#x27;s parents were visiting, by claiming she was a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. 
* Roy Merchant Jnr (David Troughton) — Sir Roysten&#x27;s badly stammering, bullied, and reluctantly bullying son, sent by his father to the GlobeLink office to oversee the company&#x27;s final hours. Roy, whose stammer is always at its worst when referring to Sir Roysten, reveals that he has been pitted against his siblings in a challenge: only the most ruthless will inherit the Merchant empire. Roy announces early in series 6 that GlobeLink News will close, after initially proposing to significantly cut the workforce..
* Octavia Merchant (Hermione Norris) – appeared in the Series 2 episode &quot;The Gulf Report&quot; as a trainee reporter who becomes a love interest of Dave&#x27;s. As usual with Dave it fizzles out quickly.
* Lynn Yeats (Elizabeth Downes) — A reporter for a rival news company and Damien&#x27;s nemesis. Lynn invariably arrives at disaster sites and warzones before Damien; she gets bigger and better stories; wins awards and generally manages to achieve everything Damien fails to achieve. Although Damien usually attributes her success to her greater resources and financial support, Lynn is simply more ruthless and unethical even than Damien himself. Damien also makes references to his bitterness towards real-life reporters such as Kate Adie.
* Anna (Nina Marc) — A short-term love interest of George&#x27;s, Anna is a Polish migrant seeking marriage to obtain a British passport and stay in the country. George, however, is convinced that she is the love of his life, though the rest of the staff tries to persuade him of her true intentions. In an attempt to save George, Dave makes a move on Anna with disastrous results. Rawle and Marc are married in real life.
* Sir Gordon Miller (Melvyn Hayes) — When GlobeLink News is axed in Series 6, Sally starts to plunder the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List as her final career move. Eventually, she teams up with the miserly and dispassionate Sir Gordon, the 34th richest man in the world. The physically diminutive Sir Gordon is probably the most fleshed-out of the several recurring characters in the short Series 6. He is the epitome of a controlling husband, with a pre-nuptial agreement designed to iron out absolutely every future disagreement or opinion. 
* Sue (Victoria Carling) — Sue is Henry&#x27;s niece, with whom George develops a promising relationship in the final episodes of Series 6. She is kind, compassionate, calm and gentle: the polar opposite of George&#x27;s highly emotional and manipulative ex-wife Margaret. Like George, Sue is an escapee from an unhappy marriage. Although George — due to his natural pessimism and lack of confidence — has to be prompted and encouraged every step of the way, their relationship blossoms, and they plan a new life together in Australia. 
* Wes Jasper (Neil Stuke) — Wes Jasper is a thinly disguised parody of Chris Evans, hosting what is clearly a very thinly disguised parody of &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, with an identical set, and the same &quot;ridicule-the-punter&quot; features. In an attempt to forge a post-GlobeLink career for himself in Series 6, Henry makes several appearances on this show as a sidekick for Wes. Dave Charnley is appalled and disappointed by his distinguished friend&#x27;s fall in standards.
* Jenny (Sara Stewart) — Joy&#x27;s more easy-going predecessor as PA who appears several times in the first series. Her main contribution is to join Dave, Henry and Henry&#x27;s great-nephew Jack on a night out and then apparently sleep with Jack – to the bemusement of Dave and Henry who have both failed to get anywhere with her, and Sally, who clearly fancied Jack. In a classic single-entendre, Sally snaps at Jenny, who asks &quot;What&#x27;s got into &quot;her&quot;?&quot;, to which Dave replies, &quot;I think it&#x27;s what&#x27;s got into &quot;you&quot; that&#x27;s got into her.&quot;

== Scripting ==
Unusually for a sitcom, the show was topical, and was usually written and filmed in the week before broadcast. The writers commented that this made for a very natural style of acting. In most offices people normally converse while looking at monitors, clipboards or newspaper crosswords; the cast of the show reproduced this while actually cribbing their lines. Typically, the last scene was filmed either the day before or sometimes on the day of broadcast, and episodes concluded with audio-only dialogue or (in later series) an additional scene during the credits, which would usually involve topical references. The most frantic rewrite is said to have occurred when, on the day of filming, British media mogul Robert Maxwell drowned. (As the writers said in a later episode, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to go overboard with the story.&quot;) A number of politicians including Neil Kinnock and Ken Livingstone made guest appearances.

The humour, like that in a real newsroom, was often very black, as the writers did not shy away from sensitive subjects. A typical line (from Henry): &quot;The ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland. What a bloody stupid phrase. What do they think two thousand people have died from? Stress?&quot; The view of relationships in the programme is also very bleak: all the main characters have very unstable romantic lives, with no-one being happily married.

The series ended with GlobeLink being closed down, with Series 6 being spent with the main characters trying to plan their futures elsewhere (largely unsuccessfully). The format for the final series differed slightly from the previous five. As well as being shorter (seven episodes), far less emphasis was placed on the news than before (both in terms of topical references and stories covered in the newsroom). Instead, much of the focus was on where the main characters would be once GlobeLink closed, after an announcement in the second episode of the series. Several minor characters appeared over the course of a few episodes in the final series, whereas most previously had only been in single episodes.

The ending contradicted the novel &quot;Drop The Dead Donkey 2000&quot; by Hamilton and Alistair Beaton (1994) , in which the company is almost destroyed in a bomb blast at the turn of the millennium.

== Home media ==
Five compilation videos, each featuring three selected episodes of &quot;Drop The Dead Donkey&quot;, were released during the 1990s. There was also a sixth, called &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which featured six episodes plus 50 classic moments chosen by the writers Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin.

Between 2005 and 2007 VCI (UK, now part of 2 Entertain) released all six series on DVD, via their &quot;Cinema Club&quot; label. They were also collected into two box sets, featuring three series apiece. Extra features included the unaired pilot, and introductions and interviews with Andy Hamilton, Guy Jenkin and the cast. In 2015, all six series were re-released in a &quot;Complete Series&quot; box set by Spirit Entertainment.

== Repeats ==
Repeats of the programme often appeared on Comedy Central Extra. Before the show starts, there is often a short review of the major news events which happened during the week of each episode&#x27;s filming. Episodes on DVD compilations are introduced in the same way (although not for Series 6 when topical references were very limited).

All series are now available via Channel 4&#x27;s All 4 service and the UK streaming service BritBox.

All episodes are available in the US on the online streaming service Acorn TV starting in December 2014.

As of April 2024, it is available in the US on the streaming service TUBI.

== 2024 stage version ==
In May 2023, it was announced that a stage version, written by Hamilton and Jenkin and reuniting the surviving members of the main cast, would tour the UK in 2024.

Entitled &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening!&quot;, the new production is directed by Derek Bond and produced by Hat Trick Productions and Simon Friend Entertainment. The tour began at Richmond Theatre in January 2024, and will return there for a second run in June 2024 after performances around the country. As well as Susannah Doyle, Robert Duncan, Ingrid Lacey, Neil Pearson, Jeff Rawle, Stephen Tompkinson and Victoria Wicks, the show features Julia Hills and Kerena Jagpal.

<text>A text file (sometimes spelled textfile; an old alternative name is flat file) is a kind of computer file that is structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text. A text file exists stored as data within a computer file system.

In operating systems such as CP/M, where the operating system does not keep track of the file size in bytes, the end of a text file is denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as an end-of-file (EOF) marker, as padding after the last line in a text file. In modern operating systems such as DOS, Microsoft Windows and Unix-like systems, text files do not contain any special EOF character, because file systems on those operating systems keep track of the file size in bytes.

Some operating systems, such as Multics, Unix-like systems, CP/M, DOS, the classic Mac OS, and Windows, store text files as a sequence of bytes, with an end-of-line delimiter at the end of each line. Other operating systems, such as OpenVMS and OS/360 and its successors, have record-oriented filesystems, in which text files are stored as a sequence either of fixed-length records or of variable-length records with a record-length value in the record header. 

&quot;Text file&quot; refers to a type of container, while plain text refers to a type of content.

At a generic level of description, there are two kinds of computer files: text files and binary files.

== Data storage ==

Because of their simplicity, text files are commonly used for storage of information. They avoid some of the problems encountered with other file formats, such as endianness, padding bytes, or differences in the number of bytes in a machine word. Further, when data corruption occurs in a text file, it is often easier to recover and continue processing the remaining contents. A disadvantage of text files is that they usually have a low entropy, meaning that the information occupies more storage than is strictly necessary.

A simple text file may need no additional metadata (other than knowledge of its character set) to assist the reader in interpretation. A text file may contain no data at all, which is a case of zero-byte file.

== Encoding ==

The ASCII character set is the most common compatible subset of character sets for English-language text files, and is generally assumed to be the default file format in many situations. It covers American English, but for the British pound sign, the euro sign, or characters used outside English, a richer character set must be used. In many systems, this is chosen based on the default locale setting on the computer it is read on. Prior to UTF-8, this was traditionally single-byte encodings (such as ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-16) for European languages and wide character encodings for Asian languages.

Because encodings necessarily have only a limited repertoire of characters, often very small, many are only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode is an attempt to create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it definitely is not UTF-8.

== Formats ==

On most operating systems, the name &quot;text file&quot; refers to a file format that allows only plain text content with very little formatting (e.g., no bold or &quot;italic&quot; types). Such files can be viewed and edited on text terminals or in simple text editors. Text files usually have the MIME type codice_1, usually with additional information indicating an encoding.

===Microsoft Windows text files===

DOS and Microsoft Windows use a common text file format, with each line of text separated by a two-character combination: carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). It is common for the last line of text &quot;not&quot; to be terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one on the last line.

On Microsoft Windows operating systems, a file is regarded as a text file if the suffix of the name of the file (the &quot;filename extension&quot;) is codice_2. However, many other suffixes are used for text files with specific purposes. For example, source code for computer programs is usually kept in text files that have file name suffixes indicating the programming language in which the source is written.

Most Microsoft Windows text files use ANSI, OEM, Unicode or UTF-8 encoding. What Microsoft Windows terminology calls &quot;ANSI encodings&quot; are usually single-byte ISO/IEC 8859 encodings (i.e. ANSI in the Microsoft Notepad menus is really &quot;System Code Page&quot;, non-Unicode, legacy encoding), except for in locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean that require double-byte character sets. ANSI encodings were traditionally used as default system locales within Microsoft Windows, before the transition to Unicode. By contrast, OEM encodings, also known as DOS code pages, were defined by IBM for use in the original IBM PC text mode display system. They typically include graphical and line-drawing characters common in DOS applications. &quot;Unicode&quot;-encoded Microsoft Windows text files contain text in UTF-16 Unicode Transformation Format. Such files normally begin with byte order mark (BOM), which communicates the endianness of the file content. Although UTF-8 does not suffer from endianness problems, many Microsoft Windows programs (i.e. Notepad) prepend the contents of UTF-8-encoded files with BOM, to differentiate UTF-8 encoding from other 8-bit encodings.

=== Unix text files ===

On Unix-like operating systems, text files format is precisely described: POSIX defines a text file as a file that contains characters organized into zero or more lines, where lines are sequences of zero or more non-newline characters plus a terminating newline character, normally LF.

Additionally, POSIX defines a as a text file whose characters are printable or space or backspace according to regional rules. This excludes most control characters, which are not printable.

=== Apple Macintosh text files ===

Prior to the advent of macOS, the classic Mac OS system regarded the content of a file (the data fork) to be a text file when its resource fork indicated that the type of the file was &quot;TEXT&quot;. Lines of classic Mac OS text files are terminated with CR characters.

Being a Unix-like system, macOS uses Unix format for text files. Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) used for text files in macOS is &quot;public.plain-text&quot;; additional, more specific UTIs are: &quot;public.utf8-plain-text&quot; for utf-8-encoded text, &quot;public.utf16-external-plain-text&quot; and &quot;public.utf16-plain-text&quot; for utf-16-encoded text and &quot;com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text&quot; for classic Mac OS text files.

== Rendering ==

When opened by a text editor, human-readable content is presented to the user. This often consists of the file&#x27;s plain text visible to the user. Depending on the application, control codes may be rendered either as literal instructions acted upon by the editor, or as visible escape characters that can be edited as plain text. Though there may be plain text in a text file, control characters within the file (especially the end-of-file character) can render the plain text unseen by a particular method.

<text>The Argentine National Anthem () was adopted as the sole official song of Argentina on 11 May 1813—three years after the May Revolution. Its lyrics were written by the Buenos Aires-born politician Vicente López y Planes and the music was composed by the Spanish musician Blas Parera.

Some first, quite different, anthems were composed from 1810; a version was then introduced in 1813, which was used throughout the 19th century. What is now officially codified as the state&#x27;s national anthem is shorter than the original composition and comprises only the first and last verses and the chorus of the 1813 &quot;Patriotic March&quot;, omitting much emotional text about the struggle for independence from Spain (&quot;with strong arms they tear to pieces the arrogant Iberian lion&quot;).

11 May is celebrated in Argentina as the Argentine National Anthem Day ().

==Etymology==
The third Argentine national anthem was originally named &quot; (), later renamed &quot; (), and then &quot;&quot; (). It has been called &quot;Himno Nacional Argentino&quot; since it was published with that name in 1847.

==History==
The first Argentine national anthem was the &quot;Patriotic March&quot;, published on 15 November 1810 in the &quot;&quot;. It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original composition made no reference to the name of Argentina (the country was not formally named &quot;República Argentina&quot; until 1826, although it was referred to as such) or an independentist will, and talked instead about Spain being conquered by France in the Peninsular War, the absolutist restoration begun by the Council of Regency, and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved so far in the Americas: &quot;Spain was victim / of the plotting Gaul / because to the tyrants / she bent her neck / If there treachery / has doomed a thousands cities / let sacred freedom and union reign here / Let the father to the sons / be able to say / enjoy rights / that I did not enjoy&quot;.

In mid-1812, the ruling triumvirate ordered the Buenos Aires Cabildo to commission a national anthem. Cayetano Rodríguez, a Franciscan friar, wrote a text that was approved on 4 August. The Catalan musician Blas Parera, music director of the local theater, set it to music and performed it for the first time with the orchestra he conducted on 1 November.

Less than a year later the Assembly of Year XIII estimated that the song was not effective enough to serve as a national anthem. On 6 March 1813 several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente López y Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as the &quot;sole national march&quot; (&quot;&quot;) on 11 May 1813. Parera was asked to compose a new musical setting around the same date. He must have finished the piece in a few days. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on 14 May 1813, at the home of the aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, but there is no documentary evidence of that. If this is true, then Parera, contrary to certain misconceptions, wrote quickly and under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813. He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on 28 May, and was paid 200 pesos.

The composition was then known as &#x27; (National Patriotic Song), and later simply as &#x27; (Patriotic Song), but in Juan Pedro Esnaola&#x27;s early arrangement, dated around 1848, it appeared under the title &quot;&quot;, and the name has been retained until today. In the complete version of the Anthem of May (as was christened by López) it is noted that the political vision portrayed is not only Argentine, but Latin American. The lyrics are ardently pro-independence and anti-Spanish, as the country was at that time fighting for its independence from Spain.

The song became popular immediately. Within ten years documented performances took place throughout Argentina, and also in Chile, Peru, and Colombia until they had their own national anthems. Different versions emerged, making mass singing difficult; several reforms were then proposed. In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the task to heart, making many changes to the music, including a slower tempo, a fuller texture, alterations to the melody, and enrichment of the harmony. In 1927 a committee produced a historicist version that undid several of Esnaola&#x27;s changes, but introduced new problems in the sung line. After a heated public debate fueled by the newspaper &quot;&quot;, this version was rejected and, following the recommendations of a second committee, Esnaola&#x27;s arrangement was officially reinstated. In 1944 it was confirmed as the official state anthem.

Throughout the 19th century the anthem was sung in its entirety. However, once harsh feelings against Spain had dissipated, and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants, a modification was introduced by a decree of President Julio Argentino Roca on 30 March 1900:

==Controversy==
The song includes a line that has given rise to controversy: . In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word is used; a slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting obvious errors such as spelling mistakes was issued with the same date of 14 May 1813, but with changed to . The meaning reverses: &quot;Buenos Aires &quot;opposes&quot; the front of the people of the union&quot; to &quot;Buenos Aires &quot;positions itself at&quot; the front ...&quot;. The original has been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires, but has also been considered a &quot;tragical misprint&quot;. In many other lines the anthem goes beyond the Argentine theater of the Spanish American wars of independence and references events in Mexico, Central America, Northern South America, and Upper Peru. The growing ideas of independence are reflected in lines such as &quot;On the surface of the earth rises a glorious new nation, her head is crowned with laurels, and a Lion lies defeated at her feet&quot;. This portrays not just Spanish absolutism, but Spain itself, as the enemy.

The words strongly attacking Spain were no longer sung.

==Usage==
Performance of the national anthem is mandatory during all official events, and Argentines in attendance are expected to stand up and sing it. Radio broadcasters voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight, while TV channels do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On national holidays, it is mandatory to perform the national anthem at midnight.

The national anthem is ruled in Argentine law by Decree 10302/1944.

The rock musician Charly García broke legal regulations dealing with the reproduction of the song when he included an idiosyncratic cover version in his 1990 album , stirring much controversy. In 1998 various Argentine artists reedited the anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album . Other singers followed on their footsteps recreating the piece in their own ways.

A line from the original version of the national anthem was used as the Argentine title of the 1928 film known in English as &quot;The Charge of the Gauchos&quot;.

The national anthem appears at the beginning of the 1985 film &quot;The Official Story&quot;, an Academy Award winner.

===Short instrumental versions===
Due to the excessive length of the official full-length version, which has a duration of around three to four minutes, during international sporting events such as professional soccer games, the Rugby World Cup, and the Olympics, only the instrumental introduction (which has a duration of around 1 minute) is played. Another variation is to play the instrumental introductory section followed by the last three lines (with the third line repeated). Since 2019, in professional soccer games, the final part of the anthem is played, which consists of the instrumental part before the chorus, the chorus, and the coda. The Olympic Games currently uses an abridged version of the anthem which consists of the entire modern version&#x27;s lyrics, with the pre-chorus instrumental omitted. Although traditional, these arrangements are not recognized by Argentine law.

===Modern version===
The following is the modern version, adopted in 1924, omitting the long anti-Spanish middle section.

<doc id="208360" wikidata="Q584125" url="?curid=208360" title="Ban Chiang">
<text>Ban Chiang (, ; , ) is an archaeological site in Nong Han district, Udon Thani province, Thailand. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992. Discovered in 1966, the site first attracted interest due to its ancient red-painted pottery. More recently, it gained international attention in 2008 when the United States Department of Justice, following an undercover investigation begun in 2003, raided several museums for their role in trafficking in Ban Chiang antiquities.

== Discovery ==
Villagers had uncovered some of the pottery in prior years without insight into their age or historical importance. In August 1966, Steve Young, a political science student at Harvard College, was living in the village conducting interviews for his senior honors thesis. Young, a speaker of Thai, was familiar with the work of Wilhelm Solheim and his theory of the possible ancient origins of civilization in Southeast Asia. One day while walking down a path in Ban Chiang with his assistant, an art teacher at the village school, Young tripped over the root of a red kapok tree (&quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;) and fell on his face in the dirt path. Under him were the exposed tops of small and medium-sized pottery jars. Young recognized that the unglazed earthenware pots had been low-fired and were quite old, but that the designs applied to the surface of the vessels were unique. He took samples of pots to Princess Phanthip Chumbote at the private museum of Suan Pakkad Palace in Bangkok and to Chin Yu Di of the Thai Government&#x27;s Fine Arts Department. Later, Elisabeth Lyons, an art historian on the staff of the Ford Foundation, sent potsherds from Ban Chiang to the University of Pennsylvania for dating. Unfortunately, the early publicity, the beauty of the pots, and the belief that the pots were several thousands of years old led to avid collecting and consequent avid looting by the villagers.

== Archaeology ==

The Fine Arts Department of Thailand conducted several small excavations during the 1960s and early 1970s. These excavations revealed skeletons, bronze artifacts and a wealth of pots. Rice fragments were also found, leading to the belief that the Bronze Age settlers were probably farmers. The site&#x27;s oldest graves do not include bronze artifacts and are therefore from a Neolithic culture; the most recent graves date to the Iron Age.

=== The 1974-1975 excavations ===
The first intensive excavation of Ban Chiang was a joint effort by the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Thai Department of Fine Arts, with co-directors Chester Gorman and Pisit Charoenwongsa. The aim was not only to investigate the site but to train Thai and western archaeologists in the latest techniques. Because of the looting, they had difficulty finding undisturbed areas to excavate, but settled on two areas 100 meters apart. The locales proved to be far richer in finds than expected, and the distinctive red-on-buff pottery that had excited so much interest proved to be quite late (300 B.C.– AD 200), with many levels of equally noteworthy pottery and other cultural remains beneath them. More exciting, the excavations uncovered crucibles and other evidence of metal working, showing that the villagers of Ban Chiang from an early stage manufactured their own metal artifacts rather than simply importing them from elsewhere. Recovered bronze objects include bracelets, rings, anklets, wires and rods, spearheads, axes and adzes, hooks, blades, and little bells. After the two seasons of excavation, six tons of pottery, stone, and metal artifacts were shipped to the University of Pennsylvania Museum for analysis. The early death of Chet Gorman in 1981, at the age of 43, slowed the process of analysis and publication.

This site has often been called a &quot;cemetery site&quot;, but research has suggested that the deceased were buried next to or beneath dwellings. This practice is called residential burial.

=== Lifestyle as revealed by human remains ===
At least 142 discrete burials were found in the 1974-1975 excavations. Analysis of the human remains by Michael Pietrusewsky and Michele Toomay Douglas revealed that the people lived a vigorous and active lifestyle with little evidence of interpersonal violence or any form of warfare. The subsistence was based on mixed agricultural/hunting/gathering economy, co-occurring with metallurgy. The conclusion that the centuries-long occupation of the site was largely peaceful is bolstered by the lack of metal weapons.

== Dating the artifacts ==
The excavation at Ban Chiang in 1974–1975 was followed by an article by Chester Gorman and Pisit Charoenwongsa, claiming evidence for the earliest dates in the world for bronze casting and iron working. Subsequent excavations, including that at Ban Non Wat, have now shown that the proposed early dates for Ban Chiang are unlikely. The first datings of the artifacts used the thermoluminescence technique, resulting in a range from 4420–3400 BCE, which would have made the site the earliest Bronze Age culture in the world. These dates stirred world-wide interest. Thermoluminescence dating of pottery was at the time an experimental technique and had been applied to Ban Chiang sherds of uncertain provenance. However, with the 1974–1975 excavation, sufficient material became available for radiocarbon dating. Reanalysis by radiocarbon dating suggested that a more likely date for the earliest metallurgy at Ban Chiang was c. 2000–1700 BCE. A date of 2100 BCE was obtained from rice phytoliths taken from inside a grave vessel of the lowest grave, which had no metal remains. The youngest grave was about 200 CE. Bronze making began circa 2000 BCE, as evidenced by crucibles and bronze fragments. A contrasting analysis was conducted by Charles Higham of the University of Otago using the bones from the people who lived at Ban Chiang and the bones of animals interred with them. The resulting determinations were analyzed using Bayesian statistics and the results suggested that the initial settlement of Ban Chiang took place about 1500 BCE, with the transition to the Bronze Age about 1000 BCE. The chronology of Ban Chiang metallurgy is still in considerable dispute.

== Metallurgy ==
Ban Chiang, along with other surrounding villages in northeast Thailand, contains many bronze artifacts that demonstrate that metallurgy had been practiced in small, village settings nearly four thousand years ago. This is of interest to archaeologists, as ancient Southeast Asian metallurgy flourished without the presence of a militaristic or urbanized state, unlike many other ancient societies that had mastered metallurgy.

Dr Joyce White and Elizabeth Hamilton co-authored a four-volume Ban Chiang metals monograph, the most extensive of its kind in Ban Chiang scholarship. The work presents metals and related evidence from the site as well as three other sites in northeast Thailand: Ban Tong, Ban Phak Top, and Don Klang. It is the second installment in the Thai Archaeology Monograph Series, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press and distributed for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

In the monograph, White and Hamilton catalogue and classify metal artifacts as well as contribute to the Ban Chiang chronology discourse. They analyzed the metals comprehensively through innovative technological perspectives in order to understand ancient metals in their social contexts. To do this, they make systematic assessments by typological range, variation in metal composition and manufacturing techniques, evidence for on-site production activities, and contextual evidence for deposition of metal finds. White and Hamilton also write that regional variation in metalworker know-how and choices can reveal past networks of communities of metallurgical practice that could have important ramifications for economic and social networks of the time as well as how those changed over time. One of their major findings is that most copper alloy products were cast in local villages and not at large centralized workshops.

White, a leading scholar on Ban Chiang, directs an organization, the Institute of Southeast Asian Archaeology (ISEAA), that manages the Ban Chiang Project at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. The project runs an open access metals database that presents the data on metal and metal-related artifacts found at Ban Chiang and surrounding sites. The metal artifacts are classified into nine groups: bangles, adzes/tillers, blades, points, bells, wires/rods, flat, amorphous, and miscellaneous. The three metal-related groups are crucibles, molds, and slag. The metals database also records the time period in which the artifacts were created and the technical analyses performed on each artifact.


== UNESCO World Heritage status ==
The site itself was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992 under criteria iii, which describes a site that &quot;bear[s] a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or has disappeared.&quot;

=== The Ban Chiang National Museum ===

The site has been increasingly attractive to Thai and international tourists, an interest fostered by a site museum that has continually upgraded its buildings and exhibitions about the site, its discovery, and archaeological interpretation, as well as the history of interest in the site by the Thai royal family. The museum includes an accurate open pit recreation of the excavation at a temple some 700 meters away called Wat Pho Si Mai, with the Ban Chiang Culture artifacts and simulated skeletons displayed as they appeared during excavation. Included in the museum&#x27;s collection is the traveling exhibit curated by Dr White, titled &quot;Ban Chiang, Discovery of a Lost Bronze Age&quot;, which toured internationally following the 1974-75 Penn Museum excavations and became part of the Ban Chiang Museum permanent exhibit in 1987. The museum includes &quot;displays and information that highlight the three main periods and six sub-periods&quot; as well as the site&#x27;s general and excavation history. Artifacts from the museum are also displayed in a Virtual Museum website. The site and museum have been reviewed by several travel publications, including CNN, TripAdvisor, and the official tourism site of Thailand.
This tourist traffic in turn has had a profound impact on the village economy, with several small shops and restaurants developing near the museum.

== US legal case ==
The site made headlines in January 2008, when thousands of artifacts from the Ban Chiang and other prehistoric sites in Thailand were found to be in the collections of at least five California museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Mingei International Museum, the Pacific Asian Museum, the Charles W. Bowers Museum, and the UC Berkeley Art Museum. The complex plot functioned as a crime ring and involved smuggling the items out of Thailand into the US, and then donating them to museums in order to claim tax write-offs. There were said to be more items in US museums than at the site itself.

The case was brought to light during 13 high-profile raids conducted by federal law enforcement officers on various California and Chicago museums, shops, warehouses, and homes of private art collectors; it was the culmination of a five-year federal undercover investigation called Operation Antiquity. A National Park Service special agent had posed as a private collector and documented the case. The agent bought looted antiquities from two art dealers and donated them to various California art museums like the ones listed above. He found that museum officials had &quot;varying degrees of knowledge about the antiquities&#x27; provenance&quot; and agreed to the donations. In total, the federal government seized more than 10,000 looted artifacts, many of which were from Ban Chiang.

The alleged smuggler of the trafficking plot imported all the Southeast Asian antiquities illegally. He entered the business during a 1970s trip to Thailand, buying antiquities from Thai middlemen and flipping the items to California museums for a small profit. His frequent clients included Beverly Hills home decor shops and private art galleries like the Silk Road Gallery. Based on the smuggler&#x27;s interactions with the undercover agent, federal agents obtained warrants to search the 13 properties that held the looted artifacts. The smuggler was arraigned in court in 2013 and pleaded not guilty and his trial was scheduled for November 2016, but was continued numerous times until he died in May 2017. Other alleged major players in the trafficking ring died of various causes before ever going to trial.

However, the case still yielded fruitful results, including convictions. Jonathan and Cari Markell, owners of the Silk Road Gallery, pleaded guilty to antiquities trafficking charges in 2015. Jonathan Markell was sentenced to 18 months in prison for trafficking looted archaeological artifacts and falsifying documents, as well as a year of supervised probation. The couple was also sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation for tax evasion. Additionally, they were fined approximately US$2,000 restitution and must pay to ship more than 300 artifacts seized from their home and shuttered gallery back to Southeast Asia at an estimated cost of US$25,000.

Some of the museums discovered to possess trafficked and looted artifacts have returned them to Thailand. The Mingei International Museum has repatriated 68 artifacts, while the Bowers Museum has returned 542 vases, bowls, and other objects. By doing so, the museums avoided prosecution. The Markells themselves are expected to give back 337 antiquities as part of their sentencing agreement. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Pacific Asia Museum, and the UC Berkeley Art Museum are also expected to repatriate stolen goods. This case is nationally significant for two major reasons: it was a US government-led crackdown, as opposed to being a result of complaints by foreign governments, and it also set a higher standard of accountability for museum officials who deal with cultural property, in accordance with the National Stolen Property Act and Archaeological Resources Protection Act.

== Notes ==
After Dr. Gorman&#x27;s death in 1981, Dr. Joyce White continued research and publications as Director of the Ban Chiang Project at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Dr. White&#x27;s research endeavors have included analysis and publication of Penn&#x27;s excavations at Ban Chiang in Thailand in the mid-1970s; ecological field research at Ban Chiang in 1978–1981 including investigations of how local people identified and used plants; lake coring and ecological mapping for palaeoenvironmental research in several parts of Thailand during the 1990s; and, since 2001, survey and excavation in northern Laos, especially in Luang Prabang Province. For Ban Chiang, White, along with Elizabeth Hamilton, has published a monograph through the University of Pennsylvania Press on the ancient metallurgy of Ban Chiang and nearby sites. The last of the four volumes was published in 2021.

<doc id="208361" wikidata="Q994925" url="?curid=208361" title="Corby">
<text>Corby is a town and civil parish in the North Northamptonshire district, in Northamptonshire, England, northeast of Northampton. In 2021 it had a population of 68,164. From 1974 to 2021, it was the administrative headquarters of the Borough of Corby, which at the 2021 Census had a population of 75,571.

Corby was once known as &quot;Little Scotland&quot; due to the large number of Scottish workers who came to work in its steelworks. Corby has undergone regeneration with the opening of Corby railway station and Corby International Pool in 2009 and the Corby Cube in 2010. The Cube houses a 450-seat theatre, public library and other community amenities.
==History==

===Early history===
Mesolithic and Neolithic artefacts have been found in the area surrounding Corby and human remains dating to the Bronze Age were found in 1970 at Cowthick. The first evidence of permanent settlement comes from the 8th century when Danish invaders arrived and the settlement became known as &quot;Kori&#x27;s by&quot; – Kori&#x27;s settlement. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Corbei&quot;. Corby&#x27;s emblem, the raven, derives from an alternative meaning of this word. These Danish roots were recognised in the naming of the most southern of the town&#x27;s housing estates, Danesholme, around which one of the Danish settlements was located.

Corby was granted the right to hold two annual fairs and a market by Henry III in 1226. In 1568 Corby was granted a charter by Elizabeth I that exempted local landowners from tolls (the fee paid by travellers to use the long-distance public roads), dues (an early form of income tax) and gave all men the right to refuse to serve in the local militia. A popular legend is that the Queen was hunting in Rockingham Forest when she (dependent on the legend) either fell from her horse or became trapped in a bog whilst riding. Upon being rescued by villagers from Corby she granted the charter in gratitude for her rescue. Another popular explanation is that it was granted as a favour to her alleged lover Sir Christopher Hatton.

====Corby Pole Fair====
The Corby Pole Fair is an event that has taken place every 20 years since 1862 in celebration of the charter. The 1942 fair was not held due to the Second World War; it took place five years later. According to a newspaper report dated 14 June 1862 which focuses on the extravagances of the fair, the fugitive slave John Anderson was described as being educated in the Corby British School, giving the town an unusual link to slavery in the United States.

The most recent pole fair was held on Friday, 3 June 2022, to coincide with The Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

===From rural village to industrial town===
The local area has been worked for iron ore since Roman times. An ironstone industry developed in the 19th century with the coming of the railways and the discovery of extensive ironstone beds. By 1910 an ironstone works had been established. In 1931 Corby was a small village with a population of around 1,500. It grew rapidly into a reasonably sized industrial town, when the owners of the ironstone works, the steel firm Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, decided to build a large integrated ironstone and steel works on the site. The start of construction in 1934 drew workers from all over the country including many workers from the depressed west of Scotland and Irish labourers. The first steel was produced in October 1935 and for decades afterwards the steel works dominated the town. By 1939 the population had grown to around 12,000, at which time Corby was thought to be the largest &quot;village&quot; in the country, but it was at that point that Corby was re-designated an urban district (see the Local Government section below).

===1940s and 1950s===

During the Second World War the Corby steelworks were expected to be a target for German bombers but in the event there were only a few bombs dropped by solitary planes and there were no casualties. This may be because the whole area was blanketed in huge dense black, low-lying clouds created artificially by the intentional burning of oil and latex to hide the glowing Bessemer converter furnaces at the steelworks from German bomber crews. The only known remaining scars from German attacks can be found in the form of bullet holes visible on the front fascia of the old post office in Corby village (now known as Decades bar and restaurant). The Corby steelworks made a notable contribution to the war effort by manufacturing the steel tubes used in Operation Pluto (Pipe Line Under the Ocean) to supply fuel to Allied forces on the European continent.

In 1950, with a population of 18,000, Corby was designated a New Town with William Holford as its architect. By 1951, he prepared the development plan with a car oriented layout and many areas of open space and woodland. In 1952, Holford produced the town centre plan and in 1954 the layout for the first 500 houses. The town now underwent its second wave of expansion, mainly from Scotland. Corby is famous for its Scottish heritage based on decades of incoming steel workers and was for a time known locally as &quot;Little Scotland&quot;.

===Decline of the steel industry===

In 1967 the British steel industry was nationalised and the Stewarts &amp; Lloyds steel tube works at Corby became part of British Steel Corporation. The Government approved a ten-year development strategy with expenditure of £3,000 million from 1973 onwards, the objective of which was to convert BSC from a large number of small scale works, using largely obsolete equipment, to a far more compact organisation with highly competitive plant.
Steelmaking was to be concentrated in five main areas: South Wales, Sheffield, Scunthorpe, Teesside and Scotland, most of which are coastal sites with access to economic supplies of iron rich imported ores.

It was not until 1975 that a closure programme was agreed after a 14-month review by Lord Beswick, the then Minister of State for Industry. Corby was not one of the Beswick Plants that were to close in the review. By this time BSC was plunging into loss and important parts of the investment programme was held back. The European Union, Davignon Plan, had also asked for Steel Capacity in Europe to be significantly reduced.

In May 1979, the new Conservative government minister, Sir Keith Joseph announced the closure of Corby Steelworks. By the end of 1981 more than 5,000 jobs had been lost from British Steel in Corby, and further cuts took the total loss to 11,000, leading to an unemployment rate of over 30%. Steel tube making continued, however, initially being supplied with steel by rail from Teesside and later from South Wales.

The title track of &quot;Steeltown&quot; by Big Country is about the loss of jobs in Corby.

===Redevelopment===
Corby was designated as a new town in 1950. Most of the housing in the town has been built since this date. The first new street completed was Bessemer Grove, about the same time that the re-built blast furnace was lit. New industry was subsequently attracted to the town when the Thatcher government designated it as an Enterprise Zone. By 1991 unemployment had returned to the national average. The recovery of Corby was explained in 1990 by John Redwood, then a junior minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, as being a result of the establishment of the Enterprise Zone, the promotion of Corby by the Thatcher government, the work of private investors and the skills of the work force. Others believe the town&#x27;s recovery was significantly assisted by its central location and substantial grants from the EU. The enterprise zone was promoted by the Corby Industrial Development Centre through a prospectus that parodied &quot;The Economist&quot;, titled &quot;The Ecorbyist&quot;; publication continued at least as late as 1994.

To the north of Corby, on the industrial estates, is a 350MW power station built in 1994; and the Rockingham Motor Speedway built in 2001.

==Politics==
From 1894 until 1939 Corby was a parish in Kettering Rural District, in 1939 Corby became an urban district, on 1 April 1974 the urban district and parish were abolished and Corby became an unparished area in Corby non-metropolitan district.

The town of Corby is entirely within the Corby and East Northamptonshire Westminster constituency. This contains parts of traditionally Conservative East Northamptonshire that balance the traditionally Labour town of Corby, leading to a marginal constituency that has gone to the party forming the UK Government at every general election since the creation of the constituency in 1983. 

From 1983 to 1997 the seat was narrowly held for the Conservatives by William Powell. Phil Hope then won the seat for Labour and held it until 2010 when he lost to the writer Louise Bagshawe, the Conservative Party candidate, who became Louise Mensch after her marriage the following year.

In 2012, Mensch resigned as an MP and the resulting by-election was won by Labour&#x27;s Andy Sawford with a majority of 7,791 votes over the Conservatives. UKIP finished in third place whilst the Liberal Democrats finished in fourth place, losing their deposit. The by-election was of national and international media interest due to the constituency being a marginal seat. During the wait for the results announcement, &quot;Corby&quot; briefly trended worldwide on Twitter.

Tom Pursglove regained the seat for the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, outpolling Sawford by a majority of 2,412. Pursglove retained the seat in 2017 with a majority of 2,690 and then by 10,268 in 2019, ahead of Labour candidate Beth Miller on both occasions. Following slight boundary changes, and with the seat now officially referred to as Corby and East Northamptonshire, the 2024 general election saw Pursglove lose the seat to Labour&#x27;s Lee Barron whose majority was 6,331. 

In the 2016 referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union, Corby voted 64% in favour of leaving whilst only 36% voted to remain in the EU. The turnout was 74.1% with the leave vote winning with a majority of 9,141 votes. The constituency&#x27;s MP at the time, Tom Pursglove, had also been in favour of the UK leaving the European Union being one of the founders of Grassroots Out, the pro-Brexit organisation largely supported by Conservative and UKIP politicians. 
Between 1979 and its abolition in 2021, Corby Borough Council was controlled by the Labour Party. 

On 8 December 2014, Northamptonshire Police began an investigation into financial dealings by Corby Borough Council. In July 2013, Conservative councillors Rob McKellar and David Sims handed the &quot;suspicious&quot; findings of an audit report to the police to see if a crime had been committed. The audit report examined four major projects, including the Corby Cube, the cost of which went from £35m to £47m. It was reported in 2016 that the investigation had concluded and no prosecutions would be brought. 

In March 2018, following Northamptonshire County Council becoming insolvent, due to financial and cultural mismanagement by the cabinet and officers, the then Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid, sent commissioner Max Caller into the council, who recommended the county council and all district and borough councils in the county be abolished, and replaced by two unitary authorities, one covering the West, and one the North of the county. These proposals were approved in April 2019. It meant that the districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire were merged to form a new unitary authority called West Northamptonshire, whilst the second unitary authority North Northamptonshire consists of the former Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough districts. These new authorities came into being on 1 April 2021. Elections for the new authorities were due to be held on 7 May 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and were instead held on 6 May 2021. On 1 April 2021 a civil parish called Corby Town was formed. On 1 January 2024 the parish was renamed to &quot;Corby&quot;.

In the local elections of 6 May 2021, for North Northamptonshire Council Corby returned 12 Labour Councillors and 3 Conservative Councillors across 5 wards, with the Conservatives only being elected in the Corby Rural Ward. The newly created Corby Town Council returned 17 Labour Councillors across 4 Wards. In 2022, Corby Town Councillor Tafadzwa Chikoto became the first black mayor of Corby, and in 2023 Leanne Buckingham became the town&#x27;s first openly lesbian mayor.

==City status bid==

In 2012, Corby bid to gain city status as part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. However, it lost out to Perth, Chelmsford and St Asaph.

==Society and culture==
It is recorded in 1851 that the accent spoken in the northern parts of Northamptonshire would be more recognisable as a &quot;West Country dialect&quot;. Scottish migration to Corby has created a unique population in the borough. The link with Scotland is a strong feature of the area: according to the 2001 Census, there were 10,063 Scottish-born in the Corby Urban Area – 18.9% of the population. A further 1.3 per cent were born in Northern Ireland. It has been estimated that a further third of the population are Scottish or of Scottish descent.

The Scottish heritage is cherished by many inhabitants. There are Scottish social and sporting clubs and there are many fervent supporters of the Rangers and Celtic football clubs (indeed, Corby was home to the largest Rangers Supporters&#x27; Club outside Glasgow and Northern Ireland until its closure in February 2013) as well as the Scottish National Team. Many shops sell Scottish foods and a supermarket even introduced Gaelic signs to their Corby store (but they have since removed them). An annual Highland Gathering featuring traditional Scottish sports, music and dancing is held in the town. Corby has one Church of Scotland congregation 
Local legend states that Corby sees the highest sales of the Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru of anywhere outside Scotland. Asda Corby is stated to sell 17 times more Irn-Bru than any other store in England. Its popularity is cemented by the fact that it is available for purchase in all bars, nightclubs and pubs in the area. In 2014, Corby held a mock referendum in the run up to the Scottish independence referendum. 576 votes were cast, with 162 voting for Scottish independence and 414 voting against.

According to the 2001 Census 1.7% of the population are non-white and the average age of the population (37.2) is slightly lower than the average for England and Wales (38.6).

November 2010 saw the opening of the Corby Cube, a major development in the town centre. As well as new council chamber, registrar office, and public library, the Cube is home to a 450-seat theatre and 100 capacity studio theatre. A programme of live theatre, dance, music and standup comedy is complemented by a participation programme encouraging all parts of Corby community to get involved. Recently the theatre started screening films, twice a week and including current mainstream releases and the best in world, independent and art house cinema. A report in 2012 revealed that the Cube was built with dangerous design flaws and almost double its original estimated costs and a capacity of only half of what was planned.
A crater on Mars discovered in the late 1970s was named after Corby, in reference to a famous transcript of a conversation in June 1969 between the crew of the Apollo 11 mission and mission control, whereby world news was relayed to the crew, amongst it was the news that &quot;in Corby, an Irishman named John Coyle won the World&#x27;s Porridge Eating Championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in 10 minutes&quot;. The reply from Apollo 11: &quot;I&#x27;d like to enter Aldrin in the porridge eating contest next time; he&#x27;s on the 19th bowl. Roger.&quot;

===Media===
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter, BBC East Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The town is located along the A43, A427, A6003 and is from the A14 at Kettering. Corby lies within two hours&#x27; drive of four international airports: Birmingham, Luton, Stansted and East Midlands. Being a new town, Corby&#x27;s road network is different from that of older towns. There are several dual carriageways, most of the principal roads have wide reservations and high speed limits and pedestrian crossings over them are often underpasses. However, Corby is only connected by dual carriageway to one neighbouring town, Kettering (the A6003). All other roads into the town are single carriageways. The three dual carriageways form an outer ring road around most of Corby, however it only encircles suburbs south of the town centre and a small amount of countryside.

===Buses===

Corby is served by six bus routes under the Corby Star brand name. Route X4 connects the town with Peterborough, Oundle, Weldon, Danesholme, Kettering, Isham, Wellingborough, Earls Barton, Northampton, It is also operated by Stagecoach Midlands. National Express coaches also provide long-distance connections to the north and Scotland. Plans to build a new bus station in Corby are being considered by the council following the closure of the old bus station in August 2002.

===Rail===
Following a number of years when the town had no railway station, a new facility opened on 23 February 2009. East Midlands Railway runs half-hourly services to London St Pancras via and . The route to London was converted to electric traction in May 2021. There is also a limited peak time service running north to , , and .

==Employment and education==

===Employment===

Since the 1980s the unemployment rate has returned to a level closer to the national average (2.7% in October 2005). Employment is biased towards manufacturing (36.8% compared with a regional average of 18.5%) and against public administration, health and education (10.0% compared with the regional average of 25.9%). Much of industry is concentrated in purpose-built industrial estates on the outskirts of the town. Fairline Boats were manufactured here. Weetabix Limited make Weetos in the north of the town. RS Components are based near Rockingham Speedway. Taste Original (formerly Puredrive), part of Zwanenberg Food Group UK has operated from Corby since 1988 making cooked meat snacking products. Amy&#x27;s Kitchen has recently opened a factory here, and manufactured products for the UK market here.

2018 research by Sky News identified Corby as the town most threatened by job losses in the UK due to automation with 31% of employment subject to cliff-edge automation.

===Demography===
According to the 2001 Census the proportion of the working age population with degree-level qualifications (8.5%) is the lowest of all areas in England and Wales. 39.3% have no GCSE-equivalent qualifications at all. The borough of Corby has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the East Midlands, outside of the metropolitan boroughs (unitary authorities), although Lincoln is very similar.

According to the 2011 census, Corby had a population of 61,255 and was 85.0% White British, 9.1% Other White (not including White Irish and Irish Traveller), 1.4% mixed race, 1.4% Asian and 1.7% Black. Corby&#x27;s least White British ward is Oakley Vale where 70.7% of the population are White British while Corby&#x27;s least ethnically diverse ward is Rural West, where 95.6% of the population are White British. In 2011, 5567 people registered their ethnicity as &#x27;Other White&#x27; or 9.1% of the population. This figure includes a large community of people from Poland and the Baltic States.

===Schools===

The Corby campus of Tresham Institute of Further and Higher Education provides a range of vocational courses for post-16 students and adult learners. The nearest universities are the University of Northampton, to the south and both the University of Leicester and De Montfort University in Leicester, to the west.

Brooke Weston Academy, was one of only fifteen CTCs in England, opened in 1990. Brooke Weston CTC consistently achieved examination results in the top 5% of English state schools, and has been a City Academy since September 2008.
Since 1990 several of Corby&#x27;s other secondary schools have fared less well with a series of poor examination results and critical inspection reports leading to mergers and closures, the most recent being the closure of Our Lady and Pope John School in 2005. Currently there are five secondary schools in Corby: Brooke Weston Academy, Lodge Park Academy, Corby Business Academy, Kingswood Secondary Academy and the newly opened Corby Technical School which opened to students in an old unused primary school in September 2012 with the new building completed and opened in November 2013. Corby Business Academy has a special unit for children with severe special educational needs. All four schools have sixth forms for post-16 students.

Corby has 17 primary schools, of which two are Church of England schools, three are Roman Catholic and one for children with severe behavioural and emotional difficulties.

==Regeneration and redevelopment==
Corby has an Urban Regeneration Company – North Northants Development Company, which now covers the whole of North Northamptonshire rather than just Corby (it was previously known as Catalyst Corby). The company is working closely with Corby Borough Council, Land Securities (town centre owners), the East Midlands Development Agency and the Homes and Communities Agency to regenerate the town centre as part of the masterplan for the whole town. The population of Corby town is expected to double in the next 30 years through housing on large estates such as Prior&#x27;s Hall, Little Stanion, Oakley Vale and Great Oakley.

In October 2007 Corby&#x27;s new shopping precinct, Willow Place, opened. In addition Parkland Gateway, the Borough&#x27;s £50m investment situated adjacent to Willow Place and including a new Olympic-sized swimming pool and civic hub (due for completion in November 2010), is being built following its approval in January 2007. Work began on the project in October 2007 and the Corby East Midlands International Pool was officially opened by Olympian Mark Foster in July 2009. Although the Evolution Corby project is currently on hold, limited aesthetic augmentation work within the town centre continues.

&quot;The Saxon Crown&quot;, a Wetherspoon pub and hotel in Corby town centre is a refurbished 1960s Cooperative store. Its name refers to the history of the area: the village of Corby derives its name from Kori, a leader of Danish invaders who settled in a clearing in Rockingham Forest.

The local Conservative Party have argued that further regeneration in Corby should be delivered through bringing visitors to the town to visit its numerous historic sites. They argue that a co-ordinated tourism programme will increase and diversify the population available for the leisure industry to market to, and thus result in more local leisure facilities being opened.

===North Londonshire===
Stephen Fry voiced an advertising campaign in London from 2010 to entice people to move to Corby and the surrounding area including Rushden, Kettering and Wellingborough. The North Northamptonshire Development Corporation&#x27;s campaign uses newspaper and London Underground advertisements, and also local radio with North Northamptonshire, being dubbed &#x27;North Londonshire&#x27;, as the area is only an hour from London St Pancras by rail. The campaign was criticised by residents in the county proud of the Northamptonshire name.

==Toxic waste contamination==

In July 2009 Corby Borough Council was found liable for negligently exposing pregnant women to toxic waste (dust) during the reclamation of the former British Steel Corporation steelworks, causing birth defects to their children. The judge found in favour of 16 of the 18 claimants, the oldest of whom was 22 at the time of the ruling. The ruling was significant as it was the first in the world to find that airborne pollution could cause such birth defects.

==Geography==

Corby is north-northwest of London, northeast of Northampton, southeast of Leicester, east of Birmingham and west of Peterborough, its nearest city.

The built up area of Corby had a population of 56,810 in 2011 compared with 61,255 for the Borough of Corby. The urban area had an area of 20.5 km2 compared with 80.3 km2 for the larger borough. Corby is expanding rapidly, with the borough having a population of 53,400 in 2001 and increasing to 61,300 in 2011. The expansion has resulted in villages like Great Oakley and Weldon being absorbed into the town&#x27;s urban area. However, the latter remains a parish, being separated from the rest of Corby by the A43.

===Areas of Corby===
Most of Corby&#x27;s population live in the town itself, however in terms of area it is mostly rural. This list includes the villages within the borough but also districts of the urban area and modern housing developments.

The song &quot;Steeltown&quot; by Big Country (title track of the album) was written about the town of Corby, telling how many Scots went to work there, but who found themselves unemployed when the steelworks declined. (Source: &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, 1984) 

In February 2025 Netflix released the series Toxic Town based on real scandal that caused birth defects due to the steel industry in Corby.

<doc id="208362" wikidata="Q782974" url="?curid=208362" title="Hopping mouse">
<text>A hopping mouse is any of about ten different Australian native mice in the genus Notomys. They are rodents, not marsupials, and their ancestors are thought to have arrived from Asia about 5 million years ago.

All are brown or fawn, fading to pale grey or white underneath, have very long tails and, as the common name implies, well-developed hind legs. Half of the hopping mouse species have become extinct since European colonisation. The primary cause is probably predation from introduced foxes or cats, coupled with competition for food from introduced rabbits and hoofed mammals. A hopping mouse&#x27;s primary diet is seeds. An Australian hopping mouse can concentrate urine to as high as 10,000 mOsm/L (10-20 times higher than a human). This allows it to survive in the desert without drinking water.

== Species ==
* The spinifex hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys alexis&quot;) occurs throughout the central and western Australian arid zones, occupying both spinifex-covered sand flats and stabilised sand dunes, and loamy mulga and melaleuca flats.
* The extinct short-tailed hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys amplus&quot;) was the largest species at around 100 g.
* The northern hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys aquilo&quot;) is found only in coastal northern Australia, from Arnhem Land to the Cobourg Peninsula.
* The fawn hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys cervinus&quot;) is found on the sparsely vegetated arid gibber plains and claypans of the Lake Eyre Basin. Small at around 30 to 50 g, and light in colour, it is gregarious and feeds at night on seeds, insects, and green shoots, not needing to drink water. It is classed as near threatened.
* Some small dusky hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys fuscus&quot;) populations retain a slender hold on existence in the Strzelecki Desert. They feed, mostly on seeds, at night and shelter in deep vertical burrows.
* The long-tailed hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys longicaudatus&quot;) is an extinct species, which was widespread in the drier regions of southern and central Australia. It dug burrows in stiff, clay soils. It liked raisins, but was not a pest to the stores of settlers. Only a handful of specimens were collected and the last record dates from 1901, although skull fragments were found in an owl pellet in 1977.
*The extinct big-eared hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys macrotis&quot;) lived in the Moore River area of south-western Australia. The last record dates from 19 July 1843.
* Mitchell&#x27;s hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys mitchellii&quot;) is the largest extant member of the genus. It occurs throughout much of semi-arid Southern Australia and is currently considered to be unthreatened, although its range has been reduced through habitat disturbance and destruction.
* The Darling Downs hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys mordax&quot;) is almost certainly extinct and is known only from a single skull collected somewhere on the Darling Downs of south-east Queensland in the 1840s, apparently from a creature similar to Mitchell&#x27;s hopping-mouse. The introduction of cattle to the Darling Downs has greatly changed the ecology of the region, and seen several other species exterminated or seriously threatened. (See Paradise parrot and Northern hairy-nosed wombat.)
* The great hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys robustus&quot; Mahoney, Smith and Medlin 2008) is extinct. It is known only from skulls found in owl pellets in the Flinders Ranges. Some pellets also include bones of the introduced house mouse—indicating that it survived into historic times, possibly the second half of the 19th century. From the skull, it appears to have been relatively large (perhaps the size of &quot;N. amplus&quot; or a little more) and to have escaped collection by early 19th century naturalists by chance. From the location of the deposits it is assumed that it preferred clay rather than sandy soils. It is notable that very few of the clay-living hopping mice have survived European settlement, sand dunes apparently providing a more secure refuge from competitors and predators. Also commonly known as the &quot;broad-cheeked hopping-mouse&quot;.

<text>Berchtesgadener Land (Central Bavarian: &quot;Berchtsgoana Land&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by the district of Traunstein and by the state of Austria.

== History ==
===Middle ages and early modern era===

The southern alpine regions were part of the stem duchy of Bavaria from the early Middle Ages. The 11th and 12th centuries saw the founding of numerous mountain villages. One of these settlements was Berchtesgaden, which later assumed a more dominant role in the administrative district that now bears its name.

The northern portion of the Salzach river valley was traditionally part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg (an imperial principality ruled by the archbishop of Salzburg), while Berchtesgaden itself was the seat of the Berchtesgaden Provostry (a principality ruled by a Prince-Provost) comprising roughly the modern municipalities of Berchtesgaden, Bischofswiesen, Marktschellenberg, Ramsau and Schönau am Königssee.

These states existed from the Middle Ages until the early 19th century, and functioned as buffers between Bavaria and Austria. However, like the rest of the Holy Roman Empire, the Napoleonic wars brought about significant changes to the political make-up of the region. In 1803 Salzburg was secularised and became the short-lived Electorate of Salzburg, and Berchtesgaden was mediatized to (incorporated into) this new state. In 1805 Salzburg was itself mediatized to Austria, but was ceded to Bavaria in 1809. In the 1816 Treaty of Munich most of Salzburg was returned to Austria becoming the Duchy of Salzburg in 1850 and ultimately the modern Austrian state of Salzburg (with the westernmost portions becoming part of the County of Tyrol). However, the land of the former Berchtesgaden Provostry and the former Salzburg land west of the Salzach and Saalach rivers remained part of Bavaria. The modern Berchtesgadener Land is mostly made up from sections of this land, with the exception of the area around Bad Reichenhall, which had been part of Bavaria for centuries; the rest lies in adjoining areas in eastern Traunstein and a small area of southern Altötting.

===Recent history===
The Berchtesgadener Land was formed in 1972 through a merger of the district of Berchtesgaden, the district of Laufen and the city of Bad Reichenhall.

Two important historical events have dramatically reshaped Berchtesgadener Land in recent years, namely Austria&#x27;s signing of the Schengen treaty in 1990 and the introduction of the Euro in 2002 in both Germany and Austria. Municipalities on both sides of the border have been brought much closer by these changes, and the area is reversing many of the effects caused by the split of 1816. There is close and mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as public transport, recreational sports and culture. There is even a cross-border radio station called &quot;Radio Untersberg&quot; (website), which would have been unimaginable some 20 years ago due to different government regulations.

Salzburg has gradually asserted a new role as an economic, educational and cultural center of the area, which has had a ripple effect through several municipalities such as Freilassing, which have traditionally defined themselves as German border towns.

== Geography ==
This district comprises the southeastern tip of Bavaria. It consists of a high alpine countryside in the south, with mountains rising to more than 2500 m, and of a strip along the Saalach River. The city of Salzburg (Austria) is located on the opposite side of the Saalach, across from the town of Freilassing.
The very south is occupied by the Berchtesgaden National Park (210 km2) comprising the Watzmann massif (2713 m) and the Königssee, a lake of 5.2 km2 surrounded by majestic mountains.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* the heraldic lion of Salzburg, representing the northern districts which were once subjects of Salzburg
* the keys of Saint Peter, the patron saint of the Berchtesgaden Provostry
* the white and blue lozenge-pattern (&quot;Rautenflagge&quot;) of Bavaria (one of the two flags of Bavaria)

<doc id="208367" wikidata="Q1017583" url="?curid=208367" title="Oswego, New York">
<text>Oswego () is a city in Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 16,921 at the 2020 census. Oswego is situated at the mouth of the Oswego River on the southeastern shore of Lake Ontario in Upstate New York, about northwest of Syracuse and east-northeast of Rochester by road. The city promotes itself as &quot;The Port City of Central New York&quot;. It is the county seat of Oswego County.

The first European settlement at Oswego was a British trading post established in 1722, and it was first incorporated as a village in 1828 before becoming a city in 1848. British forces briefly captured the city during the War of 1812, but were defeated nearby later that same month. The canalization of the Oswego River was a major boon to Oswego, attracting settlement and investment; this was later bolstered by its status as a rail hub for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, though this status had begun to decline by the 1940s. During World War II, Fort Ontario was the site of the only Jewish refugee camp in the United States. Today, the city&#x27;s economy is primarily based around manufacturing and services.

Oswego is governed by a mayor, currently Republican Rob Corradino, and a city council. The city is located within the Syracuse metropolitan area, and is also inside Syracuse&#x27;s broader media market. It is bordered by the towns of Oswego, Minetto, and Scriba to the west, south, and east, respectively; and by Lake Ontario to the north. Oswego Speedway is a nationally known automobile racing facility. The State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY Oswego) is located just outside the city in the town of Oswego, on the shores of Lake Ontario, and is a major force in the area.

==History==

===Early history===
The British established a trading post in the area in 1722 and fortified it with a log palisade later called Fort Oswego, named after the native Iroquois place name &quot;os-we-go&quot; meaning &quot;pouring out place&quot;. The first fortification on the site of the current Fort Ontario was built by the British in 1755 and called the &quot;Fort of the Six Nations&quot;.

===Military base===

Fort Ontario was destroyed by the French upon capturing it in the Battle of Fort Ontario, during the French and Indian War. Construction of a second British fort began on the same site in 1759, but Fort Ontario was only used as a cannon emplacement. During the American Revolution, the British abandoned the Fort, and in 1778, American troops destroyed it. In 1782, the British reoccupied Fort Ontario, and didn&#x27;t forfeit it to the U.S. until 1796, thirteen years after the cessation of hostilities in the Revolution. 

During the War of 1812, a weaker American garrison at Fort Ontario was overwhelmed by superior British forces in order to stem the flow of supplies from the interior of New York state, but were later defeated near Oswego later that month. Throughout the 19th Century, the U.S. military maintained a presence at Fort Ontario.

===Growth===
Oswego was incorporated as a village on March 14, 1828, and the Oswego Canal, a branch of the Erie Canal, reached the area in 1829. The city was incorporated in 1848. When the city incorporated, its area and population were removed from the figures reported for the towns.

In the 1850s, at the height of a popular water-cure movement occurring in the United States, in turn stimulating growth, Oswego was the home of the &quot;Oswego Water Cure&quot; establishment, which Stonewall Jackson reportedly visited in August 1850.

===Railroads&#x27; role in growth===
Oswego is home to the Port of Oswego and once was a hub for several major railroads: the New York Central Railroad (NYC), the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W) and the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (O&amp;W). Railways operated a coal trestle for fueling steamships at the Port of Oswego. Into the mid-1940s, the DL&amp;W had daily passenger service from Hoboken, through Binghamton, to Syracuse ending in Oswego. The New York Central last had passenger service between Oswego, Fulton and Syracuse in 1951. Former NYC and DL&amp;W passenger stations remain, as does a NYC freight station. Nothing remains of the O&amp;W, which was abandoned in its entirety on March 30, 1957. The tunnel from the former O&amp;W is used as a rail trail.

===Fort Ontario===
Fort Ontario was built between 1839 and 1844. Major masonry improvements to the forts outer wall were undertaken, but left incomplete when Congress canceled its funding in 1872. By 1901, the old fort was abandoned.

The 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division called Fort Ontario home until the brigade was deactivated on June 1, 1940. During World War II it was used for interning Jewish refugees from Europe (see section below).

In 1946, the fort was transferred to the state of New York. At that time, it was used to house veterans and their families during the post-war period. Development of the fort as a historic site began in 1949, which included the &quot;Safe Haven Museum&quot;.

Today, Fort Ontario is being restored to its 1867–1872 appearance. Costumed interpreters recreate the lives of the officers, men, and civilians who garrisoned the fort in 1868–1869.

===World War II refugee camp===

In 1944 amidst World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established a camp at the fort for survivors of the Holocaust.

The fort was used as Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter also known as &quot;Safe Haven&quot;, home to approximately 982 Jewish refugees, survivors of the Nazi Holocaust, from August 1944 to February 1946. This was the only attempt by the United States government to shelter Jewish refugees during the war.

Approximately 1,000 refugees were transferred to the fort from the Ferramonti di Tarsia, a concentration camp in Cosenza, Calabria, Italy. The refugees came from 18 different European countries.

The refugees were placed behind barbed wire, and given no official status, having been required to sign papers accepting their eventual return to their home countries in Europe at the end of the war. Due to political pressure, President Harry S. Truman allowed them to apply for citizenship.

The camp comprised 200 buildings of converted army barracks. The site is now the Safe Haven Museum.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (31.76%) is water.

Oswego is located on the southeastern shore of Lake Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River, approximately 35 miles north of Syracuse and 69 miles east of Rochester. The elevation is 298 feet above sea level. The nearest city is Fulton, located south of Oswego and north of Syracuse.

As Oswego is located on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario, in the center of the Snowbelt, the region often sees prodigious lake effect snow accumulations. Oswego is one of the snowiest towns in America, with some winters totaling over 300 inches. In 2007, Oswego gained national attention when approximately 130″ (slightly less than 11 feet) of snow fell in a two-week timespan. This broke the record of the Blizzard of 1966, which blanketed the city with 102″ of snow. As a result of this storm, the school district closed all facilities for a week, effectively shifting the planned winter holiday.

===Locations and communities near Oswego===
* Oswego: the town of Oswego
* Minetto: the town of Minetto south of the city
* Scriba: the town of Scriba east of the city
* Southwest Oswego: a hamlet located west of the city
* Fruit Valley: a hamlet located west of the city

===Climate===
Oswego has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on a hot-summer climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) characterized by cold, snowy winters and warm, often humid summers, typical of the Interior Northeast; it experiences four distinct seasons, and is located in USDA hardiness zone 6a (average extreme annual minimum temperature of . The city is known for typically experiencing exceptionally snowy winters, with an average seasonal snowfall of ; this is owed primarily to its prolific lake-effect snowfall. Lake-effect precipitation, which begins as rain when the season kicks off in September or October, also contributes to Oswego&#x27;s autumn precipitation maximum, unusual in this part of North America and typically experienced on the west coast of continents. Occasionally, nor&#x27;easters also contribute to the city&#x27;s snowfall, as do Alberta clipper systems. 
Lake Ontario also provides significant temperature moderation, allowing for slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than locations a few miles inland; during the transitional seasons, these differences can occasionally be dramatic. As a consequence of this moderation, days are quite rare in Oswego, and the city has never recorded a temperature reaching . The lake&#x27;s cooler temperatures also inhibit thunderstorm development into midsummer, though storm activity increases into August and even through early fall as the lake warms, as do precipitation and relative humidity. During the fall, lake moderation often extends the growing season by days or sometimes even weeks compared to more starkly continental inland locales.

==Politics==

===Political controversy===
In September 2005, Oswego Mayor John Gosek was arrested by the FBI and state police in a sting operation outside of a motel near Syracuse after allegedly giving a woman $250 to arrange a sexual encounter with two 14-year-old girls. The arrest came after a three-year investigation that led to charges of the mayor using his city-issued cell phone to “persuade, induce, entice and coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in sexual activity&quot;. The charge alleged that Gosek used his phone as interstate commerce for the purposes of illegal sex and falls under a federal law that is commonly known as the Mann Act. Gosek&#x27;s term wasn&#x27;t due to expire until 2007, but he resigned from office five days after his arrest.

In March 2024, the City of Oswego, prior mayoral administration and recent mayoral administration Rob Corradino and Common council members, voted and overrode the assessment process, raising the City of Oswego residential property assessments to address a budget shortfall. Properties owners expressed frustration at a council meeting, with some noting that their taxes had doubled or nearly tripled.

==Culture and recreation==
Oswego has a long history stretching back to the 15th century. Visitors can learn about the city&#x27;s history by visiting museums such as the H. Lee White Marine Museum, The Richardson-Bates House, and Fort Ontario. Throughout the city and public parks, many historical monuments can be found honoring historical figures, and other forts that stood in what is now the historical district. The city includes a number of sites on the National Register of Historic Places including the Derrick Boat No. 8, Kingsford Historic District, Market House, Oswego Armory, Oswego City Hall, Oswego City Library, Oswego County Courthouse, Oswego Yacht Club, Tanner Block, and U.S. Customhouse. In September 2024, the Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary was designated in the waters of southeastern Lake Ontario off Oswego to protect historic shipwrecks and areas of cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to Native Americans of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and to preserve them as educational and recreational resources.

The most notable historian was Rosemary Nesbitt, who is immortalized by a monument in the city&#x27;s signature public park, Breitbeck Park. Every Halloween, she would traditionally let down her long silver hair, dress in a ghostly gown, and tell ghostly haunted tales spanning across the entire history of the city. Nesbitt, who also founded the Marine Museum and wrote various books about the city&#x27;s history, died on August 2, 2009, at the age of 84.

Ludwig Bemelmans, a writer best known for his popular &#x27;Madeline&#x27; stories, was stationed at Fort Ontario, Oswego, N.Y. from 1917. From this experience he wrote the book &quot;My war with the United States&quot; published in 1937.

Boating, fishing, and hiking are also activities that are enjoyed by residents and visitors. Oswego also has three ice-skating rinks, a large public pool located on the Fort Ontario grounds, bowling, and the historic Oswego Theater.

Every year the city hosts the Oswego Harborfest, a four-day festival of music, culture and food, centered around the Oswego Harbor, culminating in a fireworks display on the Saturday evening of the festival. The event is sponsored by local businesses, and the entertainment is admission-free. The festival continues to draw approximately 150,000 to 300,000 attendees every year.

In 2007, SUNY Oswego Lakers men&#x27;s hockey team won the NCAA Division III Ice Hockey Championship. Garren Reisweber&#x27;s goal 12:55 into overtime gave Oswego State a 4–3 win over Middlebury on March 18, 2007. The Lakers captured the school&#x27;s first ever national championship in a team sport. The 2006–07 season marked the first season Oswego played in the newly built, state-of-the-art Marano Campus Center, located on Lake Ontario. The Campus Center replaced Romney Field House Ice Rink which opened in 1962, and is believed to be the first ice rink built within the State University of New York system. The old ice rink was transformed into a multi-use indoor facility for track, lacrosse and other intramural sports.

From 2005 to 2006 the Oswego Admirals of the Ontario Junior Hockey League played in the old ice rink.

==Media==
The city is served by &quot;The Palladium Times&quot; newspaper, &quot;Oswego County Today&quot;, the student-run newspaper &quot;The Oswegonian&quot;, as well as &quot;OswegoNYlion&quot; and is the home to the radio stations WRVO, WSGO, WNYO and WMVN. Oswego also has its own television station, WTOP, which is completely student-run at the State University of New York at Oswego, and is served by the Oswego High School television station, WBUC. Oswego is served by the Syracuse TV market. Previous media included the &quot;Oswego Daily News&quot;.

==Education==
The city is part of the Oswego City School District. The Oswego City School district has one high school (grades 9–12), one middle school (grades 7 and 8) and five elementary schools (grades K–6).

Trinity Catholic School (formerly St. Paul&#x27;s Academy) provides classes for PreK–6. Oswego Community Christian School provides classes for PreK–8.

The State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY Oswego) has portions of its property in Oswego City, with the rest just west of the city in the Town of Oswego.

==Electric power facilities==
===Oswego generating station===
Pursuant to Section 70 of the Public Service Law, NRG Energy, Inc. (now operating as NRG Power Marketing LLC) officially received ownership of the Oswego generating station from previous owners Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and Rochester Gas and Electric in 1999. NRG was the lowest bidder in an auction arranged by Niagara Mohawk. The facility is a 1,803-megawatt (MW) (nameplate) plant with two steam turbines powered by steam heated in boilers from fuel oil (although one of the units has natural gas listed as a backup fuel). The facility went into service in 1976 (for unit 5) and 1980 (for unit 6). In 2017, it injected 39.7 GWh of electric energy into the electric transmission system. This is equivalent to operating at full capacity for approximately 0.3% of the year. For comparison, the central region consumed 15,819 GWh of electric energy in 2017. Its power is sold into the electric wholesale market administered by the NYISO. Since the plant does not produce much electric energy on an annual basis, it is fair to assume that most of its revenue comes from the NYISO&#x27;s capacity market. For example, at 1.0 ($/kW - Month), the plant would receive annual revenue of $21.6 million from the capacity market without accounting for actual energy production.

According to the New York State Public Service Commission&#x27;s database management system, DMM, there was a whistle blower complaint filed against the facility (case no. 92-E-0306) in 1992, however, the DMM website for that case number says its contents were moved to the DMM website for case number 92-M-0016. As of November 2018, there are 5 orders on the DMM case number 92-M-0016 website, none of which have to do with a whistle blower complaint against Oswego generating station.

<doc id="208369" wikidata="Q2727388" url="?curid=208369" title="Thermoluminescence dating">
<text>Thermoluminescence dating (TL) is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated radiation dose, of the time elapsed since material containing crystalline minerals was either heated (lava, ceramics) or exposed to sunlight (sediments). As a crystalline material is heated during measurements, the process of thermoluminescence starts. Thermoluminescence emits a weak light signal that is proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material. It is a type of luminescence dating.

The technique has wide application, and is relatively cheap at some US$300–700 per object; ideally a number of samples are tested. Sediments are more expensive to date. The destruction of a relatively significant amount of sample material is necessary, which can be a limitation in the case of artworks. The heating must have taken the object above 500 °C, which covers most ceramics, although very high-fired porcelain creates other difficulties. It will often work well with stones that have been heated by fire. The clay core of bronze sculptures made by lost wax casting is also able to be tested.

Different materials vary considerably in their suitability for the technique, depending on several factors. Subsequent irradiation, for example if an x-ray is taken, can affect accuracy, as will the &quot;annual dose&quot; of radiation a buried object has received from the surrounding soil. Ideally this is assessed by measurements made at the precise findspot over a long period. For artworks, it may be sufficient to confirm whether a piece is broadly ancient or modern (that is, authentic or a fake), and this may be possible even if a precise date cannot be estimated.

== Functionality ==
Natural crystalline materials contain imperfections: impurity ions, stress dislocations, and other phenomena that disturb the regularity of the electric field that holds the atoms in the crystalline lattice together. These imperfections lead to local humps and dips in the crystalline material&#x27;s electric potential. Where there is a dip (a so-called &quot;electron trap&quot;), a free electron may be attracted and trapped.

The flux of ionizing radiation—both from cosmic radiation and from natural radioactivity—excites electrons from atoms in the crystal lattice into the conduction band where they can move freely. Most excited electrons will soon recombine with lattice ions, but some will be trapped, storing part of the energy of the radiation in the form of trapped electric charge (Figure 1).

Depending on the depth of the traps (the energy required to free an electron from them) the storage time of trapped electrons will vary as some traps are sufficiently deep to store charge for hundreds of thousands of years.

== In practical use ==
Another important technique in testing samples from a historic or archaeological site is a process known as thermoluminescence testing, which involves the principle that all
objects absorb radiation from the environment. This process frees electrons within elements or minerals that remain caught within the item. Thermoluminescence testing involves
heating a sample until it releases a type of light, which is then measured to determine the last time the item was heated.

In thermoluminescence dating, these long-term traps are used to determine the age of materials: When irradiated crystalline material is again heated or exposed to strong light, the trapped electrons are given sufficient energy to escape. In the process of recombining with a lattice ion, they lose energy and emit photons (light quanta), detectable in the laboratory.

The amount of light produced is proportional to the number of trapped electrons that have been freed which is in turn proportional to the radiation dose accumulated. In order to relate the signal (the thermoluminescence—light produced when the material is heated) to the radiation dose that caused it, it is necessary to calibrate the material with known doses of radiation since the density of traps is highly variable.

Thermoluminescence dating presupposes a &quot;zeroing&quot; event in the history of the material, either heating (in the case of pottery or lava) or exposure to sunlight (in the case of sediments), that removes the pre-existing trapped electrons. Therefore, at that point the thermoluminescence signal is zero.

As time goes on, the ionizing radiation field around the material causes the trapped electrons to accumulate (Figure 2). In the laboratory, the accumulated radiation dose can be measured, but this by itself is insufficient to determine the time since the zeroing event.

The &quot;Radiation Dose Rate&quot; - the dose accumulated per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by measurement of the alpha radioactivity (the uranium and thorium content) and the potassium content (K-40 is a beta and gamma emitter) of the sample material.

Often the gamma radiation field at the position of the sample material is measured, or it may be calculated from the alpha radioactivity and potassium content of the sample environment, and the cosmic ray dose is added in. Once all components of the radiation field are determined, the accumulated dose from the thermoluminescence measurements is divided by the dose accumulating each year, to obtain the years since the zeroing event.

== Relation to radiocarbon dating ==
Thermoluminescence dating is used for material where radiocarbon dating is not available, like sediments. Its use is now common in the authentication of old ceramic wares, for which it gives the approximate date of the last firing. An example of this can be seen in Rink and Bartoll, 2005.

Thermoluminescence dating was modified for use as a &quot;passive sand migration analysis tool&quot; by Keizars, &quot;et al.&quot;, 2008 (Figure 3), demonstrating the direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands, as well as providing a &quot;passive&quot; method of policing sand replenishment and observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines (Figure 4).

== Relation to other luminescence dating methods==
Optically stimulated luminescence dating is a related measurement method which replaces heating with exposure to intense light. The sample material is illuminated with a very bright source of green or blue light (for quartz) or infrared light (for potassium feldspar). Ultraviolet light emitted by the sample is detected for measurement.

<text>A span loop is a non-jamming loop that can be tied away from the ends of the rope.

==Information==
The span loop is known for being extremely easy to untie. The beginning of tying this knot begins with tying a Half Sheepshank, which is also known as a Bell Ringer&#x27;s Knot. In order to tie this, the same one-handed twist method employed for tying a bowline can be used. One bight or loop will poke up through the half-hitch, and it will perfectly match the end of the rope that is also poking up through the signature half-hitch part of a bowline as it is done with the one hand twist method. The next thing to do is to push the bottom loop back up and through the top loop.

<text>Noor Al Hussein (; born Lisa Najeeb Halaby; August 23, 1951) is an American-born Jordanian philanthropist and activist who is the fourth wife and widow of King Hussein of Jordan. She was Queen of Jordan from their marriage on June 15, 1978, until Hussein&#x27;s death on February 7, 1999.

Noor is the longest-standing member of the Board of Commissioners of the International Commission on Missing Persons. As of 2023, she is president of the United World Colleges movement and an advocate of the anti-nuclear weapons proliferation campaign Global Zero. In 2015, Queen Noor received Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson Award for her public service.

== Family and early life ==

Queen Noor was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby in Washington, D.C., U.S., the eldest child of Najeeb Halaby (1915–2003) and Doris Carlquist (1918–2015). Her paternal family is Syrian; her maternal family is Swedish American. Her father was raised a Christian Scientist and was a Navy experimental test pilot, an airline executive, and government official. He served as an aide to the United States Secretary of Defense in the Truman administration, before being appointed by President John F. Kennedy to head the Federal Aviation Administration. Najeeb Halaby also had a private-sector career, serving as CEO of Pan American World Airways from 1969 to 1972. The Halabys had two children following Lisa; a son, Christian, and a younger daughter, Alexa. The children were raised nominally Episcopalian. Najeeb and Doris divorced in 1977. Doris, who was of Swedish descent, died on December 25, 2015, aged 97.

Noor&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Najeeb Elias Halaby, a Syrian-Lebanese businessman born in Zahle, and whose parents hailed from Aleppo. He was a petroleum broker, according to 1920 Census records. Merchant Stanley Marcus recalled that in the mid-1920s, Halaby opened Halaby Galleries, a rug boutique and interior-decorating shop, at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Texas, and ran it with his Texas-born wife, Laura Wilkins (1889–1987, later Mrs. Urban B. Koen). Najeeb Halaby died shortly afterward, and his estate was unable to continue the new enterprise.

According to research done in 2010 for the PBS series &quot;Faces of America&quot; by Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., of Harvard University, her great-grandfather, Elias Halaby, came to New York circa 1891, one of the earliest Syrian-Lebanese immigrants to the United States. He was a Christian as well as having been a provincial treasurer (magistrate) as stated before by Najeeb Halaby in his autobiography &quot;Crosswinds: an Airman&#x27;s Memoir&quot;. He left Ottoman Syria with his two eldest sons. His wife, Almas Mallouk, and their remaining children joined him in the United States in 1894. He died three years later, leaving his teenage sons, Habib, and Najeeb (her paternal grandfather), to run his import business. Najeeb moved to Dallas around 1910 and fully assimilated into U.S. society.

== Education ==
Halaby attended schools in New York and California before entering National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. from fourth to eighth grade. She attended the Chapin School in New York City for two years, and then went on to graduate from Concord Academy. 

She entered Princeton University with its first coeducational freshman class and received an A.B. in architecture and urban planning in 1974 after completing a 32-page long senior thesis titled &quot;96th Street and Second Avenue.&quot; She was also a member of Princeton&#x27;s first women&#x27;s ice hockey team.

== Career ==
After she graduated from Princeton, Halaby moved to Australia, where she worked for a firm that specialized in planning new towns, with a burgeoning interest in the Middle East. Because of Halaby&#x27;s Syrian roots, this had special appeal for her. After a year, in 1975, she accepted a job offer from Llewelyn Davies, a British architectural and planning firm, which had been employed to design a model capital city center in Tehran, Iran. When increasing political instability forced the company to relocate to the UK, she traveled to the Arab world and decided to apply to Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism while taking a temporary aviation facility research job in Amman. Eventually, she left Arab Air and accepted a job with Alia Airlines to become Director of Facilities Planning and Design. Halaby and the king became friends while he was still mourning the death of his third wife. Their friendship evolved and the couple became engaged in 1978.

== Marriage and children ==

Halaby wed King Hussein on June 15, 1978, in Amman, becoming Queen of Jordan.

Before her marriage, she accepted her husband&#x27;s Sunni Islamic religion and upon the marriage, changed her name from Lisa Halaby to the royal name &quot;Noor Al Hussein&quot; (&quot;Light of Hussein&quot;). The wedding was a traditional Muslim ceremony. Noor assumed management of the royal household and three stepchildren, Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein and Abir Muhaisen (her husband&#x27;s children by Queen Alia). Noor and Hussein had four children:

* Hamzah (born March 29, 1980, in King Hussein Medical Center, Amman), Crown Prince from 1999 to 2004, who has five daughters and two sons.
* Prince Hashim (born June 10, 1981, at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman), who has three daughters and two sons.
* Princess Iman (born April 24, 1983, at King Hussein Medical Center, Amman), who has one son.
* Princess Raiyah (born February 9, 1986, at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman).

== Areas of work ==

=== Domestic agenda ===
Queen Noor founded the King Hussein Foundation (KHF) in 1979. It includes the Noor Al Hussein Foundation and eight specialized development institutions: the Jubilee Institute, the Information and Research Center, the National Music Conservatory, the National Center for Culture and Arts and the Institute for Family Health, the Community Development Program, Tamweelcom the Jordan Micro Credit Company and the Islamic microfinance company, Ethmar. She is the Honorary Chairperson of JOrchestra. In addition, Queen Noor launched a youth initiative, the International Arab Youth Congress, in 1980.

===International agenda===
Queen Noor&#x27;s international work focuses on environmental issues and the connection to human security with emphasis on water and ocean health. At the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, she delivered a keynote address on the link between climate change and ocean health with human security. Queen Noor is Patron of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Founding and Emeritus President of BirdLife International, Trustee Emeritus of Conservation International, and an Ocean Elder. She was also chair of King Hussein Foundation International, a US non-profit 501(c)(3) which, since 2001, has awarded the King Hussein Leadership Prize. She is the president of the international board, the governing board of international movement for the UWC movement.

She speaks Arabic, English and French.

== Widowhood ==

King Hussein died on February 7, 1999, from lymphatic cancer. After his death, his first-born son, Abdullah II, became king and Hamzah became crown prince. In 2004, Prince Hamzah was unexpectedly stripped of his status as heir designate. On July 2, 2009, Abdullah named his eldest son as heir-apparent to the throne, thereby ending the previous five years&#x27; speculation over his successor.

Noor divides her time among Jordan, the US (Washington, D.C.) and the United Kingdom (in London and at her country residence, Buckhurst Park, near Winkfield in Berkshire). She continues to work on behalf of numerous international organizations. She also enjoys skiing, water skiing, tennis, sailing, horseback riding, reading, gardening and photography. She held amateur radio callsign JY1NH, but the license has lapsed.

<doc id="208376" wikidata="Q5608683" url="?curid=208376" title="Grief knot">
<text>A grief knot (also what knot) is a knot which combines the features of a granny knot and a thief knot, producing a result which is not generally useful for working purposes. The word &quot;grief&quot; does not carry its usual meaning but is a portmanteau of &quot;granny&quot; and &quot;thief&quot;.

The grief knot resembles the granny knot, but tied so that the working ends come out diagonally from each other, whereas a granny knot&#x27;s ends both come out on the same side. It unravels rather elegantly: as tension is applied, the ropes rotate like little cogs, each one twisting to feed the rope through the knot.

==Tying==
To tie the grief knot, tie a single &quot;overhand knot&quot; (nb: this isn&#x27;t the same as a single-strand &quot;overhand knot&quot; often used as a stopper or as a component of other knots, such as the fisherman&#x27;s knot or ring water knot), as if starting a reef knot. Then thrust the two free ends together down through the center of the just-tied overhand knot. Twist the free ends to form half hitches to lock, twist the other way for the granny knot-like configuration that rolls apart when the standing parts are pulled. In short, if the standing parts (the &quot;main lines&quot; which bear force into the knot) nip/cross their own ends, the knot will lock; otherwise, it will probably slip.

==As a trick knot==
The starkly differing behavior of the knot, depending on how it is arranged, has been exploited as the basis of a parlor trick. When pulling on the standing ends the knot starts slipping and the working ends become crossed. By twisting the working ends so that they uncross and then recross in reverse, the knot&#x27;s structure is changed so that it will no longer slip. The twisting motion has been paralleled to the turning of a key, &quot;locking&quot; and &quot;unlocking&quot; the knot.

==Security==
Because the grief knot is known to slip apart &quot;with astonishing ease&quot;, it is considered one of the most insecure of knots.

However, in its locked opposing half-hitch arrangement, the grief knot has been used as a practical bend for tying together flat materials, such as straps, belts, blades of grass, and similar materials. This is because the flat shape helps to prevent the knot from accidentally &quot;unlocking&quot;. When used in this manner, the knot is known as a grass bend.

<doc id="208382" wikidata="Q27948" url="?curid=208382" title="List (abstract data type)">
<text>In computer science, a list or sequence is a collection of items that are finite in number and in a particular order. An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a tuple or finite sequence. 

A list may contain the same value more than once, and each occurrence is considered a distinct item.
The term &quot;list&quot; is also used for several concrete data structures that can be used to implement abstract lists, especially linked lists and arrays. In some contexts, such as in Lisp programming, the term list may refer specifically to a linked list rather than an array. In class-based programming, lists are usually provided as instances of subclasses of a generic &quot;list&quot; class, and traversed via separate iterators.

Many programming languages provide support for list data types, and have special syntax and semantics for lists and list operations. A list can often be constructed by writing the items in sequence, separated by commas, semicolons, and/or spaces, within a pair of delimiters such as parentheses &#x27;()&#x27;, brackets &#x27;[]&#x27;, braces &#x27;{}&#x27;, or angle brackets &#x27;&lt;&gt;&#x27;. Some languages may allow list types to be indexed or sliced like array types, in which case the data type is more accurately described as an array.

In type theory and functional programming, abstract lists are usually defined inductively by two operations: &quot;nil&quot; that yields the empty list, and &quot;cons&quot;, which adds an item at the beginning of a list.

A stream is the potentially infinite analog of a list. 

==Operations==
Implementation of the list data structure may provide some of the following operations:

* create
* test for empty
* add item to beginning or end
* access the first or last item
* access an item by index

==Implementations==
Lists are typically implemented either as linked lists (either singly or doubly linked) or as arrays, usually variable length or dynamic arrays.

The standard way of implementing lists, originating with the programming language Lisp, is to have each element of the list contain both its value and a pointer indicating the location of the next element in the list. This results in either a linked list or a tree, depending on whether the list has nested sublists. Some older Lisp implementations (such as the Lisp implementation of the Symbolics 3600) also supported &quot;compressed lists&quot; (using CDR coding) which had a special internal representation (invisible to the user). Lists can be manipulated using iteration or recursion. The former is often preferred in imperative programming languages, while the latter is the norm in functional languages.

Lists can be implemented as self-balancing binary search trees holding index-value pairs, providing equal-time access to any element (e.g. all residing in the fringe, and internal nodes storing the right-most child&#x27;s index, used to guide the search), taking the time logarithmic in the list&#x27;s size, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t change much will provide the illusion of random access and enable swap, prefix and append operations in logarithmic time as well.

==Programming language support==
Some languages do not offer a list data structure, but offer the use of associative arrays or some kind of table to emulate lists. For example, Lua provides tables. Although Lua stores lists that have numerical indices as arrays internally, they still appear as dictionaries.

In Lisp, lists are the fundamental data type and can represent both program code and data. In most dialects, the list of the first three prime numbers could be written as codice_1. In several dialects of Lisp, including Scheme, a list is a collection of pairs, consisting of a value and a pointer to the next pair (or null value), making a singly linked list.

==Applications==

Unlike in an array, a list can expand and shrink.

In computing, lists are easier to implement than sets. A finite set in the mathematical sense can be realized as a list with additional restrictions; that is, duplicate elements are disallowed and order is irrelevant. Sorting the list speeds up determining if a given item is already in the set, but in order to ensure the order, it requires more time to add new entry to the list. In efficient implementations, however, sets are implemented using self-balancing binary search trees or hash tables, rather than a list.

Lists also form the basis for other abstract data types including the queue, the stack, and their variations.

==Abstract definition==
The abstract list type &quot;L&quot; with elements of some type &quot;E&quot; (a monomorphic list) is defined by the following functions:

:nil: () → &quot;L&quot;
:cons: &quot;E&quot; × &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L&quot;
:first: &quot;L&quot; → &quot;E&quot;
:rest: &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L&quot;

with the axioms

:first (cons (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;)) = &quot;e&quot;
:rest (cons (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;)) = &quot;l&quot;

for any element &quot;e&quot; and any list &quot;l&quot;. It is implicit that

:cons (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;) ≠ &quot;l&quot;
:cons (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;) ≠ &quot;e&quot;
:cons (&quot;e&quot;1, &quot;l&quot;1) = cons (&quot;e&quot;2, &quot;l&quot;2) if &quot;e&quot;1 = &quot;e&quot;2 and &quot;l&quot;1 = &quot;l&quot;2

Note that first (nil ()) and rest (nil ()) are not defined.

These axioms are equivalent to those of the abstract stack data type.

In type theory, the above definition is more simply regarded as an inductive type defined in terms of constructors: &quot;nil&quot; and &quot;cons&quot;. In algebraic terms, this can be represented as the transformation 1 + &quot;E&quot; × &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L&quot;. &quot;first&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; are then obtained by pattern matching on the &quot;cons&quot; constructor and separately handling the &quot;nil&quot; case.

===The list monad===
The list type forms a monad with the following functions (using &quot;E&quot;* rather than &quot;L&quot; to represent monomorphic lists with elements of type &quot;E&quot;):

:formula_1
:formula_2
where &quot;append&quot; is defined as:
:formula_3

Alternatively, the monad may be defined in terms of operations &quot;return&quot;, &quot;fmap&quot; and &quot;join&quot;, with:
:formula_4
:formula_5

Note that &quot;fmap&quot;, &quot;join&quot;, &quot;append&quot; and &quot;bind&quot; are well-defined, since they&#x27;re applied to progressively deeper arguments at each recursive call.

The list type is an additive monad, with &quot;nil&quot; as the monadic zero and &quot;append&quot; as monadic sum.

Lists form a monoid under the &quot;append&quot; operation. The identity element of the monoid is the empty list, &quot;nil&quot;. In fact, this is the free monoid over the set of list elements.

<text>Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, (19 February 1594 – 6 November 1612), was the eldest son and heir apparent of James VI and I, King of England and Scotland; and his wife Anne of Denmark. His name derives from his grandfathers: Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley; and Frederick II of Denmark. Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright and promising heir to his father&#x27;s thrones. However, at the age of 18, he predeceased his father, dying of typhoid fever. His younger brother Charles succeeded him as heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones.

==Early life==
Henry was born on 19 February 1594 at Stirling Castle, Scotland, and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland automatically on his birth. His nurses included Mistress Primrose and Mistress Bruce. Henry&#x27;s baptism on 30 August 1594 was celebrated with complex theatrical entertainments written by poet William Fowler and a ceremony in a new Chapel Royal at Stirling purpose-built by William Schaw. James VI set a tax of £100,000 for the expenses. Textiles and costume for the event were bought using Anne&#x27;s dowry of £100,000 Scots which had been in the safekeeping of various towns. In the month before the baptism, there were rumours at the Scottish court that James VI was jealous of Anne of Denmark and thought that Ludovic Stewart, Duke of Lennox, might be the father of Prince Henry.
His father placed him in the care of John Erskine, Earl of Mar, and his mother Annabell Murray, at Stirling Castle, out of the care of the boy&#x27;s mother. James VI worried that the mother&#x27;s tendency toward Catholicism might affect the son. The child&#x27;s removal to Stirling caused enormous tension between Anne and James, and Henry remained there under the care of Mar&#x27;s family until 1603. James VI wrote a note to the Earl of Mar in June 1595 instructing him, in the event of his death, not to deliver Henry to Anne of Denmark or the Parliament of Scotland until he was 18 and gave the order himself.

Anne of Denmark was reluctant to go to Stirling and was said to be afraid that her enemies would give her a poisoned posset at the Castle. James VI frequently visited the Prince, and travelled to Stirling for his son&#x27;s first birthday. As early as August 1595, James VI encouraged the infant to hold a pen and make a penstroke on a document, which the king humorously certified, &quot;I will testify this is the prince&#x27;s own mark&quot;.

The Prince had silver candlesticks, a silver cup and a silver plate with a salt cellar. Elizabeth I contributed to the expenses at Stirling, paying £5000 Scots in 1595. At this time, Patrick Gray, Master of Gray was keeper of Henry&#x27;s wardrobe, and took delivery of a little coffer worth £8 Scots for the Prince&#x27;s clothes. Adam Newton became his schoolmaster or tutor. William Keith of Delny and then George Lauder were his legal tutors, administrators of his estates and incomes.

In 1596 Queen Elizabeth, via Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and his secretary Anthony Bacon, sent her miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard to Prince Henry, and this was received by the Earl of Mar at Stirling. It was said that Prince Henry would be godfather to his younger brother Duke Robert, in May 1602, and afterwards stay at Dunfermline Palace with his mother, but James VI forbade this.

Alexander Wilson became Henry&#x27;s tailor. In 1602 it was planned that Henry would visit his mother at Falkland Palace, but this was postponed because of her sickness. The French ambassador in London Christophe de Harlay, Count of Beaumont, reported a rumour, spread by James&#x27;s friends, that Anne of Denmark was cruel and ambitious, and hoped to rule Scotland as Regent or Governor for Henry after the death of her husband.

==London==
James became King of England in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns and his family moved south. Anne of Denmark came to Stirling to collect her son, and after an argument with the Prince&#x27;s keepers, Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar, was allowed to take Henry to Edinburgh on 28 May. On the following Sunday Anne took him to St Giles Kirk in her silver coach. Anne and Henry arrived in England, at the fortified town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, on 1 June.

Henry&#x27;s tutor Adam Newton continued to serve the Prince, and several Scottish servants from the Stirling household were retained, including the poet David Murray. The prince was lodged at Oatlands and Nonsuch Palace, and was relocated to Winchester during an outbreak of plague. At Winchester, in September 1603, Anne of Denmark produced a masque to welcome her son, which was controversial. In November 1603 he was staying at Wilton House, and King James joked that a letter presented to Henry by the Venetian diplomats was bigger than he was. Henry rode with the Earl of Nottingham and his governor Sir Thomas Chaloner to Salisbury to dine with the Venetian ambassador Nicolò Molin and other diplomats. This was the first time he had made an appearance and dined outside the royal household, and his father joked that Henry was the ambassador&#x27;s prisoner.

On 15 March 1604, Henry rode on horseback behind his father through the streets of London during the delayed Royal Entry. From 1604 onwards, Henry often stayed at St James&#x27;s Palace. The gardens were improved for him by Alphonsus Fowle. The daily expenses of the Prince in England were managed by the Cofferer of the Household, Henry Cocke and after 1610 David Foulis. David Murray of Gorthy was keeper of the Prince&#x27;s privy purse and his accounts reveal some details of Henry&#x27;s interests.

Two Scottish tailors, Alexander Wilson and Patrick Black, moved to London and made the prince&#x27;s clothes. Wilson made him doublets and hose from cloth supplied by Robert Grigge, and a hunting coat of green chamlet lined with velvet. The prince was supplied with perfumed gloves made of stag&#x27;s leather, perfumed gloves from Córdoba, and embroidered waistcoats &quot;wrought very curiously in colour silks&quot;.

==Music, games and sports==

Prince Henry was introduced to a variety of sports at Stirling Castle. In September 1600 he was bought two golf clubs, two staffs, and four rackets. The handles were covered with velvet and dressed with metal passementerie. In September 1601, an English visitor, Thomas Musgrave, saw Henry dance, leap, and wield a pike. On Sunday 8 May 1603 Henry exercised in the castle garden, watched by his mother, played billiards after dinner, and after supper &quot;ran and played at the boards&quot;. Henry had a huntsman, Thomas Pott, who continued to serve him in England. Pott travelled abroad several times, taking gifts of dogs from the young prince to European rulers.

Henry was tutored in music by Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Nicholas Villiard, and Walter Quinn. Thomas Giles taught him to dance. In August 1604 Henry danced for the Spanish envoy, the Constable Velasco, and showed him military pike exercises in the palace garden. Charles Guerolt taught Henry the &quot;science of defence&quot;, fencing. At Oatlands in 1603 Prince Henry told Scaramelli, a Venetian diplomat, about his interests in dancing, tennis and hunting. George Moncrieff was his falconer and kept his hawks. 

In 1606 the French ambassador Antoine Lefèvre de la Boderie noted that Prince Henry played golf, which he described as a Scottish game not unlike &quot;pallemail&quot; or pall-mall. One of Prince Henry&#x27;s biographers, &quot;W. H.&quot;, mentioned that Henry nearly hit Adam Newton with a golf ball, and Henry said that would have paid him back. Henry also played tennis, and in July 1606 played with his uncle Christian IV of Denmark at Greenwich Palace. He had a court for &quot;pall-mall&quot;, laid out at St James&#x27;s Fields, north of St James&#x27;s Palace. It was a long alley surfaced with cockle shells crushed into clay or loam.

In 1607 Henry sought permission to learn to swim, but the Earls of Suffolk, and Shrewsbury, wrote to Newton that swimming was a &quot;dangerous thing&quot; that their own sons might practise &quot;like feathers as light as things of nought&quot;, but was not suitable for Princes as &quot;things of great weight and consequence&quot;.

A riding school, one of the first in England, was built for him at St James&#x27;s Palace in 1607. Robert Douglas was the prince&#x27;s master of horse by 1610. Henry competed at running at the ring with foreign visitors and diplomats including Louis Frederick, Duke of Württemberg-Montbéliard, in April and May 1610. Henry talked of the merits of various breeds of horses and his own Barbary horses to the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini in 1611.

In March 1609, Henry was entertained by a man with a baboon. He revealed an interest in Venetian maritime power and had a plan of the fortification of Palmanova. As an indoor amusement, Henry played chess.

==Literature in the schoolroom==
In England, his writing masters included Peter Bales, who practiced &quot;small writing&quot; and made a miniature copy of the king&#x27;s book of advice, the &quot;Basilicon Doron&quot; for him to wear as a tablet book. Bales encouraged Henry to copy improving Latin phrases, known as &quot;sententiae&quot;. Henry translated works by Guy Du Faur, Seigneur de Pibrac and sent them to his mother, Anne of Denmark. He was a patron of Joshua Sylvester, who translated the poems of Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas. Henry started to translate Sylvester&#x27;s version into Latin to present to his father. He paid £100 to George Heriot for a diamond ring sent to his friend the essayist John Harington of Kelston, who sent him a translation of the sixth book of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; with notes referring to his father&#x27;s &quot;Basilicon Doron&quot;. Henry seems not to have studied ancient Greek authors, but told the Venetian ambassador he would learn modern Italian. Esther Inglis presented him with miniature manuscript books, including &quot;A Book of the Armes of England&quot;, as a New Year&#x27;s Day gift for which he rewarded her £5. The Venetian ambassador, Nicolò Molin, judged that Henry learnt under the impetus of his father&#x27;s spur, rather than his own inclination, and his brother, Charles, Duke of York, was more earnest in his studies.

==Training and personality==
The king greatly preferred the role of schoolmaster to that of father, and he wrote texts for the schooling of his children. James directed that Henry&#x27;s household &quot;should rather imitate a College than a Court&quot;, or, as Thomas Chaloner wrote in 1607, &quot;His Highness&#x27;s household [...] was intended by the King for a &quot;courtly college&quot; or a &quot;collegiate court&quot;&quot; He passionately engaged in such physical pursuits as hawking, hunting, jousting and fencing, and from a young age studied naval and military affairs and national issues, about which he often disagreed with his father. He also disapproved of the way his father conducted the royal court, disliked Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, a favourite of his father, and esteemed Walter Raleigh, wishing him to be released from the Tower of London.

The prince&#x27;s popularity rose so high that it threatened his father. Relations between the two could be tense, and on occasion surfaced in public. At one point, they were hunting near Royston when James criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase, and initially moved to strike his son with his cane, but Henry rode off. Most of the hunting party then followed the son.

&quot;Upright to the point of priggishness, he fined all who swore in his presence&quot;, according to Charles Carlton, a biographer of Charles I, who describes Henry as an &quot;obdurate Protestant&quot;. In addition to the alms box to which Henry forced swearers to contribute, he made sure his household attended church services. His religious views were influenced by the clerics in his household, who came largely from a tradition of politicised Calvinism. Henry listened humbly, attentively, and regularly to the sermons preached to his household, and once told his chaplain, Richard Milbourne, that he esteemed most the preachers whose attitude suggested, &quot;Sir, you must hear me diligently: you must have a care to observe what I say.&quot;

Henry is said to have disliked his younger brother, Charles, and to have teased him, although this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger child&#x27;s head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.

==Investiture and leadership==

With his father&#x27;s accession to the throne of England in 1603, Henry at once became Duke of Cornwall. In 1610 he was further invested as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thus for the first time uniting the six automatic and two traditional Scottish and English titles held by heirs-apparent to the two thrones. The ceremony of investiture was celebrated with a pageant &quot;London&#x27;s Love to Prince Henry&quot;, and a masque, &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;, during which his mother gave a sword encrusted with diamonds, intended to represent justice.

As a young man, Henry showed great promise and was beginning to be active in leadership matters. Among his activities, he was responsible for the reassignment of Sir Thomas Dale to the Virginia Company of London&#x27;s struggling colony in North America. The city of Henricus in colonial Virginia was named in his honour in 1611; his name also survives in Henrico County, Virginia and Cape Henry. He was the &quot;Supreme Protector&quot; of the Company of Discoverers of the Northwest Passage, and a patron of Robert Harcourt&#x27;s expedition to Guiana.

The Irish Gaelic lord of Inishowen, Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty, had applied to gain a position as a courtier in the household of Henry, to help him in his struggles against officials in Ireland. Unknown to Sir Cahir, on 19 April 1608, the day he launched O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion by burning Derry, his application was approved. Henry took an interest in the Kingdom of Ireland and was known to be supportive of the idea of a reconciliation with the former rebel Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who had fled into exile during the Flight of the Earls. Because of this Tyrone and his entourage mourned when the Prince met his early death.

In 1611, King James gave Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire to Prince Henry. Henry had a banqueting house built of leafy tree branches in the park, in which he held a dinner for his parents and his sister Princess Elizabeth. David Murray paid 110 shillings for transporting musical instruments from London to Woodstock for the event.

===Marriage negotiations===
In between 1610 and 1612, potential brides from across Europe were considered for Henry. In particular, Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici of the House of Medici, and the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in what is now Italy, hoped to arrange a royal marriage between Henry and his sister, Caterina de&#x27; Medici. To this end, Cosimo II sent fifteen small bronze statutes, including one of a trotting horse, as well as Giambologna, a famous sculptor, to the English court in 1611. However, Henry unexpectedly died in 1612, before the marriage negotiations could be finalized. Caterina instead married Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat in 1617.

In May 1612, the Duke of Bouillon came to London as the ambassador of Marie de&#x27; Medici, dowager queen of France, and cousin to Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici through their paternal grandfather, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. According to the Venetian ambassador, Antonio Foscarini, his instructions included a proposal of marriage between Christine of France, the daughter of King Henry IV of France and sister of King Louis XIII of France, and Henry, the Prince of Wales. Anne of Denmark, the queen consort and Henry&#x27;s mother, told one of the Duke&#x27;s senior companions that she would prefer Henry married a French princess without a dowry than a Florentine princess (Caterina de&#x27; Medici) with any amount of gold.

With Henry Frederick&#x27;s death in 1612, Christine of France instead married Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy on 10 February 1619 at the Louvre in Paris, France. Charles, Duke of York, who became the heir apparent to the throne of England and Scotland on his brother&#x27;s death, fulfilled their mother&#x27;s wishes by wedding Henrietta Maria of France in 1625.

==Death==
Henry died from typhoid fever at the age of 18 on 6 November 1612, during the celebrations that led up to the wedding of his sister Elizabeth. (The diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the post-mortem examination, which was ordered to be carried out in order to dispel rumours of poisoning.) His mother, Anne of Denmark, had sent requests to Walter Raleigh in the Tower of London for his special &quot;great cordial&quot;, which failed to effect a cure. It was reported that his last words were to ask for his sister Princess Elizabeth, who was discouraged from visiting him by their parents&#x27; order for fear of contagion.

After Henry&#x27;s death, his brother Charles fell ill but was the chief mourner at the funeral, which King James (who detested funerals) refused to attend. The body lay in state at St. James&#x27;s Palace for four weeks. On 7 December, over a thousand people walked in the mile-long cortège to Westminster Abbey. On top of the coffin there was a wooden effigy of the prince made by Richard Norris, with lifelike features modelled in wax by Abraham van der Doort, clothed in robes of crimson velvet edged with fur. The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, gave a two-hour sermon. As Henry&#x27;s body was lowered into the ground, his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave.

Prince Henry&#x27;s death was widely regarded as a tragedy for the nation. According to Charles Carlton, &quot;Few heirs to the English throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as Prince Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay passed to Charles, who until then had lived in Henry&#x27;s shadow. Four years later, Charles, then 16 years old, was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.

==Literature and music occasioned by the prince&#x27;s death==

===Sermons===
Henry&#x27;s chaplain, Daniel Price, delivered a series of sermons about the young man&#x27;s death. (Price borrowed from John Donne&#x27;s unrelated &quot;The first Anniversary&quot;, published in 1611, and &quot;The second Anniversary&quot;, published in 1612, for some of his language and ideas.):
* &quot;Lamentations for the death of the late illustrious Prince Henry [...] Two Sermons&quot; (1613; see 1613 in literature): &quot;Oh, why is there not a generall thaw throughout all mankinde? why in this debashed Ayre doe not all things expire, seeing Time looks upon us with watry eues, disheveld lockes, and heavie dismall lookes; now that the Sunne is gone out of our Firmament, the ioy, the beautie, the glory of Israel is departed?&quot;
* &quot;Spirituall Odours to the Memory of Prince Henry. In Four of the Last Sermons Preached in St James after his Highnesse Death&quot; (Oxford, 1613; see 1613 in literature) From &quot;Meditations of Consolation in our Lamentations&quot;: &quot;[...] his body was so faire and strong that a soule might have been pleased to live an age in it [...] vertue and valor, beauty and chastity, armes and arts, met and kist in him, and his goodnesse lent so much mintage to other Princes, that if Xenophon were now to describe a Prince, Prince HENRY had been his Patterne. [...] He hath gon his Passover from death to life, where there is more grace and more capacity [...] where earthly bodies shalbe more celestiall, then man in his Innocency or Angels in their glory, for they could fall: Hee is there with those Patriarchs that have expected Christ on earth, longer than they have enjoyed him in heaven; He is with those holy Penmen of the holy spirit, they bee now his paterns, who were here his teachers [...]&quot;
* &quot;Teares Shed over Abner. The Sermon Preached on the Sunday before the Prince his funerall in St James Chappell before the body&quot; (Oxford, (1613; see 1613 in literature): &quot;He, He is dead, who while he lived, was a perpetuall Paradise, every season that he shewd himselfe in a perpetuall spring, eavery exercise wherein he was scene a special felicity: He, He is dead before us [...] He, He is dead; that blessed Model of heaven his face is covered till the latter day, whose shining lamps his eyes in whose light there was life to the beholders, they bee ecclipsed until the sunne give over shining. [...] He, He is dead, and now yee see this [...]&quot;

===Prose memorials===

Price also wrote two prose &quot;Anniversaries&quot; on the death:
* &quot;Prince Henry His First Anniversary&quot; (Oxford, 1613; see 1613 in literature): &quot;in HIM, a glimmering light of the Golden times appeare, all lines of expectation met in this Center, all spirits of vertue, scattered into others were extracted into him [...]&quot;
* Another &quot;Anniversary&quot;, published in 1614

===Verses===
Within a few months of the prince&#x27;s death, at least 32 poets had versified on it. In addition to those listed below, the writers included Sir Walter Raleigh (a friend), John Donne, Edward Herbert, Thomas Heywood and Henry King.

These poems were published in 1612 (see 1612 in poetry):
* Sir William Alexander, &quot;An Elegie on the Death of Prince Henrie&quot;
* Joshua Sylvester, &quot;Lachrimae Lachrimarum; or, The Distillation of Teares Shede for the Untimely Death of the Incomparable Prince Panaretus&quot;, also includes poems in English, French, Latin and Italian by Walter Quin
* George Wither, &quot;Prince Henries Obsequies; or, Mournefull Elegies Upon his Death&quot;

These poems and songs were published in 1613 (see 1613 in poetry):
* Thomas Campion, &quot;Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry&quot;, verse and music; music by Giovanni Coperario (or &quot;Copario&quot;), said to have been John Cooper, an Englishman
* George Chapman, &quot;An Epicede or Funerall Song, On the Most Disastrous Death, of the Highborne Prince of Men, Henry Prince of Wales, &amp;c.&quot;, the work states &quot;1612&quot; but was published in 1613
* John Davies, &quot;The Muses-Teares for the Losse of their Hope&quot;
* William Drummond of Hawthornden, &quot;Tears on the Death of Moeliades&quot;
* Mary Oxley, or Oxlie, a Scottish poet living in Morpeth, wrote a response to William Drummond of Hawthornden&#x27;s &quot;Moeliades&quot;, which was published in 1656.

===Music===
In addition to the above verse-setting by Coperario, both Thomas Tomkins and Thomas Weelkes composed settings of &quot;When David heard&quot;, a Biblical passage in which King David laments the loss of his son Absalom in battle; it is thought that both settings were directly inspired by the death of the prince.

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography refers to a mourning song in memory of Prince Henry by John Ward remaining unpublished during the composer&#x27;s lifetime; however, a &quot;newly composed&quot; song on the same subject was included in his &quot;First Set&quot; of Madrigals (1613).

==Honours and arms==
===Honours===
* KG: Knight of the Garter, &quot;14 June 1603&quot;

===Arms===
Henry Frederick as Prince of Wales bore the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label of three points argent&quot;.

<text>Astro Boy, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka. It was serialized in Kobunsha&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen&quot; from 1952 to 1968. The 112 chapters were collected into 23 volumes by Akita Shoten. Dark Horse Comics published an English translation in 2002. The story follows Astro Boy, an android young boy with human emotions who is created by Umataro Tenma after the recent death of his son Tobio. Eventually, Astro is sold to a robot circus run by Hamegg, but is saved from his servitude by Professor Ochanomizu. Astro becomes a surrogate son to Ochanomizu who creates a robotic family for Astro and helps him to live a normal life like an average human boy, while accompanying him on his adventures.

&quot;Astro Boy&quot; has been adapted into three anime series produced respectively by the first incarnation of Mushi Production and its direct successor Tezuka Productions, with a fourth in development. The manga was originally produced for TV as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the first popular animated Japanese television series that embodied the aesthetic that later became familiar worldwide as &quot;anime&quot;. After enjoying success abroad, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was remade in the 1980s as &quot;New Mighty Atom&quot;, known as &quot;Astroboy&quot; in other countries, and again in 2003. In November 2007, he was named Japan&#x27;s envoy for overseas safety. An American animated film based on the original manga series by Tezuka was released on October 23, 2009. In March 2015, a trailer was released announcing a new animated series. The success of the manga and anime series led it to becoming a major media franchise consisting of films including a major motion picture, a number of soundtracks and a library of video games. The series was also among the first to embrace mass merchandise including action figures, collectible figurines, food products, clothing, stamps and trading cards. By 2004, the franchise had generated in merchandise sales.

Astro Boy is one of the most successful manga and anime franchises in the world and has become Tezuka&#x27;s most famous creation. The combined 23 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes have sold over 100 million copies worldwide, making it Tezuka&#x27;s best-selling manga and one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The 1963 anime series became a hit on television in Japan and the United States. &quot;Astro Boy&quot; has been praised for its importance in developing the anime and manga industry. It has been featured on numerous greatest anime of all time lists and has inspired many other influential authors in the creation of manga.

==Plot==
&quot;Astro Boy&quot; is a science fiction series set in a futuristic world where robots co-exist with humans. Its focus is on the adventures of the titular &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (sometimes called simply &quot;Astro&quot;): a powerful android created by the head of the Ministry of Science, Doctor Tenma (known as Dr. Astor Boynton II in the 1960s English dub; Dr. Boynton in the 1980s English dub). Dr. Tenma created Astro to replace his son Tobio (&#x27;Astor&#x27; in the 1960s English dub; &#x27;Toby&#x27; in the 1980s English dub and the 2009 film), who was killed in a car accident (in the 2003 anime, Tobio is shown as having run away from home before the accident, while in the 2009 film, Toby&#x27;s death was caused by an incident with the Peacekeeper, a weaponized robot). Dr. Tenma built and adopted Astro in Tobio&#x27;s memory and treated Astro as lovingly as if he was the real Tobio. However, Dr. Tenma soon realized that the little android could not fill the void of his lost son, especially given that Astro could not grow older or express human aesthetics (in one set of panels in the manga, Astro is shown preferring the mechanical shapes of cubes over the organic shapes of flowers). In the original 1960 edition, Tenma rejected Astro and sold him to a cruel circus owner, Hamegg (the Great Cacciatore in the 1960s English dub). In the 1980 edition, Hamegg kidnapped Astro while Tenma was trying to find him. In the 2009 film, Tenma rejected Astro simply because he could not stop thinking about Toby, but later during the film (and unlike in either the manga or the three anime cartoons), Tenma realized that Astro made credit to replace Tobio; as a result, Tenma decided that he would readopt Astro. None of these events about Astro being rejected (completely or temporarily) or kidnapped in both the 1960 and 1980 cartoons as well as in the 2009 film happened in the 2003 cartoon as Astro&#x27;s birth was given by Professor Ochanomizu (Dr. Elefun in the 1960 and 1980 cartoons, as well as in the 2009 film; Dr. O&#x27;Shay in the 2003 cartoon).

After some time, Professor Ochanomizu, the new head of the Ministry of Science (co-head of the Ministry of Science in the 2009 film), notices Astro Boy performing in the circus and convinces Hamegg to turn Astro over to him. (In a retcon the story becomes far more violent and complicated). He then takes Astro in as his own and treats him gently and warmly, becoming his legal guardian. He soon realizes that Astro has superior powers and skills, as well as the ability to experience human emotions.

Astro then is shown fighting crime, evil, and injustice using his seven powers: 100K horsepower strength, jet flight, high intensity lights in his eyes, adjustable hearing, instant language translation, a retractable machine gun in his hips, and a high IQ capable of determining if a person is good or evil. Most of his enemies are robot-hating humans, robots gone berserk, or alien invaders. Almost every story includes a battle involving Astro and other robots. In one manga episode, Astro takes on the US Air Force, and stops it from bombing some innocent Vietnamese villagers (this was a time-travel episode, in which Astro went back from the 21st century to 1969).

==Production==
The &quot;Astro Boy&quot; series consists of several storylines. Atom (known as Astro Boy or just Astro in English) originally appeared as a supporting character in the Tezuka comic &quot;Atom Taishi&quot; (&quot;Ambassador Atom&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Captain Atom&quot;), which appeared in &quot;Shonen&quot;, a monthly magazine for boys, in April 1951. Tezuka then created a comic series in which Astro was the main character. According to Schodt, Tezuka created Astro to be a &quot;21st-century reverse-Pinocchio, a nearly perfect robot who strove to become more human and emotive and to serve as an interface between man and machine.&quot; As Tezuka&#x27;s art style advanced, Astro Boy &quot;became more modern and cute&quot; to appeal to his audience of boys in elementary school. Schodt added that the page layouts used in &quot;Astro Boy&quot; episodes &quot;became more creative.&quot; When designing supporting characters, Tezuka sometimes created characters that were homages to Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse and Disney Princesses, Max Fleischer, the creator of Superman, and other American animators. In several of the &quot;Astro Boy&quot; stories, the first few pages were in color. Tezuka had a &quot;Star System&quot; of characters where characters from his other works played various roles in &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. Similarly, several characters in &quot;Astro Boy&quot; appear in his other works. Tezuka developed &quot;a type of dialog with his readers&quot; since he developed so many stories during his lifetime. Tezuka also had a habit of introducing nonsensical characters at random moments in order to lighten a scene which was becoming too serious; he sometimes felt trapped by the need to satisfy his young male audience&#x27;s desire to see battling robots.

&quot;Astro Boy&quot; was described by Schodt as an &quot;analog,&quot; a world where man and advanced technology coexist. As a result, the plots of the &quot;Astro Boy&quot; stories often involve issues that stem from this idea. When &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was created in the 1950s and 1960s, Japan did not have the reputation for science and technology that it had gained by 2002. This made the &quot;analog&quot; nature of &quot;Astro Boy &quot;unique.

The novels were originally published by Akita Shoten; 23 volumes of paper backs were printed. The stories do not appear in order by publication date, but in the order that Tezuka and the collection editors considered most appropriate. The collection begins with &quot;The Birth of Astro Boy&quot;, an episode that Tezuka wrote in 1975 to make the collection of stories easier to understand. The first &quot;Astro Boy&quot; story ever written, first published in April 1951, is in volume 15. In addition, Tezuka often re-drew chapters that he had created earlier. Schodt explains that this is the reason some may appear &quot;more modern&quot; than others. For many of his older stories, Tezuka added introductory pages where he himself was portrayed as the narrator. The color pages were reprinted in black and white for the inexpensive paperback versions.

===English-language version===
The English-language version of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; is an adaptation of the Akita Shoten published works by Osamu Tezuka. The artwork was flipped from the original Japanese version so the books could be read from left to right. Frederik L. Schodt translated the English-language version of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and for most of the characters, he used the original Japanese names. Schodt believed that it was necessary to retain the Japanese names wherever possible, as the story was set in Japan. Schodt translated the nickname &quot;Higeoyaji&quot; to &quot;Mr. Mustachio&quot;, and decided to use Astro Boy&#x27;s English name. He explained that &quot;Astro&quot; is close to the Japanese name &quot;Atom&quot;, an English word. In addition, Schodt believed that using &quot;Atom&quot; in an American edition of the story would be &quot;going too much against the history&quot;. Occasionally, names of Japanese characters had double meanings that were impossible to convey in the English-language translation. Schodt decided that keeping the sound of the names was important, especially when the names were famous. In those cases, Schodt tried to use the double meaning elsewhere in the translation. When dealing with minor foreign characters with humorous-sounding names, Schodt used equivalent English puns wherever it was possible.

The editors of the English-language &quot;Astro Boy&quot; book did not remove content that could be perceived to be racially insensitive. They explained that in some cases people may be portrayed differently from how they actually were in 2002 (the year of publication of the English version). The editors said that some readers may feel that the portrayals contribute to racial discrimination and, while that was not Tezuka&#x27;s intent, the issue needed to be explained as some readers may feel offended or insulted by the depictions. They felt that it would be inappropriate to revise the works, because Tezuka had died and there was no way to reverse what he created, and revising his works would violate his right as a creator. They also expressed the belief that editing or stopping publication of the work would &quot;do little&quot; to end racial and ethnic discrimination throughout the world.

==Media==
===Manga===
The manga was originally published from 1952 to 1968, followed by a newspaper serialization (1967–1969) and two further series in 1972–1973 and 1980–1981.

The original &quot;Mighty Atom&quot; manga stories were later published in English-language versions by Dark Horse Comics in a translation by Frederik L. Schodt. They followed the television series by keeping the character name as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the name most familiar to English-speaking audiences, instead of &quot;Mighty Atom.&quot; Names of the other characters, such as Doctor Tenma and Professor Ochanomizu, are those of the original Japanese.

Astro Boy (along with some of his supporting characters) appear in a series of &quot;edu-manga&quot; that tell biographies of famous personalities such as Helen Keller, Albert Einstein and Mother Teresa. Astro Boy and his &quot;sister&quot; appear in prologues and epilogues for each story and learn about the famous person from Dr. Ochanomizu, who acts as narrator for each installment. These manga were published by Kodansha, Ltd. from 2000 to 2002 with English-language versions published by Digital Manga Publishing and seeing print from 2003 to 2005.

From 2003 to 2009, Naoki Urasawa wrote the series &quot;Pluto&quot;, with help from Takashi Nagasaki. It adapts &quot;Astro Boy&quot;&#x27;s arc (which story Urasawa says &quot;has been enshrined as a centerpiece in the literature of our generation&quot;) into a murder mystery. In a 2004 manga of &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot; written by Akira Himekawa, the plot, as well as the character designs, loosely followed that of the 2003 anime series. The artwork is quite different from Tezuka&#x27;s original. This version of the manga was published in English by Chuang Yi and distributed in Australia by Madman Entertainment.

A prequel, &quot;&quot; began serialization in 2014. It later received an anime adaptation in 2017.

====Unlicensed comics====
In 1965, Gold Key published a one-shot comic book, licensed by NBC Enterprises, based on the U.S. version of the &quot;Astro Boy&quot; TV show. This was done without any input from Osamu Tezuka, who considered the book an unauthorized or &quot;pirate&quot; edition and denounced the publication as &quot;horribly drawn&quot;.

Astro Boy also appears in the premium giveaway series, &quot;March of Comics&quot; (# 285) also published by Gold Key in 1966.

Editorial Mo.Pa.Sa., an Argentine company, published the comic book &quot;Las Fantásticas Aventuras de Astroboy&quot; in the 1970s.

In 1987, the Chicago-based comics publisher NOW Comics issued their own version of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, with art done by Canadian artist Ken Steacy, and again done without Osamu Tezuka giving input. The series was cancelled in mid-1988.

===Anime===

====1963 series====

The &quot;Astro Boy&quot; animated television series premiered on Fuji TV on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1963, and is the first popular animated Japanese television series that embodied the aesthetic that later became familiar worldwide as anime. It lasted for four seasons, with a total of 193 episodes, the final episode presented on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1966. At its height it was watched by 40% of the Japanese population who had access to a TV. Only the first two years (a total of 104 episodes) were dubbed in English and shown in the US. (The other 89 episodes were never made available in English.)

====1980 series====

A full-colour, second remake of the original stories was produced by Tezuka Productions. The series premiered on NTV, October 1, 1980. At total of 52 episodes were produced and aired. The series was directed by Ishiguro Noboru. The series was released on a 7 disc compilation set by Manga Entertainment on November 22, 2005. A further &quot;Greatest Astro Boy Adventures&quot; DVD was released on July 18, 2006.

====2003 series====

A third series of fifty episodes was produced by Tezuka Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan, Dentsu, and Fuji Television network. It was created to celebrate the birth date of Astro Boy, and was first broadcast in Japan on the same date as Astro&#x27;s birth in the manga (April 7, 2003) across Animax and Fuji Television. It was directed by Kazuya Konaka and written by Chiaki J. Konaka, with additional writers including Keiichi Hasegawa, Sadayuki Murai, Ai Ohta, Hirotoshi Kobayashi, Kenji Konuta, and Marc Handler.

====International co-productions====
At the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, Tezuka Productions revealed that they were in early negotiations to create local adaptations of Astro Boy with international companies. The furthest along was a partnership with Nigeria&#x27;s Channels TV, with whom Tezuka was looking to &quot;re-version&quot; the brand with. The project surfaced the following year as the preschool-oriented &quot;Little Astro Boy&quot;.

During the 2014 Annecy Festival, Tezuka Productions confirmed it was developing more shows. The first, &quot;Astro Boy Reboot&quot; would be a co-production with France&#x27;s Caribara Productions and Monaco&#x27;s Shibuya Productions. Additionally, it was confirmed that more &quot;Little Astro Boy&quot; was on the way. In 2022, it was announced that Thomas Astruc, creator of &quot;&quot;, would be developing the series along with Method Animation. The series will be 3D, as opposed to 2D as initially planned.

The new &quot;Little Astro Boy&quot; would later be revealed in 2016 as an entirely separate production with France&#x27;s Planet Nemo. The series was later named to &quot;Go Astro Boy Go!&quot; before debuting in 2019.

===Films===

In 1962, MBS released a live-action movie, a compilation film made up of episodes from the 1959–60 live-action TV series that came before the 1960s animated television series and, which loosely followed the manga. The opening sequence (approximately one minute) is animated, and the rest is live action. The movie was of 75 minute in duration.

Tezuka met Walt Disney at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, at which time Disney said he hoped to &quot;make something just like&quot; Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. A Japanese IMAX featurette was made in 2005, based on the 2003–2004 anime, titled &quot;Astro Boy vs IGZA&quot;, but has only been shown in Japan.

An animated movie version was released in October 2009 from Imagi Animation Studios. The English version features the voices of Freddie Highmore as Astro Boy and Nicolas Cage as Dr. Tenma. IDW Publishing released a comic book adaptation of the movie to coincide with the film&#x27;s release in October 2009; both as a four-part mini-series and as a graphic novel.

A live-action &quot;Astro Boy&quot; movie was announced in 2015, to be produced by animation studio Animal Logic in collaboration with Tezuka Productions and Ranger 7 Films. &quot;San Andreas&quot; writers Jeremy Passmore and Andre Fabrizio were confirmed to be part of the writing team in 2016.

===Video games===
Home Data developed and Konami published their &quot;Mighty Atom&quot; video game for the Nintendo Famicom in 1988. It is known for its extreme difficulty level attributed to a one-hit death rule.

Banpresto published the Zamuse-developed release of their &quot;Mighty Atom&quot; for the Super Famicom system in 1994. Like the Konami game, this title follows events in the manga series.

Sega published a pair of games based on Astro Boy. &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; for the Game Boy Advance drew from various elements from the series, while &quot;Astro Boy&quot; for the PlayStation 2 was loosely based on the 2003 anime with a slightly darker plot.

&quot;Astro Boy: The Video Game&quot; is a video game based on the Astro Boy animated feature film from Imagi Animation Studios. It was originally released on October 8, 2009, from D3Publisher for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii and DS, and Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It features the voices of Freddie Highmore and Kristen Bell.

Mobile game publisher Animoca developed a series of six &quot;Astro Boy&quot; themed titles for iOS and Android devices between 2013 and 2016: the endless runner &quot;Astro Boy Dash&quot;, the musical edutainment application &quot;Astro Boy Piano&quot;, the shooter &quot;Astro Boy Flight&quot;, the strategy defense &quot;Astro Boy Siege: Alien Attack&quot;, the puzzle game crossover &quot;Tezuka World: Astro Crunch&quot;, and a second endless runner called &quot;Astro Boy Zap&quot;.

In 2016, Active Gaming Media launched a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Astro Boy: Edge of Time&quot;, a digital card game featuring drawings by a number of well known artists. While the campaign failed to reach its $50,000 goal, it was eventually released as a free-to-play title in Japan on DMM.com and on Steam internationally in April and June 2017. The game was shut down on March 29, 2018.

The character has also shown up in video game crossovers alongside Tezuka&#x27;s other works, including the 2012 Android and iOS mobile game &quot;Great Battle! Tezuka All Stars&quot;. Astro Boy also appears as a playable character in the crossover puzzle game &quot;Crystal Crisis&quot;, released by Nicalis in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. &quot;Eshigami no Kizuna&quot;, a Compile Heart video game that re-imagines Tezuka characters as , is scheduled to be released on mobile platforms in 2019.

==Reception and legacy==
The manga has sold approximately 100 million copies.

&quot;Astro Boy&quot; is considered one of the greatest manga and anime series of all time. In a 2006 &#x27;experts&#x27; ranking for &#x27;Greatest Manga of All Time&#x27; held by the Japan Media Arts Festival for their 10th anniversary, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; ranked 6th, the 3rd highest Tezuka manga on the list after &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Black Jack&quot;. In addition, the 1963 anime adaptation ranked 2nd in the &#x27;Greatest Anime of All Time&#x27; list.

In a 2009 poll held by Asahi Shimbun for &#x27;Greatest Shōwa Manga&#x27;, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; ranked 5th, the highest ranked Tezuka manga on the list.

&quot;Astro Boy&quot; became Tezuka&#x27;s most famous work. Frederik L. Schodt, the translator of the English-language version of the manga, said it had &quot;extraordinary longevity and appeal across cultures.&quot; Schodt said that many of the stories are &quot;sometimes&quot; of &quot;uneven quality.&quot; Schodt said that as the time becomes closer to &quot;a true age of robots,&quot; &quot;Astro Boy&quot; assumes more meaning. Jeff Yang of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, in discussing Schodt&#x27;s &quot;The Astro Boy Essays&quot;, said &quot;while kids came for Astro&#x27;s atomic action – just about every installment included Astro harrowing a fellow robot who&#x27;d fallen from digital grace with his fission-powered fists – they stayed for the textured, surprisingly complex stories.&quot;

Astro ranked 43rd on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters.

The 1960s anime was named the 86th best animated series by IGN, calling it the first popular anime television series.

The 1980s anime was extremely popular in Australia, Canada, and many parts of Asia, with two different English dubs. The dub shown in Australia (and to a lesser extent in the USA) was coordinated by Tezuka Productions and NTV and produced in the USA. Another dub was produced in Canada solely for broadcast there.

While the 2003 anime did poorly in North America, having received poor distribution and having been heavily edited, including the removal of its orchestrated soundtrack and much of Astro&#x27;s childlike innocence, it was better received in the UK on the BBC, where it ran for almost three years, as well as other parts of the world such as Dubai based MBC 3.

On April 7, 2003 (one day after the premiere of the 2003 anime in Japan), the city of Niiza, Saitama registered the Astro Boy character as a resident to coincide with his birthdate in the manga. That same day, the JR Yamanote Line platform at JR Takadanobaba Station started using the theme music from the TV series to signal the departure of a train. Also, many lamp posts in the area carry pictures from the TV series, and two large murals depicting Tezuka&#x27;s works are across the street of JR Takadanobaba station. Later in 2004, the theme music from the TV series would eventually be used to signal the departure of a train at JR Niiza Station on the JR Musashino Line.

<text>The Twilight Club was a dinner club in New York City that operated from 1883 until 1904. It was founded by Charles F. Wingate &quot;to cultivate good fellowship and enjoy rational recreation.&quot;

== Formation ==

On January 4, 1883, the Twilight Club was founded by Charles Frederick Wingate during &quot;a gathering at Mouquin&#x27;s restaurant of a number of congenial friends...&quot; Meetings consisted of dinner or discussions both humorous and serious on disputable topics of the day. Some recorded topics were fishing, rearing of children, and the value of a college education. Sometimes the questions would be hypotheticals such as, &quot;what would you do if you were King of Manhattan Island?&quot;, or &quot;who is the most remarkable man on earth?&quot;

The inspiration for the club came from a dinner at Delmonico&#x27;s held to honor sociologist Herbert Spencer on November 9, 1882, prior to his departure from the United States. Herbert Spencer made a speech on this occasion in which he said, &quot;We have had somewhat too much of the Gospel of Work; it is time to preach the Gospel of Relaxation.&quot; This motto engendered the formation of the Twilight Club. Herbert Spencer did not participate in the club. However, Charles Wingate offered him an honorary membership, which, upon acceptance, he offered this advice to the club, &quot;I would, however, remark that the reports of your proceedings seem to imply rather more gravity of speech in your conversations than is altogether consistent with the &#x27;expectation of relaxation.&#x27;&quot; The official motto of the club was, &quot;To cultivate good fellowship and enjoy rational recreation.&quot;

== Membership, principles, and officers ==

By 1884, the Twilight Club was heralded as a hot spot for the “who’s who” of Manhattan. “Among all the clubs in New York, of which prominent men are members, few are better known than the Twilight club, and, at the same time, few are more worthy of note…&quot; trumpeted a local publication. 

Rather than formal “Rules,” the Twilight Club had a list of “Principles”:

Principles
*No dues
*No debts
*No by-laws
*No president
*No constitution
*No salaries
*No initiation fee
*No full dress
*No mutual admiration
*No defalcations
*No decamping treasurer
*No watered stock
*No parliamentary rules
*No previous questions
*No lengthy speeches
*No late hours
*No profanity
*No &#x27;fish stories&#x27;
*No &#x27;sailors&#x27; yarns&#x27;
*No dueling
*No free dinners
*No scandal
*No bribery
*No personalities
*No party politics
*No preaching
*No gambling
*No dynamite
*No &#x27;bouncer&#x27;

*No &#x27;papers&#x27;
*No &#x27;dudes&#x27;
*No puns
*No gush
*No cant
*No red tape
*No formality
*No humbug

Additions and amendments were accepted, but they were required to be submitted in writing, along with a deposit of $17.34 (as a guarantee of good faith) two years before being voted on.

There was an executive committee. However, the only officer was Charles F. Wingate, who acted as &quot;secretary, treasurer, committee of admission, and head and doer of what ever was to be done.&quot; Wingate kept a complete list of members, which was published in a contemporaneous biography of the club and corroborated in multiple newspaper articles at the time.

While the Club defined its members as &quot;club-able fellows with $1,” specific evenings were designated as &quot;ladies&#x27; nights,” where women were invited to attend the dinners and to actively engage in the discussions. 

In January 1887, after three years in operation, the Club raised its annual membership dues from $1 to $2 per year and later to $3 per year. 

While “full dress was absolutely prohibited,” some guests would nonetheless dress to impress, arriving in full dinner dress. 

==Dinners ==

Dinner began promptly at 6 and ran until 8 followed by two and a half hours of intellectual discussion. Speeches were limited to 5 minutes &quot;with the express understanding that each orator will speak his inmost thoughts without hesitation or reserve, and with the perfect assurance of the esteem and good-will of all his listeners.&quot; During its most active period, the club met every two weeks, eight months of the year. It was called the Twilight Club because the meetings happened much earlier than other clubs in the city. Meetings could be over before other similar clubs had begun dinner. The low cost, sometimes just the cost of dinner, the early hours and the casual nature of the discussions were unique factors that led to the club&#x27;s popularity among its members.

The St. Denis Hotel (also referred to as the Hotel St. Denis) became the most common location for gatherings. There was no permanent master of ceremonies. For each dinner, the secretary Charles F. Wingate would appoint one member to be the president for the night. Wingate would inform the temporary president of the program for the evening and coach him in conducting the discussion. The dining party consisted of a mixture of paid members, their guests, and invited experts who were brought in to give their testimony and opinions in reference to the topic of discussion for that evening.

The following is a catalogue of noted gatherings (dates, location, topics, attendees and guest speakers):

*April 1884, D&#x27;orville&#x27;s restaurant in the Mills Building. &quot;How did you make your first dollar? &amp; Fish and Fishing.&quot; The dinner was on the 9th floor requiring attendees to climb 215 stairs.
*March 1885, D&#x27;Orville&#x27;s restaurant, &quot;How Should Girls be Trained?&quot;. Ideas proposed included allowing girls to play football and abandoning corsets. This meeting, described as 60-odd members, was lampooned in the New York Times saying, &quot;A more reckless display of mingled ignorance and presumption has never been made by any club in this city or elsewhere.&quot;
*January 1887, &quot;Where shall we go to church in 1987?&quot;.
*January 1888, &quot;What Would you do if you were King of Manhattan Island?&quot; 300 men and women diners in attendance.
*June 1890, &quot;Is it worth while to go to College?&quot;, 80 gentlemen attended.
*December 1892, &quot;What shall we do with our slums!&quot;.
*January 1893, St. Denis Hotel, &quot;The American Drama&quot;, 100 ladies with their escorts attended.

== Demise ==
Club meetings ended in the early 1900s with the last reported meeting in 1904. In 1910, Joel Benton recounts that, &quot;The Club has held no gatherings of late years, on account of its founder&#x27;s now fatally terminated illness&quot; and &quot;The Club, beginning in 1883, suspended 5 or 6 years ago.&quot; Waters said, &quot;But alas! Wingate is absent, and there is no one to replace him.&quot; When Charles Wingate Died in 1909, he was noted as the founder of the Twilight Club, and its factotum. The club lasted over twenty years and hosted hundreds of dinners with guests numbering from dozens to several hundred. The last public meeting of the Twilight Club was May 19, 1918. By a unanimous vote at the annual meeting in September, the Twilight Club officially became the Society of Arts and Sciences.

=== Manhattan Athletic Club ===

In 1893, the Manhattan Athletic Club went into receivership. Charles Wingate and a consortium of Twilight Club Members raised $500,000 to purchase the building as a permanent home for the club. They also intended to rent the club to other similar social clubs that could benefit from such a meeting place. While dues had been raised from $1 to $2, at the time of the athletic club purchase, Wingate mentions the initiation fee of $100 and dues of $15, which is contrasted with the dues of $30 for a similar club in London. At the time the club reported 800 members, although attendance at dinners was reported as between 50 and 200, depending on the event. The Twilight Club hoped to increase membership to 1,500 with this purchase. However, no record of a purchase or such club operations was recorded. The only noted use in this time period was for conducting boxing matches. The Twilight Club continued to have dinners mainly at the St. Denis Hotel following discussions of this purchase.

=== Twilight Park ===

Twilight Park in the Catskill region of New York state was founded by Charles F. Wingate. Besides the name and a handful of Twilight Club members purchasing property there, it had no connection to the Twilight Club and its operations.

<text>Major Ronald Ivor Ferguson, OStJ (10 October 1931 – 16 March 2003) was a polo manager, initially to the Duke of Edinburgh and later, for many years, to then Charles, Prince of Wales. His daughter, Sarah, Duchess of York, is the former wife of the Duke of York. He was the maternal grandfather of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ferguson was the son of Colonel Andrew Henry Ferguson (1899–1966) and his wife Marian Montagu Douglas Scott (1908–1996), a first cousin of Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott, who became (after her wedding to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester) Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester and an aunt-by-marriage of Queen Elizabeth II. 

His maternal grandfather was Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Herbert Montagu Douglas Scott, the fourth son of William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch, a direct descendant of Charles II of England, and Lady Louisa Jane Hamilton. 

His great-grandfather (through his paternal grandmother) was Henry Brand, 2nd Viscount Hampden. 

Ferguson&#x27;s elder brother, John Ferguson, died at 10 years of age from peritonitis.

He was born in London and grew up at Dummer Down Farm, his later home in adulthood, at Dummer, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. He attended Ludgrove School followed by Eton College and Sandhurst.

===Career===
He entered the Life Guards in February 1952, the regiment of which his father had previously been Colonel. In 1954 Ferguson was promoted to Lieutenant and Captain in 1958. Ferguson retired in 1968 and was &quot;granted the honorary rank of Major&quot;. During his career he served with the regiment in Germany, Egypt, Aden, and Cyprus. In 1987, he was entered as an officer (brother) in the Venerable Order of Saint John.

===Polo===
After he retired, he devoted himself to polo. His interest in polo frequently brought him into contact with the Royal Family, and it was through this connection that his daughter, Sarah, met Prince Andrew.

In 1979, on the England II team alongside Alan Kent, Patrick Churchward and Charles, Prince of Wales, he won the Silver Jubilee Cup.

In 1988, while his daughter Sarah was married to Prince Andrew, the &quot;News of the World&quot; printed a story about Ferguson&#x27;s membership of the Wigmore Club, &quot;a health club and massage parlour in London staffed by girls who, dressed in starched white &#x27;medical&#x27; gowns, allegedly offered à la carte sexual services to members.&quot; He maintained that he had used the club &quot;for massage only... and by that I mean a totally straight one&quot; and as &quot;a kind of cocoon where I could shut myself away for an hour and think&quot;. The controversy did not affect his marriage; however, it allegedly led him to leave his post as the Prince of Wales&#x27; polo manager and his position at the Guards Polo Club.

He was reinstated with the Guards Polo Club shortly before he died.

===Personal life===
Ferguson&#x27;s first wife was Susan Wright. They married in St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 17 January 1956. They had two daughters:
* Jane Louisa Ferguson (b. 26 August 1957) married William Makim in July 1976. They had two children before divorcing in 1991. She married Rainer Hans Luedecke on 1 January 1994. They have one daughter. 
** Seamus Makim (b. 1981) married Silvia Zeltenhammer. They have two sons:
*** Vincent Makim
*** Quintin Makim
** Ayesha Makim (b. 1986) married Sacha Specker in May 2015. They have one daughter:
*** Poppy Jane Specker (b. 19 February 2020)
** Heidi Olivia Luedecke (b. 19 June 1996)
* Sarah Margaret Ferguson (b. 15 October 1959), later the Duchess of York; married Prince Andrew, Duke of York in 1986 and divorced in 1996. They have two daughters:
** Princess Beatrice (b. 8 August 1988)
** Princess Eugenie  (b. 23 March 1990)

The couple divorced in 1974. During their marriage, the Fergusons were recognised society figures. The Major retired from his army career, and his family moved to Dummer Down Farm which he inherited upon his father&#x27;s death.

In 1976, Ferguson married for the second time, to Susan Rosemary Deptford (b. 1946). They had three children:
* Andrew Frederick John Ferguson (b. 1978); married Florence Jane C. Hill on 15 June 2019
* Alice Victoria Ferguson (b. 1980) married Nicholas Stileman on 28 August 2010. They have one daughter:
** Amara Eliza Stileman (b. 10 April 2012)
* Elizabeth Charlotte &quot;Eliza&quot; Ferguson (b. 1985); married Harry Cobb on 2 September 2017.

Ferguson&#x27;s widow Susan remarried in Dummer in 2012, to Lt-Gen Sir Richard Swinburn, who was made Commander UK Field Army in 1994. Prince Andrew, Sarah, Duchess of York and their two daughters attended Sir Richard and Lady Swinburn&#x27;s wedding celebrations. Sir Richard died in October 2017.

His rare media appearances were to defend his daughter Sarah and raise awareness of prostate cancer. He had cancer during the last decade of his life. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1996, and also had skin cancer. He suffered a heart attack in November 2002. In March 2003, at age 71, he died of a heart attack at the Hampshire Clinic, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England.

<text>Kimba the White Lion, known in Japan as , is a Japanese &quot;shōnen&quot; manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka which was serialized in the &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot; magazine from November 1950 to April 1954. An anime based on the manga was created by Mushi Production and was broadcast on Fuji Television from 1965 to 1967. It was the first color animated television series created in Japan. It began airing in North America from 1966. The later series was produced by Tezuka Productions.

A TV special premiered September 5, 2009, on Fuji TV. Produced in commemoration of Fuji TV&#x27;s 50th anniversary, it was directed by Gorō Taniguchi, written by novelist and drama writer Osamu Suzuki, and featuring character designs from illustrator Yoshitaka Amano.

==Plot==
In Africa during the mid-20th century, as mankind encroaches, the white lion Panja (パンジャ, Caesar in the English dub) gives the jungle&#x27;s wild animals a . However, he angers nearby villagers by stealing their cattle and their food to feed the jungle carnivores (in the English dub he merely frees the cattle). A professional hunter, Ham Egg (Viper Snakely in the English dub), is called in to stop these raids. He avoids directly attacking Panja. Instead, he records the sounds of Panja and uses them to trap his pregnant mate, Eliza (エライザ), who then becomes bait in a trap for Panja. Panja is killed for his hide (but not before asking Eliza to name their child Kimba) and Eliza is put on a ship, destined for a zoo.

Kimba (レオ, &quot;Leo&quot; in Japanese) is born on the ship. Eliza teaches him his father&#x27;s ideals. As a huge tropical storm nears, she urges her cub out through the bars of her cage. The storm wrecks the ship, and Kimba starts to drown in the ocean. The fish help him learn to swim. As he begins to despair, the stars in the sky form the face of his mother, who encourages him. Guided by butterflies, he makes it to land.

Kimba lands far from his ancestral home and is found and cared for by humans. He learns the advantages of human culture and decides that when he returns to his wild home, he will bring culture to the jungle and stand for peace like his father.
The show follows Kimba&#x27;s life after he returns to the wild, still a young cub, and how he learns and grows in the next year. Kimba soon learns that only communication and mutual understanding between animals and humans will bring true peace.

==Media==

===Other media===
The music video for the song &quot;A Boy&quot; by Leo Ieiri, which has an animated part made by Tezuka Productions, features an anime version of the singer (based on Kimba and modeled after the singer) which meets other characters from the &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; series.

Jungle Emperor (ジャングル大帝 Jungle Taitei) is a cancelled 1990 eight-bit platform action game that was in development by Taito for the Nintendo Entertainment System, based on the popular manga/anime of the same name (aka Kimba the White Lion) by Osamu Tezuka. Not much is known about this game, except that it was going to be released in November 1990, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. There were also plans for the unreleased Nintendo 64. A Jungle Emperor/Kimba the White Lion N64 game titled Emperor of the Jungle was going to be made for the magnetic disk drive peripheral, but was also cancelled. The only known evidence of its existence is a short video clip from Nintendo Space World. It was going to be an action-adventure game with vast exploration, but no information regarding the plot of the game currently exists. The game had its first on-video appearance at the 1996 Tokyo Shoshinkai Show, after which the release date of Spring 1999 was announced. A few scenes from the game were shown shortly after. Later that year in an interview at E3 1998, Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned that the project is in a bit of trouble and may take longer to complete than originally expected, due to inexperience. Its cancellation was announced soon after.

&quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; characters have cameos in the GBA game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot;, as well as a chapter from the &quot;Black Jack&quot; manga and Naoki Urasawa&#x27;s Pluto.

In the sixth episode of Season 2 of the Fox TV series &quot;Fringe&quot;, Earthling, Kimba had a cameo in one of the episodes.

==Music==

The series uses several themes. The 1966 Japanese version uses an opening theme and a closing theme. The opening is called . The end song is . For the Japanese remake, the opening song is sung by Ichiro Mizuki, and the ending is sung by Tomoko Tokugai.

The American theme was written by Bernie Baum, Bill Giant and Florence Kaye and sung by Bill Giant. The opening song for the sequel series is &quot;Go Ahead Onward Leo!&quot; written by Isao Tomita and sung by Mieko Hirota. The US-English theme song known as &quot;Leo the Lion&quot; was written by Mark Boccaccio and Susan Brunet of Miami, Florida&#x27;s SONIC-Sound International Corporation in 1984. &quot;Jungle Emperor Symphonic Poem&quot; (by Isao Tomita) was released on LP in 1966.

==Claims of resemblance to &quot;The Lion King&quot;==

After the 1994 release of Disney&#x27;s animated feature film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, it was suggested by some that there were similarities in characters, plotlines, sequences and events in the story resembling those of &quot;Kimba&quot;. Fred Ladd, the English-language producer, referred to the parallels as &quot;stunning&quot;. Similarities in visual sequences have also been noted, most comprehensively by animation historian Fred Patten who published an essay on the subject. Patten would later go on to say that allegations that &quot;The Lion King&quot; was &quot;simply [an] imitation&quot; of Kimba were &quot;not true&quot;, and that many fans who had not seen the show since childhoodor at allhad &quot;exaggerated the similarities&quot;. Matthew Broderick, the voice actor for the adult Simba, recalled in an interview back in 1994 that he once believed that he was cast in a project about Kimba, bringing up memories of watching the series as a child.

Upon the release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; in Japan, multiple Japanese cartoonists signed a letter urging The Walt Disney Company to acknowledge due credit to &quot;The Jungle Emperor&quot; in the making of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. 488 Japanese cartoonists and animators signed the petition, which drew a protest in Japan, where Tezuka and &quot;Kimba&quot; are cultural icons.

Addressing alleged similarities between characters, &quot;The Lion King&quot; director Roger Allers stated it was &quot;not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird, or hyenas&quot; in films set in Africa. Additionally, the word is simply the Swahili word for &#x27;lion&#x27;, which Fred Ladd acknowledges could account for the similarly-named protagonists; in fact, Leo (the protagonist&#x27;s original name) was initially going to be changed in the English dub to &quot;Simba&quot;, but an NBC executive changed the protagonist&#x27;s name to Kimba during development. According to Ladd, this was because the executive found Simba &quot;too common&quot;, which would make it difficult to maintain rights over the character&#x27;s name.

Tezuka&#x27;s family and Tezuka Productions have never pursued litigation against The Walt Disney Company for copyright infringement. Yoshihiro Shimizu, the company&#x27;s director, stated that many of their employees saw resemblances between the two properties, but &quot;any similarities in their plots are based in the facts of nature and therefore are two different works&quot;. In his book, Makoto Tezuka states that the controversy started in America and people inflated the issue because of their opposition to Disney&#x27;s business practices. He also states that he refuses to participate in this denunciation of Disney and that he does not want to see his father&#x27;s works being turned into a weapon for those people. Tezuka acknowledges that &quot;Kimba&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; are two different stories with different themes, but if the latter was about a white lion who spoke with humans, then he would not be able to pardon the similarities.
==Reception==
In 1967, the &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; theatrical feature was awarded the St. Mark&#x27;s Silver Lion Award at the 19th Venice International Film Festival.

==Commercial use==
In 1978, the adult Leo character, designed by Tezuka himself, became the mascot for the Seibu Lions (current Saitama Seibu Lions) baseball team, along with his sister Lina who was created for the baseball team. The was used on the team baseball cap and helmet for decades Leo also appeared on the players&#x27; uniform for the 2014 season, designed by Tezuka Productions. The Seibu conglomerate-owned team&#x27;s mascot became highly visible throughout Japan on baseball caps, shirts, etc., as well as being heavily used in advertisement especially in the Tokyo area. Frederick L. Schodt makes the argument that by the 1980s, Leo the lion could hardly escape the notice of foreign visitors to the city.

Image from the &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; manga appears on shirts made by Lacoste in cooperation with Tezuka Productions for their &quot;Lacoste Live&quot; capsule collection &quot;Tezuka Collection&quot;, edition Fall/Winter 2013/2014.
