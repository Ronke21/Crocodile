<text>Liu Hui () was a Chinese mathematician who published a commentary in 263 CE on &quot;Jiu Zhang Suan Shu (The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art).&quot; He was a descendant of the Marquis of Zixiang of the Eastern Han dynasty and lived in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 CE) of China. 

His major contributions as recorded in his commentary on &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; include a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, theorems in solid geometry, an improvement on Archimedes&#x27;s approximation of , and a systematic method of solving linear equations in several unknowns. In his other work, &quot;Haidao Suanjing (The Sea Island Mathematical Manual)&quot;, he wrote about geometrical problems and their application to surveying. He probably visited Luoyang, where he measured the sun&#x27;s shadow.

==Mathematical work==
Liu Hui expressed mathematical results in the form of decimal fractions that utilized metrological units (i.e., related units of length with base 10 such as 1 &quot;chǐ&quot; = 10 &quot;cùn&quot;, 1 &quot;cùn&quot; = 10 &quot;fēn&quot;, 1 &quot;fēn&quot; = 10 &quot;lí&quot;, etc.); this led Liu Hui to express a diameter of 1.355 feet as 1 &quot;chǐ&quot;, 3 &quot;cùn&quot;, 5 &quot;fēn&quot;, 5 &quot;lí&quot;. Han Yen (fl. 780-804 CE) is thought to be the first mathematician that dropped the terms referring to the units of length and used a notation system akin to the modern decimal system and Yang Hui (c. 1238–1298 CE) is considered to have introduced a unified decimal system.

Liu provided a proof of a theorem identical to the Pythagorean theorem. Liu called the figure of the drawn diagram for the theorem the &quot;diagram giving the relations between the hypotenuse and the sum and difference of the other two sides whereby one can find the unknown from the known.&quot;

In the field of plane areas and solid figures, Liu Hui was one of the greatest contributors to empirical solid geometry. For example, he found that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge. He also found that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid. He computed the volume of solid figures such as cone, cylinder, frustum of a cone, prism, pyramid, tetrahedron, and a wedge. However, he failed to compute the volume of a sphere and noted that he left it to a future mathematician to compute.

In his commentaries on &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, he presented:

* An algorithm for the approximation of pi (). While at the time, it was common practice to assume to equal 3, Liu utilized the method of inscribing a polygon within a circle to approximate to equal formula_1 on the basis of a 192-sided polygon. This method was similar to the one employed by Archimedes whereby one calculates the length of the perimeter of the inscribed polygon utilizing the properties of right-angled triangles formed by each half-segment. Liu subsequently utilized a 3072-sided polygon to approximate to equal 3.14159, which is a more accurate approximation than the one calculated by Archimedes or Ptolemy.

* Gaussian elimination.
* Cavalieri&#x27;s principle to find the volume of a cylinder and the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders although this work was only finished by Zu Chongzhi and Zu Gengzhi. Liu&#x27;s commentaries often include explanations why some methods work and why others do not. Although his commentary was a great contribution, some answers had slight errors which was later corrected by the Tang mathematician and Taoist believer Li Chunfeng.
* Through his work in the Nine Chapters, he could have been the first mathematician to discover and compute with negative numbers; definitely before Ancient Indian mathematician Brahmagupta started using negative numbers.

=== Surveying ===

Liu Hui also presented, in a separate appendix of 263 AD called &quot;Haidao Suanjing&quot; or &quot;The Sea Island Mathematical Manual&quot;, several problems related to surveying. This book contained many practical problems of geometry, including the measurement of the heights of Chinese pagoda towers. This smaller work outlined instructions on how to measure distances and heights with &quot;tall surveyor&#x27;s poles and horizontal bars fixed at right angles to them&quot;. With this, the following cases are considered in his work:

* The measurement of the height of an island opposed to its sea level and viewed from the sea
* The height of a tree on a hill
* The size of a city wall viewed at a long distance
* The depth of a ravine (using hence-forward cross-bars)
* The height of a tower on a plain seen from a hill
* The breadth of a river-mouth seen from a distance on land
* The width of a valley seen from a cliff
* The depth of a transparent pool
* The width of a river as seen from a hill
* The size of a city seen from a mountain.

Liu Hui&#x27;s information about surveying was known to his contemporaries as well. The cartographer and state minister Pei Xiu (224–271) outlined the advancements of cartography, surveying, and mathematics up until his time. This included the first use of a rectangular grid and graduated scale for accurate measurement of distances on representative terrain maps. Liu Hui provided commentary on the Nine Chapter&#x27;s problems involving building canal and river dykes, giving results for total amount of materials used, the amount of labor needed, the amount of time needed for construction, etc.

Although translated into English long beforehand, Liu&#x27;s work was translated into French by Guo Shuchun, a professor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who began in 1985 and took twenty years to complete his translation.

<text>Matinkylä (; , ; both literally translated the &quot;village of Matt/Matti&quot;) is one of the major districts of Espoo, a city on the southern coast of Finland. Matinkylä sits between the Länsiväylä highway and the coast of the Gulf of Finland, between the areas of Haukilahti and Iivisniemi.

The middle part of Matinkylä consists of high apartment buildings, whereas the southern part consists of terraced houses and shorter apartment buildings. There are also some detached houses and paired houses in the area. Iirislahti in eastern Matinkylä, as well as Nuottalahti, Nuottaniemi and Koukkuniemi in southern Matinkylä consist of smaller houses. Matinkylä also has a marine area with many islands, such as Iso Vasikkasaari and Miessaari.

About 30,000 people live in the Greater Matinkylä area, consisting of Matinkylä itself and the neighbouring areas of Olari and Henttaa. Iso Omena, one of Finland&#x27;s biggest shopping malls, is situated in Matinkylä.

Matinkylä was the final stop of the Länsimetro, until the extension to Kivenlahti was finished in December 2022.

== History ==
The roots of Matinkylä date back to the medieval village of Mattby, which was located to the north of the main building of the current Matinkylä manor. At the time, the areas were located immediately next to the shore of the Gulf of Finland, tectonic uplift has since slowly shifted the shoreline to the south. The 1540 land record mentions Mattby having four main houses. The fifth house in the village, Biskopsby, disappeared already in the 16th century; its location remains a mystery. The main farms lost their independent status in the 17th century, and their names have been forgotten.

As well as the Matinkylä manor, the site of the Frisans manor is located in Matinkylä.

== Services ==

The shopping centre Iso Omena is located on the northern side of Matinkylä. The shopping centre includes over 100 businesses as well as numerous municipal services of Espoo, such as a library and a health care station.

The area of Nokkala contains a beach and a boat harbour, connected to the restaurant Nokkalan Majakka. The archipelago ships stop at the Nokkala harbour in summer time.

There are three primary schools in Matinkylä: the Matinlahti school (classes 1 to 6), the Tiistilä school (classes 1 to 10) and the Swedish-speaking Mattlidens skola (classes 1 to 9). The Swedish-speaking Mattlidens Gymnasium is connected to Mattlidens skola.

== Transport ==
The Matinkylä metro station, the terminus of the first stage of Länsimetro, was taken into use on 18 November 2017. The station is connected to a bus terminal. The metro station and the bus terminal are located in the Iso Omena shopping centre.

== Future ==
There are plans to build Finland&#x27;s largest gymnasium Meri-Matti in Matinkylä. The projected cost of the school, intended for about 1350 students, is 40 to 45 million euro. The Olari gymnasium will move to Meri-Matti once it is completed. The Meri-Matti gymnasium will be built in Tynnyripuisto from 2019 to 2022.

<doc id="202722" wikidata="Q428091" url="?curid=202722" title="Tensor contraction">
<text>In multilinear algebra, a tensor contraction is an operation on a tensor that arises from the canonical pairing of a vector space and its dual. In components, it is expressed as a sum of products of scalar components of the tensor(s) caused by applying the summation convention to a pair of dummy indices that are bound to each other in an expression. The contraction of a single mixed tensor occurs when a pair of literal indices (one a subscript, the other a superscript) of the tensor are set equal to each other and summed over. In Einstein notation this summation is built into the notation. The result is another tensor with order reduced by 2.

Tensor contraction can be seen as a generalization of the trace.

== Abstract formulation ==
Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space over a field &quot;k&quot;. The core of the contraction operation, and the simplest case, is the canonical pairing of &quot;V&quot; with its dual vector space &quot;V&quot;∗. The pairing is the linear map from the tensor product of these two spaces to the field &quot;k&quot;:

: formula_1

corresponding to the bilinear form

: formula_2

where &quot;f&quot; is in &quot;V&quot;∗ and &quot;v&quot; is in &quot;V&quot;. The map &quot;C&quot; defines the contraction operation on a tensor of type , which is an element of formula_3. Note that the result is a scalar (an element of &quot;k&quot;). In finite dimensions, using the natural isomorphism between formula_3 and the space of linear maps from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;, one obtains a basis-free definition of the trace.

In general, a tensor of type (with and ) is an element of the vector space

: formula_5

(where there are &quot;m&quot; factors &quot;V&quot; and &quot;n&quot; factors &quot;V&quot;∗). Applying the canonical pairing to the &quot;k&quot;th &quot;V&quot; factor and the &quot;l&quot;th &quot;V&quot;∗ factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;) contraction operation, which is a linear map that yields a tensor of type . By analogy with the case, the general contraction operation is sometimes called the trace.

== Contraction in index notation ==

In tensor index notation, the basic contraction of a vector and a dual vector is denoted by

: formula_6

which is shorthand for the explicit coordinate summation

: formula_7

(where are the components of in a particular basis and are the components of in the corresponding dual basis).

Since a general mixed dyadic tensor is a linear combination of decomposable tensors of the form formula_8, the explicit formula for the dyadic case follows: let

: formula_9

be a mixed dyadic tensor. Then its contraction is

: formula_10.

A general contraction is denoted by labeling one covariant index and one contravariant index with the same letter, summation over that index being implied by the summation convention. The resulting contracted tensor inherits the remaining indices of the original tensor. For example, contracting a tensor &quot;T&quot; of type (2,2) on the second and third indices to create a new tensor &quot;U&quot; of type (1,1) is written as

: formula_11

By contrast, let

: formula_12

be an unmixed dyadic tensor. This tensor does not contract; if its base vectors are dotted, the result is the contravariant metric tensor,

: formula_13,

whose rank is 2.

== Metric contraction ==

As in the previous example, contraction on a pair of indices that are either both contravariant or both covariant is not possible in general. However, in the presence of an inner product (also known as a metric) &quot;g&quot;, such contractions are possible. One uses the metric to raise or lower one of the indices, as needed, and then one uses the usual operation of contraction. The combined operation is known as &quot;metric contraction&quot;.

== Application to tensor fields ==

Contraction is often applied to tensor fields over spaces (e.g. Euclidean space, manifolds, or schemes). Since contraction is a purely algebraic operation, it can be applied pointwise to a tensor field, e.g. if &quot;T&quot; is a (1,1) tensor field on Euclidean space, then in any coordinates, its contraction (a scalar field) &quot;U&quot; at a point &quot;x&quot; is given by

: formula_14

Since the role of &quot;x&quot; is not complicated here, it is often suppressed, and the notation for tensor fields becomes identical to that for purely algebraic tensors.

Over a Riemannian manifold, a metric (field of inner products) is available, and both metric and non-metric contractions are crucial to the theory. For example, the Ricci tensor is a non-metric contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor, and the scalar curvature is the unique metric contraction of the Ricci tensor.

One can also view contraction of a tensor field in the context of modules over an appropriate ring of functions on the manifold or the context of sheaves of modules over the structure sheaf; see the discussion at the end of this article.

=== Tensor divergence ===

As an application of the contraction of a tensor field, let &quot;V&quot; be a vector field on a Riemannian manifold (for example, Euclidean space). Let formula_15 be the covariant derivative of &quot;V&quot; (in some choice of coordinates). In the case of Cartesian coordinates in Euclidean space, one can write

: formula_16

Then changing index &quot;β&quot; to &quot;α&quot; causes the pair of indices to become bound to each other, so that the derivative contracts with itself to obtain the following sum:

: formula_17

which is the divergence div &quot;V&quot;. Then

: formula_18

is a continuity equation for &quot;V&quot;.

In general, one can define various divergence operations on higher-rank tensor fields, as follows. If &quot;T&quot; is a tensor field with at least one contravariant index, taking the covariant differential and contracting the chosen contravariant index with the new covariant index corresponding to the differential results in a new tensor of rank one lower than that of &quot;T&quot;.

== Contraction of a pair of tensors ==

One can generalize the core contraction operation (vector with dual vector) in a slightly different way, by considering a pair of tensors &quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot;. The tensor product formula_19 is a new tensor, which, if it has at least one covariant and one contravariant index, can be contracted. The case where &quot;T&quot; is a vector and &quot;U&quot; is a dual vector is exactly the core operation introduced first in this article.

In tensor index notation, to contract two tensors with each other, one places them side by side (juxtaposed) as factors of the same term. This implements the tensor product, yielding a composite tensor. Contracting two indices in this composite tensor implements the desired contraction of the two tensors.

For example, matrices can be represented as tensors of type (1,1) with the first index being contravariant and the second index being covariant. Let formula_20 be the components of one matrix and let formula_21 be the components of a second matrix. Then their multiplication is given by the following contraction, an example of the contraction of a pair of tensors:

: formula_22.

Also, the interior product of a vector with a differential form is a special case of the contraction of two tensors with each other.

== More general algebraic contexts ==

Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring and let &quot;M&quot; be a finite free module over &quot;R&quot;. Then contraction operates on the full (mixed) tensor algebra of &quot;M&quot; in exactly the same way as it does in the case of vector spaces over a field. (The key fact is that the canonical pairing is still perfect in this case.)

More generally, let &quot;O&quot;X be a sheaf of commutative rings over a topological space &quot;X&quot;, e.g. &quot;O&quot;X could be the structure sheaf of a complex manifold, analytic space, or scheme. Let &quot;M&quot; be a locally free sheaf of modules over &quot;O&quot;X of finite rank. Then the dual of &quot;M&quot; is still well-behaved and contraction operations make sense in this context.

<doc id="202725" wikidata="Q35246" url="?curid=202725" title="Oruro">
<text>Oruro (Hispanicized spelling) or Uru Uru is a city in Bolivia with a population of 264,683 (2012 calculation), about halfway between La Paz and Sucre in the Altiplano, approximately above sea level.

It is Bolivia&#x27;s fifth-largest city by population, after Santa Cruz de la Sierra, El Alto, La Paz, and Cochabamba. It is the capital of the Department of Oruro and the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oruro. Oruro has been subject to cycles of boom and bust owing to its dependence on the mining industry, notably tin, tungsten (wolfram), silver and copper.

==History==
The city was founded on November 1, 1606, by Don Manuel Castro de Padilla as a silver-mining center in the Urus region. At the time it was named Real Villa de San Felipe de Austria, after the Spanish monarch Philip III. It thrived for a while, but it was eventually abandoned as the silver mines became exhausted.

Oruro was reestablished by European Bolivians in the late nineteenth century as a tin mining center. It was named after the native tribe &quot;Uru-Uru.&quot; For a time, the La Salvadora tin mine was the most important source of tin in the world. Gradually, as this resource became less plentiful, Oruro again went into a decline. Its economy is still based on the mining industry.

==Economy==
While traditionally based upon mining, Oruro has become increasingly popular for tourism since the late 20th century. In the early 21st century, Oruro&#x27;s economy grew through trade and economic connections with Chile, especially for exporting products to Pacific markets. It transported products by road through Chile to the Pacific port of Iquique to open new connections to external markets; it also used the rail connection through Uyuni to the port at Antofagasta for exports. Thanks to increased road building, Oruro has become important as a waystation on the overland route of goods from the Atlantic port of Santos, Brazil, through Puerto Suárez and Santa Cruz to the capital, La Paz.

The city is served by the Oruro Airport.

==Culture and education==
Despite its economic decline, the city attracts numerous tourists to its Carnaval de Oruro, considered one of the great folkloric events in South America for its masked &quot;diablada&quot; and Anata.
The Oruru Carnival was discovered in 1559, when the Augustinian priests were on the land, the festival is in honor of the Virgin of Candlemas.
The Oruro Symphony Orchestra is based in the city. Aymara painter and printmaker Alejandro Mario Yllanes (1913–1960) was born here.

The Universidad Técnica de Oruro, noted for its engineering school, is located in Oruro.

== Climate ==
Oruro lies north of the salty lakes Uru Uru and Poopó. It is three hours (by vehicle) from La Paz. Located at an altitude of 3709 meters above sea level, Oruro is well known for its cold weather. Warmer temperatures generally take place during August, September and October, after the worst of the winter chills and before the summer rains. From May to early July, night-time temperatures combined with a cold wind can bring the temperature down to well below freezing. Summers are warmer, and, although it is an arid area, it has considerable rainfall between November and March. The Köppen climate classification describes the climate as a cold subtropical highland climate, abbreviated Cfb, with winter precipitation not low enough for a &quot;Cwb&quot; designation. Due to the warm days and dry winters, snow is not a frequent occurrence as much as the bitter cold (especially at night); however, flurries can fall usually once every few years, most recently July 4, 2015. The other three most recent snowfalls were those of 13 June 2013, 1 September 2010 (with accumulation), as well as one in 2008. 

== Main attractions ==

*Museo Patiño, former residence of &quot;tin baron&quot; Simón Iturri Patiño
*Museo Mineralógico (Mineralogical Museum): has exhibits of precious stones, minerals, and fossils
*Museo Etnográfico Minero (Ethnographical Mining Museum): housed in a mine tunnel, depicts methods of Bolivian mining
*Museo Nacional Antropológico Eduardo López Rivas (National Anthropological Museum): displays tools and information on the Chipaya and Uru tribes, and about Carnaval de Oruro.
*Churches: Catedral Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, Santuario de la Virgen del Socavón, Iglesia de Cunchupata
*Inti Raymi, a mine

==Education==
Because of a high proportion of German-speaking residents, many of whom came as immigrants to work in the mines, the area once had a German school, &quot;Deutsche Schule Oruro&quot;.

==Gallery==
==Twin towns – sister cities==
* Lima, Peru
* Iquique, Chile

<doc id="202735" wikidata="Q129906" url="?curid=202735" title="Codex Argenteus">
<text>The  (Latin for &quot;Silver Book/Codex&quot;) is a 6th-century illuminated manuscript, originally containing part of the 4th-century translation of the Christian Bible into the Gothic language. Traditionally ascribed to the Arian bishop Wulfila, it is now established that the Gothic translation was performed by several scholars, possibly under Wulfila&#x27;s supervision. Of the original 336 folios, 188—including the Speyer fragment discovered in 1970—have been preserved, containing the translation of the greater part of the four canonical gospels. A part of it is on permanent display at the Carolina Rediviva building in Uppsala, Sweden, under the name &quot;Silverbibeln&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Silver Bible&quot;).

==History==
===Origin===
The (literally: &quot;Silver Book&quot;) was probably written for the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, either at his royal seat in Ravenna, or in the Po valley or at Brescia; it was made as a special and impressive book written with gold and silver ink on high-quality thin vellum stained a regal purple, with an ornate treasure binding. Under Theodoric&#x27;s reign, manuscripts of the Gothic Bible were recopied. After Theodoric&#x27;s death in 526, the &quot;Silver Bible&quot; is not mentioned in inventories or book lists for a thousand years.

===Discovery===
187 leaves of the original 336 parchment folios were preserved at the former Benedictine abbey of Werden (near Essen, Rhineland). The abbots at Werden were imperial princes and had a seat in the Imperial Diet. While the precise date of the &quot;Silver Bible&quot; is unknown, it was discovered at Werden in the 16th century.

The remaining part of the codex came to rest in the library of Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II at his imperial seat in Prague. In 1648, after the Battle of Prague from the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it was taken as war booty to Stockholm, Sweden, to the library of Queen Christina of Sweden. In 1654, after her conversion to Catholicism and her abdication, the codex went to the Netherlands among the property of Isaac Vossius, her former librarian. In the 1660s it was bought and taken to Uppsala University by Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, who also provided its present lavishly decorated binding.

The codex remains at the Uppsala University Library in the Carolina Rediviva building. On 5 April 1995, parts of the codex which were on public display in Carolina Rediviva were stolen. The stolen parts were recovered one month later, in a storage box at the Stockholm Central Railway Station.

The details of the codex&#x27;s wanderings for a thousand years remain a mystery; it is unknown whether the other half of the book may have survived.

In 1998 the codex was subjected to carbon-14 analysis, and was dated to the 6th century. It was also determined the codex had been bound at least once during the 16th century.

===The Speyer fragment===
The final leaf of the codex, fol. 336, was discovered in October 1970 in Speyer, West Germany, 321 km south-east of Werden. originating in Aschaffenburg. The leaf contains the final verses of the Gospel of Mark.

===Publications===
First publication mentioning Gothic manuscript appeared in 1569 by Goropius Becanus in his book &quot;Origines Antwerpianae&quot;:

In 1597, Bonaventura Vulcanius, Leiden professor of Greek, published his book &quot;De literis et lingua Getarum sive Gothorum&quot;. It was the first publication of a Gothic text altogether, calling the manuscript &quot;Codex Argenteus&quot;:

But he was not only the first who enabled the learned world to make the acquaintance of the Gothic translation of the Gospels in Gothic script, but also the first who connected this version with the name of Ulfilas:


In his book Vulcanius published two chapters about the Gothic language which contained four fragments of the Gothic New Testament: the Ave Maria (Luke I.28 and 42), the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (Matt. VI.9-13), the Magnificat (Luke I.46-55) and the Song of Simeon (Luke II.29-32), and consistently gave first the Latin translation, then the Gothic in Gothic characters, and then a transliteration of the Gothic in Latin characters.

In 1737, Lars Roberg, a physician of Uppsala, made a woodcut of one page of the manuscript; it was included in Benzelius&#x27; edition of 1750, and the woodcut is preserved in the Linköping Diocesan and Regional Library. Another edition of 1854–7 by Anders Uppström contained an artist&#x27;s rendition of another page. In 1927, a facsimile edition of the Codex was published.

The standard edition is that published by Wilhelm Streitberg in 1910 as &quot;Die Gotische Bibel&quot; (&quot;The Gothic Bible&quot;).

==Script and illumination==

The manuscript is written in an uncial script in the Gothic alphabet, reportedly created by Ulfilas. The script is very uniform, so much so that it has been suggested that it was made with stamps. However, two hands have been identified: one hand in the Gospels of Matthew and John and another in the Gospels of Mark and Luke. The illumination is limited to a few large, framed initials and, at the bottom of each page, a silver arcade which encloses the monograms of the four evangelists.

In the 1920s, German conservator Hugo Ibscher worked on the conservation of the Codex.

<text>The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1806. Its first performance by Franz Clement was unsuccessful and for some decades the work languished in obscurity, until revived in 1844 by the then 12-year-old violinist Joseph Joachim with the orchestra of the London Philharmonic Society conducted by Felix Mendelssohn. Joachim would later claim it to be the &quot;greatest&quot; German violin concerto. Since then it has become one of the best-known and regularly performed violin concertos.

==Genesis==
Beethoven had previously written a number of pieces for violin and orchestra. At some point in 1790–2, before his musical maturity, he began a Violin Concerto in C, of which only a fragment of the first movement survives. Whether the work, or even the first movement, had ever been completed is not known. In any event, it was neither performed nor published. Later in the 1790s, Beethoven had completed two Romances for violin – first the Romance in F and later the Romance in G.

These works show a strong influence from the French school of violin playing, exemplified by violinists such as Giovanni Battista Viotti, Pierre Rode and Rodolphe Kreutzer. The two Romances, for instance, are in a similar style to slow movements of concerti by Viotti. This influence can also be seen in the D major Concerto; the &#x27;martial&#x27; opening with the beat of the timpani follows the style of French music at the time, while the prevalence of figures in broken sixths and broken octaves closely resembles elements of compositions by Kreutzer and Viotti.

==Performance history==
Beethoven wrote the concerto for his colleague Franz Clement, a leading violinist of the day, who had earlier given him helpful advice on his opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;. The work was premiered on 23 December 1806 in the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, the occasion being a benefit concert for Clement. The first printed edition (1808) was dedicated to Stephan von Breuning.

It is believed that Beethoven finished the solo part so late that Clement had to sight-read part of his performance. Some sources state that Clement interrupted the concerto between the first and second movements with a solo composition of his own, played on one string of the violin held upside down however, other sources claim that he played this piece only at the end of the performance.

The premiere was not a success, and the concerto was little performed in the following decades.

The work was revived in 1844, well after Beethoven&#x27;s death, with a performance by the then 12-year-old violinist Joseph Joachim with the orchestra of the London Philharmonic Society conducted by Felix Mendelssohn. Ever since, it has been one of the most important works of the violin concerto repertoire, and is frequently performed and recorded today.

==Performance practice==

It has been said that not only in this piece, but generally, &quot;Recordings demonstrate that ... it was the practice in the early twentieth century to vary the tempo considerably within a movement,&quot; and that in the concerto, there is &quot;often one big trough (slowing?) in the central G major passage.&quot;

==Structure==
The work is in three movements:

It is scored, in addition to the solo violin, for flute, two oboes, two soprano clarinets in B-flat, two bassoons, two French horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings.

=== 1. Allegro ma non troppo ===
The movement starts with five beats on the timpani and leads into a theme played by the oboes, clarinets and bassoons. The strings enter with a non-diatonic D# that leads into a V7 chord. The clarinets and bassoons play another theme. This is suddenly interrupted by a louder section in B-flat major. This leads into a theme in D major and later in the parallel minor. The soloist enters with a V7 chord in octaves. This movement is about 21 minutes long.

=== 2. Larghetto ===
This movement is in G major. It is about 10 minutes long.

=== 3. Rondo. Allegro ===
This movement starts without pause from the second movement. It begins with the famous &quot;hunting horn&quot; theme. There is a section in G minor. After the cadenza, it ends with a typical V-I cadence. This movement is about 10 minutes long.

===Cadenzas===
Cadenzas for the work have been written by several notable violinists, including Joachim. The cadenzas by Fritz Kreisler are probably most often employed. More recently, composer Alfred Schnittke provided controversial cadenzas with a characteristically 20th-century style; violinist Gidon Kremer has recorded the concerto with the Schnittke cadenzas. New klezmer-inspired cadenzas written by Montreal-based klezmer clarinetist and composer Airat Ichmouratov for Alexandre Da Costa in 2011 have been recorded by the Taipei Symphony Orchestra for Warner Classics.

The following violinists and composers have written cadenzas:

* Leopold Auer
* Joshua Bell
* Ferruccio Busoni
* Stephanie Chase
* Ferdinand David
* Jakob Dont
* María Dueñas
* Isaak Dunayevsky
* Mischa Elman

* Sayaka Shoji
* Ödön Singer
* Louis Spohr
* Maxim Vengerov
* Henri Vieuxtemps
* Jörg Widmann
* Henryk Wieniawski
* August Wilhelmj
* Eugène Ysaÿe
==Alternative versions==
Perhaps due to the Violin Concerto&#x27;s lack of success at its premiere, and at the request of Muzio Clementi, Beethoven revised it in a version for piano and orchestra, which was later published as Op. 61a. For this version, which is present as a sketch in the Violin Concerto&#x27;s autograph alongside revisions to the solo part, Beethoven wrote a lengthy first movement cadenza which features the orchestra&#x27;s timpanist along with the solo pianist. This and the cadenzas for the other movements were later arranged for the violin (and timpani) by Rudolf Kolisch, Max Rostal, Ottokar Nováček, Christian Tetzlaff and Wolfgang Schneiderhan. Gidon Kremer, on his recording with Nikolaus Harnoncourt, adapts these cadenzas for violin, timpani and piano, although the piano does not play in any other parts of the recording. Patricia Kopatchinskaja adapted the cadenza of the first movement for two violins, celli and timpani, for the other movements for violin. Seiji Ozawa also wrote an arrangement for piano. More recently, it has been arranged as a concerto for clarinet and orchestra by Mikhail Pletnev. Robert Bockmühl (1820/21–1881) arranged the solo violin part for cello.

<doc id="202746" wikidata="Q1766592" url="?curid=202746" title="My Religion (Keller book)">
<text>My Religion is a 1927 book written by Helen Keller (1880 - 1968) when she was 47 years old. The book was written as a tribute to Emanuel Swedenborg whom Helen regarded as &quot;one of the noblest champions true Christianity has ever known&quot;. This book is regarded as Keller&#x27;s spiritual autobiography in which she stated that &quot;the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg have been my light, and a staff in my hand and by his vision splendid I am attended on my way&quot;.

The original publication was loosely put together and hastily printed by Doubleday, Page &amp; Company. Nevertheless, it sold well in 1927 and has remained in print ever since. In 1994, Ray Silverman, a Swedenborgian minister and literary scholar, thoroughly revised and edited &quot;My Religion,&quot; organizing the eight unwieldy sections of the first edition into twelve distinct chapters with subheadings to clarify their contents. Furthermore, important materials not present in the first edition were added to elucidate and expand the original text. Other revisions included modernization of several words and phrases, substitution of inclusive language where appropriate, correction of spelling and typographical errors, alteration of punctuation to conform to modern standards, and emendation of a few historical inaccuracies. Extra paragraph breaks were added and a very few passages that distracted from the main messages were delicately pruned. 

== 2000 edition as &quot;Light in My Darkness&quot; ==
In 2000 an edition of &quot;My Religion&quot; was published by Swedenborg Foundation Publishers together with an article entitled ... that was originally published in &quot;Guideposts&quot; magazine in 1956, together as &quot;Light in My Darkness&quot;.

The additional article, titled &quot;...&quot; was written in when Keller was 76 years old. The article, which had been reprinted by Guideposts in 1995, is significant in that it establishes the fact that Keller was indeed a lifelong Swedenborgian. It is in this article that she writes,
Also included in the 2000 edition is a quote from Keller&#x27;s last published book, &quot;Teacher&quot; (1955). In it she speaks of her undimmed enthusiasm for Swedenborg&#x27;s teachings. She does this by first quoting the American poet, Walt Whitman who wrote: 
&quot;O Spirit, as a runner strips/ Upon a windy afternoon/ Be unencumbered of what troubles you--/ Arise with grace / And greatly go, with the wind upon your face.&quot;

Keller then adds, &quot;In that state of exhilaration I had accepted the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, had drunk in his interpretation of the Bible, fearless, reverent, yet as unconfined as the sun, the clouds, the sea.&quot;

The change in title from &quot;My Religion&quot; to &quot;Light in My Darkness&quot; is significant. The new title is taken from one of Keller&#x27;s poetic statements in which she declares, &quot;I know that life is given us so that we may grow in love. And I believe that God is in me as the sun is in the color and fragrance of the flower, the Light in my darkness, the Voice in my silence.&quot;

== Reception ==
Readers were divided by those impressed by her faith and those disappointed that the famous deafblind activist advocated Swedenborgianism rather than a more &quot;mainstream&quot; religion.

<doc id="202748" wikidata="Q110911578" url="?curid=202748" title="High Flight">
<text>High Flight is a 1941 sonnet written by war poet John Gillespie Magee Jr. and inspired by his experiences as a fighter pilot of the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II. Magee began writing the poem on 18 August, while stationed at No. 53 OTU outside London, and mailed a completed manuscript to his family on 3 September, three months before he died in a training accident. Originally published in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, it was widely distributed when Magee became one of the first post-Pearl Harbor American casualties of the war on 11 December, after which it was exhibited at the American Library of Congress in 1942. Owing to its gleeful and ethereal portrayal of aviation, along with its allegorical interpretation of death and transcendence, the poem has been featured prominently in aviation memorials across the world, including that of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

== Creation ==

While piloting a Spitfire Mk I, Magee reached during a training flight over Wales sometime in August 1941. He was impressed by the speed and agility of the aircraft, and moved by the experience of flying at that altitude. He wrote to his parents that he completed the poem soon after finishing training that day.

The first person to read Magee&#x27;s poem later that same day in the officers&#x27; mess was fellow Pilot Officer Michael Henry Le Bas (later Air Vice-Marshal M. H. Le Bas, Air Officer Commanding No. 1 Group RAF), with whom Magee had trained.

Magee enclosed the poem in a letter to his parents, dated 3 September 1941. His father, then curate of Saint John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, DC, reprinted it in church publications. The poem became more widely known through the efforts of Archibald MacLeish, then Librarian of Congress, who included it in an exhibition of poems called &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot; at the Library of Congress in February 1942. The manuscript copy of the poem remains at the Library of Congress.

=== Inspirational sources ===
Dr. Oliver Tearle writes that Magee could have been inspired by romantic poems that imagined the sensation of flying before humans first successfully flew. The poet described his flight as supernatural, surrealistic and limitless, while it concerns an actual flight in an actual flying machine. Tearle stated that the poem could be seen as a symbol of technological progress, as its author had transcended the confinements of nature in real life: the aeroplane has allowed humankind to defy the limit of being bound to Earth, soar higher than any bird, and &quot;become almost a god himself.&quot; &quot;High Flight&quot; could have been further influenced by the effects of hypoxia, which Magee described experiencing on one of his flights in his logbook, and perhaps an aviation-specific type of spatial disorientation that makes pilots feel dissociated with their aircraft&#x27;s controls.

The last words of &quot;High Flight&quot; — &quot;...and touched the face of God&quot; — can also be found in a poem by Cuthbert Hicks published three years earlier in &quot;Icarus: An Anthology of the Poetry of Flight&quot;. The last two lines in Hicks&#x27; poem &quot;The Blind Man Flie&quot;s read:

The anthology includes the poem &quot;New World&quot; by G. W. M. Dunn, which contains the phrase &quot;on laughter-silvered wings&quot;. Dunn wrote of &quot;the lifting mind&quot;, another phrase that Magee used in &quot;High Flight&quot;, and refers to &quot;the shouting of the air&quot;, in comparison to Magee&#x27;s line, &quot;chased the shouting wind.&quot; Another line by Magee, &quot;The high untrespassed sanctity of space&quot;, closely resembles &quot;Across the unpierced sanctity of space&quot;, which appears in the anthology in the poem &quot;Dominion over Air&quot; (previously published in the &quot;RAF College Journal&quot;).

== Uses of the poem ==


During April and May 1942, many Hollywood stars including Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Cary Grant, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan as it toured the United States on a mission to raise war bonds. Actress Merle Oberon recited &quot;High Flight&quot; as part of this show. During the performance on 30 April 1942, at the Loew&#x27;s Capitol Theatre in Washington, D.C., and before her recitation of &quot;High Flight&quot;, Oberon acknowledged the attendance of Magee&#x27;s father, John Magee, and brother Christopher Magee.

Orson Welles read the poem on an episode of &quot;The Radio Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; (11 October 1942), &quot;Command Performance&quot; (21 December 1943), and &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot; (31 May 1944).

&quot;High Flight&quot; has been a favourite poem amongst both aviators and astronauts. It is the official poem of the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Air Force. The poem has to be recited from memory by fourth-class cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, where it can be seen on display in the Cadet Field House. At the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery, the grave marker of Brigadier General Robin Olds is inscribed with a variant of a line from the poem: &quot;dancing the skies on laughter silvered wings&quot;.

The poem is often read at funerals of aviators; portions of the poem appear on many of the headstones in the Arlington National Cemetery, and it is inscribed in full on the back of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial. It is displayed on panels at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, the National Air Force Museum of Canada, in Trenton, Ontario. It is the subject of a permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, in Dayton, Ohio.

Brigadier General Robert Lee Scott Jr. included the poem in his 1943 book &quot;God is My Co-Pilot&quot;.

Astronaut Michael Collins brought an index card with the poem typed on it on his Gemini 10 flight and included the poem in his 1974 autobiography &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot;. Former NASA Flight Director Gene Kranz quoted the first line of the poem in his book &quot;Failure Is Not An Option&quot;. U.S. President Ronald Reagan used part of &quot;High Flight&quot; in a speech written by Peggy Noonan on the night after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster on 28 January 1986.

At RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, a memorial to Red Arrows pilots, Flight Lieutenants Jon Egging, killed on 20 August 2011, and Sean Cunningham, killed on 8 November 2011, bears an interpretation of the poem on a brass plaque atop a wooden plinth in front of a gate guardian aircraft outside the RAF Aerobatics Team hangar. The plaque reads &quot;...they have slipped the surly bonds of Earth / Put out their hands and touched the face of God... / In memory of / Flt Lt Jon Egging – 20th August 2011 / Flt Lt Sean Cunningham – 8th November 2011&quot;.

In her 1 September 2018, eulogy for her father, John McCain, Meghan McCain quoted the poem at the end of her tribute. &quot;I know that on the afternoon of August 25th in front of Oak Creek in Cornville, Arizona, surrounded by the family he loved so much, an old man shook off the scars of battle one last time and arose a new man to pilot one last flight up and up and up, busting clouds left and right, straight on through to the kingdom of heaven. And he slipped the earthly bonds, put out his hand, and touched the face of God&quot;

=== Musical adaptations ===
Miklós Rózsa composed the earliest known setting of &quot;High Flight&quot;, for tenor voice, in 1942. It was later published as one of his &quot;Five Songs&quot; in 1974. Canadian composer and Royal Canadian Air Force veteran Robert J. B. Fleming wrote a through-composed musical setting of the poem for the Divine Services Book of the Canadian Armed Forces published in 1950. The composer Bill Pursell wrote his own arrangement with narration for the United States Air Force Band, which was broadcast on their radio show in the late 1940s. Several songs and symphonic compositions have been based on Magee&#x27;s text, including Bob Chilcott&#x27;s 2008 setting, premiered on 1 May 2008 by the King&#x27;s Singers.The poem has been set to music by several composers, including by John Denver and Lee Holdridge as performed on the Bob Hope television show and is included in his 1983 album &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; and by Christopher Marshall, whose composition was commissioned for and premiered by The Orlando Chorale with saxophonist George Weremchuk (Orlando, Florida) in March 2009, under the direction of Gregory Ruffer. The first performance of a setting of words, known as &quot;Even Such Is Time&quot;, from Fauré’s Requiem, plus additional non-liturgical texts that included &quot;High Flight&quot;, was performed by the Nantwich Choral Society, conducted by John Naylor, on Saturday 26 March 2011, in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Nantwich, Cheshire. The music was written by Andrew Mildinhall, the former organist at the church, who accompanied the performance with the Northern Concordia Orchestra.

Singer Al Jarreau paid brief homage to &quot;High Flight&quot; by using the closing lines in the bridge of his 1983 song &quot;Mornin&#x27;&quot;.

The American composer James Curnow was commissioned by the Graduates Association of Tenri High School Band in Nara, Japan to write a piece for concert band in honour of the 50th anniversary of its association. The piece is entitled &quot;Where Never Lark or Eagle Flew&quot; with the subtitle &quot;Based on a poem by John Gillespie Magee Jr.&quot; In 2012, the Australian composer Daniel Walker was commissioned by North Sydney Boys High School to compose a piece for the school&#x27;s centenary celebrations. This composition, &#x27;Through Footless Halls of Air&#x27;, which was written for choir and symphonic winds, features the poem in the lyrics.

British composer Jonathan Dove included the poem in his 2009 oratorio &quot;There Was a Child&quot;, written as a memoriam to Robert Van Allen, who also died at the age of nineteen. It has also been set by British composer Nicholas Scott Burt as a short motet and dedicated to the choir of Rugby Parish Church.

In 2011, Emmylou Harris wrote and recorded a song, &quot;Darlin&#x27; Kate&quot;, dedicated to her late friend, folk singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle, which included the lines, &quot; As you slip the surly bonds of earth and sail away...&quot;

In 2014, Canadian composer Vince Gassi composed a piece for concert band entitled &quot;Chase The Shouting Wind&quot;.

In 2015, the Hardcore DJ Nosferatu used the poem in his track &quot;sanctity of space&quot;.

===Depictions in mass media===
Many U.S. television viewers were introduced to &quot;High Flight&quot; when several TV stations ended (and sometimes also began) their programming day with various short films containing it. The sign-off film occasionally seen on KPTV in Portland, Oregon and KCRA in Sacramento, California featured the spoken poem played to Air Force flying footage. Other examples of the use of the poem in television programs, films include:

* Featured in an episode of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Men&quot; season 2 episode 6 &quot;Maidenform&quot; originally aired 31 August 2008, where the poem is read on television during a scene featuring Pete Campbell.
* An episode of the UK archaeology documentary series &quot;Time Team&quot; that featured the excavation of a crashed Spitfire in France, when the poem was read during the end credits.
* The penultimate episode &quot;Daybreak&quot; of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, where the poem is paraphrased.
* The first and last lines quoted by President Ronald Reagan after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in January 1986.
** The 1990 made-for-television film, &quot;Challenger&quot;, that documented the events leading up to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster concludes with the seven doomed astronauts reciting the poem in their thoughts as the shuttle is about to launch.
* The 1993 Mel Gibson movie &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot;, where the poem is recited by the character Chuck Norstadt, played by Nick Stahl.
* The 1993 Russell Crowe movie &quot;For the Moment&quot;, where the poem is recited by Crowe&#x27;s character, Lachlan Curry.
* The 1989 science fiction adventure film &quot;Slipstream&quot;, which made frequent use of the poem, most notably by Mark Hamill and Bob Peck.
* The film &quot;Snow Walker&quot;, in which James Cromwell recites the poem.
* Pilot and composer Max Conrad&#x27;s second LP of &quot;Flight Inspired Music&quot;, which features the poem on the cover.
* Scott O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s book &quot;Return With Honor&quot;, which has a full transcript of the poem.
* &quot;One Small Step&quot;, a children&#x27;s novel by Philip Kerr, reprints the poem in full before the Author&#x27;s Note.
*A reporter in the film &quot;First Man&quot; is heard quoting the poem (&#x27;slipped the surly bonds of Earth&#x27;) while describing the Gemini 8 mission that Neil Armstrong took part in. 
* President Bartlet recites the final portion of the poem (&quot;...with outstretched fingers, we touched the face of God&quot;) in &quot;The Crackpots and These Women&quot;, the fifth episode from Season 1 of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. 
* A French translation of &quot;High Flight&quot; is told by Bernard Chabert in an episode of &quot;Pégase&quot;, a French TV documentary dedicated to the Spitfire.
* English independent filmmakers James Walker and John Wallace produced the documentary film &quot;High Flight&quot; in 2016, which takes its name from the poem, and documents Magee&#x27;s story, the origin of the poem and the poem&#x27;s place in the legacy of World War Two iconography, as well as the cultural impact of the era upon the &quot;baby boomer&quot; generation. The film is due for release and distribution in late 2016.
* In 2019, it was referenced during a speech of the opening episode of the sixth season of the TV series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;.
* In 2022, the third episode of the fourth season of the Netflix series &quot;Manifest&quot; was titled &quot;High Flight&quot;, within which the phrase &quot;long, delirious, burning blue&quot; played a pivotal role.

<text>Mu ren zhuang () or Mook Yan Jong (also known as The Wing-Chun Dummy or simply The Wooden Dummy internationally), is a training tool used in various styles of Chinese martial arts, most notably that of Wing Chun and other kung fu styles of Southern China. Traditionally made from wood, the dummies are now also made from synthetic materials such as steel and plastic.

==In Wing Chun==

The Wing Chun wooden dummy is the most popular form of wooden dummy. A popular legend says it came about when 108 separate wooden dummies from the Shaolin Temple were combined into one by the nun Ng Mui to make training more efficient and effective. The Wing Chun wooden dummy uses an arm and leg configuration designed to cultivate fighting skill and chi simultaneously. The Hong Kong wooden dummy is a wall mounted version of the Wing Chun Wooden Dummy that hangs using two wooden slats through the body of the wooden dummy. Older versions of the Wing Chun wooden dummy were originally placed in the ground. The modern design was created by Ip Man in Hong Kong to fit the needs of living in an apartment. The Wing Chun version of the &quot;muk yan jong&quot; has three arms and one leg, which represents an opponent&#x27;s body in various positions and the lines of force the body can give out. The wooden slats on which the &quot;muk yan jong&quot; is mounted has a springiness that is similar to a human opponent&#x27;s involuntary reaction and allows the user to practice absorbing energy into his/her stance. Due to this springiness, this type of dummy is considered an &quot;alive&quot; dummy. Therefore, the older version of the dummy without mounting is commonly called a &quot;dead&quot; dummy.

==In Jeet Kune Do==
Bruce Lee, a student of Ip Man, had also made and modified a Wing Chun wooden dummy for his martial arts philosophy of Jeet Kune Do, which had a modified neck and a metal leg. Many of the principles of Wing Chun are central to Jeet Kune Do.

==In Choy Lee Fut==
===Ching Jong===
Ching Jong (balanced dummy) has a different orientation to the arms more suited to Choy Lee Fut style&#x27;s arm motions. In this version, the single top arm, protruding straight out from the front, moves up and down, anchored traditionally with a rope and heavy weight (the origin of the namesake) and anchored with a spring to the rear in modern times. Furthermore, the two middle arms now protrude outward in a &quot;V&quot;, and also an additional lower arm that can be substitute with a traditional Wing Chun dummy&#x27;s leg. Also, sandbags are mounted on the front and sides, which are struck for hand and finger conditioning, similar to makiwara.

===Sui Sau Jong===
The sui sau jong (breaking hand dummy) features a swinging arm around the shoulder level, hanging sandbags, as well as a rotor-like arm at the top, located at head height. The arms are coordinated so that striking the swinging arm causes the rotation of the helicopter arm, and vice versa. The main aim of this dummy is to train quick reactions for counterattacks.

===Ma Jong===
Unlike other dummies, the Ma Jong (horse dummy) is a moveable dummy.

===Others===
Other dummys used in Choy Lee Fut includes the &quot;qiang bao zhuang&quot; (墻包樁) (a wall mounted sand bag), &quot;sha bao zhuang&quot; (沙包樁) (a sand bag apparatus, with one main heavy sand bag connected to two other sand bags on its side through a pulley system), and other mechanical dummies.

<text>Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson is a 1990 work about sexual decadence in Western literature and the visual arts by scholar Camille Paglia, in which she addresses major artists and writers such as Donatello, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Emily Brontë, and Oscar Wilde. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, Paglia argues that the primary conflict in Western culture is between the binary forces of the Apollonian and Dionysian, Apollo being associated with order, symmetry, culture, rationality, and sky, and Dionysus with disorder, chaos, nature, emotion, and earth. The book became a bestseller, and was praised by numerous literary critics, although it also received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars.

==Background==
Paglia&#x27;s discovery of Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot; in 1963 inspired her to write a book larger in scope. &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; began to take shape in essays Paglia wrote in college between 1964 and 1968. The title was inspired by Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Persona&quot;, which Paglia saw on its American release in 1968. The book was finished in 1981, but was rejected by seven major New York publishers before being released by Yale University Press in 1990. Paglia credits editor Ellen Graham with securing Yale&#x27;s decision to publish the book. &quot;Sexual Personae&quot;&#x27;s original preface was removed at the Yale editors&#x27; suggestion because of the book&#x27;s extreme length, but was later published in Paglia&#x27;s essay collection &quot;Sex, Art, and American Culture&quot; (1992).

Paglia describes &quot;Sexual Personae&quot;&#x27;s method as psychoanalytic and acknowledges a debt to Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Her other major influences were Sir James George Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890), Jane Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion&quot; (1903), Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918), D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1920), Sándor Ferenczi&#x27;s &quot;Thalassa&quot; (1924), the works of literary critics G. Wilson Knight and Harold Bloom, Erich Neumann&#x27;s &quot;The Great Mother&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Origins and History of Consciousness&quot; (1949), Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Nude&quot; (1956), Gaston Bachelard&#x27;s &quot;The Poetics of Space&quot; (1958), Norman O. Brown&#x27;s &quot;Life Against Death&quot; (1959) and &quot;Love&#x27;s Body&quot; (1966), and Leslie Fiedler&#x27;s &quot;Love and Death in the American Novel&quot; (1960). Paglia also acknowledges astrology as an influence.

Paglia said of the book, &quot;It was intended to please no one and to offend everyone. The entire process of the book was to discover the repressed elements of contemporary culture, whatever they are, and palpate them. One of the main premises was to demonstrate that pornography is everywhere in major art. Art history as written is completely sex free, repressive and puritanical. I want precision and historical knowledge, but at the same time, I try to zap it with pornographic intensity.&quot;

==Summary==
Paglia seeks to demonstrate &quot;the unity and continuity of western culture&quot;. Accepting the canonical Western tradition, she &quot;rejects the modernist idea that culture has collapsed into meaningless fragments.&quot; Paglia argues that Christianity did not destroy paganism, which flourishes in art, eroticism, astrology, and popular culture. She examines antiquity, the Renaissance, and Romanticism from the late eighteenth century to 1900, contending that &quot;Romanticism turns almost immediately into Decadence.&quot; She believes that the &quot;amorality, aggression, sadism, voyeurism, and pornography in great art have been ignored or glossed over by most academic critics&quot; and that sex and nature are &quot;brutal pagan forces.&quot; She also stresses the truth in sexual stereotypes and the biological basis of sexual difference, noting that her stance is &quot;sure to cause controversy.&quot; Paglia sees the mother as an overwhelming force who condemns men to lifelong sexual anxiety, from which they fleetingly escape through rationalism and physical achievement. 

Portraying Western culture as a struggle between phallic sky-religion (&quot;Sky Cult&quot;) on the one hand and chthonic earth-religion (&quot;Earth Cult&quot;) on the other, Paglia draws on the Greco-Roman polarity between the Apollonian and Dionysian. She associates Apollo with order, structure, and symmetry, and Dionysus with chaos, disorder, and nature. She analyzes literature and art on the premise that the primary conflict in Western culture has always been between these forces. In her view, the major patterns of continuity in Western culture originate in paganism. Other sources of continuity include androgyny, sadism, and the aggressive &quot;western eye,&quot; which seeks to refine and dominate nature&#x27;s ceaseless hostility and has created our art and cinema. Paglia criticizes feminists for sentimentality or wishful thinking about the causes of rape, violence, and poor relations between the sexes.

She prominently argues for the vital role that patriarchy has played in civilizational development, even noting that &quot;Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny.&quot; In one of her most controversial passages, she grounds this claim in what effectively amounts to the variability hypothesis in evolutionary psychology: Serial or sex murder, like fetishism, is a perversion of male intelligence. It is a criminal abstraction, masculine in its deranged egoism and orderliness. It is the asocial equivalent of philosophy, mathematics and music. There is no female Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper.But already more conflicted in tone, another one of her main explanations for this asymmetry instead runs: Male conspiracy cannot explain all female failures. I am convinced that, even without restrictions, there still would have been no female Pascal, Milton, or Kant. Genius is not checked by social obstacles: it will overcome. Men&#x27;s egotism, so disgusting in the talentless, is the source of their greatness as a sex. [emphasis added] [...] Even now, with all vocations open, I marvel at the rarity of the woman driven by artistic or intellectual obsession, that self-mutilating derangement of social relationship which, in its alternate forms of crime and ideation, is the disgrace and glory of the human species.The &quot;sexual personae&quot; of Paglia&#x27;s title include the female vampire (Medusa, Lauren Bacall); the pythoness (the Delphic Oracle, Gracie Allen); the beautiful boy (Hadrian&#x27;s Antinous, Dorian Gray); the epicene man of beauty (Byron, Elvis Presley); and the male heroine (the passive male sufferer; for example, the old men in William Wordsworth&#x27;s poetry). Writers Paglia discusses include Spenser, Shakespeare, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the Marquis de Sade, Goethe, William Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Honoré de Balzac, Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Henry James, and Emily Dickinson. The works of literature Paglia analyzes include Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

Works of art to which Paglia applies her analysis of the Western canon include the &quot;Venus of Willendorf&quot;, the Nefertiti Bust, Ancient Greek sculpture, Donatello&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;, Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; and &quot;Primavera&quot;, da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;The Virgin and Child with St. Anne&quot;. Paglia questions the sociologist Max Weber&#x27;s definition of charisma, according to which it must be manifested in heroic deeds or miracles, writing that she sees charisma as &quot;the numinous aura around a narcissistic personality&quot; and &quot;the radiance produced by the interaction of male and female elements in a gifted personality&quot;, rather than something dependent upon &quot;acts or external effects.&quot;

==Reception==

===Feminist responses===
&quot;Sexual Personae&quot; received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars. Robin Ann Sheets wrote that Paglia &quot;takes a profoundly anti-feminist stance.&quot; Molly Ivins wrote a critical review of &quot;Sexual Personae&quot;, accusing Paglia of historical inaccuracy, egocentrism, and writing in sweeping generalizations. Teresa Ebert denounced the book as &quot;deeply misogynist and rancorous&quot; in the &quot;Women&#x27;s Review of Books&quot;, writing that Paglia uses a biological basis to &quot;justify male domination, violence, and superiority in Western culture.&quot; English professor Sandra Gilbert described &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; as &quot;markedly monomaniacal ... bloated, repetitious&quot; and &quot;awkwardly written,&quot; adding that it is &quot;so &#x27;essentialist&#x27; as to outbiologize even Freud.&quot; Gilbert accused Paglia of &quot;vulgar homophobia&quot; and said she deserved &quot;moral contempt&quot; and &quot;loathes liberalism, egalitarianism, feminism, and Mother Nature.&quot; Martha Duffy wrote that the book had a &quot;neoconservative cultural message&quot; that was well-received, but rejected by many feminists. Beth Loffreda censured Paglia, writing, &quot;She garners most of her publicity by loudly and nastily proclaiming everyone wrong on the sensitive issues of gender, sexuality and rape.&quot; She concluded, &quot;Hers is a seductiveness of simple answers, of clear narratives, of motivations and actions traced solely to a biological origin—a place stripped of the complex ambiguities, the complex interactions of self, skin, group, and institutions that make up daily life.&quot; The critic Mary Rose Kasraie wrote, &quot;Paglia gives no indication she has read any studies related to women, or recent studies about imagination, nature and culture&quot; and had &quot;terrible gaps in her coverage.&quot; Kasraie called the work &quot;distractingly antischolarly&quot; and &quot;an unacademic wallow in Sadean sadomasochistic chthonian nature.&quot;

Judy Simons criticized Paglia&#x27;s &quot;potentially sinister political agenda&quot; and decried her &quot;intellectual sleight of hand.&quot;
Germaine Greer wrote that Paglia&#x27;s insights into Sappho are &quot;vivid and extremely perceptive&quot;, but also &quot;unfortunately inconsistent and largely incompatible with each other&quot;. Professor Alison Booth called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; an &quot;anti-feminist cosmogony.&quot; Literary scholar Marianne Noble wrote that Paglia misread sadomasochism in Dickinson&#x27;s poetry, that &quot;Paglia&#x27;s absolute belief in biological determinism leads her to pronouncements about female nature that are not only detestable but dangerous, because they routinely receive serious widespread attention in the contemporary culture at large&quot;, and that Paglia &quot;derives appalling social conclusions.&quot;

Maya Oppenheim of &quot;The Independent&quot; called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; a &quot;seminal feminist work.&quot; Paglia wrote in &quot;Free Women, Free Men&quot; (2017) that &quot;academic and establishment feminists&quot; made &quot;vicious attacks&quot; on the book, in most cases without reading it, and that these attacks will stand as &quot;an indictment of the sorry process by which important political movements can undermine themselves through the blind insularity of their ruling coteries.&quot;

===General response===
The critic Helen Vendler gave &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; a negative review in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, writing that while Paglia could be &quot;enlightening and entertaining&quot; when dealing with a subject congenial to her, she failed in her discussions of subjects that demanded more than appreciation of images and stories. In response to a letter of protest from Paglia, Vendler denied that &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; contained poetry criticism. The critic Terry Teachout, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; flawed but &quot;every bit as intellectually stimulating as it is exasperating&quot;. The novelist Anthony Burgess called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; a &quot;fine, disturbing book. It seeks to attack the reader&#x27;s emotions as well as his/her prejudices. It is very learned. Each sentence jabs like a needle.&quot; Harold Bloom wrote, &quot;&quot;Sexual Personae&quot; will be an enormous sensation of a book, in all of the better senses of ’sensation.’ There is no book comparable in scope, stance, design, or insight. It compels us to rethink the question of the literary representation of human sexuality.&quot; In &quot;The American Religion&quot; (1992), Bloom called it a &quot;masterwork&quot; and credited Paglia with a &quot;shrewd and alarming sexual definition of charisma&quot;, though he also wrote that its &quot;powerful sexual reductiveness ... necessarily produces distortions when applied to the personality of any prophet whosoever.&quot;

Valerie Steele wrote, &quot;Paglia has been attacked as an academic conservative, in league with Allan Bloom and other defenders of the &#x27;Western canon,&#x27; but no conservative would be so explicitly approving of pornography, homosexuality, and rock-and-roll.&quot; The literature professor Robert Alter wrote in &quot;Arion&quot;, &quot;[O]n purely stylistic grounds, this is one of the few thoroughly enjoyable works of criticism written in the American language in the last couple of decades.&quot; He called the book &quot;immensely ambitious, vastly erudite, feisty, often outrageous, and sometimes dazzlingly brilliant.&quot; Pat Righelato concluded, &quot;Camille Paglia&#x27;s syncretic theoretical enterprise invoking Frazer, Freud, Nietzsche, and Bloom, from anthropology to influence theory and psychobiography, is an immense tour de force.&quot;

Gerald Gillespie called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; &quot;vigorous and capacious,&quot; and wrote of Paglia, &quot;Her passion for her subject matter [...] radiates as a beacon of hope for the survival of the Western heritage beyond the current Babylonian captivity of the American academy.&quot; Christina Hoff Sommers wrote in &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; (1994) that &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; should have led to Paglia being &quot;acknowledged as an outstanding woman scholar even by those who take strong exception to her unfashionable views&quot;, and criticized the &quot;Women&#x27;s Review of Books&quot; for calling the book &quot;crackpot extremism&quot; and feminist professors at Connecticut College for comparing it to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The classical scholar Bruce Thornton called it &quot;wild and brilliant&quot;, adding, &quot;Even when she&#x27;s wrong, Paglia is more interesting than any dozen poststructuralist clerks.&quot;

The novelist John Updike wrote that &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; &quot;feels less a survey than a curiously ornate harangue. Her percussive style—one short declarative sentence after another—eventually wearies the reader; her diction functions not so much to elicit the secrets of books as to hammer them into submission... The weary reader longs for the mercy of a qualification, a doubt, a hesitation; there is little sense, in her uncompanionable prose, of exploration occurring before our eyes, of tentative motions of thought reflected in a complex syntax.&quot; The jurist Richard Posner called &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; &quot;an insightful book, written in a lively manner, though opinionated, uneven, and often difficult to follow&quot;, and compared it to Allan Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; (1987), writing that they are both examples of &quot;difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public.&quot; The anthropologist Melvin Konner wrote that &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; is &quot;a powerful account of gender as depicted in Western art and literature.&quot; In 2013, the singer David Bowie listed &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; among his 100 favorite books.

<doc id="202763" wikidata="Q1990319" url="?curid=202763" title="Runge's phenomenon">
<text>In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, Runge&#x27;s phenomenon () is a problem of oscillation at the edges of an interval that occurs when using polynomial interpolation with polynomials of high degree over a set of equispaced interpolation points. It was discovered by Carl David Tolmé Runge (1901) when exploring the behavior of errors when using polynomial interpolation to approximate certain functions.
The discovery shows that going to higher degrees does not always improve accuracy. The phenomenon is similar to the Gibbs phenomenon in Fourier series approximations.

The Weierstrass approximation theorem states that for every continuous function formula_1 defined on an interval formula_2, there exists a set of polynomial functions formula_3 for formula_4, each of degree at most formula_5, that approximates formula_1 with uniform convergence over formula_2 as formula_5 tends to infinity. This can be expressed as:

:formula_9

Consider the case where one desires to interpolate through formula_10 equispaced points of a function formula_1 using the formula_5-degree polynomial formula_3 that passes through those points. Naturally, one might expect from Weierstrass&#x27; theorem that using more points would lead to a more accurate reconstruction of formula_1. However, this &quot;particular&quot; set of polynomial functions formula_3 is not guaranteed to have the property of uniform convergence; the theorem only states that a set of polynomial functions exists, without providing a general method of finding one.

The formula_3 produced in this manner may in fact diverge away from formula_1 as formula_5 increases; this typically occurs in an oscillating pattern that magnifies near the ends of the interpolation points. The discovery of this phenomenon is attributed to Runge.

==Problem==
Consider the Runge function
:formula_19
(a scaled version of the Witch of Agnesi).
Runge found that if this function is interpolated at equidistant points &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; between −1 and 1 such that:

:formula_20

with a polynomial &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of degree ≤ &quot;n&quot;, the resulting interpolation oscillates toward the end of the interval, i.e. close to −1 and 1. It can even be proven that the interpolation error increases (without bound) when the degree of the polynomial is increased:

:formula_21

This shows that high-degree polynomial interpolation at equidistant points can be troublesome.

===Reason===
Runge&#x27;s phenomenon is the consequence of two properties of this problem. 
* The magnitude of the &quot;n&quot;-th order derivatives of this particular function grows quickly when &quot;n&quot; increases.
* The equidistance between points leads to a Lebesgue constant that increases quickly when &quot;n&quot; increases.

The phenomenon is graphically obvious because both properties combine to increase the magnitude of the oscillations.

The error between the generating function and the interpolating polynomial of order &quot;n&quot; is given by
:formula_22

for some formula_23 in (−1, 1). Thus, 
:formula_24.

Denote by formula_25 the nodal function
:formula_26

and let formula_27 be the maximum of the magnitude of the formula_28 function:
:formula_29.

It is elementary to prove that with equidistant nodes
:formula_30

where formula_31 is the step size.

Moreover, assume that the (&quot;n&quot;+1)-th derivative of formula_32 is bounded, i.e.
:formula_33.

Therefore, 
:formula_34.

But the magnitude of the (&quot;n&quot;+1)-th derivative of Runge&#x27;s function increases when &quot;n&quot; increases. The consequence is that the resulting upper bound tends to infinity when &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity.

Although often used to explain the Runge phenomenon, the fact that the upper bound of the error goes to infinity does not necessarily 
imply, of course, that the error itself also diverges with &quot;n.&quot;

==Mitigations==

===Change of interpolation points===
The oscillation can be minimized by using nodes that are distributed more densely towards the edges of the interval, specifically, with asymptotic density (on the interval ) given by the formula formula_35.
A standard example of such a set of nodes is Chebyshev nodes, for which the maximum error in approximating the Runge function is guaranteed to diminish with increasing polynomial order.

===S-Runge algorithm without resampling===
When equidistant samples must be used because resampling on well-behaved sets of nodes is not feasible, the S-Runge algorithm can be considered. In this approach, the original set of nodes is mapped on the set of Chebyshev nodes, providing a stable polynomial reconstruction. The peculiarity of this method is that there is no need of resampling at the mapped nodes, which are also called &quot;fake nodes&quot;. A Python implementation of this procedure can be found here.

===Use of piecewise polynomials===
The problem can be avoided by using spline curves which are piecewise polynomials. When trying to decrease the interpolation error one can increase the number of polynomial pieces which are used to construct the spline instead of increasing the degree of the polynomials used.

===Constrained minimization===
One can also fit a polynomial of higher degree (for instance, with formula_5 points use a polynomial of order formula_37 instead of formula_38), and fit an interpolating polynomial whose first (or second) derivative has minimal formula_39 norm.

A similar approach is to minimize a constrained version of the formula_40 distance between the polynomial&#x27;s formula_41-th derivative and the mean value of its formula_41-th derivative. Explicitly, to minimize
:formula_43
where formula_44 and formula_45, with respect to the polynomial coefficients and the Lagrange multipliers, formula_46. When formula_47, the constraint equations generated by the Lagrange multipliers reduce formula_48 to the minimum polynomial that passes through all formula_5 points. At the opposite end, formula_50 will approach a form very similar to a piecewise polynomials approximation. When formula_51, in particular, formula_50 approaches the linear piecewise polynomials, i.e. connecting the interpolation points with straight lines.

The role played by formula_53 in the process of minimizing formula_54 is to control the importance of the size of the fluctuations away from the mean value. The larger formula_53 is, the more large fluctuations are penalized compared to small ones. The greatest advantage of the Euclidean norm, formula_56, is that it allows for analytic solutions and it guarantees that formula_54 will only have a single minimum. When formula_58 there can be multiple minima in formula_54, making it difficult to ensure that a particular minimum found will be the global minimum instead of a local one.

===Least squares fitting===
Another method is fitting a polynomial of lower degree using the method of least squares. Generally, when using formula_41 equidistant points, if formula_61 then least squares approximation formula_48 is well-conditioned.

===Bernstein polynomial===
Using Bernstein polynomials, one can uniformly approximate every continuous function in a closed interval, although this method is rather computationally expensive.

===External fake constraints interpolation===
This method proposes to optimally stack a dense distribution of constraints of the type on nodes positioned externally near the endpoints of each side of the interpolation interval, where P&quot;(x) is the second derivative of the interpolation polynomial. Those constraints are called External Fake Constraints as they do not belong to the interpolation interval and they do not match the behaviour of the Runge function. The method has demonstrated that it has a better interpolation performance than Piecewise polynomials (splines) to mitigate the Runge phenomenon.

==Related statements from the approximation theory==
For every predefined table of interpolation nodes there is a continuous function for which the sequence of interpolation polynomials on those nodes diverges. For every continuous function there is a table of nodes on which the interpolation process converges. Chebyshev interpolation (i.e., on Chebyshev nodes) converges uniformly for every absolutely continuous function.

<text>Digital Picture Exchange (DPX) is a common file format for digital intermediate and visual effects work and is a SMPTE standard (ST 268-1:2014). The file format is most commonly used to represent the density of each colour channel of a scanned negative film in an uncompressed &quot;logarithmic&quot; image where the gamma of the original camera negative is preserved as taken by a film scanner. For this reason, DPX is the worldwide-chosen format for still frames storage in most digital intermediate post-production facilities and film labs. Other common video formats are supported as well (see below), from video to purely digital ones, making DPX a file format suitable for almost any raster digital imaging applications. DPX provides, in fact, a great deal of flexibility in storing colour information, colour spaces and colour planes for exchange between production facilities. Multiple forms of packing and alignment are possible. The DPX specification allows for a wide variety of metadata to further clarify information stored (and storable) within each file.

The DPX file format was originally derived from the Kodak Cineon open file format (codice_1 file extension) used for digital images generated by Kodak&#x27;s original film scanner. The original DPX (version 1.0) specifications are part of SMPTE 268M-1994. The specification was later improved and published by SMPTE as ANSI/SMPTE 268M-2003. Academy Density Exchange (ADX) support for the Academy Color Encoding System are added in the current version of the standard SMPTE ST 268-1:2014. Extensions for high-dynamic-range video and wide color gamut are standardized in SMPTE ST 268-2:2018.

== Metadata and standard flexibility ==
SMPTE specifications dictate a mild number of compulsory metadata, like image resolution, color space details (channel depth, colorimetric metric, etc.), number of planes/subimages, as well as original filename and creation date/time, creator&#x27;s name, project name, copyright information, and so on.

Furthermore, a couple of industry-specific metadata areas are present: Motion-Picture and Television ones. They are either used only if the picture has enough embedded information relevant to that specific industry, otherwise are left &quot;empty&quot;. For example, Motion-Picture-specific metadata includes perforation-exact film KeyKode (if the image comes from a film scan), camera shutter angle, slate information and frame positioning within a frame sequence. On the other side, Television metadata includes full SMPTE time code, video overscan and field information, and signal/colour level information.

A third, variable-size metadata area, which is user-definable, exists. Third-party applications/software occasionally use this area to store additional information; for example, when the DPX stores images with technical specifications far away from the original standard (like pictures coded in the CIE &quot;XYZ&quot; color space, or Bayer-patterned raw frames from specific digital cameras like the Arriflex D-21).

SMPTE ST 268-2:2018 defines a standards-based metadata section that supports Extensible Metadata Platform, XML, and KLV metadata representations.

== Support ==
XnView can read FFmpeg codice_2 DPX images. ImageMagick supports DPX. The C++ source of a DPX library is available. DjV, and vooya support DPX sequences. IrfanView also has support for DPX images through a plugin.

<doc id="202772" wikidata="Q6884018" url="?curid=202772" title="Mixed tensor">
<text>In tensor analysis, a mixed tensor is a tensor which is neither strictly covariant nor strictly contravariant; at least one of the indices of a mixed tensor will be a subscript (covariant) and at least one of the indices will be a superscript (contravariant).

A mixed tensor of type or valence formula_1, also written &quot;type (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;)&quot;, with both &quot;M&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;N&quot; &gt; 0, is a tensor which has &quot;M&quot; contravariant indices and &quot;N&quot; covariant indices. Such a tensor can be defined as a linear function which maps an (&quot;M&quot; + &quot;N&quot;)-tuple of &quot;M&quot; one-forms and &quot;N&quot; vectors to a scalar.

==Changing the tensor type==

Consider the following octet of related tensors:
formula_2
The first one is covariant, the last one contravariant, and the remaining ones mixed. Notationally, these tensors differ from each other by the covariance/contravariance of their indices. A given contravariant index of a tensor can be lowered using the metric tensor , and a given covariant index can be raised using the inverse metric tensor . Thus, could be called the &quot;index lowering operator&quot; and the &quot;index raising operator&quot;.

Generally, the covariant metric tensor, contracted with a tensor of type (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), yields a tensor of type (&quot;M&quot; − 1, &quot;N&quot; + 1), whereas its contravariant inverse, contracted with a tensor of type (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), yields a tensor of type (&quot;M&quot; + 1, &quot;N&quot; − 1).

===Examples===
As an example, a mixed tensor of type (1, 2) can be obtained by raising an index of a covariant tensor of type (0, 3),
formula_3
where formula_4 is the same tensor as formula_5, because
formula_6
with Kronecker acting here like an identity matrix.

Likewise,
formula_7
formula_8
formula_9
formula_10

Raising an index of the metric tensor is equivalent to contracting it with its inverse, yielding the Kronecker delta,
formula_11
so any mixed version of the metric tensor will be equal to the Kronecker delta, which will also be mixed.

<text>José Ramón Adolfo &quot;el Pajarito&quot; Villeda Morales (November 26, 1909 – October 8, 1971) served as President of Honduras from 1957 to 1963. 

==Biography==

Trained as a physician, his specialty was pediatrics. Villeda Morales was a liberal who supported the democratization of Honduras after a long period of military rule. He was the Liberal Party candidate in the 1954 presidential election, the first free election for over two decades, winning a plurality over a divided National Party but falling short of a majority. The deadlock led to a coup by Vice-President Julio Lozano Díaz. Following the military junta of 1955, he was in 1957 chosen by the country&#x27;s constituent assembly to serve as president and oversee the transition to democracy. Villeda Morales immediately embarked on a campaign which he believed would help the poorer elements of society, introducing welfare benefits and enacting a new labor code that favored the country&#x27;s large working class population (working on the theory that regulations, rather than the market, can improve, rather than undermine, long-term conditions of work). While these steps were popular with the masses, they enraged the traditional holders of power in Honduras: the military and the upper classes. When it seemed likely that the Liberal Party candidate, Modesto Rodas Alvarado, would win the 1963 election with an even stronger mandate to enact social reforms, the military responded with a coup, just ten days before the election was scheduled to take place.

Ramón Villeda Morales and his wife, Alejandrina, had six sons: twins Ramón and Ruben, Alejandro, Mauricio, Leonardo, and Juan Carlos.

Ramon Villeda Morales died on November 26, 1971, in New York City, where he was serving as the Honduran Ambassador to the UN. His widow, former First Lady of Honduras , died in November 2012, aged 95.

==Legacy==
Villeda Morales helped modernize Honduras, and to create its public health, public education, and social security systems. He was a key supporter of the Alliance for Progress.

San Pedro Sula International Airport is named after him. His son Mauricio Villeda Bermúdez is a leader of the Liberal Party and was a candidate for the presidency in the 2013 elections.

<text>USS &quot;Cleveland&quot; (C-19/PG-33/CL-21) was a United States Navy &quot;Denver&quot;-class protected cruiser.

==Construction==
She was launched 28 September 1901 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by &quot;Miss R. Hanna&quot; (probably Ruth Hanna McCormick), and commissioned 2 November 1903, with Commander William Henry Hudson Southerland in command.

==Service history==
The &quot;Cleveland&quot; cruised with the European Squadron, in West Indies and Cuban waters, along the east coast between Hampton Roads and Boston, and on a midshipmen training cruise until 17 May 1907. She then sailed from New York via Gibraltar, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Singapore to Cavite, arriving 1 August 1907. After three years on the Asiatic station, the &quot;Cleveland&quot; returned to Mare Island Navy Yard 1 August 1910. Decommissioned 3 August 1910, she was placed in second reserve 8 April 1912, and returned to full commission 31 August 1912.

The &quot;Cleveland&quot; alternated patrols in waters off Mexico and Central America with reserve periods at Mare Island Navy Yard between 1912 and 1917, protecting American lives and interests from the turmoil of revolution. On 31 March 1917, she arrived at Hampton Roads, and from 9 April to 22 June, patrolled from Cape Hatteras to Charleston. Assigned to escort convoys to a mid-ocean meeting point, the &quot;Cleveland&quot; made seven voyages between June 1917 and December 1918. In November 1919, &quot;Cleveland&quot; returned the body of former Salvadoran president Carlos Meléndez (who had died in New York in August 1919) to La Libertad, El Salvador.
Returning to patrols off Central and South America, the &quot;Cleveland&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Fleet once more from 16 February 1920, returning to Caribbean waters from time to time. She was reclassified CL-21 on 8 August 1921. During her continued service in the Caribbean and along the South American coasts, the &quot;Cleveland&quot; made courtesy calls, supported diplomatic activities, gave disaster relief, and represented American interests in troubled areas. 

&quot;Cleveland&quot; was decommissioned at Boston 1 November 1929, and sold to the Union Shipbuilding Company of Baltimore, Maryland for scrapping on 7 March 1930 in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty limiting naval armament. The price for the ship was $32,000. The company&#x27;s steamer &quot;Columbine&quot; took the cruiser in tow at Boston on 8 April 1930 to bring her to the ship breaking yard in Baltimore.

<text>The Birth of Tragedy Out of the Spirit of Music () is an 1872 work of dramatic theory by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It was reissued in 1886 as &quot;The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism&quot; (). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, &quot;&quot;, wherein Nietzsche commented on this earlier book.

==The book==

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism and nihilism of a fundamentally meaningless world. Originally educated as a philologist, Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual dichotomy between the Dionysian and the Apollonian (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche&#x27;s words, &quot;Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god Apollo exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever.&quot; And yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the human condition. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the chorus, while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian abstract forms were able to give shape to the passionate Dionysian experience.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always satyrs, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = &quot;goat song&quot; from &quot;tragos&quot; = &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;aeidein&quot; = &quot;to sing&quot;.) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they&#x27;re embodying. It&#x27;s a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the Bacchantes&#x27; rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of Aeschylus and Sophocles, there was an age where tragedy died. Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like Euripides and the coming of rationality, represented by Socrates. Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The &quot;participation mystique&quot; aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man&#x27;s ability to live creatively in optimistic harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of Richard Wagner, in a &quot;rebirth&quot; of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical Enlightenment view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and Cosima Wagner suggested that he write a book about the subject. In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher Wilhelm Engelmann. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book privately printed under the title &quot;Socrates and Greek Tragedy&quot; () and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November. Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled &quot;The Birth of Tragedy Out of the Spirit of Music&quot; (), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872. A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher&#x27;s financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche&#x27;s new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled &quot;The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism&quot; (), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called &quot;An Attempt at Self-Criticism&quot;, commenting on the earlier editions.

== Influences ==

&quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; is a young man&#x27;s work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways. In addition, Nietzsche uses the term &quot;naïve&quot; in exactly the sense used by Friedrich Schiller. Of great importance are the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, especially &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as &quot;representation&quot; in Schopenhauer&#x27;s sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as &quot;will.&quot; Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer&#x27;s Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.

One year before the publication of &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled On Music and Words. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who denounced Nietzsche&#x27;s work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, Erwin Rohde—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf&#x27;s inaccurate citations of Nietzsche&#x27;s work. Richard Wagner also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf&#x27;s critique.

In his denunciation of &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a &quot;complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity&quot; to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of Gottfried Hermann and Karl Lachmann, was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional philology, philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche&#x27;s academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche&#x27;s first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks&quot;, describes the situation in these words:
:&quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche&#x27;s entire academic career. It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the University of Basel, had no students in his field. His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche&#x27;s courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; as &quot;an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness.&quot; Still, he defended the &quot;arrogant and rhapsodic book&quot; for inspiring &quot;fellow-rhapsodizers&quot; and for luring them on to &quot;new secret paths and dancing places.&quot;

In 1888, in &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, Nietzsche was once again radically defending his first work. He defends &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; by stating: &quot;...It is indifferent toward politics,—&#x27;un-German,&#x27; to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An &#x27;idea&#x27;—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this &#x27;idea&#x27;; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. &#x27;Rationality&#x27; against instinct. &#x27;Rationality&#x27; at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the &#x27;Birth of Tragedy&#x27; recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a &#x27;vicious kind of dwarfs&#x27; who are &#x27;subterranean&#x27; ...&quot;

In the title of his novel &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, Thomas Mann alludes to a passage from &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, and the influence of Nietzsche&#x27;s work can be seen in the novel&#x27;s character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the &quot;Dionysian principle&quot;.

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;atheist humanism&quot;, the influential Catholic theologian Henri de Lubac considered it &quot;a work of genius&quot;, and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche&#x27;s early thought and Christianity.

<text>Kūt (), officially Al-Kut, also spelled Kutulamare, Kut al-Imara, or Kut Al Amara is a city in eastern Iraq, on the left bank of the Tigris River, about south east of Baghdad. the estimated population is about 389,400 people.
It is the capital of the province long known as Al Kut, but since the 1960s renamed Wasit.

The old town of Kut is within a sharp &quot;U&quot; bend of the river, opposite from the point where the Shatt al-Gharraf branches off from the Tigris. This U-shaped bend almost makes it an island but for a narrow connection to the shore. Kut was a regional center of the carpet trade for centuries. The area around Kut is a fertile cereal grain growing region. The Baghdad Nuclear Research Facility, looted following the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, is located near Kut.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Kut has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Kut is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== History ==

The medieval city of Madharaya was at the site of modern Kut. It lay at the point where the Nahrawan Canal flowed out into the Tigris. Madharaya has been identified as the hometown of the Sasanian-era Zoroastrian religious leader Mazdak. By the early 1200s, however, Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote that Madharaya was in ruins.

Modern Kut owes much of its prosperity to the advent of steamboat transportation on the Tigris in the 1800s.

=== World War I ===


Kut was the scene of a fierce battle during World War I. The British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, led by Major General Charles Townshend, marched north from Basra in September 1915 in what became known as the Mesopotamian Campaign. They reached Kut on September 26, where after three days of fighting they drove the Ottoman forces from the town.

After a halt of nearly nine months, Townshend then headed up river to Ctesiphon. Following a battle there, the British forces withdrew back to Kut. On December 7, 1915, the Turks, under their commander, Colonel Nurettin Pasha, arrived at Kut and began a siege that lasted 147 days. The British cavalry under Colonel Gerard Leachman succeeded in breaking out, but Townshend and the bulk of the force remained besieged. Many attempts were made to relieve Townshend&#x27;s forces, but all were defeated. Some 23,000 British and Indian soldiers died in the attempts to retake Kut, probably the worst loss of life for the British away from the European theater. Near the end of the siege, T. E. Lawrence and Aubrey Herbert of British Intelligence unsuccessfully tried to bribe Khalil Pasha to allow the troops to escape. Townshend, with some 8,000 surviving soldiers, finally surrendered Kut on April 29, 1916. The captured soldiers were divided, where the officers were sent to separate facilities, and many of the enlisted soldiers were impressed into hard labour until the surrender of the Ottoman Empire; more than half of them died. The British went back on the offensive in December 1916 with a larger and better-supplied force under General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude and with steep casualties retook Kut on February 23, 1917.

Kut suffered heavy damage during the First World War, and was almost entirely rebuilt afterward.

=== Modern history ===
The Kut Barrage was constructed in the city in the 1930s to provide irrigation water for the surrounding area. The barrage supports a road and includes a lock for boats passing up and down the Tigris. Its purpose is to maintain a sufficiently high water level in the Tigris to provide water for the Gharraf irrigation canal.

In 1952, were irrigated from water provided by the Gharraf Canal. Of this newly reclaimed land, was distributed to small farmers as part of a social land reform program. These farmers received per family and were required to live on the land they farmed. In 2005, repairs and maintenance works were carried out at the Kut Barrage and the Gharraf Head Regulator for a total cost of US$3 million.

== Contingency Operating Base Delta (COB Delta) ==

In the early 21st century, the Contingency Operating Base (COB) Delta was an American military installation located on the right bank of the Tigris southwest from Kut. Designated as a Forward operating base (FOB) in the early stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Delta was centered on a former Iraqi Air Force base, Ubaydah Bin Al Jarrah Air Base. In 2005 Delta was selected to become an &quot;enduring&quot; FOB, remaining open after other FOBs had closed. During the Operation Iraqi Freedom, FOB Delta was 
manned by Polish, Kazakhstan, El Salvadorian, Georgian, Lithuanian, British, and US Multi-National Forces. Sometime after 2009 the FOB was re-designated as a COB. COB Delta was closed on October 24, 2011 and officially turned over to the IAF in a handover ceremony that afternoon in the main flight line hangar/terminal. Later that evening, approximately 2,200, the last Force Pro civilians flew out by helicopter.

<text>Salival is a live, outtake, and video album, released as a limited edition box set in CD/VHS and CD/DVD formats in 2000 by American rock band Tool. It includes a 56-page book of photos and stills from their music videos.

== Background ==
The live track &quot;You Lied&quot; is a cover of a song by bass player Justin Chancellor&#x27;s previous band Peach. The cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;No Quarter&quot; was originally planned to be used for the soundtrack to &quot;Private Parts&quot;, but Tool subsequently decided against allowing it to be used, leading to criticism from Howard Stern, who had previously endorsed the band.

&quot;Salival&quot; is the second and final official Tool release (as of 2025) to feature a substantial amount of live material (Tool&#x27;s other official live release, consisting of songs primarily from Lollapalooza &#x27;93, is available on the out-of-print &quot;Sober – Tales from the Darkside&quot;). The tracks were recorded from several different shows prior to &quot;Salival&quot;″s release in 2000; however, because the booklet merely lists locations without date information, the exact sources are unconfirmed. Likely candidates for most of the recordings are the 1998 summer tour, though the San Diego recording could be &quot;Third Eye,&quot; &quot;Pushit&quot; or &quot;Merkaba&quot; from spring 1997.

Live versions of the &quot;Ænima&quot; tracks &quot;Pushit&quot; and &quot;Third Eye&quot; appear on this album plus a live version of the &quot;Opiate&quot; song &quot;Part of Me&quot;. The live instrumental song &quot;Merkaba&quot; was originally an intro for &quot;Sober&quot; when played live, however no tracks from &quot;Undertow&quot; properly appear here in live form. The name &quot;Merkaba&quot; or Merkabah translating to &quot;Mer-Light&quot;, &quot;Ka-Spirit&quot;, &quot;Ba-Body&quot; is the divine light vehicle allegedly used by ascended masters to connect with and reach those in tune with the higher realms. A reference to the Merkabah school of Jewish mysticism as it relates to new age meditation. &quot;Message to Harry Manback II&quot;, &quot;No Quarter&quot;, and &quot;LAMC&quot; were recorded during the sessions for &quot;Ænima&quot; though they were slightly re-recorded before being released on Salival.

=== Rumors and leaks ===
As with other releases, there were rumors during the &quot;Salival&quot; period. Most notably, the band was said to be breaking up. Maynard James Keenan said, &quot;we mentioned some song titles and some dickhead went out and reserved all of the .com and .org names.&quot;

== Artwork and packaging ==
The album is packaged in a black box sized 8.25&quot; × 6.75&quot; × 2&quot; featuring the &quot;Salival man&quot; with outstretched arms. It is contained within a translucent slipcase that features the band&#x27;s logo on the front. The front of the book included with the package has a small glossy square on its front. Upon initial release, the package came with two stickers on the cover; one announcing that the &quot;new studio album&quot; was due to arrive in stores on April 17, 2001, Maynard&#x27;s 37th birthday, though it was ultimately pushed back to May 15. The other sticker, a Parental Advisory, would be the fourth and last one to appear on a Tool release.

The audio CD portion of the album is contained within a disc tray at the back of the 56-page book, which has similar dimensions to and is only slightly larger than a standard CD jewel case.

=== Album typos ===
The first pressings of &quot;Salival&quot; contain typographical errors, as well as the VHS edition having red tape. Later editions do not have these typos. The following typos are found in the CD booklet.

* Aloke Dutta and Paul D&#x27;Amour&#x27;s names are misspelled as &quot;Aloke Dutto&quot; and &quot;Paul D&#x27;Mour&quot;.
* &quot;Stinkfist&quot; is listed as &quot;Stink Fist.&quot;
* &quot;Message to Harry Manback II&quot; is spelled &quot;Messege to Harry Manback II.&quot; 
* The playing order of the videos on the VHS are listed in reverse chronological order.
* The track ordering of &quot;Merkaba&quot; and &quot;You Lied&quot; is incorrect.

A typographical error made it into VHS Version 61422-31158-2R; Stinkfist was spelled &#x27;Stinkfest&#x27; on the label sticker.

<text>In geometric modelling and in computer graphics, a composite Bézier curve or Bézier spline is a spline made out of Bézier curves that is at least formula_1 continuous. In other words, a composite Bézier curve is a series of Bézier curves joined end to end where the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve. Depending on the application, additional smoothness requirements (such as formula_2 or formula_3 continuity) may be added.

A continuous composite Bézier is also called a polybézier, by similarity to polyline, but whereas in polylines the points are connected by straight lines, in a polybézier the points are connected by Bézier curves. A béziergon (also called bézigon) is a closed path composed of Bézier curves. It is similar to a polygon in that it connects a set of vertices by lines, but whereas in polygons the vertices are connected by straight lines, in a béziergon the vertices are connected by Bézier curves. Some authors even call a formula_1 composite Bézier curve a &quot;Bézier spline&quot;; the latter term is however used by other authors as a synonym for the (non-composite) Bézier curve, and they add &quot;composite&quot; in front of &quot;Bézier spline&quot; to denote the composite case.

Perhaps the most common use of composite Béziers is to describe the outline of each letter in a PostScript or PDF file. Such outlines are composed of one béziergon for open letters, or multiple béziergons for closed letters. Modern vector graphics and computer font systems like PostScript, Asymptote, Metafont, OpenType, and SVG use composite Bézier curves composed of cubic Bézier curves (3rd order curves) for drawing curved shapes.

==Smooth joining==
A commonly desired property of splines is for them to join their individual curves together with a specified level of parametric or geometric continuity. While individual curves in the spline are fully formula_5 continuous within their own interval, there is always some amount of discontinuity where different curves meet.

The Bézier spline is fairly unique in that it&#x27;s one of the few splines that doesn&#x27;t guarantee any higher degree of continuity than formula_1. It is, however, possible to arrange control points to guarantee various levels of continuity across joins, though this can come at a loss of local control if the constraint is too strict for the given degree of the Bézier spline.

=== Smoothly joining cubic Béziers ===
Given two cubic Bézier curves with control points formula_7 and formula_8 respectively, the constraints for ensuring continuity at formula_9 can be defined as follows:

* formula_10 (positional continuity) requires that they meet at the same point, which all Bézier splines do by definition. In this example, the shared point is formula_9

* formula_2 (velocity continuity) requires the neighboring control points around the join to be mirrors of each other. In other words, they must follow the constraint of formula_13

* formula_14 (tangent continuity) requires the neighboring control points to be collinear with the join. This is less strict than formula_2 continuity, leaving an extra degree of freedom which can be parameterized using a scalar formula_16. The constraint can then be expressed by formula_17

While the following continuity constraints are possible, they are rarely used with cubic Bézier splines, as other splines like the B-spline or the β-spline will naturally handle higher constraints without loss of local control.

* formula_3 (acceleration continuity) is constrained by formula_19. However, applying this constraint across an entire cubic Bézier spline will cause a cascading loss of local control over the tangent points. The curve will still pass through every third point in the spline, but control over its shape will be lost. In order to achieve formula_3 continuity using cubic curves, it&#x27;s recommended to use a cubic uniform B-spline instead, as it ensures formula_3 continuity without loss of local control, at the expense of no longer being guaranteed to pass through specific points

* formula_22 (curvature continuity) is constrained by formula_23, leaving two degrees of freedom compared to formula_3, in the form of two scalars formula_16 and formula_26. Higher degrees of geometric continuity is possible, though they get increasingly complex

* formula_27 (jolt continuity) is constrained by formula_28. Applying this constraint to the cubic Bézier spline will cause a complete loss of local control, as the entire spline is now fully constrained and defined by the first curve&#x27;s control points. In fact, it is arguably no longer a spline, as its shape is now equivalent to extrapolating the first curve indefinitely, making it not only formula_27 continuous, but formula_5, as joins between separate curves no longer exist

==Approximating circular arcs==
In case circular arc primitives are not supported in a particular environment, they may be approximated by Bézier curves. Commonly, eight quadratic segments or four cubic segments are used to approximate a circle. It is desirable to find the length formula_31 of control points which result in the least approximation error for a given number of cubic segments.

===Using four curves===
Considering only the 90-degree unit-circular arc in the first quadrant, we define the endpoints formula_32 and formula_33 with control points formula_34 and formula_35, respectively, as:

:formula_36

From the definition of the cubic Bézier curve, we have:

:formula_37

With the point formula_38 as the midpoint of the arc, we may write the following two equations:

:formula_39

Solving these equations for the x-coordinate (and identically for the y-coordinate) yields:

:formula_40
:formula_41

Note however that the resulting Bézier curve is entirely outside the circle, with a maximum deviation of the radius of about 0.00027.
By adding a small correction to intermediate points such as 

:formula_42

the magnitude of the radius deviation to 1 is reduced by a factor of about 3, to 0.000068 (at the expense of the derivability of the approximated circle curve at endpoints).

===General case===
We may approximate a circle of radius formula_43 from an arbitrary number of cubic Bézier curves. Let the arc start at point formula_32 and end at point formula_33, placed at equal distances above and below the x-axis, spanning an arc of angle formula_46:

:formula_47

The control points may be written as:

:formula_48

===Examples===
==Fonts==
TrueType fonts use composite Béziers composed of quadratic Bézier curves (2nd order curves). To describe a typical type design as a computer font to any given accuracy, 3rd order Béziers require less data than 2nd order Béziers; and these in turn require less data than a series of straight lines. This is true even though any one straight line segment requires less data than any one segment of a parabola; and that parabolic segment in turn requires less data than any one segment of a 3rd order curve.

<text>&quot;&quot; (), known in English as &quot;Our Language&quot;, is the national anthem of Moldova. It has been used since 1994 and was officially adopted on 22 July 1995.

For a brief period of time in the early 1990s, the national anthem of Moldova was &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot;, which was and remains the national anthem of Romania. The lyrics were written by Alexei Mateevici (1888–1917) a month before his death. Mateevici contributed significantly to the national emancipation of Bessarabia. The music was composed by Alexandru Cristea.

==Lyrics==
The focus of &quot;Limba noastră&quot; is language, hence its namesake; in this case, the official language of Moldova, namely Romanian.

The Constitution of Moldova refers to the country&#x27;s official language as &quot;Romanian&quot;, and similarly in December 2013, a decision of the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled that the Declaration of Independence takes precedence over the Constitution and that the state language is therefore &quot;Romanian&quot;. In Transnistria and by older populations, however, the language is often referred to as &quot;Moldovan&quot;. Additionally, in Transnistria, the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet is still used, and the Russian language is spoken by a majority in the region.

The anthem calls for the people to revive the usage of their native language. The poem does not refer to the language by name; it is poetically called &quot;our language&quot;.

&quot;Limba noastră&quot; is based on a 12-verse poem. For the officially-defined national anthem used today, the verses were selected and reorganised into 5 verses of 4 lines each; namely, the first, second, fifth, eighth and twelfth verses, respectively, which are highlighted in bold.

<text>Vicarius Filii Dei (Latin: &quot;Vicar&quot; or &quot;Representative of the Son of God&quot;) is a phrase first used in the forged medieval &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; to refer to Saint Peter, who is regarded as the first Pope by the Catholic Church.

==Origins and uses of the phrase==
The earliest known instance of the phrase &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; is in the &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot;, now dated between the eighth and the ninth centuries AD.

Johann Peter Kirsch states that &quot;many of the recent critical students of the document [i.e. Donation of Constantine] locate its composition at Rome and attribute the forgery to an ecclesiastic, their chief argument being an intrinsic one: this false document was composed in favour of the popes and of the Holy Catholic Roman Church, therefore the Christ Church itself must have had the chief interest in a forgery executed for a purpose so clearly expressed&quot;.

However, it goes on to state, &quot;Grauert, for whom the forger is a Frankish subject, shares the view of Hergenröther, i.e. the forger had in mind a defence of the new Western Empire from the attacks of the Eastern Romans. Therefore it was highly important for him to establish the legitimacy of the newly founded empire, and this purpose was especially aided by all that the document alleges concerning the elevation of the pope.&quot;

Despite the Donation later being recognized as a forgery, initially the whistleblower Laurentius Valla who discovered the forgery had his work suppressed by the Index Librorum Prohibitorum

Gratian included the phrase in his &quot;Decretum&quot; in Distinctio 96 chapter 14. The title was also included in some collections of Greek canons. Though it was derived from a forgery (The Donation of Constantine) and some have said it carried no dogmatic or canonical authority, Protestants pointed to the weight and authority proscribed within Gratian&#x27;s Decretal Distinctio 19 Chapter 6 which stated that the decretal epistles were reckoned part of the canonical scriptures. It was previously also used as such for hundreds of years in the past.

=== Documented Usage ===
Several popes used the phrase and quoted it throughout their documents including the following:

* Pope Leo IX in his &quot;In Terra Pax Hominibus&quot;, 1054
* Pope Nicholaus IV in his &quot;letter to Caydonius the Tartar&quot;, 1289
* Pope John XXII in his &quot;Licet juxta doctrinam&quot;, 1327
* Pope John XXII in his &quot;Bulla Sabbatina,&quot; 1322
* Pope Paul VI in his &quot;Rivi Muniensis,&quot; 1965 and in his &quot;Bafianae,&quot; 1968 

==== Lawyers ====
Catholic documents used the phrase as well including those from Canon Lawyer Augustinus Triumphus in his &quot;Summa de potestate ecclesiastica.&quot; Others such as Venetian lawyer Alphonsus Alvarez Guerrero, a Spanish civil and canon lawyer (1559) used the phrase in his &quot;Thesaurus Christianae Religiones.&quot; Venetian jureconsult and author (16th century) Giovanni Battista Ziletti (1577) also used the phrase in his work &quot;Consiliorum Seu Responsorum, Ad Causas Criminales, Recens Editorum&quot;

==== Cardinals and Bishops ====
In 1561 Dominican and Spanish theologian Juan de Torquemada used the phrase in his monumental &quot;Summa de Ecclesia.&quot; In 1581, Antonino (Archbishop of Florence) in Volume 3 of his &quot;Summa Theologicae&quot; quotes the phrase and applies it to the pope. The acclaimed Cardinal Henry Edward Manning used an English equivalent &quot;Vicar of the Son of God&quot; to refer to the pope. In his &quot;Vindication of the Popes against opponents of all kinds&quot; &quot;Vindiciae Summorum Pontificum adversus omnis generis adversarios,&quot; Wilibald Heiss (1755) also used the title. Jesuit Vincent Houdry also used the title in his work &quot;Bibliotheca Concionatoria Complectens Panegyricas Orationes Sanctorum&quot; where he described the win of Innocent II over antipope Anaclectus II

==== Ecclesiastical Anthology ====
In his &quot;Polyanthea Sacrorum,&quot; Giovanni Paolo Paravicini and also Laurentius Brancati in his &quot;Epitome Canonum Omnium,&quot; enumerated papal names or claims to authority and stated that the &quot;Papa Est Vicarius Filii Dei Sicut Petris&quot; &quot;The Pope is Vicarius Filii Dei like Peter&quot;. Wolfgang Frölich in his 1790 work (&quot;Who is Peter) Quis est Petrus seu qualis Petri Primatus?: Liber theologico-canonico catholicus&quot; described Peter&#x27;s successor with the phrase &quot;Christi Filii Dei Vicarius&quot;. The French catechism &quot;Catéchisme de persévérance&quot;, also used the French version of the title &quot;vicaire du Fils de Dieu&quot;. Italian Franciscan canonist Lucius Ferraris also used the title in his &quot;Prompta Bibliotheca Canonica, Juridica, Moralis.&quot; Theologian D&#x27;Utrecht in his work &quot;Défense de L&#x27;Eglise Romaine et des Souverains Pontifes&quot; also used the title.

===Papal title?===

The Protestant writer Andreas Helwig suggested that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; was an expansion of the historical title &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot;, rather than an official title used by the Popes themselves. His interpretation did not become common until about the time of the French Revolution. Some later Protestant figures asserted that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; was an official title of the Pope, with some saying that this title appeared on the papal tiara and/or a mitre. Some Catholic converts to Protestantism such as Balthasar Hoffman also testified to witnessing the title engraved with 100 diamonds on the 1845 tiara of Gregory XVI

Catholic apologist Patrick Madrid answers the Protestant assertions by claiming that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; has never been an official Papal title. Catholics answer the claims that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; is written on the Papal Tiara by stating that a simple inspection of the more than 20 papal tiaras still in existence—including those in use in 1866 during the reign of Pope Pius IX when Uriah Smith made his claim—shows that none have this inscription, nor is there any evidence that any of the earlier papal tiaras destroyed by invading French troops in 1798 had it. However, a Catholic publication, Our Sunday Visitor, did admit to the title being inscribed on a tiara. Catholic scholar, professor emeritus at the Catholic University of America, Dr Johannes Quasten (1900–1987), stated that &quot;The title Vicarius Filii Dei as well as the title vicarius christi is very common as the title of the pope&quot;.

==Protestant view==
Some fundamentalist Protestants have the view that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; can be applied to the Bishop of Rome.

===Origins of a controversy===
The earliest extant record of a Protestant writer on this subject is that of Professor Andreas Helwig in 1612. In his work &quot;Antichristus Romanus&quot; he took fifteen titles in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin and computed their numerical equivalents using the principle of Isopsephy in those languages, arriving at the number 666 mentioned in the Book of Revelation. Out of all these titles, he preferred to single out &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot;, for the reason that it met &quot;all the conditions which [Cardinal] Bellarmine had thus far demanded.&quot;

Helwig&#x27;s criteria were as follows:

# must yield the required number
# must agree with the papal order
# must not be a vile name applied by enemies, but acceptable to Antichrist himself
# must be one of which he can boast.

Helwig suggested that the supposed title was an expansion of the historical title &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot;, rather than an official title used by the Popes themselves. Additionally, he said nothing about the title appearing on tiaras or mitres. Helwig&#x27;s interpretation did not become a common one until about the time of the French Revolution. Some later Protestant figures directly claimed that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; was an official title of the Roman Catholic Pope, some claimed that this title appeared on the papal tiara and/or a mitre.

Some Protestants view the Pope as the Antichrist. This view was common at the time of Helwig and is still part of the confession of faith of some Protestant churches, such as those within Confessional Lutheranism and the London Baptist confession of 1689.

===Historical Seventh-day Adventist views===
In 1866, Uriah Smith was the first to propose the interpretation to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In &quot;The United States in the Light of Prophecy&quot;, he wrote: &quot;The pope wears upon his pontifical crown in jeweled letters, this title: &quot;″Vicarius Filii Dei″&quot;, &#x27;Viceregent of the Son of God&#x27;; the numerical value of which title is just six hundred and sixty-six. The most plausible supposition we have ever seen on this point is that here we find the number in question. It is the number of the beast, the papacy; it is the number of his name, for he adopts it as his distinctive title; it is the number of a man, for he who bears it is the &#x27;man of sin&#x27;.&quot;
Uriah Smith maintained his interpretation in the various editions of &quot;Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation&quot;, which was influential in the church.

In November 1948, Le Roy Froom, a Seventh-day Adventist ministerial leader, editor of the church&#x27;s &quot;Ministry&quot;, and a church historian, wrote an article to correct the mistaken use of some of the denomination&#x27;s evangelists who continued to claim that the Latin words &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; were written on a papal tiara. 
Froom also stated in the 1948 article that at one point a prominent Adventist went to Rome to take some pictures of the papal tiaras, but &quot;the photographs were without any wording of any sort on any one of the three crown, front or back.&quot; Later, an Adventist artist who wanted to illustrate a standard Adventist text on prophecies added the words &quot;Vicarius&quot;, &quot;Filii&quot;, and &quot;Dei&quot;, one word on each of the three tiaras in the photograph taken. He submitted his image for publishing in a standard church text on Bible prophecy; the image was to serve as an illustration in the book, not as a visual proof. However, when an Adventist publishing house and the Adventist General Conference received it, they &quot;emphatically rejected it as misleading and deceptive, and refused to allow its use. (All honor to them!).&quot; Froom concluded his 1948 article with the following words: &quot;Truth does not need fabrication to aid or support it. Its very nature precludes any manipulation or duplicity. We cannot afford to be party to any fraud. The reflex action upon our own souls should be a sufficient deterrent. We must never use a quotation or a picture merely because it sounds or looks impressive. We must honor the truth, and meticulously observe the principle of honesty in the handling of evidence under all circumstances.&quot;

It is worth noting however that the equivalent title &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; is indeed known to be inscribed upon the Belgium Tiara given to Pope Pius IX on 18 June 1871 by the Ladies of the Royal Court of the King of the Belgians and designed by Jean Baptist Bethune of Ghent. Adventists have proposed that the alternate &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; is no better than Vicarius Filii Dei, because of the correlation in Leviticus 24:18 between the substitute &quot;Vicarium&quot; in the Vulgate and the substitute ἀντί &quot;life for life&quot; in the Greek text. They have proposed &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; therefore means &quot;Antichrist&quot;.

===Catholic response===
Catholic apologist Patrick Madrid answers the Protestant claims by claiming that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; has never been an official Papal title. He also argues that even if it were a Papal title, that would not be sufficient to associate the Pope with the number of the Beast, as, for example, the name of Ellen Gould White can also be similarly manipulated to get the same number (ELLen GoVLD VVhIte 50+50+5+50+500+5+5+1=666). He answers the claims that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; is not written on Papal Tiara by stating that merely looking at any of the more than 20 papal tiaras still in existence—including those in use in 1866 during the reign of Pope Pius IX when Uriah Smith made his claim—plainly shows that not even one of them has any such inscription, nor is there any evidence that any of the earlier papal tiaras destroyed by invading French troops in 1798 had any such inscription either.

Adventist Samuele Bacchiocchi responded to those claims, by pointing out that &quot;interpreting 666 on the basis of the numerical values of the letters of names can give absurd results&quot;. He also notes the Donation of Constantine was considered as true to the point &quot;this forged document was used by 10 popes over a period of six centuries to assert, not only their ecclesiastical supremacy over all the churches, but also their political sovereignty over what became known the Papal States, which included most of Italy.&quot; He also states the title &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; was considered as an official title of the pope.

<doc id="202821" wikidata="Q7489233" url="?curid=202821" title="Shape note">
<text>Shape notes are a musical notation designed to facilitate congregational and social singing. The notation became a popular teaching device in American singing schools during the 19th century. Shapes were added to the noteheads in written music to help singers find pitches within major and minor scales without the use of more complex information found in key signatures on the staff.

Shape notes of various kinds have been used for over two centuries in a variety of music traditions, mostly sacred music but also secular, originating in New England, practiced primarily in the Southern United States for many years, and since 2013 experiencing a renaissance in other locations as well.

== Nomenclature ==
Shape notes have also been called character notes and patent notes, respectively, and buckwheat notes and dunce notes, pejoratively.

== Overview ==
The idea behind shape notes is that the parts of a vocal work can be learned more quickly and easily if the music is printed in shapes that match up with the solfège syllables with which the notes of the musical scale are sung. For instance, in the four-shape tradition used in the Sacred Harp and elsewhere, the notes of a C major scale are notated and sung as follows:
A skilled singer experienced in a shape note tradition has developed a fluent triple mental association, which links a note of the scale, a shape, and a syllable. This association can be used to help in reading the music.
When a song is first sung by a shape note group, they normally sing the syllables (reading them from the shapes) to solidify their command over the notes. Next, they sing the same notes to the words of the music.

The syllables and notes of a shape note system are relative rather than absolute; they depend on the key of the piece. The first note of a major key always has the triangular Fa note, followed (ascending) by Sol, La, etc. The first note of a minor key is always La, followed by Mi, Fa, etc.

The first three notes of any major scale – fa, sol, la – are each a tone apart. The fourth to sixth notes are also a tone apart and are also fa, sol, la. The seventh and eighth notes, being separated by a semitone, are indicated mi-fa. This means that just four shapenotes can adequately reflect the &quot;feeling&quot; of the whole scale.

==Four-shape vs. seven-shape systems==
The system illustrated above is a &quot;four-shape&quot; system; six of the notes of the scale are grouped in pairs assigned to one syllable/shape combination. The ascending scale using the fa, so, la, fa, so, la, mi, fa syllables represent a variation of the hexachord system introduced by the 11th century monk Guido of Arezzo, who originally introduced a six-note scale using the syllables ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la.

The four syllable variation of Guido&#x27;s original system was prominent in 17th century England, and entered the US in the 18th century. Shortly afterward, shapes were invented to represent the syllables. (see below). The other important systems are &quot;seven-shape&quot; systems, which give a different shape and syllable to every note of the scale. Such systems use as their syllables the note names &quot;do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do&quot; (familiar to most people due to the song &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;). A few books (e.g. &quot;The Good Old Songs&quot; by C. H. Cayce) present the older seven-note syllabification of &quot;do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, do&quot;. In the seven-shape system invented by Jesse B. Aikin, the notes of a C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:
There are other seven-shape systems.
==Effectiveness of shape notes==
A controlled study on the usefulness of shape notes was carried out in the 1950s by George H. Kyme with an experimental population consisting of fourth- and fifth-graders living in California. Kyme took care to match his experimental and control groups as closely as possible for ability, quality of teacher, and various other factors. He found that the students taught with shape notes learned to sight read significantly better than those taught without them. Kyme additionally found that the students taught with shape notes were also far more likely to pursue musical activities later on in their education.

==Shape notes and modulation==
Many forms of music in the common practice period employ modulation, that is, a change of key in mid-piece. Since the 19th century, most choral music has employed modulation, and since the key change is easy for instruments but difficult for singers, the new tonality is usually established by instrumental accompaniment; accordingly, the choir will also sing in the temperament of the instrument rather than the just intonation of the human voice. Modulation is sometimes said to be problematic for shape-note systems, since the shapes employed for the original key of the piece no longer match the scale degrees of the new key; but the ability to use of sharp and flat symbols along with shape notes is a matter of the range of sorts available to the typographer and musical preferences. The development of musical preferences is partly documented by surviving copies of B.F. White&#x27;s &quot;Organ&quot; from the 1850s.

Justin Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Judgment Anthem&quot;, which first appeared in shapes in Little and Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Easy Instructor&quot; (1801), appears to shift keys (and key signatures) from E minor to E♭ major, then back to E minor before concluding in E♭ major. Morgan, however, may be supposed to have intended simply a shift from major to minor while maintaining the same tonic pitch. It was reprinted in many of the early shape note tunebooks, but not in the Sacred Harp (1844), in which Jeremiah Ingalls&#x27;s &quot;Christian Song&quot; is the only song that modulates (in this case, from D minor to D major).

== Origin and early history ==
As noted above, the syllables of shape-note systems greatly antedate the shapes. The practice of singing music to syllables designating pitch goes back to about AD 1000 with the work of Guido of Arezzo. Other early work in this area includes the cipher notation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (18th century), and the tonic sol-fa of Sarah Anna Glover and John Curwen (19th century).

American forerunners to shape notes include the 9th edition of the Bay Psalm Book (Boston), and &quot;An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes in a Plaine &amp; Easy Method&quot; by Reverend John Tufts. The 9th edition of the Bay Psalm Book was printed with the initials of four-note syllables (fa, sol, la, me) underneath the staff. In his book, Tufts substituted the initials of the four-note syllables on the staff in place of note heads, and indicated rhythm by punctuation marks to the right of the letters.

Compositions of the &quot;Yankee tunesmiths&quot; (&quot;First New England School&quot;) began to appear in 1770, prior to the advent of shape notes, which first appeared in &quot;The Easy Instructor&quot; by William Little and William Smith in 1801 in Philadelphia. Little and Smith introduced the four-shape system shown above, intended for use in singing schools. In 1803 Andrew Law published &quot;The Musical Primer&quot;, which used slightly different shapes: a square indicated &quot;fa&quot; and a triangle &quot;la&quot;, while &quot;sol&quot; and &quot;mi&quot; were the same as in Little and Smith. Additionally, Law&#x27;s invention was more radical than Little and Smith&#x27;s in that he dispensed with the use of the staff altogether, letting the shapes be the sole means of expressing pitch. Little and Smith followed traditional music notation in placing the note heads on the staff, in place of the ordinary oval note heads. In the end, it was the Little/Smith system that won out, and there is no hymnbook used today that employs the Law system.
Some copies of &quot;The Easy Instructor, Part II&quot; (1803) included a statement, on the verso of the title page, in which John Connelly (whose name is given in other sources as Conly, Connolly, and Coloney) grants permission to Little and Smith to make use in their publications of the shape notes to which he claimed the rights. Little and Smith did not themselves claim credit for the invention, but said instead that the notes were invented around 1790 by John Connelly of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Andrew Law asserted that he was the inventor of shape notes.

Shape notes proved popular in America, and quickly a wide variety of hymnbooks were prepared making use of them. The shapes were eventually extirpated in the northeastern U.S. by a so-called &quot;better music&quot; movement, headed by Lowell Mason. But in the South, the shapes became well entrenched, and multiplied into a variety of traditions. Ananias Davisson&#x27;s Kentucky Harmony (1816) is the first Southern shape-note tunebook, and was soon followed by Alexander Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Harmony&quot; (1818), Allen D. Carden&#x27;s The Missouri Harmony (1820) and many others.

==Rise of seven-shape systems==
By the middle of the 19th century, the &quot;fa so la&quot; system of four syllables had acquired a major rival, namely the seven-syllable &quot;do re mi&quot; system. Thus, music compilers began to add three more shapes to their books to match the extra syllables. Numerous seven-shape notations were devised. Jesse B. Aikin was the first to produce a book with a seven-shape note system, and he vigorously defended his &quot;invention&quot; and his patent. The system used in Aikin&#x27;s 1846 &quot;Christian Minstrel&quot; eventually became the standard. This owes much to the influential Ruebush &amp; Kieffer Publishing Company adopting Aikin&#x27;s system around 1876. Two books that have remained in continuous (though limited) use, William Walker&#x27;s &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; and M. L. Swan&#x27;s &quot;New Harp of Columbia&quot;, are still available. These books use seven-shape systems devised by Walker and Swan, respectively.

== Currently active shape note traditions ==

Although seven-shape books may not be as popular as in the past, there are still a great number of churches in the American South, in particular Southern Baptists, Primitive Baptists, almost all of the non-instrumental Churches of Christ, some Free Methodists, Mennonite, some Amish, United Pentecostals, and United Baptists in the Appalachian regions of West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky, that regularly use seven-shape songbooks in Sunday worship. These songbooks may contain a variety of songs from 18th-century classics to 20th-century gospel music. Thus today denominational songbooks printed in seven shapes probably constitute the largest branch of the shape-note tradition.

In addition, nondenominational community singings are also intermittently held which feature early- to mid-20th century seven-shape gospel music such as Stamps-Baxter hymnals or &quot;Heavenly Highway&quot;. In these traditions, the custom of &quot;singing the notes&quot; (syllables) is generally preserved only during the learning process at singing schools and singing may be to an instrumental accompaniment, typically a piano.

The seven-shape system is also still used at regular public singings of 19th-century songbooks of a similar type to the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, such as &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot; and the &quot;New Harp of Columbia&quot;. Such singings are common in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, and generally preserve the singing school custom of &quot;singing the notes&quot;.

The seven-shape (Aikin) system is commonly used by the Mennonites and Brethren. Numerous songbooks are printed in shaped notes for this market. They include &quot;Christian Hymnal&quot;, the &quot;Christian Hymnary&quot;, &quot;Hymns of the Church&quot;, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Praises&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Praises&quot;, the &quot;Church Hymnal&quot;, &quot;Silver Gems in Song&quot;, &quot;the Mennonite Hymnal&quot;, and &quot;Harmonia Sacra&quot;.

Some African-American churches use the seven-shape note system.

The four-shape tradition that currently has the greatest number of participants is Sacred Harp singing. But there are many other traditions that are still active or even enjoying a resurgence of interest. Among the four-shape systems, the &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; has remained in continuous use at one singing in Benton, Kentucky, and is now experiencing a small amount of regrowth. The current reawakening of interest in shape note singing has also created new singings using other recently moribund 19th-century four-shape songbooks, such as &quot;The Missouri Harmony&quot;, as well as new books by modern composers, such as the &quot;Northern Harmony&quot;. Of a hybrid nature, in terms of reviving Ananias Davisson&#x27;s Kentucky Harmony but taking the further step of incorporating songs from 70 other early tunebooks, along with new compositions, is the Shenandoah Harmony (2013). Thomas B. Malone has specialized in the revival of works by Jeremiah Ingalls, and has published a four-shape edition of Ingalls&#x27; 1805 &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot;. Malone organizes an annual mid-July singing in Newbury, Vermont, where Ingalls was a tavern-keeper and musician between 1789 and 1810.

<text>Blank Generation is the debut studio album by American punk rock band Richard Hell and the Voidoids. It was produced by Richard Gottehrer and released on August 26, 1977 on Sire Records.

==Background==
Kentucky-born Richard Meyers moved to New York City after dropping out of high school in 1966 aspiring to become a poet. He and his best friend from high school, Tom Miller, founded the rock band the Neon Boys, which became Television in 1973. They changed their names: Miller became Tom Verlaine, after the Symbolist Paul Verlaine, and Meyers became Richard Hell. The group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and spiked his hair; in 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren brought some of Hell&#x27;s ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols&#x27; image. 

Disputes with Verlaine led to Hell&#x27;s departure from Television in April 1975, and he co-founded the Heartbreakers with New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan. Hell lasted less than a year with this band, and began recruiting members for a new one in early 1976. For guitarists, Hell found Robert Quine and Ivan Julian—Quine had worked in a bookstore with Hell, and Julian responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. They lifted drummer Marc Bell from Wayne County. The band was named the Voidoids after a novel Hell had been writing.

Hell drew musical inspiration from acts such as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Stooges and fellow New Yorkers the Velvet Underground, a group with a reputation for heroin-fueled rock and roll with poetic lyrics. Hell also drew from—and covered—garage rock bands such as the Seeds and the Count Five, both found on the 1972 &quot;&quot; compilation.

Hell had written the song &quot;Blank Generation&quot; while still in Television; he had played it regularly with the band since at least 1974, and later with the Heartbreakers. The Voidoids released a 7&quot; &quot;Blank Generation&quot; EP in November 1976 on Ork Records containing &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Lose&quot;. The cover featured a black-and-white photo by Hell&#x27;s former girlfriend and unofficial CBGB photographer Roberta Bayley, depicting a bare-chested Hell with an open jeans zipper. It was an underground hit, and the band signed to Sire Records for its album debut. Bell eventually left and became a member of the Ramones in 1978, adopting the stage name Marky Ramone.

==Recording==
The album was co-produced by Richard Gottehrer, a songwriter associated with the Brill Building who co-penned his first hit in 1963 with &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; and who performed in the group the Strangeloves, known for hits such as &quot;I Want Candy&quot;.

According to Hell, they recorded and mixed the entire album at Electric Lady Studios in New York City across three weeks beginning on March 14, 1977. Two months later, they were informed that the album release would be delayed until September because their label, Sire Records, was changing distributors. &quot;In the meantime, I had noticed a lot of things about the record that I thought we could have done better,&quot; recalls Hell. He asked their label if they could re-record the album, and after getting their approval, they booked three weeks in late June and early July at Plaza Sound Studio, located on the eighth floor of Radio City Music Hall. The final LP would use the Plaza Sound recordings for every song except &quot;Liars Beware,&quot; &quot;New Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Another World,&quot; where the Electric Lady recordings were retained. Their rendition of John and Tom Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Walking on the Water&quot; was also added to the LP during the Plaza Sound sessions; the song had been added to their repertoire after it debuted during a CBGB performance on April 14, 1977.

Final mixing began at Plaza Sound on July 13, but their work was interrupted a little after 9:00 p.m. by the New York City blackout of 1977. Electricity would not be restored until the next day, and mixing wouldn&#x27;t resume until July 18 when all remaining studio work was completed on the same day.

Both Quine and Julian played Fender Stratocasters through Fender Champ amplifiers. Quine is usually panned to the right and Julian to the left in the mix, but their positions are reversed on &quot;New Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Down at the Rock and Roll Club.&quot; On &quot;Liars Beware&quot; Julian plays through both channels as he played his rhythm part twice, with slightly heavier playing on the left. Quine plays all the solos except for &quot;Liars&quot; and &quot;Another World,&quot; which Julian does. Julian does all of the soloing on &quot;Another World&quot; except during the outro, where both Julian and Quine play at the same time. Mixed in the center were Bell&#x27;s drums and Hell&#x27;s bass and vocals.

Julian opens &quot;Blank Generation&quot; with a riff loosely inspired by the Who&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;The Seeker&quot;. The rest of the band joins one by one until Quine&#x27;s short lead ends in feedback. The main section of the song features lyrics reflecting the hopelessness of his generation against a descending chord progression patterned after &quot;The Beat Generation&quot;, a 1959 novelty song by Bob McFadden and poet Rod McKuen, the descent matched with falsetto &quot;ooh-ooh&quot; backing vocals. Quine takes two guitar solos—the first eight bars, the second 16—exhibiting his peculiar atonal mix of 1950s rock and roll with 1960s free jazz. The song closes with a falsetto, doo-wop-like &quot;Whee-ooh!&quot; which had been suggested by Johnny Thunders.

== Cover design ==

The original album sleeve features a front cover photo by Bayley of a shirtless Hell in black jeans, opening a frayed jacket to reveal the phrase &quot;YOU MAKE ME _______&quot; written across his chest. The back cover featured a posed photo of Hell and the Voidoids taken by Kate Simon. Hell&#x27;s hair was spiked, a look he attributed to Rimbaud.

== Critical reception ==
In a contemporary review of &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that the Voidoids &quot;make unique music from a reputedly immutable formula, with jagged, shifting rhythms accentuated by Hell&#x27;s indifference to vocal amenities like key and timbre&quot;, and that he intended &quot;to save this record for those very special occasions when I feel like turning into a nervous wreck.&quot;

In the first edition (1979) of &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, Dave Marsh rated it 2 stars out of 5 and described it as &quot;bull-oney&quot;, writing &quot;In the first place, Jack Kerouac said everything here first, and far better. In the second place, Hell is about as whining as Verlaine is pretentious.&quot; However, in a radical and uncharacteristic re-evaluation, the second edition (1983) replaced Marsh&#x27;s review with one from Lester Bangs, who upped the rating to a full 5 stars, labeling it &quot;seminal&quot; and &quot;essential to any modern music collection&quot;, and describing the music as &quot;shattering assaults by a band that prophesied the later No Wave punk-jazz fusion&quot;.

Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the album combines manic William Burroughs-influenced poetry and raw-edged music for the best rock presentation of nihilism and existential angst ever. Hell&#x27;s voice, fluctuating from groan to shriek, is more impassioned and expressive than a legion of Top 40 singers.&quot;

Ben Ratliff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; later wrote that &quot;Blank Generation&quot; &quot;helped define punk, so we&#x27;re often told, but it&#x27;s much more than that: it&#x27;s literary, romantic (boy-girl), Romantic (intellectual tradition) and, because of Robert Quine&#x27;s guitar solos, intensely musical, an album of high-grade improvisation.&quot;

Mark Deming of AllMusic called &quot;Blank Generation&quot; &quot;one of the most powerful [albums] to come from punk&#x27;s first wave&quot; and &quot;groundbreaking punk rock that followed no one&#x27;s template, and today it sounds just as fresh—and nearly as abrasive—as it did when it first hit the racks.&quot; Sid Smith of BBC Music, in a 2007 retrospective review, called it &quot;a thrilling and improbably poignant listening experience&quot;.

== 1990 reissue ==
The 1990 compact disc reissue of &quot;Blank Generation&quot; differed in several respects from the original vinyl album. It sported a different cover, and included two bonus tracks: a version of the pop standard &quot;All the Way&quot; and an original, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. Both were outtakes from the original album sessions. Also, the version of &quot;Down at the Rock &amp; Roll Club&quot; was a noticeably different recording from that which appeared on the original album.

== 2017 reissue ==
In October 2017, it was announced that a 40th anniversary limited edition of the album would be released on CD and vinyl on November 24 for Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday sale. The reissue, mastered by original engineer Greg Calbi, included a second disc of previously unreleased alternate takes, singles-only tracks and rare bootleg live tracks recorded at the band&#x27;s first CBGB performance in 1976, as well as a booklet featuring an essay from Hell, an interview with Ivan Julian conducted by Hell, previously unpublished photos by Bayley, and snapshots of Hell&#x27;s notebooks and private papers.
==Legacy==
Rock critics have held &quot;Blank Generation&quot; in high regard. It has been highly influential, reflecting the kinds of themes that soon became commonplace in punk. Along with such groups as Television, Suicide, the Ramones, the Patti Smith Group, and the Heartbreakers, the Voidoids helped define the early New York punk scene.

Upon the album&#x27;s release, critics such as Velvet Lanier called it &quot;one of the greatest records ever cut&quot;; Jimi LaLumia at &quot;The Village Gate&quot; called the title track &quot;a classic, a unifying lifeline&quot; for the punk scene; and &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;the Future of American rock&quot;. To Joe Ferbacher at &quot;Creem&quot;, &quot;Blank Generation&quot; was evidence that punk was essentially American, and was more authentic than the more commercially successful but less intellectual or philosophical British punk scene.

Punk became a phenomenon in England, with the quick rise and fall of the Sex Pistols and with longer lasting bands such as the Clash. Glen Matlock was inspired to write &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; in 1976 after seeing a handbill containing the names of Hell&#x27;s songs, including &quot;(I Belong To The) Blank Generation&quot;, that Malcolm McLaren had brought back to England with him from the United States. Matlock, nor any of the other Pistols, had actually heard Hell&#x27;s song, as it wasn&#x27;t released on an album until late August 1977. By then, &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; had already been recorded and released as a single two months earlier. Hell was at first offended at how much McLaren had taken from him—musically, lyrically, and visually—but came to accept it, as he believed &quot;ideas are free property&quot;, and praised the band&#x27;s vocalist Johnny Rotten for taking his nihilist persona further than he felt himself able to do. The Voidoids toured England with the Clash in 1977, and during one show, Rotten appeared on stage and goaded the audience into demanding an encore from Hell and his band. The nihilism of &quot;Blank Generation&quot; was echoed in other songs in the early British punk scene such as the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; and Generation X&#x27;s &quot;Your Generation&quot;.

Hell became mired in heroin addiction, and the group did not release another album until 1982&#x27;s &quot;Destiny Street&quot;, by which time punk had passed from headlines in favor of new wave. The album had a weak reception, and Hell turned focus on non-music projects.

Meanwhile, British punk had swept the US and was to largely define its public perception. American bands influenced by British punk proliferated, and the music evolved into genres such as hardcore punk and alternative rock. Many of these bands delved into punk history and paid tribute to the Voidoids and other New York bands, in particular New York-based noise rockers Sonic Youth, whose frontman Thurston Moore had seen the Voidoids live in the 1970s. The Voidoids were a key influence on the Minutemen, whose D. Boon name-dropped Hell in &quot;History Lesson – Part II&quot;.

* All live CBGB recordings were taken from audience cassette recordings. The &quot;Blank Generation&quot; recording from November 19 cut in halfway through the song&#x27;s intro. This was repaired by splicing in an intro from another audience cassette recording of &quot;Blank Generation&quot; that was performed the following night. (It happens at 00:19.)

<doc id="202824" wikidata="Q4750283" url="?curid=202824" title="An die Jugend">
<text>An die Jugend is a sequence (or collection) of pieces of classical music for solo piano by Ferruccio Busoni.

== Plan of the work ==
The collection was written June–August 1909 and consists of four volumes, the last with an epilogue. It was published later in the same year by Zimmermann of Leipzig under four separate catalog numbers (Z 4755, Z 4756, Z 4757, and Z 4781). Each book takes about five minutes to play, and may be played separately, or together as a cycle. As in many other works by Busoni, it is compiled from transcribed, freely adapted, and original music.

* Book 1: Preludietto, Fughetta ed Esercizio - this section uses impressionist harmonies reminiscent of Claude Debussy. In the &quot;Esercizio&quot;, chords suggesting A major in the left hand are juxtaposed with passages in the right based on the whole tone scale.
* Book 2: Preludio, Fuga e Fuga figurata (Studie nach J. S. Bach&#x27;s Wohltemperiertem Klavier) - The &quot;Preludio&quot; and &quot;Fuga&quot; are almost unaltered transcriptions of the D major prelude and fugue from the first book of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. The &quot;Fuga figurata&quot; presents elements of the prelude and fugue simultaneously.
* Book 3: Giga, Bolero e Variazione (Studie nach Mozart) - The &quot;Giga&quot; is based on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Eine kleine Gigue, K. 574&quot;, the &quot;Bolero&quot; is based on the fandango in the Act III finale of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, while the &quot;Variazione&quot; is a variation on the &quot;Giga&quot;.
* Book 4: Introduzione e Capriccio (Paganinesco) &amp; Epilogo - The &quot;Introduzione&quot; is a transcription of the opening of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Caprice No. 11&quot; for solo violin and the &quot;Capriccio&quot; is an arrangement of his &quot;Caprice No. 15&quot;, followed by a return of the material from the &quot;Introduzione,&quot; but in modified and grandiose style. Busoni embellishes the originals, creating a difficult piece reminiscent of the elaborate early versions of Franz Liszt&#x27;s own Paganini transcriptions. In the epilogue, music from Book 1 returns. Although, as before, the harmonic language is impressionist and tonal centres are unclear, the piece closes with a cadence in C major. (The epilogue is omitted, when the books are not played as a cycle.)

== First performance ==
The first performance, of Books 2, 3, and 4 (without &quot;Epilogo&quot;), was on 16 October 1909 in Bechstein Hall, London, with Busoni as the pianist.

== The first Sonatina ==
The materials of Book 1, and the &quot;Epilogo,&quot; all related and highly original compositions, and written in the new style first explored in &quot;Elegien&quot; (BV 249), were later revised and combined with a new introduction and short linking passages presenting the thematic roots of the pieces and gluing them together into a single entity. The new piece, resembling a set of variations without a theme, Busoni entitled &quot;Sonatina&quot; (BV 257). This more advanced and forward-looking composition was the first of what would eventually be six &quot;sonatinas&quot; containing some of the most unusual and original piano music of the early 20th century.

<doc id="202827" wikidata="Q310866" url="?curid=202827" title="Leonid Andreyev">
<text>Leonid Nikolaievich Andreyev (, – 12 September 1919) was a Russian playwright, novelist and short-story writer, who is considered to be a father of Expressionism in Russian literature. He is regarded as one of the most talented and prolific representatives of the Silver Age literary period. Andreyev&#x27;s style combines the elements of realist, naturalist, and symbolist schools in literature. Of his 25 plays, his 1915 play &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; is regarded as his finest achievement.

==Biography==
Born in Oryol, Russia, to a middle-class family, Andreyev originally studied law in Moscow and in Saint Petersburg. His mother hailed from an old Polish aristocratic, though impoverished, family, while she also claimed Ukrainian and Finnish ancestry. He became a police-court reporter for a Moscow daily, performing the routine of his humble calling without attracting any particular attention. At this time he wrote poetry and made a few efforts to publish it, but most publishers rejected his work. In 1898 the newspaper in Moscow published his first short story, &quot;Баргамот и Гараська&quot; (&quot;Bargamot and Garaska&quot;). This story came to the attention of Maxim Gorky who recommended that Andreyev concentrate on his literary work. Andreyev eventually gave up his law practice, fast becoming a literary celebrity, and the two writers remained friends for many years to come. Through Gorky, Andreyev became a member of the Moscow Sreda literary group, and published many of his works in Gorky&#x27;s Znanie collections.

Andreyev&#x27;s first collection of short stories and short novels (&quot;повести&quot;) appeared in 1901, quickly selling a quarter-million copies and making him a literary star in Russia. In 1901 he published &quot;Стена&quot; (&quot;The Wall&quot;), and in 1902, &quot;Бездна&quot; (&quot;The Abyss&quot;) and &quot;В тумане&quot; (&quot;In the Fog&quot;). The last two stories caused great commotion because of their candid and audacious treatment of sex. From 1898-1905 Andreyev published numerous short stories on many subjects, including life in Russian provincial settings, court and prison incidents (where he drew on material from his professional activity), and medical settings. His particular interest in psychology and psychiatry gave him an opportunity to explore insights into the human psyche and to depict memorable personalities who later became classic characters of Russian literature, such as in the 1902 short story &quot;Мысль&quot; (&quot;Thought&quot;).

During the time of the first Russian revolution (1905) Andreyev participated actively in social and political debate as a defender of democratic ideals. Several of his stories, including &quot;The Red Laugh&quot; (&quot;Красный смех&quot;, 1904), &quot;Governor&quot; (&quot;Губернатор&quot;, 1905) and &quot;The Seven Who Were Hanged&quot; (&quot;Рассказ о семи повешенных&quot;, 1908), captured the spirit of this period. Starting from 1905 he also produced many theatre dramas, including &quot;The Life of Man&quot; (1906), &quot;Tsar Hunger&quot; (1907), &quot;Black Masks&quot; (1908), &quot;Anathema&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Days of Our Life&quot; (1909). &quot;The Life of Man&quot; was staged by both Konstantin Stanislavsky (with his Moscow Art Theatre) and Vsevolod Meyerhold (in Saint Petersburg), two leading lights of Russian theatre of the twentieth century, in 1907.

Andreyev&#x27;s works of the post-1905 revolution period are often interpreted to represent the evocation of absolute pessimism and a despairing mood. By the beginning of the second decade of the century his fame began to wane as new literary powers such as the Futurists rapidly came to prominence.

Andreyev completed his most well-known work, the play &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot;, in August 1915, just two months before its world premiere at the Moscow Art Theatre on 27 October 1915. A critically successful Broadway production, using an English language translation of the original Russian by Gregory Zilboorg, was staged in 1922. The work has been adapted into several films, a novel, an opera, and a musical, and is his most-performed play internationally.

Aside from his political writings, Andreyev published little after 1915. In 1916 he became the editor of the literary section of the newspaper &quot;&quot;l. He later supported the February Revolution of 1917, but foresaw the Bolsheviks&#x27; coming to power as catastrophic. In 1917 he moved to Finland. From his house in Finland he addressed manifestos to the world at large against the excesses of the Bolsheviks. An idealist and a rebel, Andreyev spent his last years in bitter poverty, and his premature death from heart failure may have been hastened by his anguish over the results of the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917. He finished his last novel, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a few days before his death.

A play, &quot;The Sorrows of Belgium&quot;, was written at the beginning of the War to celebrate the heroism of the Belgians against the invading German army. It was produced in the United States, as were the plays, &quot;The Life of Man&quot; (1917), &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot; (1922), &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; (1922), and &quot;Anathema&quot; (1923). A popular and acclaimed film version of &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; was produced by MGM Studios in 1924. Some of his works were translated into English by Thomas Seltzer.

&quot;Poor Murderer&quot;, an adaptation of his short story &quot;Thought&quot; made by Pavel Kohout, opened on Broadway in 1976.
He was married to Alexandra Veligorskaia, a niece of Taras Shevchenko. She died of puerperal fever in 1906. They had two sons, Daniil Andreyev, a poet and mystic, author of &quot;Roza Mira&quot;, and Vadim Andreyev. In 1908 Leonid Andreyev married Anna Denisevich, and decided to separate his two little boys, keeping the elder son, Vadim, with him and sending Daniil to live with Aleksandra&#x27;s sister. Vadim Andreyev became a poet. He lived in Paris.

==Influence and legacy==

During the 1914-1929 period, America was avid for anything relating to Edgar Allan Poe and, as Poe&#x27;s Russian equivalent, translations of Andreyev&#x27;s work found a ready audience in the English-speaking world. His work was extensively translated in book form, for instance as &quot;The Crushed Flower, and other stories&quot; (1916); &quot;The Little Angel, and other stories&quot; (1916); &quot;When The King Loses His Head, and other stories&quot; (1920). Translation of his stories were also published in the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine during the 1920s, such as &quot;Lazarus&quot; in the March 1927 edition.

Often referred to as &#x27;a Russian Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;, Andreyev had an influence through translations on two of the great horror writers, H.P. Lovecraft and R.E. Howard. Copies of his &quot;The Seven Who Were Hanged&quot; and &quot;The Red Laugh&quot; were found in the library of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft at his death, as listed in the &quot;Lovecraft&#x27;s Library&quot; catalogue by S.T. Joshi. Andreyev was also one of the seven &quot;most powerful&quot; writers of all time, in the opinion of Robert E. Howard.

Leonid Andreyev&#x27;s granddaughter, daughter of Vadim Andreyev, the American writer and poet Olga Andreyeva Carlisle, published a collection of his short stories, &quot;Visions&quot;, in 1987.

<doc id="202830" wikidata="Q256466" url="?curid=202830" title="Capucine">
<text>Germaine Hélène Irène Lefebvre (, 6 January 1928 – 17 March 1990), known by her stage name Capucine (), was a French fashion model and actress known for her comedic roles in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963) and &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965). She appeared in 36 films and 17 television productions between 1948 and 1990.

==Early life==
Capucine was born Germaine Hélène Irène Lefebvre on 6 January 1928 in Saint-Raphaël, Var, France. She often confused the date of her birth by claiming that she was born in 1931 or 1933, and most sources indicate those years. She attended school in Saumur, France, and earned Bachelor of Arts degree in foreign languages.

In 1945, at age 17, while riding in a carriage in Paris, Lefebvre was noticed by a commercial photographer. Adopting the French name of a flower, &quot;Capucine&quot; (nasturtium, &quot;Tropaeolum&quot;), she became a fashion model, working for the fashion houses Givenchy and Christian Dior.

Capucine met Audrey Hepburn while modeling for Givenchy in Paris. They remained close friends for the rest of Capucine&#x27;s life.

==Career==
===Early films===
Capucine made her film debut in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Eagle with Two Heads&quot; (1948), in a small, unbilled role. She also appeared in Jacques Becker&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous in July&quot; (1949) and Robert Dhéry&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Show&quot; (1949).

She was in Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon&#x27;s &quot;My Friend Sainfoin&quot; (1950) and Dhéry&#x27;s &quot;Bernard and the Lion&quot; (1951).

After a break of a few years, Capucine appeared in &quot;Mademoiselle from Paris&quot; (1955) and &quot;Frou-Frou&quot; (1955).

===Rise to fame===
In 1957, film producer Charles K. Feldman spotted Capucine while she was modeling in New York City. Feldman put her under contract at $150 a week. He brought her to Hollywood to learn English and study acting under Gregory Ratoff. She took the stage name &quot;Capucine&quot;, saying, &quot;Two names are interesting and I hope one is interesting.&quot;

She signed a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures in 1958. After unsuccessfully auditioning for the role of Feathers in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), she landed her first English-speaking role in the film &quot;Song Without End&quot; (1960), a biopic of Franz Liszt, where Capucine played Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. Producer William Goetz said, &quot;You can teach a girl to act, but nobody can teach her how to look like a princess. You&#x27;ve got to start with a girl who looks like a princess.&quot;

&quot;Every time I get in front of the camera, I think of it as an attractive man I am meeting for the first time,&quot; she said in 1960. &quot;I find him demanding and aloof, so I must do all I can to interest him.&quot; &quot;I got much better as we went on,&quot; she said. &quot;As the scenes warmed up, so did I.&quot;

In 1960, she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

Capucine followed this with &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960), a comedy that had been set up with her in mind by Feldman at 20th Century Fox. She played a French prostitute who becomes the love interest of John Wayne. Directed by Henry Hathaway, it was successful at the box office.

Capucine returned to Europe to co-star in &quot;Le triomphe de Michel Strogoff&quot; (1961) with Curd Jürgens, a sequel to &quot;Michel Strogoff&quot; (1956).

Back in Hollywood, she had second billing in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1962), produced by Feldman, in which she portrayed a redeemed hooker. Co-star Laurence Harvey complained that Feldman cut his part to expand Capucine&#x27;s role.

She was then William Holden&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962). During filming, Capucine began a romance with Holden, which led to the end of her romantic relationship with Feldman; however, the producer remained loyal professionally.

Feldman announced he would put Capucine in &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot; and &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;, but neither happened.

She moved to Switzerland in 1962.
Blake Edwards cast Capucine in &quot;The Pink Panther,&quot; playing Inspector Clouseau&#x27;s wife, who is having an affair with a jewel thief, played by David Niven. It was a huge hit, and led to a number of sequels. In 1964, Capucine said the directors she had learned most from were Edwards and Henry Hathaway.

Capucine was reunited with Holden in &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964), produced by Feldman; it was a box office disappointment. Another film she did for Feldman, the comedy &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965), which co-starred Sellers and Peter O&#x27;Toole, was far more successful; it was filmed entirely in France.

Capucine was one of several European stars in &quot;Sex Quartet&quot; (1966) for Columbia (originally &quot;The Queens&quot;), then Feldman put her in &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. She was announced for Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, but did not appear in the film.

Feldman died in May 1968, and Capucine&#x27;s career never regained its former momentum. She inherited the rights to the book &quot;Zandy&quot; from his estate and sold them to the makers of &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot;.

===Later career===
Capucine had a supporting role in &quot;Fräulein Doktor&quot; (1968) and the lead in the Spanish thriller &quot;The Exquisite Cadaver&quot; (1969). She was in the supporting cast of &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot; (1969). Fellini said, &quot;She had a face to launch a thousand ships...but she was born too late.&quot;

In 1968, she told an Italian magazine she wished she did not always have to be elegant, that she longed to play a &quot;disheveled woman,&quot; but &quot;since the directors know I was a model, it is obvious that they can&#x27;t see me as anything else.&quot;

Dirk Bogarde suggested her for the role of Tadzio&#x27;s mother in &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971), but Luchino Visconti turned her down, saying, &quot;She has a horrible voice and too many teeth. She looks like a horse, a beautiful horse, I know that, I was a trainer. I know all about horses, but I don&#x27;t want a horse.&quot;

Capucine had a supporting role in the Western &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1971) and guest-starred on &quot;Search&quot; (1972), her first TV series.

She supported Jean-Paul Belmondo in &quot;Incorrigible&quot; (1975) and Richard Burton in &quot;Jackpot&quot;, which was ultimately abandoned.

She appeared on television in &quot;Cinéma 16&quot; and &quot;La pêche miraculeuse&quot; (1976), and had roles in &quot;The Con Artists&quot; (1976), &quot;Per amore&quot; (1976), &quot;Ecco noi per esempio&quot; (1977), &quot;Nest of Vipers&quot; (1978), &quot;From Hell to Victory&quot; (1979), &quot;Atrocious Tales of Love and Death&quot; (1979), &quot;Neapolitan Mystery&quot; (1979), &quot;Arabian Adventure&quot; (1979), &quot;Jaguar Lives!&quot; (1979), and &quot;Martin Eden&quot; (1979).

Capucine appeared in episodes of &quot;Orient Express&quot; (1980); &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1982); and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1985), as well as the 1986 miniseries &quot;Sins&quot;.

She went to Europe to make &quot;Les invités&quot; (1982), &quot;Aphrodite&quot; (1982), &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982), and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983).

Capucine appears in episodes of &quot;Série noire&quot;; &quot;Voglia di cantare&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;; &quot;Sins&quot;; &quot;Delirium&quot; (1987); &quot;My First Forty Years&quot; (1987); &quot;Gila and Rik&quot; (1987); &quot;Una verità come un&#x27;altra&quot; (1989); &quot;Quartier nègre&quot; (1989); &quot;Blaues Blut&quot; (1990); and &quot;Il giudice istruttore&quot;.

==Personal life==
Capucine met Pierre Trabaud on the set of &quot;Rendez-vous&quot; (1949) and they married the next year. The marriage lasted only eight months, and she never married again.

She had a relationship with Charles K. Feldman, who produced her films &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot;, and &quot;The Honey Pot&quot;. This affair ended when Capucine met William Holden, but she and Feldman remained friends until his death in 1968. He left her $75,000 ().

Capucine met actor William Holden in the early 1960s. They starred in the films &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962) and &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964). Holden was married to Brenda Marshall, but the two began a two-year affair, which ended in part due to Holden&#x27;s increasing alcoholism. After the affair ended, she and Holden remained friends until his death in 1981. In his will, he left her $50,000 ().

==Death==
On 17 March 1990, at age 62, Capucine jumped to her death from her eighth-floor apartment in Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland, where she had lived for 28 years, having reportedly suffered from illness and depression for some time. The police said an investigation left no doubt that she died by suicide. Neighbours said she had led a reclusive life with her three cats, hardly ever leaving her apartment and spending most of her time reading.

<text>Metamorphism is the transformation of existing rock (the protolith) to rock with a different mineral composition or texture. Metamorphism takes place at temperatures in excess of , and often also at elevated pressure or in the presence of chemically active fluids, but the rock remains mostly solid during the transformation. Metamorphism is distinct from weathering or diagenesis, which are changes that take place at or just beneath Earth&#x27;s surface.

Various forms of metamorphism exist, including regional, contact, hydrothermal, shock, and dynamic metamorphism. These differ in the characteristic temperatures, pressures, and rate at which they take place and in the extent to which reactive fluids are involved. Metamorphism occurring at increasing pressure and temperature conditions is known as &quot;prograde metamorphism&quot;, while decreasing temperature and pressure characterize &quot;retrograde metamorphism&quot;.

Metamorphic petrology is the study of metamorphism. Metamorphic petrologists rely heavily on statistical mechanics and experimental petrology to understand metamorphic processes.

==Metamorphic processes==
Metamorphism is the set of processes by which existing rock is transformed physically or chemically at elevated temperature, without actually melting to any great degree. The importance of heating in the formation of metamorphic rock was first recognized by the pioneering Scottish naturalist, James Hutton, who is often described as the father of modern geology. Hutton wrote in 1795 that some rock beds of the Scottish Highlands had originally been sedimentary rock, but had been transformed by great heat.

Hutton also speculated that pressure was important in metamorphism. This hypothesis was tested by his friend, James Hall, who sealed chalk into a makeshift pressure vessel constructed from a cannon barrel and heated it in an iron foundry furnace. Hall found that this produced a material strongly resembling marble, rather than the usual quicklime produced by heating of chalk in the open air. French geologists subsequently added metasomatism, the circulation of fluids through buried rock, to the list of processes that help bring about metamorphism. However, metamorphism can take place without metasomatism (isochemical metamorphism) or at depths of just a few hundred meters where pressures are relatively low (for example, in contact metamorphism).

Rock can be transformed without melting because heat causes atomic bonds to break, freeing the atoms to move and form new bonds with other atoms. Pore fluid present between mineral grains is an important medium through which atoms are exchanged. This permits recrystallization of existing minerals or crystallization of new minerals with different crystalline structures or chemical compositions (neocrystallization). The transformation converts the minerals in the protolith into forms that are more stable (closer to chemical equilibrium) under the conditions of pressure and temperature at which metamorphism takes place.

Metamorphism is generally regarded to begin at temperatures of . This excludes diagenetic changes due to compaction and lithification, which result in the formation of sedimentary rocks. The upper boundary of metamorphic conditions lies at the solidus of the rock, which is the temperature at which the rock begins to melt. At this point, the process becomes an igneous process. The solidus temperature depends on the composition of the rock, the pressure, and whether the rock is saturated with water. Typical solidus temperatures range from for wet granite at a few hundred megapascals (MPa) of pressure to about for wet basalt at atmospheric pressure. Migmatites are rocks formed at this upper limit, which contains pods and veins of material that has started to melt but has not fully segregated from the refractory residue.

The metamorphic process can occur at almost any pressure, from near surface pressure (for contact metamorphism) to pressures in excess of 16 kbar (1600 MPa).

===Recrystallization===
The change in the grain size and orientation in the rock during the process of metamorphism is called recrystallization. For instance, the small calcite crystals in the sedimentary rocks limestone and chalk change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock marble. In metamorphosed sandstone, recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite, also known as metaquartzite, in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked. Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization. High temperatures allow the atoms and ions in solid crystals to migrate, thus reorganizing the crystals, while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their points of contact (&quot;pressure solution&quot;) and redeposition in pore space.

During recrystallization, the identity of the mineral does not change, only its texture. Recrystallization generally begins when temperatures reach above half the melting point of the mineral on the Kelvin scale.

Pressure solution begins during diagenesis (the process of lithification of sediments into sedimentary rock) but is completed during early stages of metamorphism. For a sandstone protolith, the dividing line between diagenesis and metamorphism can be placed at the point where strained quartz grains begin to be replaced by new, unstrained, small quartz grains, producing a &quot;mortar texture&quot; that can be identified in thin sections under a polarizing microscope. With increasing grade of metamorphism, further recrystallization produces &quot;foam texture&quot;, characterized by polygonal grains meeting at triple junctions, and then &quot;porphyroblastic texture&quot;, characterized by coarse, irregular grains, including some larger grains (porphyroblasts.)
Metamorphic rocks are typically more coarsely crystalline than the protolith from which they formed. Atoms in the interior of a crystal are surrounded by a stable arrangement of neighboring atoms. This is partially missing at the surface of the crystal, producing a &quot;surface energy&quot; that makes the surface thermodynamically unstable. Recrystallization to coarser crystals reduces the surface area and so minimizes the surface energy.

Although grain coarsening is a common result of metamorphism, rock that is intensely deformed may eliminate strain energy by recrystallizing as a fine-grained rock called &quot;mylonite&quot;. Certain kinds of rock, such as those rich in quartz, carbonate minerals, or olivine, are particularly prone to form mylonites, while feldspar and garnet are resistant to mylonitization.
===Phase change===
Phase change metamorphism is the creating of a new mineral with the same chemical formula as a mineral of the protolith. This involves a rearrangement of the atoms in the crystals. An example is provided by the aluminium silicate minerals, kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite. All three have the identical composition, . Kyanite is stable at surface conditions. However, at atmospheric pressure, kyanite transforms to andalusite at a temperature of about . Andalusite, in turn, transforms to sillimanite when the temperature reaches about . At pressures above about 4 kbar (400 MPa), kyanite transforms directly to sillimanite as the temperature increases. A similar phase change is sometimes seen between calcite and aragonite, with calcite transforming to aragonite at elevated pressure and relatively low temperature.

===Neocrystallization===
Neocrystallization involves the creation of new mineral crystals different from the protolith. Chemical reactions digest the minerals of the protolith which yields new minerals. This is a very slow process as it can also involve the diffusion of atoms through solid crystals.

An example of a neocrystallization reaction is the reaction of fayalite with plagioclase at elevated pressure and temperature to form garnet. The reaction is:

Many complex high-temperature reactions may take place between minerals without them melting, and each mineral assemblage produced provides us with a clue as to the temperatures and pressures at the time of metamorphism. These reactions are possible because of rapid diffusion of atoms at elevated temperature. Pore fluid between mineral grains can be an important medium through which atoms are exchanged.

A particularly important group of neocrystallization reactions are those that release volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide. During metamorphism of basalt to eclogite in subduction zones, hydrous minerals break down, producing copious quantities of water. The water rises into the overlying mantle, where it lowers the melting temperature of the mantle rock, generating magma via flux melting. The mantle-derived magmas can ultimately reach the Earth&#x27;s surface, resulting in volcanic eruptions. The resulting arc volcanoes tend to produce dangerous eruptions, because their high water content makes them extremely explosive.

Examples of &quot;dehydration reactions&quot; that release water include:

An example of a decarbonation reaction is:

===Plastic deformation===
In plastic deformation pressure is applied to the protolith, which causes it to shear or bend, but not break. In order for this to happen temperatures must be high enough that brittle fractures do not occur, but not so high that diffusion of crystals takes place.
As with pressure solution, the early stages of plastic deformation begin during diagenesis.

==Types==

===Regional===
&quot;Regional metamorphism&quot; is a general term for metamorphism that affects entire regions of the Earth&#x27;s crust. It most often refers to &quot;dynamothermal metamorphism&quot;, which takes place in &quot;orogenic belts&quot; (regions where mountain building is taking place), but also includes &quot;burial metamorphism&quot;, which results simply from rock being buried to great depths below the Earth&#x27;s surface in a subsiding basin.

====Dynamothermal====

To many geologists, regional metamorphism is practically synonymous with dynamothermal metamorphism. This form of metamorphism takes place at convergent plate boundaries, where two continental plates or a continental plate and an island arc collide. The collision zone becomes a belt of mountain formation called an &quot;orogeny&quot;. The orogenic belt is characterized by thickening of the Earth&#x27;s crust, during which the deeply buried crustal rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures and is intensely deformed. Subsequent erosion of the mountains exposes the roots of the orogenic belt as extensive outcrops of metamorphic rock, characteristic of mountain chains.

Metamorphic rock formed in these settings tends to shown well-developed foliation. Foliation develops when a rock is being shortened along one axis during metamorphism. This causes crystals of platy minerals, such as mica and chlorite, to become rotated such that their short axes are parallel to the direction of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated, rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them. Foliated rock often develops planes of cleavage. Slate is an example of a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale, and it typically shows well-developed cleavage that allows slate to be split into thin plates.

The type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone, the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: The mudstone is first converted to slate, which is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism. Slate in turn is converted to phyllite, which is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism. Schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism. High-grade metamorphism transforms the rock to gneiss, which is coarse to very coarse-grained.

Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Marble lacks platy minerals and is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.

Collisional orogenies are preceded by subduction of oceanic crust. The conditions within the subducting slab as it plunges toward the mantle in a subduction zone produce their own distinctive regional metamorphic effects, characterized by paired metamorphic belts.

The pioneering work of George Barrow on regional metamorphism in the Scottish Highlands showed that some regional metamorphism produces well-defined, mappable zones of increasing metamorphic grade. This &quot;Barrovian metamorphism&quot; is the most recognized metamorphic series in the world. However, Barrovian metamorphism is specific to pelitic rock, formed from mudstone or siltstone, and it is not unique even in pelitic rock. A different sequence in the northeast of Scotland defines &quot;Buchan metamorphism&quot;, which took place at lower pressure than the Barrovian.

====Burial====

Burial metamorphism takes place simply through rock being buried to great depths below the Earth&#x27;s surface in a subsiding basin. Here the rock is subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure caused by the immense weight of the rock layers above. Burial metamorphism tends to produce low-grade metamorphic rock. This shows none of the effects of deformation and folding so characteristic of dynamothermal metamorphism.

Examples of metamorphic rocks formed by burial metamorphism include some of the rocks of the Midcontinent Rift System of North America, such as the Sioux Quartzite, and in the Hamersley Basin of Australia.

===Contact===


&quot;Contact metamorphism&quot; occurs typically around intrusive igneous rocks as a result of the temperature increase caused by the intrusion of magma into cooler country rock. The area surrounding the intrusion where the contact metamorphism effects are present is called the metamorphic aureole, the contact aureole, or simply the aureole. Contact metamorphic rocks are usually known as hornfels. Rocks formed by contact metamorphism may not present signs of strong deformation and are often fine-grained and extremely tough. The Yule Marble used on the Lincoln Memorial exterior and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery was formed by contact metamorphism.

Contact metamorphism is greater adjacent to the intrusion and dissipates with distance from the contact. The size of the aureole depends on the heat of the intrusion, its size, and the temperature difference with the wall rocks. Dikes generally have small aureoles with minimal metamorphism, extending not more than one or two dike thicknesses into the surrounding rock, whereas the aureoles around batholiths can be up to several kilometers wide.

The metamorphic grade of an aureole is measured by the peak metamorphic mineral which forms in the aureole. This is usually related to the metamorphic temperatures of pelitic or aluminosilicate rocks and the minerals they form. The metamorphic grades of aureoles at shallow depth are albite-epidote hornfels, hornblende hornfels, pyroxene hornfels, and sillimanite hornfels, in increasing order of temperature of formation. However, the albite-epidote hornfels is often not formed, even though it is the lowest temperature grade.

Magmatic fluids coming from the intrusive rock may also take part in the metamorphic reactions. An extensive addition of magmatic fluids can significantly modify the chemistry of the affected rocks. In this case the metamorphism grades into metasomatism. If the intruded rock is rich in carbonate the result is a skarn. Fluorine-rich magmatic waters which leave a cooling granite may often form greisens within and adjacent to the contact of the granite. Metasomatic altered aureoles can localize the deposition of metallic ore minerals and thus are of economic interest.

&quot;Fenitization&quot;, or &quot;Na-metasomatism&quot;, is a distinctive form of contact metamorphism accompanied by metasomatism. It takes place around intrusions of a rare type of magma called a &quot;carbonatite&quot; that is highly enriched in carbonates and low in silica. Cooling bodies of carbonatite magma give off highly alkaline fluids rich in sodium as they solidify, and the hot, reactive fluid replaces much of the mineral content in the aureole with sodium-rich minerals.

A special type of contact metamorphism, associated with fossil fuel fires, is known as pyrometamorphism.

===Hydrothermal===
&quot;Hydrothermal metamorphism&quot; is the result of the interaction of a rock with a high-temperature fluid of variable composition. The difference in composition between an existing rock and the invading fluid triggers a set of metamorphic and metasomatic reactions. The hydrothermal fluid may be magmatic (originate in an intruding magma), circulating groundwater, or ocean water. Convective circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the ocean floor basalts produces extensive hydrothermal metamorphism adjacent to spreading centers and other submarine volcanic areas. The fluids eventually escape through vents on the ocean floor known as black smokers. The patterns of this hydrothermal alteration are used as a guide in the search for deposits of valuable metal ores.

===Shock===

&quot;Shock metamorphism&quot; occurs when an extraterrestrial object (a meteorite for instance) collides with the Earth&#x27;s surface. Impact metamorphism is, therefore, characterized by ultrahigh pressure conditions and low temperature. The resulting minerals (such as SiO2 polymorphs coesite and stishovite) and textures are characteristic of these conditions.

===Dynamic===
&quot;Dynamic metamorphism&quot; is associated with zones of high strain such as fault zones. In these environments, mechanical deformation is more important than chemical reactions in transforming the rock. The minerals present in the rock often do not reflect conditions of chemical equilibrium, and the textures produced by dynamic metamorphism are more significant than the mineral makeup.

There are three deformation mechanisms by which rock is mechanically deformed. These are &quot;cataclasis&quot;, the deformation of rock via the fracture and rotation of mineral grains; plastic deformation of individual mineral crystals; and movement of individual atoms by diffusive processes. The textures of dynamic metamorphic zones are dependent on the depth at which they were formed, as the temperature and confining pressure determine the deformation mechanisms which predominate.

At the shallowest depths, a fault zone will be filled with various kinds of unconsolidated cataclastic rock, such as &quot;fault gouge&quot; or &quot;fault breccia&quot;. At greater depths, these are replaced by consolidated cataclastic rock, such as &quot;crush breccia&quot;, in which the larger rock fragments are cemented together by calcite or quartz. At depths greater than about , &quot;cataclasites&quot; appear; these are quite hard rocks consist of crushed rock fragments in a flinty matrix, which forms only at elevated temperature. At still greater depths, where temperatures exceed , plastic deformation takes over, and the fault zone is composed of mylonite. Mylonite is distinguished by its strong foliation, which is absent in most cataclastic rock. It is distinguished from the surrounding rock by its finer grain size.

There is considerable evidence that cataclasites form as much through plastic deformation and recrystallization as brittle fracture of grains, and that the rock may never fully lose cohesion during the process. Different minerals become ductile at different temperatures, with quartz being among the first to become ductile, and sheared rock composed of different minerals may simultaneously show both plastic deformation and brittle fracture.

The strain rate also affects the way in which rocks deform. Ductile deformation is more likely at low strain rates (less than 10−14 sec−1) in the middle and lower crust, but high strain rates can cause brittle deformation. At the highest strain rates, the rock may be so strongly heated that it briefly melts, forming a glassy rock called &quot;pseudotachylite&quot;. Pseudotachylites seem to be restricted to dry rock, such as granulite.

==Classification of metamorphic rocks==

Metamorphic rocks are classified by their protolith, if this can be determined from the properties of the rock itself. For example, if examination of a metamorphic rock shows that its protolith was basalt, it will be described as a metabasalt. When the protolith cannot be determined, the rock is classified by its mineral composition or its degree of foliation.

===Metamorphic grades===
Metamorphic grade is an informal indication of the amount or degree of metamorphism.

In the Barrovian sequence (described by George Barrow in zones of progressive metamorphism in Scotland), metamorphic grades are also classified by mineral assemblage based on the appearance of key minerals in rocks of pelitic (shaly, aluminous) origin:

Low grade ------------------- Intermediate --------------------- High grade
:Greenschist ------------- Amphibolite ----------------------- Granulite
:Slate --- Phyllite ---------- Schist ---------------------- Gneiss --- Migmatite
:Chlorite zone
::::Biotite zone
:::::::Garnet zone
::::::::::Staurolite zone
:::::::::::::Kyanite zone
::::::::::::::::Sillimanite zone

A more complete indication of this intensity or degree is provided by the concept of metamorphic facies.

===Metamorphic facies===

Metamorphic facies are recognizable terranes or zones with an assemblage of key minerals that were in equilibrium under specific range of temperature and pressure during a metamorphic event. The facies are named after the metamorphic rock formed under those facies conditions from basalt.

The particular mineral assemblage is somewhat dependent on the composition of that protolith, so that (for example) the amphibolite facies of a marble will not be identical with the amphibolite facies of a pellite. However, the facies are defined such that metamorphic rock with as broad a range of compositions as is practical can be assigned to a particular facies. The present definition of metamorphic facies is largely based on the work of the Finnish geologist, Pentti Eskola in 1921, with refinements based on subsequent experimental work. Eskola drew upon the zonal schemes, based on index minerals, that were pioneered by the British geologist, George Barrow.

The metamorphic facies is not usually considered when classifying metamorphic rock based on protolith, mineral mode, or texture. However, a few metamorphic facies produce rock of such distinctive character that the facies name is used for the rock when more precise classification is not possible. The chief examples are amphibolite and eclogite. The British Geological Survey strongly discourages use of &quot;granulite&quot; as a classification for rock metamorphosed to the granulite facies. Instead, such rock will often be classified as a granofels. However, this is not universally accepted.


See diagram for more detail.

===Prograde and retrograde===
Metamorphism is further divided into prograde and retrograde metamorphism. Prograde metamorphism involves the change of mineral assemblages (paragenesis) with increasing temperature and (usually) pressure conditions. These are solid state dehydration reactions, and involve the loss of volatiles such as water or carbon dioxide. Prograde metamorphism results in rock characteristic of the maximum pressure and temperature experienced. Metamorphic rocks usually do not undergo further change when they are brought back to the surface.

Retrograde metamorphism involves the reconstitution of a rock via revolatisation under decreasing temperatures (and usually pressures), allowing the mineral assemblages formed in prograde metamorphism to revert to those more stable at less extreme conditions. This is a relatively uncommon process, because volatiles produced during prograde metamorphism usually migrate out of the rock and are not available to recombine with the rock during cooling. Localized retrograde metamorphism can take place when fractures in the rock provide a pathway for groundwater to enter the cooling rock.

==Equilibrium mineral assemblages==

Metamorphic processes act to bring the protolith closer to thermodynamic equilibrium, which is its state of maximum stability. For example, shear stress (nonhydrodynamic stress) is incompatible with thermodynamic equilibrium, so sheared rock will tend to deform in ways that relieve the shear stress. The most stable assemblage of minerals for a rock of a given composition is that which minimizes the Gibbs free energy

formula_1

where:
*&quot;U&quot; is the internal energy (SI unit: joule),
* &quot;p&quot; is pressure (SI unit: pascal),
* &quot;V&quot; is volume (SI unit: m3),
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature (SI unit: kelvin),
* &quot;S&quot; is the entropy (SI unit: joule per kelvin),

In other words, a metamorphic reaction will take place only if it lowers the total Gibbs free energy of the protolith. Recrystallization to coarser crystals lowers the Gibbs free energy by reducing surface energy, while phase changes and neocrystallization reduce the bulk Gibbs free energy. A reaction will begin at the temperature and pressure where the Gibbs free energy of the reagents becomes greater than that of the products.

A mineral phase will generally be more stable if it has a lower internal energy, reflecting tighter binding between its atoms. Phases with a higher density (expressed as a lower molar volume &quot;V&quot;) are more stable at higher pressure, while minerals with a less ordered structure (expressed as a higher entropy &quot;S&quot;) are favored at high temperature. Thus andalusite is stable only at low pressure, since it has the lowest density of any aluminium silicate polymorph, while sillimanite is the stable form at higher temperatures, since it has the least ordered structure.

The Gibbs free energy of a particular mineral at a specified temperature and pressure can be expressed by various analytic formulas. These are calibrated against experimentally measured properties and phase boundaries of mineral assemblages. The equilibrium mineral assemblage for a given bulk composition of rock at a specified temperature and pressure can then be calculated on a computer.

However, it is often very useful to represent equilibrium mineral assemblages using various kinds of diagrams. These include petrogenetic grids and compatibility diagrams (compositional phase diagrams.)

=== Petrogenetic grids ===
A petrogenetic grid is a geologic phase diagram that plots experimentally derived metamorphic reactions at their pressure and temperature conditions for a given rock composition. This allows metamorphic petrologists to determine the pressure and temperature conditions under which rocks metamorphose. The Al2SiO5 nesosilicate phase diagram shown is a very simple petrogenetic grid for rocks that only have a composition consisting of aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), and oxygen (O). As the rock undergoes different temperatures and pressure, it could be any of the three given polymorphic minerals. For a rock that contains multiple phases, the boundaries between many phase transformations may be plotted, though the petrogenetic grid quickly becomes complicated. For example, a petrogenetic grid might show both the aluminium silicate phase transitions and the transition from aluminum silicate plus potassium feldspar to muscovite plus quartz.

=== Compatibility diagrams ===

Whereas a petrogenetic grid shows phases for a single composition over a range of temperature and pressure, a &quot;compatibility diagram&quot; shows how the mineral assemblage varies with composition at a fixed temperature and pressure. Compatibility diagrams provide an excellent way to analyze how variations in the rock&#x27;s composition affect the mineral paragenesis that develops in a rock at particular pressure and temperature conditions. Because of the difficulty of depicting more than three components (as a ternary diagram), usually only the three most important components are plotted, though occasionally a compatibility diagram for four components is plotted as a projected tetrahedron.

<doc id="202834" wikidata="Q431192" url="?curid=202834" title="Orléanist">
<text>Orléanist () was a 19th-century French political label originally used by those who supported a constitutional monarchy expressed by the House of Orléans. Due to the radical political changes that occurred during that century in France, three different phases of Orléanism can be identified:
* The &quot;pure&quot; Orléanism: constituted by those who supported the constitutional reign of Louis Philippe I (18301848) after the 1830 July Revolution, and who showed liberal and moderate ideas.
* The &quot;fusionist&quot; (or &quot;unionist&quot;) Orléanism: the movement formed by pure Orléanists and by those Legitimists who after the childless death of Henri, Count of Chambord in 1883 endorsed Philippe, Count of Paris, grandson of Louis Philippe, as his successor. The fusion drove the Orleanist movement to more conservative stances, emphasising French nationality (rejecting claims to France of the Spanish Bourbons on account of their &quot;foreigness&quot;) and Catholicism.
* The &quot;progressive&quot; Orléanism: the majority of &quot;fusionists&quot; who, after the decline of monarchist sentiment in the 1890s, joined into moderate republicans, who showed progressive and secular-minded goals, or into Catholic rally, like the Liberal Action.

Orleanism was opposed by the two other monarchist trends: the more conservative Legitimism that was loyal to the eldest branch of the House of Bourbon after 1830, and the Bonapartism that supported Napoleon’s legacy and heirs.

==Under the July Monarchy==

On 26 July 1830, the revolution of the so-called Three Glorious Days (or July Revolution) erupted due to the authoritarian and anti-Gallican tendencies showed by Charles X and his Prime Minister Jules de Polignac, expressed by the recently approved Saint-Cloud Ordinances. Despite the abdication of Charles X and the Dauphin Louis in favor to Charles X&#x27;s grandson Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, on 2 August 1830, only seven days later Louis Philippe I, still Duke of Orléans, was elected by the Chamber of Deputies as new &quot;King of the French&quot;. The enthronement of Louis Philippe was strongly wanted by &quot;Doctrinaires&quot;, the liberal opposition to Charles X&#x27;s ministries, under the concept &quot;nationalize the monarchy and royalize France&quot;. On 14 August 1830, the Chamber approved a new Constitution, which became the &quot;de facto&quot; political manifesto for the Orléanists, containing the basis for a constitutional monarchy with a central Parliament. The Orléanism, became the dominant tendency within political life, easily divided inside the Chamber of Deputies between the centre-left of Adolphe Thiers and the centre-right of François Guizot. Louis Philippe showed himself more aligned with Guizot, entrusted to the higher offices of government, and rapidly became associated with the rising &quot;new men&quot; of the banks, industries and finance, gaining the epithet of &quot;Roi bourgeois&quot;. In the early 1840s, Louis Philippe&#x27;s popularity decreased, due to his strong connection to upper classes and repression against workers&#x27; strikes, and showed few concerns for his weakened position, leading the writer Victor Hugo to describe him as &quot;a man with many little qualities&quot;. The Orléanist regime finally fell in 1848, when a revolution erupted and on 24 February Louis Philippe abdicated in favor to his grandson Philippe, Count of Paris, under regency of his mother Helene, Duchess of Orléans, who was quickly ousted out from the Chamber of Deputies during the regency&#x27;s formalization, who was interrupted by republican deputies who instead proclaimed the Second Republic.

After 18 years of reign, Louis Philippe left the Orléanist base well-defined inside the magistrature, the press, universities and academies, especially the &quot;Académie française&quot;. However, also some great aristocratic families joined the court, like the Dukes of Broglie, as well former Bonapartist officers like the Marshal Soult and Édouard Mortier. This establishment constituted the majority of the Party of Order, led by Thiers, who represented the conservatives and monarchists under the Second Republic.

==Under the Third Republic==
===Fusion and restoration project===

Orléanism revived after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 which caused the fall of the Second Empire which had succeeded to the Second Republic under Emperor Napoleon III, the former president of France who had been enthroned after the coup d&#x27;état of 1851. The Second Empire was succeeded itself officially in 1871 by the Third Republic. A National Assembly, composed by 638 on 778 seats, was formed and new elections were called for the 8 February of the same year, which resulted in a victory for the monarchist right: 396 seats won, divided to 214 Orléanists and 182 Legitimists, nicknamed &quot;cavalrymen&quot;. Initially divided about the dynastic issue, the Orléanists found a compromise with the Legitimists, supporting the rights of Henri, Count of Chambord (former Duke of Bordeaux, currently childless) in return of the recognition of the Count of Paris as his heir, echoing an 1862 statement of Chambord. Although Chambord never mentioned the Count of Paris as his heir, probably fearing the defection of his ultraconservative supporters, the informal agreement sanctioned the &quot;fusion&quot; of Legitimists and Orléanists, who quite easily formed a conservative coalition.
The monarchist majority, led by the Duke of Aumale (son of Louis Philippe), and the centre-left endorsed the centre-right candidate Thiers as president of the Republic, but due to the continued arguments between Legitimists and Orléanists and the memory of the dynastic divisions of the past 40 years, Thiers moved to support a &quot;conservative republic&quot; instead of a divided monarchy.

Due to Chambord&#x27;s dislike of Aumale, the &quot;fusionists&quot; rapidly passed under the leadership of the Duke of Broglie, who in 1873 successfully managed the election of President Patrice de MacMahon, former general and national hero who showed Legitimist sympathies, considering him as a kind of &quot;lieutenant-general of the kingdom&quot; before the fully restoration of Chambord on the throne. Broglie was shortly after awarded with the premiership by MacMahon, supported by monarchists and the centre-right. Restoration appeared imminent when a parliamentary commission was established in October 1873 to adopt a monarchist constitution. But in the same month the majority was weakened by the refusal of Chambord to accept the French Tricolour, used since 1830, preferring instead the return of the royal white flag, symbol of the Ancien Régime. The question was apparently resolved with a compromise between Broglie and Chambord: the last will accept the tricolour flag while a future agreement about a new flag will be considered. In October the majority was shocked when the centre-right representative Charles Savary rashly misinformed the press of Chambord&#x27;s full acceptance of the tricolour flag. The pretender had to harshly clarify his position, causing the left of the centre-right, Orléanists disappointment and the dissolution of the &quot;restoration&quot; commission on 31 October 1873. A last attempt by Chambord was made on 12 November, when he asked President MacMahon via the Duke of Blacas to join with him into the National Assembly and spoke toward the representatives, hoping to convince them to restore the monarchy, but MacMahon refused due to his institutional position, toward he was formally even if not ideologically attached, causing the project&#x27;s failure. Due to the impossibility to restore the monarchy in a short time, the Orléanists waited the death of the sickly Chambord, occurred in 1883, but by that time, enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded, and as a result the Count of Paris was never offered the French throne.

The monarchists, however, still controlled the National Assembly, and under MacMahon&#x27;s partisan presidency they launched the so-called &quot;moral order government&quot;, in reference to the Paris Commune, whose political and social innovations were viewed as morally degenerate by large conservative segments of the French population.
In February 1875, a series of parliamentary acts established the constitutional laws of the new republic. At its head was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament consisting of a directly elected Chamber of Deputies and an indirectly-elected Senate was created, along with a ministry under the President of the council (prime minister), who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and the legislature. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of whether a monarchy should replace the republic dominated public debate.
On 16 May 1877, with public opinion swinging heavily in favour of a republic after the election of March, President MacMahon made one last desperate attempt to salvage the monarchical cause by dismissing the &quot;conservative republican&quot; prime minister Jules Simon and appointing the Duke of Broglie to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election for the following October. If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the president being accused of having staged a constitutional coup d&#x27;état known as &quot;16 May Crisis&quot; after the date on which it happened. Republicans returned triumphantly after the October elections for the Chamber of Deputies. The crisis ultimately sealed the defeat of the royalist movement, and was instrumental in creating the conditions of the longevity of the Third Republic: in January 1879 the Republicans gained control of the Senate, formerly monopolized by monarchists. MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the hands of Jules Grévy, leader of the Republican Left.

The end of the presidency of MacMahon and the Senate&#x27;s loss caused the end of the monarchist bloc. Although there were Orléanist deputies in the Chamber for all the 19th century, they were only a minority. At the end, many monarchists accepted the republic, moving toward the centre. Some Orléanists, especially from their &quot;bourgeoise&quot; core base, accepted the republic even since the 1870s, like Thiers and press baron Émile de Girardin. In 1892, after Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s approval to the Third Republic, breaking the historical alliance between Church and Crown, some monarchists led by Orléanist Jacques Piou and Legitimist Albert de Mun formed the group of the &quot;ralliés&quot; (&quot;supporters&quot;), that in 1901 constituted the base of the first Christian Democratic party in France, the Liberal Action, while many other royalists were still attached to the Crown.

===Association with the far-right===
The elections of 1898 confirmed the exclusion of the monarchists from any possible government. However, 4 years earlier, the Dreyfus affair shook public opinion, dividing the republican camp: socialists, radicals and liberals defended the innocence of Dreyfus, while other republicans joined the nationalists and monarchists against Dreyfus. The election also introduced 10 overtly anti-Semitic representatives, led by Édouard Drumont. The following year, on 20 June 1899, the academic Henri Vaugeois and journalist Maurice Pujo founded the nationalist association &quot;Action française&quot;, initially absent of any specific ideology. However, the &quot;Action&quot; was joined by many Catholics and monarchists who were anti-Dreyfus, contributing to the move of the association toward the right. Particularly, the adhesion of Charles Maurras, considered a &quot;pragmatic&quot; anti-Dreyfusard rather than a true anti-Semite, contributed to the creation of the ideology of the &quot;Action&quot;, which rapidly became the main monarchist group. Maurras, despite becoming the movement&#x27;s ideologist, supported not a classical monarchy on religious term (divine right) but a positivist one, stating that a monarchy would grant more order and stability than a parliamentary republic. The largest group of French monarchists, after the death of Chambord in 1883, endorsed the Count of Paris until his death in 1894, recognizing the claim of his son Philippe, Duke of Orléans, who was also supported by the &quot;Action&quot;. However, monarchism inside the &quot;Action&quot; was always integrated secondary to its semi-official ideology of &quot;integral nationalism&quot; theorized by Maurras, and many &quot;Action&quot; activists were still republicans, like the founder Vaugeois. The movement grew to be one of the largest organizations in France, but in 1926 a condemnation from Pope Pius XI against the &quot;Action&quot; caused the defection of many Catholic sympathizers. The Pope judged that it was folly for the French Church to continue to tie its fortunes to the unlikely dream of a monarchist restoration, and distrusted the movement&#x27;s tendency to defend the Catholic religion in merely utilitarian and nationalistic terms, and the &quot;Action Française&quot; never recovered from the condemnation.

By 1934, the &quot;Action&quot; was still a considerable force, with over 60,000 members across France. In that year, they joined other far-right leagues on 6 February demonstrations against political corruption and the Parliament, causing the resignation of Prime Minister Édouard Daladier the day after and provoking fear of a nationalist coup d&#x27;état. The papal condemnation, the aggressive tactics, and Maurras&#x27;s disrespectful attitude toward constitutional monarchists finally ended the organization as a major power. The Orléanist pretender Jean, Duke of Guise, who in 1937 broken ties with the &quot;Action&quot;, also lost many supporters. From this moment, Orléanism ceased to be associated with the &quot;Action&quot; or the far-right. Instead, the Duke of Guise&#x27;s son and heir Henri, Count of Paris, launched his own magazine &quot;Courier Royale&quot; and secretly dealt with anti-fascist conservative General La Rocque, leader of the French Social Party, about the possibility of a restoration.

==Hope during the Fourth Republic==
In 1946, the Count of Paris (who succeeded his father in 1940) moved to Portugal due to the ban on former royals still present in France. As a result of the unstable situation of the Fourth Republic, characterized like its predecessor by short governments and a high number of political parties, the Count of Paris made a serious attempt to restore the French monarchy. He endorsed the Christian Democratic Popular Republican Movement (MPR), and formed a kind of political committee composed of the academics Bertrand de Jouvenel, Gustave Thibon and Michel de Saint Pierre, publishing on 5 February 1948 the manifesto &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une constitution monarchique et démocratique&quot;, that promoted the idea of a constitutional monarchy.
Thanks to the MPR deputy Paul Hutin-Desgrées (co-founder of &quot;Ouest-France&quot;), the exile law was abrogated on 24 June 1950, permitting the return of the Count of Paris to the capital, where he met with President Vincent Auriol.
The count and his family made their home in the Parisian suburbs of Louveciennes, and quickly became media darlings. Orléans frequently went to parties and meetings which were attended by prominent French politicians of the Fourth Republic, such as Antoine Pinay, Jacques Soustelle, Pierre Mendès France and Maurice Schumann. Through his newsletter &quot;Courier 50&quot;, the Count of Paris expressed support for the policies of Mendès France, like the peace in Indochina, the refusal of a US-controlled European Defence Community (EDC) and decolonization of French Africa.

Orléans&#x27; relationship with Charles de Gaulle was also promising, as the general and the pretender had similar political views and were both devout Roman Catholics. When De Gaulle became prime minister in 1958, it was expected by the Count of Paris that the general would move to restore the French monarchy, but instead De Gaulle preferred to strengthen the republican institutions, eventually becoming the driving force behind the establishment of the present-day Fifth Republic. De Gaulle was elected president of the new government in 1959, and seems to have promised the Count of Paris that he wouldn&#x27;t run again in the election of 1965, instead supporting the candidacy of the pretender that would promote a campaign to transform the republic into a constitutional monarchy. However, in 1963 De Gaulle confided to his minister Alain Peyrefitte that, despite his respect and esteem for the Count of Paris, he never considered him to be his successor as the head of state, stating that the idea of a monarchy was incompatible with the modern world. Disappointed by the false hopes and unfulfilled promises, the Count of Paris retired from French political life in 1967, ending also the publications of his newsletter.

== Principles of succession ==

Orléanist pretenders from 1883 to the present follow these principles:
* The Crown passes by primogeniture to males born in the male line of Hugh Capet.
* Only children born of legal marriages conforming with the canon law of the Catholic Church are dynasts. 
* The Sovereign or Head of the House can neither abdicate nor alter the line of succession. The Princes of the blood likewise cannot personally renounce theirs succession rights. Those rights can however be permanently lost under specific circumstances (see below).
* The throne is never vacant; upon the death of the Sovereign or Head of the House, the first in line automatically succeeds, regardless of any coronation or whether actually reigning.
* The Sovereign or Head of the House must be Catholic.
*The Sovereign or Head of the House must be both French and born of an unbroken line of French dynasts descending from Hugh Capet. Any prince of the blood that leaves France to claim a foreign throne or a position subject to which permanently loses his rights of succession, as do his descendants. It is this rule that separates the Orléanist rule from the Legitimist one.

== List of claimants to the French throne since 1848 ==
==Orléanist political parties ==
* Doctrinaires (1815–48)
* Resistance Party (1832–48)
* Movement Party (1831–48)
* Party of Order (1848–52)
* Action Française (1899–present)

==Legacy==
The Orléanist party, despite the different regimes, maintained its &quot;bourgeois&quot; platform, constituted by those academics, journalists and financiers who backed Louis Philippe during his reign, and was intended as the liberal centre of politics, far from reactionary Legitimists and revolutionary republicans. However, for all the span of Louis Philippe&#x27;s reign, the Orléanists were not a homogeneous party, but simply the majority who supported the constitutional system. It was only after the establishment of the Second French Republic in 1848 and the division inside right-wing factions over the monarchy that the Orléanist party found unity, supporting a parliamentary system instead of an executive one.

In the early 20th century, the majority of Orléanists accepted the republican institutions, approving the parliamentary system and pro-business policy realized by the republican majority, who reflected the historical Orléanist purposes. French historian René Rémond included the presidency of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing as part of the Orléanist tradition, due to his liberal views and equidistance from the nationalist right (descending from Bonapartism) and the conservative right (from Legitimism). The term &quot;Orléanist parliamentarism&quot; was also used by jurist and sociologist Maurice Duverger to define the form of government of the Fifth Republic, which presents a parliamentary system with a powerful head of state.

In 1974, before the presidential election, the New Royal Action (NAR), born by a moderate faction spilled from the &quot;Action française&quot;, endorsed Bertrand Renouvin for the presidency, with the purpose of restoring a constitutional monarchy led by Orléans, followed by centrist and liberal positions on other issues. Renouvin gained only 43,722 votes (0.17%).

<text>Murad Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Kevorkian (May 26, 1928 – June 3, 2011) was an American pathologist and euthanasia proponent. He publicly championed a terminal patient&#x27;s right to die by physician-assisted suicide, embodied in his quote, &quot;Dying is not a crime&quot;. Kevorkian said that he assisted at least 130 patients to that end. He was convicted of murder in 1999 and was often portrayed in the media with the name of &quot;Dr. Death&quot;.

In 1998, Kevorkian was arrested and tried for his role in the voluntary euthanasia of a man named Thomas Youk who had Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, or ALS. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. He was released on parole on June 1, 2007, on condition he would not offer advice about, participate in, or be present at the act of any type of euthanasia to any other person, nor that he promote or talk about the procedure of assisted suicide.

==Early life and education==
Murad Jacob Kevorkian () was born in Pontiac, Michigan, on May 26, 1928, to Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire, in what is now Turkey. His father, Levon (1891–1960), was born in the village of Passen, near Erzurum, and his mother, Satenig (1900–1968), was born in the village of Govdun, near Sivas. His father left Ottoman Armenia and made his way to Pontiac in 1912, where he found work at an automobile foundry. Satenig fled the Armenian genocide of 1915, finding refuge with relatives in Paris and eventually reuniting with her brother in Pontiac. Levon and Satenig met through the Armenian community in their city, where they married and began their family. The couple had a daughter, Margaret, in 1926, followed by son Murad, and their third and last child, Flora. 

When Kevorkian was a child, his parents took him to an Orthodox church weekly. He started questioning the existence of a God, as he believed an all-knowing God would have prevented the Armenian Genocide on his extended family. He stopped attending church by the time he was 12.

Kevorkian was a child prodigy, teaching himself multiple languages (including German, Russian, Greek, and Japanese). As such, he was often alienated by his peers. Kevorkian graduated from Pontiac Central High School with honors in 1945, at the age of 17. In 1952, he graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.

Kevorkian completed residency training in anatomical and clinical pathology and briefly conducted research on blood transfusion.

==Career==

Over a period of decades, Kevorkian developed several controversial ideas related to death. In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:

Senior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian&#x27;s employer, opposed his proposal, and Kevorkian chose to leave the university rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death-row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1976 decision in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; reinstituted the death penalty. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but he failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.

As a pathologist at Pontiac General Hospital, Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the U.S. military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.

In the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal &quot;Medicine and Law&quot; that laid out his thinking on the ethics of euthanasia.

In 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in Detroit newspapers as a physician consultant for &quot;death counseling&quot;. His first public assisted suicide, of Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed in 1989 with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, took place in 1990. Charges of murder were dropped on December 13, 1990, as there were, at that time, no laws in Michigan regarding assisted suicide. In 1991, however, the State of Michigan revoked Kevorkian&#x27;s medical license and made it clear that, given his actions, he was no longer permitted to practice medicine or to work with patients. His California medical license was suspended in April 1993 by an administrative law judge, with Kevorkian&#x27;s attorney responding that Kevorkian &quot;will go on assisting people commit suicide. He dares that California judge to come catch him&quot;.

According to his lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian assisted in the deaths of 130 terminally ill people between 1990 and 1998. In each of these cases, the individuals themselves allegedly took the final action which resulted in their own deaths. Kevorkian allegedly assisted only by attaching the individual to a euthanasia device that he had devised and constructed. The individual then pushed a button which released the drugs or chemicals that would end their own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of a device which delivered the euthanizing drugs intravenously. Kevorkian called the device a &quot;Thanatron&quot; (&quot;Death machine&quot;, from the Greek &quot;thanatos&quot; meaning &quot;death&quot;). Other people were assisted by a device which employed a gas mask fed by a canister of carbon monoxide, which Kevorkian called the &quot;Mercitron&quot; (&quot;Mercy machine&quot;). 

===Criticism and Kevorkian&#x27;s response===
According to a report by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, 60% of the patients who died with Kevorkian&#x27;s help were not terminally ill, and at least 13 had not complained of pain. The report further asserted that Kevorkian&#x27;s counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person&#x27;s &quot;mental state is [...] of paramount importance.&quot; The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease. Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian&#x27;s and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian&#x27;s first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he &quot;made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life,&quot; as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian&#x27;s activity. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;: &quot;Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness... it was not usually terminal. Autopsies showed five people had no disease at all... Little over a third were in pain. Some presumably suffered from no more than hypochondria or depression.&quot;

In response, Kevorkian&#x27;s attorney Geoffrey Fieger published an essay stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve never met any doctor who lived by such exacting guidelines as Kevorkian... [H]e published them in an article for the &quot;American Journal of Forensic Psychiatry&quot; in 1992. Last year he got a committee of doctors, the Physicians of Mercy, to lay down new guidelines, which he scrupulously follows.&quot; However, Fieger stated that Kevorkian found it difficult to follow his &quot;exacting guidelines&quot; because of &quot;persecution and prosecution&quot;, adding, &quot;[H]e&#x27;s proposed these guidelines saying this is what ought to be done. These are not to be done in times of war, and we&#x27;re at war.&quot;

In a 2010 interview with Sanjay Gupta, Kevorkian stated an objection to the status of assisted suicide in Oregon, Washington, and Montana. At that time, only in those three states was assisted suicide legal in the United States, and then only for terminally ill patients. To Gupta, Kevorkian stated, &quot;What difference does it make if someone is terminal? We are all terminal.&quot; In his view, a patient had to be suffering but did not have to be terminally ill to be assisted in committing suicide. However, he also said in that same interview that he declined four out of every five assisted suicide requests, on the grounds that the patient needed more treatment or medical records had to be checked.

In 2011, disability rights and anti-legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia group Not Dead Yet spoke out against Kevorkian, citing potentially concerning sentiments he expressed in his published writing. On page 214 of &quot;Prescription: Medicide, the Goodness of Planned Death&quot;, Kevorkian wrote that assisting &quot;suffering or doomed persons [to] kill themselves&quot; was &quot;merely the first step, an early distasteful professional obligation... What I find most satisfying is the prospect of making possible the performance of invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditions that this first unpleasant step can help establishin a [portmanteau] word obitiatry.&quot; In a journal article titled &quot;The Last Fearsome Taboo: Medical Aspects of Planned Death&quot;, Kevorkian also detailed anesthetizing, experimenting on, and utilizing the organs of a disabled newborn as a token of &quot;daring and highly imaginative research&quot; that would be possible &quot;beyond the constraints of traditional but outmoded, hopelessly inadequate, and essentially irrelevant ethical codes now sustained for the most part by vacuous sentimental reverence&quot;.

===Art and music===

Kevorkian was a jazz musician and composer. &quot;The Kevorkian Suite: A Very Still Life&quot; was a 1997 limited-release CD of 5,000 copies from the &#x27;Lucid Subjazz&#x27; label. It features Kevorkian on the flute and organ playing his own works with &quot;The Morpheus Quintet&quot;. It was reviewed in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; online as &quot;weird&quot; but &quot;good-natured&quot;. As of 1997, 1,400 units had been sold. Kevorkian wrote all the songs but one; the album was reviewed in &quot;jazzreview.com&quot; as &quot;very much grooviness&quot; except for one tune, with &quot;stuff in between that&#x27;s worthy of multiple spins&quot;.

The first public performance of the complete classical organ works by Jack Kevorkian was by Craig Rifel in a live concert on April 30, 1996, at Central United Methodist Church in Waterford, Michigan, including Kevorkian&#x27;s Prelude &amp; Fugue in E-flat, Pipe Dream, Sonata in D, Passacaglia on B-A-C-H, Pastorale &amp; Fugue in B-Flat, and Fantasy &amp; Fugue in C. In 1999, the Geneva-based self-determination society EXIT commissioned David Woodard to orchestrate wind settings of Kevorkian&#x27;s organ works.

He was also an oil painter. His work tended toward the grotesque and surreal, and he had created pieces of symbolic art, such as one &quot;of a child eating the flesh off a decomposing corpse&quot;. Of his known works, six were made available in the 1990s for print release. The Ariana Gallery in Royal Oak, Michigan, is the exclusive distributor of Kevorkian&#x27;s artwork. The original oil prints are not for release. Sludge metal band Acid Bath used his painting &quot;For He is Raised&quot; as the cover art for their 1996 album &quot;Paegan Terrorism Tactics&quot;.

In 2011, his paintings became the center of a legal entanglement between his sole heir and the Armenian Library and Museum of America.

==Trials, conviction, and imprisonment==
Kevorkian was tried four times for assisting suicides between May 1994 and June 1997. With the assistance of Fieger, Kevorkian was acquitted three times. The fourth trial ended in a mistrial. The trials helped Kevorkian gain public support for his cause. After Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson lost a primary election to a Republican challenger, Thompson attributed the loss in part to the declining public support for the prosecution of Kevorkian and its associated legal expenses.

In the November 22, 1998, broadcast of CBS News&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Kevorkian allowed the airing of a videotape he made on September 17, 1998, which depicted the voluntary euthanasia of Thomas Youk, 52, who was in the final stages of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. After Youk provided his fully informed consent (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk&#x27;s family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.

On November 25, 1998, Kevorkian was charged with first-degree murder and the delivery of a controlled substance (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk). Because Kevorkian&#x27;s license to practice medicine had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance.

On March 26, 1999, a jury began deliberations in the first-degree murder trial of Kevorkian. He had discharged his attorneys and proceeded through the trial representing himself, a decision he later regretted. The judge ordered a criminal defense attorney to remain available at trial as standby counsel for information and advice. Inexperienced in law but persisting in his efforts to represent himself, Kevorkian encountered great difficulty in presenting his evidence and arguments. He was not able to call any witnesses to the stand as the judge did not deem the testimony of any of his witnesses relevant.

After a two-day trial, the Michigan jury found Kevorkian guilty of second-degree homicide. Judge Jessica Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to serve 10–25 years in prison and told him:

Kevorkian was sent to a prison in Coldwater, Michigan, to serve his sentence. After his conviction (and subsequent losses on appeal), Kevorkian was denied parole repeatedly until 2007.

In an MSNBC interview aired on September 29, 2005, Kevorkian said that if he were granted parole, he would not resume directly helping people die and would restrict himself to campaigning to have the law changed. On December 22, 2005, Kevorkian was denied parole by a board on the count of 7–2 recommending not to give parole.

Reportedly terminally ill with Hepatitis C, which he contracted in the 1960s, Kevorkian was expected to die within a year in May 2006. After applying for a pardon, parole, or commutation by the parole board and Governor Jennifer Granholm, he was paroled for good behavior on June 1, 2007. He had spent eight years and two and a half months in prison.

Kevorkian was on parole for two years, under the conditions that he would not help anyone else die, or provide care for anyone older than 62 or disabled. Kevorkian said he would abstain from assisting any more terminal patients with death, and his role in the matter would strictly be to persuade states to change their laws on assisted suicide. He was also forbidden by the rules of his parole from commenting about assisted suicide procedure.

==Activities after his release from prison==
Kevorkian gave a number of lectures upon his release. He lectured at universities such as the University of Florida, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. His lectures were not limited to the topic of euthanasia; he also discussed such topics as tyranny, the criminal justice system, politics, the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Armenian culture. He appeared on the Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot; on September 2, 2009, to discuss health care reform.

On April 15 and 16, 2010, Kevorkian appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. Cooper asked, &quot;You are saying doctors play God all the time?&quot; Kevorkian said: &quot;Of course. Any time you interfere with a natural process, you are playing God.&quot;
Director Barry Levinson and actors Al Pacino, Susan Sarandon and John Goodman, who appeared in &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, a film based on Kevorkian&#x27;s life, were interviewed alongside Kevorkian. Kevorkian was again interviewed by Cavuto on &quot;Your World&quot; on April 19, 2010, regarding the movie and Kevorkian&#x27;s world view. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; premiered April 24, 2010, on HBO. The film premiered April 14 at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City. Kevorkian walked the red carpet alongside Al Pacino, who portrayed him in the film. Pacino received Emmy and Golden Globe awards for his portrayal and personally thanked Kevorkian, who was in the audience, upon receiving both of these awards. Kevorkian stated that the film &quot;brings tears to my eyes – and I lived through it&quot;.

===2008 congressional race===

On March 12, 2008, Kevorkian announced plans to run for United States Congress to represent Michigan&#x27;s 9th congressional district as an independent against eight-term congressman Joe Knollenberg (R-Bloomfield Hills), former Michigan Lottery commissioner and state senator Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), Adam Goodman (L-Royal Oak) and Douglas Campbell (G-Ferndale). The race had already garnered national attention due to Democrats targeting the historically Republican district based in Oakland County, which Knollenberg barely won in 2006 against a little-known opponent. The district would suffer some of the worst brunt of the Great Recession due to declines in Detroit&#x27;s automotive industry. Upon Kevorkian&#x27;s entry into the race, one analyst viewed him as a potential spoiler to Peters&#x27; candidacy.

Ultimately, Kevorkian received 8,987 votes (2.6% of the vote) in the election, in which Peters defeated the incumbent Knollenberg by a nine-percent margin. Peters would eventually serve three terms in Congress before making a successful run for the United States Senate.




==Illness and death==
Kevorkian had struggled with kidney problems for years. He was diagnosed with liver cancer, which &quot;may have been caused by hepatitis C,&quot; according to his longtime friend Neal Nicol. Kevorkian was hospitalized on May 18, 2011, with kidney problems and pneumonia. Kevorkian&#x27;s condition grew rapidly worse and he died from a thrombosis on June 3, 2011, eight days after his 83rd birthday, at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. According to his attorney, Mayer Morganroth, there were no artificial attempts to keep him alive and his death was painless. Kevorkian was buried in White Chapel Memorial Cemetery in Troy, Michigan.

==Legacy==
Judge Thomas Jackson, who presided over Kevorkian&#x27;s first murder trial in 1994, commented that he wanted to express sorrow at Kevorkian&#x27;s death and that the 1994 case was brought under &quot;a badly written law&quot; aimed at Kevorkian, but he attempted to give him &quot;the best trial possible&quot;. Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian&#x27;s lawyer during the 1990s, gave a speech at a press conference in which he stated: &quot;Dr. Jack Kevorkian didn&#x27;t seek out history, but he made history.&quot; Fieger said that Kevorkian revolutionized the concept of suicide by working to help people end their own suffering, because he believed physicians are responsible for alleviating the suffering of patients, even if that meant allowing patients to die.

Kevorkian spoke at Presbyterian and Episcopal churches to gain support for euthanasia. John Finn, medical director of palliative care at the Catholic St. John&#x27;s Hospital, said Kevorkian&#x27;s methods were unorthodox and inappropriate. He added that many of Kevorkian&#x27;s patients were isolated, lonely, and potentially depressed, and therefore in no state to mindfully choose whether to live or die. Derek Humphry, author of the suicide handbook &quot;Final Exit&quot;, said Kevorkian was &quot;too obsessed, too fanatical, in his interest in death and suicide to offer direction for the nation&quot;.

In a 2015 Retro Report story about Kevorkian&#x27;s legacy and the Right to Die movement, journalist Jack Lessenberry said Kevorkian &quot;got a national debate going, which I think he then helped stifle by his own outrageous actions&quot;. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, said that Kevorkian &quot;was a major historical figure in modern medicine&quot;. The Catholic Church in Detroit said Kevorkian left behind a &quot;deadly legacy&quot; that denied scores of people their right to &quot;dignified, natural&quot; deaths. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of right-to-die organization Exit International, said that Kevorkian &quot;moved the debate forward in ways the rest of us can only imagine. He started at a time when it was hardly talked about and got people thinking about the issue. He paid one hell of a price, and that is one of the hallmarks of true heroism.&quot;

The epitaph on Kevorkian&#x27;s tombstone reads, &quot;He sacrificed himself for everyone&#x27;s rights.&quot;

In 2015, the 1968 Volkswagen Type 2 van in which Jack Kevorkian assisted some of his suicidal patients was bought by paranormal investigator Zak Bagans (from the documentary series &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;) for display in his haunted museum in Las Vegas.

<text>Black Uhuru is a Jamaican reggae group formed in 1972, initially as Uhuru (Swahili for &#x27;freedom&#x27;). The group has undergone several line-up changes over the years, with Derrick &quot;Duckie&quot; Simpson as the mainstay. They had their most successful period in the 1980s, with their album &quot;Anthem&quot; winning the first ever Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 1985.

==History==
The group formed in the Waterhouse district of Kingston in 1972, initially called “Uhuru&quot; (the Swahili word for freedom), with a line-up of Garth Dennis, Don Carlos, and Derrick &quot;Duckie&quot; Simpson. Their first release was a cover version of The Impressions&#x27; &quot;Romancing to the Folk Song&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Time is on Our Side&quot;; Neither song was a success and they split up, with Carlos pursuing a solo career, as did Dennis, before joining The Wailing Souls. Simpson also briefly worked with the Wailing Souls, before forming a new version of Uhuru with Errol Nelson (of The Jayes) and Michael Rose, the group now taking the name Black Sounds Uhuru. Their Prince Jammy-produced debut album, &quot;Love Crisis&quot;, was released in 1977.

Nelson returned to The Jayes in late 1977, and was replaced the following year by Sandra &quot;Puma&quot; Jones, a social worker from South Carolina, US, who had previously worked as a dancer for Ras Michael &amp; the Sons of Negus, and as a member of the group Mama Africa. The band now took on their most familiar name, Black Uhuru. The group began working extensively with Sly and Robbie, and recorded a string of successful singles, including &quot;General Penitentiary&quot; a re-recording of Rose&#x27;s solo hit &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, and &quot;Shine Eye Gal&quot;, which featured guest guitarist Keith Richards. The group&#x27;s second album &quot;Showcase&quot; drew on these singles, and the band cemented their status with a performance at the 1980 Reggae Sunsplash festival. They planned to record an album with Dennis Brown producing, but this didn&#x27;t materialise, although two singles, &quot;Wood for My Fire&quot; and &quot;Rent Man&quot;, were released. They were signed by Island Records in 1980, who issued the &quot;Sinsemilla&quot; album to an international audience in 1981. The follow-up, &quot;Red&quot; reached number 28 in the UK Albums Chart in 1981, &quot;Chill Out&quot; reached number 38 a year later, and they toured with The Rolling Stones. In 1989, their album &quot;Red&quot; was ranked No. 23 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 greatest albums of the 1980s.&quot; Their next studio album, &quot;Anthem&quot;, appeared in 1984, and won the first ever Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album the following year.

Despite this success, Rose left the group in 1984 to resume his solo career after falling out with Simpson, and was replaced by Junior Reid. They signed to RAS Records and moved in a different direction with the album &quot;Brutal&quot; and the single &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, the latter recorded with New York dance producer Arthur Baker. Although these alienated much of their roots reggae following, &quot;Brutal&quot; was nominated for a Grammy and &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; gave them their second UK hit single, reaching number 62. The band began to disintegrate; their next album with Jammy was started but never completed, they stopped working with Sly and Robbie, and Jones left the band due to ill health (she died in 1990 from cancer). Her replacement was Janet &quot;Olafunke&quot; Reid, and the group returned in 1987 with the &quot;Positive&quot; album. Reid was unable to obtain a US visa, and unable to tour, left the band, followed shortly by Olafunke.

Black Uhuru, now reduced to Simpson alone, had been booked to play at an awards ceremony in California, which coincidentally had original Uhuru members Don Carlos and Garth Dennis on the bill, and they took the opportunity to reunite the original line-up for a performance at the event, and decided to continue afterwards. The &quot;Now&quot; album followed in 1991, and was also nominated for a Grammy. In 1996 the group fragmented again, with Simpson leaving to tour Europe with dub poet Yasus Afari, under the name Black Uhuru, while Carlos and Dennis also toured the US under the same name. A legal battle over the name followed, won by Simpson in 1997. Carlos resumed his solo career, while Simpson formed a new line-up of Black Uhuru with Andrew Bees and Jennifer Connolly . Only one album &quot;Unification&quot; and then the band interchange in 1999 which introduced Kaye Starh as the new background vocalist at D Bus Negril she was signed exclusively for in studio and live performances. The band went on a European tour Black Uhuru featuring Sly and Robby in the summer of 2000. Black Uhuru with Duckie Simpson, Kaye Starh and Andrew Bees promoted the Unification album and also the tour was an introduction of Kaye Starh to international reggae music scene. 

With new songs came into view the &quot;Dynasty album was created and was recorded&quot; was released with Duckie Simpson , Kaye Starh and Andrew Bees before Bees went back to pursue his solo career in 2003.

In February 2004, it was announced in the Jamaican press that Simpson and Michael Rose had reunited under the name &quot;Black Uhuru feat. Michael Rose&quot;. Together with the female background vocalist Kaye Starh they released a single, &quot;Dollars&quot;, and performed at several concerts including &quot;Western Consciousness 2004&quot; on 28 April in Jamaica, of which a live video was released shortly thereafter. A new album was reported to be in progress, although it was never released. The group toured throughout Europe in 2006.

In 2008, Simpson took on lead vocal duties with Kaye Starh with interchangeable female vocals as they toured Brazil in 2010. With collaborative efforts from Kaye Starh Duckie Simpson recorded the new album, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, with guest appearances from Aterciopelados and Jarabe De Palo, although this was still unreleased a year later due to the mastering files configuration issues . . A 25th Anniversary Edition DVD of their &quot;Live in London&quot; concert was released in June 2008. Derrick &quot;Duckie&quot; Simpson, Andrew Bees, and Kaye Starh has been touring the US , Europe and North and South America and also the Caribbean performing at Moonsplash in Anguilla. 

Andrew Bees returned to the group in 2010 and he along with Duckie Simpson and Kaye Starh performed on a Festival in Puerto Rico, later that year Duckie Simpson , Kaye Starh and Andrew Bees. went on to performed at Bonnaroo in 2011 with a successful East Coast tour sharing stages with the renowned reggae pop star Shaggy.

In 2012 Black Uhuru was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award in music by the IRAMA and also The Key For The City of Las Vegas which made 31 of August officially Black Uhuru Day in Las Vagas. The band, comprised of Duckie Simpson, Kaye Starh and Andrew Bees, was invited to take part in a Red Carpet event representing the continent of the Caribbean in a Broadway Musical dubbed &quot;Loving The Silent Tears&quot;. in 2012 which was held at The Shrine Auditorium in LA this event was star studded with Emmy and Grammy Award winners. The band returned to Jamaica then went a European tour in 2013 with many successful many sold out venues. The band performance became electrified as the introduction of Kaye Starh songs into The band set had heightened the audience in a vibrant mode of musical excitement as nothing such as this in the history of Black Uhuru had ever happened before the fans was very receptive and respectfully wanted more of the band performances as they shouted for more.

<doc id="202838" wikidata="Q734112" url="?curid=202838" title="Animal Rights (album)">
<text>Animal Rights is the fourth studio album by American musician Moby, released on September 23, 1996. The album was a temporary style shift from the electronica music that Moby had previously released to an alternative rock sound influenced by the hardcore punk music that he had enjoyed as a teenager. The album was released to mediocre critical reviews and commercial performance.

== Background ==

Moby&#x27;s decision to release a punk rock album was in part the result of being disillusioned by the lack of positive media feedback he had been receiving from the music media for his electronic works, which they struggled to comprehend and failed to take very seriously. Moby had previous experience performing rock music, having been a member of the groups Vatican Commandos and Ultra Vivid Scene in the 1980s.

The album was recorded between the summer of 1995 and spring of 1996 in Manhattan, New York. Moby worked alongside Alan Moulder in the making of the album. Just as Moby decided to change direction, the electronic music he moved away from started to gain recognition and popularity through artists like The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy.

== Packaging ==

The cover photograph features Moby at two weeks old, being held by his grandfather. The album&#x27;s liner notes contain various pictures, an essay on the course of basic rights over history, an essay outlining Moby&#x27;s disregard for the Christian Coalition, and a page with various &quot;last minute maxims&quot;, such as &quot;cruelty is unacceptable&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t expect people to worry about the world when they can&#x27;t feed themselves or their children.&quot;

== Release ==

The first single from &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, released on August 26, 1996, was a cover of Mission of Burma&#x27;s 1981 song &quot;That&#x27;s When I Reach for My Revolver&quot;. The single peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart.

On September 23, 1996, &quot;Animal Rights&quot; was released in the United Kingdom, where it charted at number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. The first batch of released copies in the United Kingdom were packaged with a 49-minute bonus CD called &quot;Little Idiot&quot;. Consisting entirely of drum-free ambient tracks, it was the second in a line of ambient bonus CDs, following &quot;Underwater&quot;, which came with &quot;Everything Is Wrong&quot;. &quot;Little Idiot&quot; included reworkings of tracks from &quot;Animal Rights&quot; – it also features a drawing of Moby&#x27;s character &quot;Little Idiot&quot;, who would later appear on various music videos and single and album covers. A second single from &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, &quot;Come On Baby&quot;, was released on November 4, 1996, but failed to chart.

&quot;Animal Rights&quot; was not released in Moby&#x27;s native United States until five months later on February 11, 1997, with a different tracklisting. The album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but reached number 31 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. Moby toured the record as the opening act for Soundgarden on their &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; tour, where he was met with largely unreceptive audiences. He also undertook a separate promotional tour for &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, where, he later recalled, he found himself playing to &quot;roughly 50 people a night&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Animal Rights&quot; received generally negative reviews upon its first release. Moby had earlier made his reputation with electronic music, but &quot;Animal Rights&quot; found him embracing punk rock and ambient music. While most critics praised his attempt at diversifying, &quot;Salon&quot;″s Douglas Wolk opined that &quot;Animal Rights&quot; &quot;finds Moby falling on his nose&quot; and concluded that &quot;maybe somebody should try to convince Moby that guitars are actually made out of dead animals&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Lorraine Ali felt that &quot;this time around, he has decided to push an agenda instead of boundaries&quot;. However, James Oldham of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Animal Rights&quot; is a brave, turbulent and consistently exhilarating record&quot;, and Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, said that the two discs &quot;enrich and play off each other with the flow and coherence &quot;Everything Is Wrong&quot; lacks&quot;. Seeming to expect a negative critical reaction, Moby added the following entreaty to the bottom of the credits page: &quot;please listen to &quot;animal rights&quot; in its entirety at least once.&quot;

== Legacy ==
According to Moby&#x27;s manager Eric Härle, &quot;Animal Rights&quot; nearly ended Moby&#x27;s career because not only did the new direction leave audiences cold – with music media uninterested and his existing fan base largely alienated by it – but it led to people being confused as to what kind of artist Moby really was. Having &quot;wipe[d] out all of his early good work&quot; in establishing himself, Moby was left struggling for any kind of recognition and quickly became seen as a &quot;has-been&quot; in the eyes of many people in the industry. In an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Moby admitted that the failure of &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, combined with the negative reception he received from Soundgarden&#x27;s fanbase while touring the album, led him to consider quitting music. However, he chose to continue his career after other artists, including Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Axl Rose and Bono, personally told him they enjoyed the album. By 2002, &quot;Animal Rights&quot; had sold 100,000 copies worldwide.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Animal Rights&quot; &quot;ranks as one of the classic failed albums, right alongside Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s big-band &quot;Am I Not Your Girl?&quot;.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; critic Mark Reed, in a 2002 retrospective review, suggested that &quot;Animal Rights&quot; had been unfairly lambasted by contemporary critics for being unrepresentative of Moby&#x27;s capabilities and for &quot;daring to go against the grain&quot;, describing it as &quot;one of the most underbought, underrated, unusual albums a major recording artist has ever produced.&quot; Additionally, despite the negative critical reaction, Moby has since named &quot;Animal Rights&quot; as his favorite of his albums.

<doc id="202840" wikidata="Q225107" url="?curid=202840" title="Adjugate matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, the adjugate or classical adjoint of a square matrix , , is the transpose of its cofactor matrix. It is occasionally known as adjunct matrix, or &quot;adjoint&quot;, though that normally refers to a different concept, the adjoint operator which for a matrix is the conjugate transpose.

The product of a matrix with its adjugate gives a diagonal matrix (entries not on the main diagonal are zero) whose diagonal entries are the determinant of the original matrix:
:formula_1
where is the identity matrix of the same size as . Consequently, the multiplicative inverse of an invertible matrix can be found by dividing its adjugate by its determinant.

== Definition ==
The adjugate of is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of ,
:formula_2

In more detail, suppose is a unital+ commutative ring and is an matrix with entries from . The -&quot;minor&quot; of , denoted , is the determinant of the matrix that results from deleting row and column of . The cofactor matrix of is the matrix whose entry is the &quot;cofactor&quot; of , which is the -minor times a sign factor:
:formula_3
The adjugate of is the transpose of , that is, the matrix whose entry is the cofactor of ,
:formula_4

=== Important consequence ===
The adjugate is defined so that the product of with its adjugate yields a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the determinant . That is,
:formula_5
where is the identity matrix. This is a consequence of the Laplace expansion of the determinant.

The above formula implies one of the fundamental results in matrix algebra, that is invertible if and only if is an invertible element of . When this holds, the equation above yields
:formula_6

== Examples ==

=== 1 × 1 generic matrix ===
Since the determinant of a 0 × 0 matrix is 1, the adjugate of any 1 × 1 matrix (complex scalar) is formula_7. Observe that formula_8

=== 2 × 2 generic matrix ===
The adjugate of the 2 × 2 matrix
:formula_9
is
:formula_10
By direct computation,
:formula_11
In this case, it is also true that ((A)) = (A) and hence that ((A)) = A.
=== 3 × 3 generic matrix ===
Consider a 3 × 3 matrix
:formula_12
Its cofactor matrix is
:formula_13
where
:formula_14

Its adjugate is the transpose of its cofactor matrix,
:formula_15

=== 3 × 3 numeric matrix ===
As a specific example, we have
:formula_16
It is easy to check the adjugate is the inverse times the determinant, .

The in the second row, third column of the adjugate was computed as follows. The (2,3) entry of the adjugate is the (3,2) cofactor of A. This cofactor is computed using the submatrix obtained by deleting the third row and second column of the original matrix A,
:formula_17
The (3,2) cofactor is a sign times the determinant of this submatrix:
:formula_18
and this is the (2,3) entry of the adjugate.

== Properties ==
For any matrix , elementary computations show that adjugates have the following properties:
* formula_19, where formula_20 is the identity matrix.
* formula_21, where formula_22 is the zero matrix, except that if formula_23 then formula_24.
* formula_25 for any scalar .
* formula_26.
* formula_27.
* If is invertible, then formula_28. It follows that:
** is invertible with inverse .
* is entrywise polynomial in . In particular, over the real or complex numbers, the adjugate is a smooth function of the entries of .

Over the complex numbers,
* formula_29, where the bar denotes complex conjugation.
* formula_30, where the asterisk denotes conjugate transpose.

Suppose that is another matrix. Then
:formula_31
This can be proved in three ways. One way, valid for any commutative ring, is a direct computation using the Cauchy–Binet formula. The second way, valid for the real or complex numbers, is to first observe that for invertible matrices and ,
:formula_32
Because every non-invertible matrix is the limit of invertible matrices, continuity of the adjugate then implies that the formula remains true when one of or is not invertible.

A corollary of the previous formula is that, for any non-negative integer ,
:formula_33
If is invertible, then the above formula also holds for negative .

From the identity
:formula_34
we deduce
:formula_35

Suppose that commutes with . Multiplying the identity on the left and right by proves that
:formula_36
If is invertible, this implies that also commutes with . Over the real or complex numbers, continuity implies that commutes with even when is not invertible.

Finally, there is a more general proof than the second proof, which only requires that an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix has entries over a field with at least 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 elements (e.g. a 5 × 5 matrix over the integers modulo 11). is a polynomial in &quot;t&quot; with degree at most &quot;n&quot;, so it has at most &quot;n&quot; roots. Note that the &quot;ij&quot;&amp;hairsp;th entry of is a polynomial of at most order &quot;n&quot;, and likewise for . These two polynomials at the &quot;ij&quot;&amp;hairsp;th entry agree on at least &quot;n&quot; + 1 points, as we have at least &quot;n&quot; + 1 elements of the field where is invertible, and we have proven the identity for invertible matrices. Polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot; which agree on &quot;n&quot; + 1 points must be identical (subtract them from each other and you have &quot;n&quot; + 1 roots for a polynomial of degree at most &quot;n&quot; – a contradiction unless their difference is identically zero). As the two polynomials are identical, they take the same value for every value of &quot;t&quot;. Thus, they take the same value when &quot;t&quot; = 0. 

Using the above properties and other elementary computations, it is straightforward to show that if has one of the following properties, then does as well:
* upper triangular,
* lower triangular,
* diagonal,
* orthogonal,
* unitary,
* symmetric,
* Hermitian,
* normal.

If is skew-symmetric, then is skew-symmetric for even &quot;n&quot; and symmetric for odd &quot;n&quot;. Similarly, if is skew-Hermitian, then is skew-Hermitian for even &quot;n&quot; and Hermitian for odd &quot;n&quot;.

If is invertible, then, as noted above, there is a formula for in terms of the determinant and inverse of . When is not invertible, the adjugate satisfies different but closely related formulas.
* If , then .
* If , then . (Some minor is non-zero, so is non-zero and hence has rank at least one; the identity implies that the dimension of the nullspace of is at least , so its rank is at most one.) It follows that , where is a scalar and and are vectors such that and .

=== Column substitution and Cramer&#x27;s rule ===
Partition into column vectors:
:formula_37
Let be a column vector of size . Fix and consider the matrix formed by replacing column of by :
:formula_38
Laplace expand the determinant of this matrix along column . The result is entry of the product . Collecting these determinants for the different possible yields an equality of column vectors
:formula_39

This formula has the following concrete consequence. Consider the linear system of equations
:formula_40
Assume that is non-singular. Multiplying this system on the left by and dividing by the determinant yields
:formula_41
Applying the previous formula to this situation yields Cramer&#x27;s rule,
:formula_42
where is the th entry of .

=== Characteristic polynomial ===
Let the characteristic polynomial of be
:formula_43
The first divided difference of is a symmetric polynomial of degree ,
:formula_44
Multiply by its adjugate. Since by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, some elementary manipulations reveal
:formula_45

In particular, the resolvent of is defined to be
:formula_46
and by the above formula, this is equal to
:formula_47

=== Jacobi&#x27;s formula ===

The adjugate also appears in Jacobi&#x27;s formula for the derivative of the determinant. If is continuously differentiable, then
:formula_48
It follows that the total derivative of the determinant is the transpose of the adjugate:
:formula_49

=== Cayley–Hamilton formula ===

Let be the characteristic polynomial of . The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that
:formula_50
Separating the constant term and multiplying the equation by gives an expression for the adjugate that depends only on and the coefficients of . These coefficients can be explicitly represented in terms of traces of powers of using complete exponential Bell polynomials. The resulting formula is
:formula_51
where is the dimension of , and the sum is taken over and all sequences of satisfying the linear Diophantine equation
:formula_52

For the 2 × 2 case, this gives
:formula_53
For the 3 × 3 case, this gives
:formula_54
For the 4 × 4 case, this gives
:formula_55

The same formula follows directly from the terminating step of the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm, which efficiently determines the characteristic polynomial of .

In general, adjugate matrix of arbitrary dimension N matrix can be computed by Einstein&#x27;s convention.
:formula_56

== Relation to exterior algebras ==
The adjugate can be viewed in abstract terms using exterior algebras. Let be an -dimensional vector space. The exterior product defines a bilinear pairing
formula_57
Abstractly, formula_58 is isomorphic to , and under any such isomorphism the exterior product is a perfect pairing. That is, it yields an isomorphism
formula_59
This isomorphism sends each to the map formula_60 defined by
formula_61
Suppose that is a linear transformation. Pullback by the th exterior power of induces a morphism of spaces. The adjugate of is the composite
formula_62

If is endowed with its canonical basis , and if the matrix of in this basis is , then the adjugate of is the adjugate of . To see why, give formula_63 the basis
formula_64
Fix a basis vector of . The image of under formula_65 is determined by where it sends basis vectors:
formula_66
On basis vectors, the st exterior power of is
formula_67
Each of these terms maps to zero under formula_68 except the term. Therefore, the pullback of formula_68 is the linear transformation for which
formula_70
That is, it equals
formula_71
Applying the inverse of formula_65 shows that the adjugate of is the linear transformation for which
formula_73
Consequently, its matrix representation is the adjugate of .

If is endowed with an inner product and a volume form, then the map can be decomposed further. In this case, can be understood as the composite of the Hodge star operator and dualization. Specifically, if is the volume form, then it, together with the inner product, determines an isomorphism
formula_74
This induces an isomorphism
formula_75
A vector in corresponds to the linear functional
formula_76
By the definition of the Hodge star operator, this linear functional is dual to . That is, equals .

== Higher adjugates ==
Let be an matrix, and fix . The th higher adjugate of is an formula_77 matrix, denoted , whose entries are indexed by size subsets and of . Let and denote the complements of and , respectively. Also let formula_78 denote the submatrix of containing those rows and columns whose indices are in and , respectively. Then the entry of is
:formula_79
where and are the sum of the elements of and , respectively.

Basic properties of higher adjugates include :
* .
* .
* formula_80, where denotes the &amp;hairsp;th compound matrix.

Higher adjugates may be defined in abstract algebraic terms in a similar fashion to the usual adjugate, substituting formula_81 and formula_82 for formula_83 and formula_84, respectively.

== Iterated adjugates ==
Iteratively taking the adjugate of an invertible matrix A times yields

:formula_85
:formula_86

For example,
:formula_87
:formula_88

<text>Charles Waddell Chesnutt (June 20, 1858 – November 15, 1932) was an American author, essayist, political activist, and lawyer, best known for his novels and short stories exploring complex issues of racial and social identity in the post-Civil War South. Two of his books were adapted as silent films in 1926 and 1927 by the African-American director and producer Oscar Micheaux. Following the Civil Rights Movement during the 20th century, interest in the works of Chesnutt was revived. Several of his books were published in new editions, and he received formal recognition. A commemorative stamp was printed in 2008.

During the early 20th century in Cleveland, Ohio, Chesnutt established what became a highly successful court reporting business, which provided his main income. He became active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, writing articles supporting education as well as legal challenges to discriminatory laws.

== Early life ==
Chesnutt was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Andrew Chesnutt and Ann Maria (née Sampson) Chesnutt, both &quot;free persons of color&quot; from Fayetteville, North Carolina. His paternal grandfather was known to be a white slaveholder. He identified as African-American but noted that he was seven-eighths white. Given his majority-European ancestry, Chesnutt could &quot;pass&quot; as a white man, but he never chose to do so. In many southern states at the time of his birth, Chesnutt would have been considered legally white if he had chosen to identify so. By contrast, under the one drop rule later adopted into law by the 1920s in most of the South, he would have been classified as legally black because of some known African ancestry, even in spite of only being one-eighths black.

After the end of the Civil War and resulting emancipation, in 1867, the Chesnutt family returned to Fayetteville; Charles was nine years old. His parents ran a grocery store, in which Chesnutt worked part-time, but it failed because of his father&#x27;s poor business practices and the struggling economy of the postwar South. In his early adolescence, Chesnutt was left to take care of his mother and siblings at home, due to his mother&#x27;s failing health and eventual death. During this time, he published his first story in a small newspaper.

In addition to his responsibilities at home, Chesnutt attended school in Fayetteville called the Howard School, and by the age of 14, he had become a pupil-teacher there due to financial needs. This school was one of many founded for black students by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau during the Reconstruction era. As a teacher, Chesnutt was extended many new job offers, but difficulties of the time period, such as funding and methodological disagreements, caused many of them to be withdrawn.

Throughout the remainder of his youth, Chesnutt continued to study and teach. According to Fayetteville historian Bruce Daws, Chesnutt was also a teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina, from 1873 to 1876, and also taught in schools near Spartanburg, South Carolina. In 1877, he was promoted to assistant principal of the normal school in Fayetteville, one of a number of historically black colleges established for the training of black teachers. By 1880, he became the school&#x27;s principal and Chief Executive Officer upon the death of the former principal, Robert Harris. After becoming principal, Chesnutt inspired many remarkable qualities in his students. He later resigned from his position in 1883, when he moved to New York City to pursue a writing career.

==Marriage and family==
In 1878, a year after he was employed at the normal school, Chesnutt married fellow teacher Susan Perry, a young African American from a respected family. Five years later, they moved to New York City, hoping to escape the prejudice and poverty of the Southern United States. By 1898, they had three daughters, named Helen, Ethel, and Dorothy, and one son named Edwin. Their second daughter, Helen Maria Chesnutt, became a noted classicist and published a biography of her father, in which she attempted to avoid extraneous emotion, seeking to provide a detailed telling of her father&#x27;s life as accurately as she could.

==Legal and writing career==
Chesnutt wanted to pursue a literary career, which he desired for the sake of providing for his family, as well as improving race relations with social commentary and literary activism. After spending six months in New York City, Chesnutt came to the conclusion that he could not raise a family there, and so the Chesnutts moved to Cleveland. In 1887, in Cleveland, Chesnutt studied the law and passed the bar exam. Chesnutt had learned stenography as a young man in North Carolina, and used this skill to establish what became a lucrative court reporting (legal stenography) business, which made him &quot;financially prosperous&quot;.

Chesnutt also began writing stories, which were published by top-ranked national magazines. These included &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, which in August 1887 published &quot;The Goophered Grapevine&quot;, his first short story. It was the first work by an African American to be published by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In 1890, he tried to interest Walter Hines Page of Houghton Mifflin in his novel &quot;A Business Career&quot;, completed that year. Page said he needed to establish his reputation more before publishing a novel but encouraged him. Dealing with white characters and their society, this novel was found among Chesnutt&#x27;s manuscripts and eventually published in 2005.
His first book was a collection of short stories entitled &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot;, published in 1899. These stories featured black characters who spoke in African American Vernacular English, as was popular in much contemporary southern literature portraying the antebellum years in the South, as well as the postwar period.

That year he published another short story collection, &quot;The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color-Line&quot; (1899), which included the title story, as well as &quot;The Passing of Grandison&quot;, and others. These overturned contemporary ideas about the behavior of enslaved people and their seeking of freedom, as well as raising new issues about African-American culture. &quot;Atlantic&quot; editors strongly encouraged Chesnutt in his writing, and he had a 20-year relationship with the magazine.

Chesnutt&#x27;s stories on racial identity were complex and concerned characters dealing with the difficulties of racialization, &quot;passing&quot;, illegitimacy, racial identities, and social place throughout his career. As in &quot;The Wife of His Youth&quot;, Chesnutt explored issues of color and class preference within the black community, including among longtime free people of color in northern towns.

The issues were especially pressing during the social volatility of Reconstruction and late 19th-century southern society. Whites in the South were trying to reestablish supremacy in social, economic and political spheres. With their regaining of political dominance through paramilitary violence and suppression of black voting in the late 19th century, white Democrats in the South passed laws imposing legal racial segregation and a variety of Jim Crow rules that imposed second-class status on black people. From 1890 to 1910, southern states also passed new constitutions and laws that disfranchised most black people and many poor white people from voting. At the same time, there was often distance and competition between the masses of illiterate freedmen making their way from slavery, and families established as free before the war, especially if the latter were educated and property-owning.

Chesnutt continued writing short stories. He also completed a biography of the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery before the war and become renowned as a speaker and abolitionist in the North. Encouraged by &quot;Atlantic&quot; editors, however, Chestnutt eventually moved to the larger novel form. He wanted to express his stronger sense of activism. The magazine&#x27;s press published his first novel, &quot;The House behind the Cedars&quot; (1900).

His &quot;Marrow of Tradition&quot; (1901) was based on the Wilmington Massacre of 1898, when whites took over the city: attacking and killing many black people, and ousting the elected biracial government. This was the only &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in United States history. Eric Sundquist, in his book &quot;To Wake the Nations: Race in the Making of American Culture &quot; (1993), described the novel as &quot;probably the most astute political-historical novel of its day&quot;, both in recounting the massacre and reflecting the complicated social times in which Chesnutt wrote it. Chesnutt wrote several other novels, though some of them were published posthumously. He also traveled around and gave regular lectures in different states, primarily going on tour in the north.

Because his novels posed a more direct challenge to current sociopolitical conditions, they were not as popular among readers as his stories, which had portrayed antebellum society. But, among the era&#x27;s literary writers, Chesnutt was well-respected. For example, in 1905, he was invited to Mark Twain&#x27;s 70th-birthday party in New York City. Although Chesnutt&#x27;s stories met with critical acclaim, poor sales of his novels doomed his hopes of a self-supporting literary career. His last novel, &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Dream&quot;, was published in 1905 and detailed the actions of an ex-Confederate colonel returning to his hometown in North Carolina with hopes of reviving the town.

He produced a play called &quot;Mrs. Darcy&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1906, however, it did not make much money and was deemed a failure. Afterward, aside from a few small pieces, Chesnutt did not write or publish much of anything before his eventual death in 1932.

== Writing ==
In style and subject matter, the writings of Charles Chesnutt straddle the divide between the local color school of American writing and literary realism.

One of Chesnutt&#x27;s important works was &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot; (1899), a collection of stories set in postbellum North Carolina. The lead character Uncle Julius, a formerly enslaved man, entertains a white couple from the North, who have moved to the farm, with fantastical tales of antebellum plantation life. Julius&#x27;s tales feature such supernatural elements as haunting, transfiguration, and conjuring, which were typical of Southern African-American folk tales. But Uncle Julius is also telling the stories in ways crafted to achieve his own goals and care for his circle. Julius&#x27; tales are similar to Joel Chandler Harris&#x27; collection of folktales, the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; tales, but differ in that they indirectly provide commentary on slavery and racial inequality, and the psychological and social effects therein. Controversially, some argue that these stories reinforce African American stereotypes, but for the most part, critics typically agree that the stories are elevated by their allegorical depiction of racial injustice. Seven of the Uncle Julius tales were collected in &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot;. Chesnutt wrote a total of fourteen Uncle Julius tales, the remainder of which were later collected in &quot;The Conjure Woman and Other Conjure Tales&quot;, edited by Richard H. Brodhead and published posthumously in 1993.

In 1899, Chesnutt published his &quot;The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color-Line&quot;, a collection of short stories in the realist vein. He explored many themes that also were used by 20th-century black writers:especially the prevalence of color prejudice&quot; among blacks, &quot;the dangers of &#x27;passing&#x27;, the bitterness of mulatto offspring..., the pitfalls of urban life and intermarriage in the North, and the maladministration of justice in the small towns of the South.

Both collections were highly praised by the influential novelist, critic, and editor William Dean Howells in a review published in 1900 in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; titled &quot;Mr. Charles W. Chesnutt&#x27;s Stories&quot;. While acknowledging Chesnutt as a black writer, he says the stories are not to be first considered for their &quot;racial interest&quot; but it is as &quot;works of art, that they make their appeal, and we must allow the force of this quite independently of the other interest.&quot; He described Chesnutt asnotable for the passionless handling of a phase of our common life which is tense with potential tragedy; for the attitude almost ironical, in which the artist observes the play of contesting emotions in the drama under his eyes; and for his apparently reluctant, apparently helpless consent to let the spectator know his real feeling in the matter.&quot;The House Behind the Cedars&quot; (1900) was Chesnutt&#x27;s first novel, his attempt to improve on what he believed were inadequate depictions of the complexity of race and the South&#x27;s social relations. He wanted to express a more realistic portrait of his region and community drawn from personal experience. He was also concerned with the silence around issues of miscegenation and passing, and hoped to provoke political discussion by his novel. The issues are expressed chiefly through the trials of Rena Walden, a young, fair, mixed-race woman who joins her brother in another town, where he is already passing for white and established as a lawyer. She and a white upper-class friend of his fall in love and become engaged. When her fiancée learns of her black ancestry, he breaks their engagement, but tries to get her to agree to be his mistress. She leaves to teach in a black school, but is assaulted there by a lower-class mulatto. She tries to return to her mother but dies on the way, although helped by a longtime black friend.

&quot;The Marrow of Tradition&quot; (1901), set fictionally against events like the Wilmington Race Riot, marked a turning point for Chesnutt. He combined leading characters who were prominent whites in town, together with a black doctor who had returned from the North, exploring the difficulties for the latter in a small, prejudiced Southern town. Among the characters were half-sisters, one white and one black, daughters of the same white father, who encounter each other during these events. With this and other early 20th-century works, Chesnutt began to address political issues more directly and confronted sensitive topics such as racial &quot;passing&quot;, lynching, and miscegenation, which made many readers uncomfortable.

Many reviewers condemned the novel&#x27;s overt politics. Some of Chesnutt&#x27;s supporters, such as William Dean Howells, regretted its &quot;bitter, bitter&quot; tone. He found it powerful but with more &quot;justice than mercy&quot; in it. Middle-class white readers, who had been the core audience for Chesnutt&#x27;s earlier works, found the novel&#x27;s content shocking and some found it offensive. It sold poorly.

His last novel, &quot; The Colonel&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1905), was described as &quot;a tragic story of an idealist&#x27;s attempt to revive a depressed North Carolina town through a socioeconomic program much akin to the New South creed of Henry W. Grady and Booker T. Washington.&quot; It featured a white aristocrat who returns to his town during the Reconstruction, when it was controlled by a lower-class white and was stagnating economically. Colonel Champion builds a new cotton mill, to try to establish business. He runs into conflicts because of racial discrimination and leaves the town in defeat. The book received little critical notice and sold hardly any copies. Chesnutt gave up thinking he could support his family by his writing. He built up his court reporting business, lectured in the North, and became an activist with the NAACP. The Harlem Renaissance eclipsed much of Chesnutt&#x27;s remaining literary reputation. New writers regarded him as old-fashioned, even believing him to be guilty of pandering to racial stereotypes. They relegated Chesnutt to minor status.

Overall, Chesnutt&#x27;s writing style is formal and subtle. A typical sentence from his fiction is a passage from &quot;The House Behind the Cedars&quot;: &quot;When the first great shock of his discovery wore off, the fact of Rena&#x27;s origin lost to Tryon some of its initial repugnance—indeed, the repugnance was not to the woman at all, as their past relations were evidence, but merely to the thought of her as a wife.&quot; - Chapter XX, &quot;Digging up roots&quot;.

Starting in the 1960s, when the Civil Rights Movement brought renewed attention to African-American life and artists, a long process of critical discussion and re-evaluation has revived Chesnutt&#x27;s reputation. In particular, critics have focused on the writer&#x27;s complex narrative technique, subtlety, and use of irony. Several commentators have praised Chesnutt&#x27;s exploration of racial identity, the manner in which he used African-American speech and folklore, and his criticism of the skewed logic put forth by Jim Crow laws. Chesnutt&#x27;s longer works laid the foundation for the modern African-American novel.

It also won &quot;Best Short Film&quot; at The Sweet Auburn International Film Festival, and the &quot;Short Film&quot; award at the Hollywood Black Film Festival.

== Race relations ==
Chesnutt&#x27;s views on race relations put him between Du Bois&#x27; talented tenth and Booker Washington&#x27;s separate but equal positions. In 1905, he delivered a speech to the Boston Historical and Literary Association, and later published his speech as an essay titled &quot;Race Prejudice; Its Causes and Its Cure.&quot; In the speech, he spoke about dismantling race antagonism &quot;stone by stone&quot; as the black middle class continued to grow and prosper. As he recounted the history of black achievements and spoke on poverty, Chesnutt cited many specific numbers and statistics in his speech, and called for full African American rights.

Chesnutt envisioned a nation of &quot;one people molded by the same culture.&quot; He concluded his remarks with the following statement, made 58 years before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech:

== Social and political activism ==

Starting in 1901, Chesnutt turned more energies to his court reporting business and, increasingly, to social and political activism. Beginning in 1910, he served on the General Committee of the newly founded National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Working with W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, he became one of the early 20th century&#x27;s most prominent activists and commentators.

Chesnutt contributed some short stories and essays to the NAACP&#x27;s official magazine, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, founded in 1910. He did not receive compensation for these pieces. He wrote a strong essay protesting the southern states&#x27; successful actions to disfranchise black people at the turn of the 20th century. To his dismay, their new constitutions and laws survived several appeals to the United States Supreme Court, which held that the conditions imposed (by new electoral registration requirements, poll taxes, literacy tests and similar conditions) applied to all residents and were therefore constitutional. Although a couple of rulings went against the states, they devised new means to keep black people from voting.

In 1917, Chesnutt protested showings in Ohio of the controversial film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, which the NAACP officially protested at venues across the nation. In Ohio he gained prohibitions against the film. Set during Reconstruction, the film glorified the Ku Klux Klan, which had taken violent action against freedmen. The Klan was revived following this film, reaching a peak in membership nationally in 1925, as chapters were founded in the urban Midwest and West as well as the South.

Chesnutt died on November 15, 1932, at the age of 74. He was interred in Cleveland&#x27;s Lake View Cemetery.

== Legacy and honors ==

* In 1913, Chesnutt was awarded an honorary LLD from Wilberforce University.
*1928, Chesnutt was awarded the NAACP&#x27;s Spingarn Medal for his life&#x27;s work.
*In 1987, construction of the Charles Waddell Chesnutt Library was completed at the Fayetteville State University in North Carolina. (Chesnutt had been the second principal of the Howard School, later known as Fayetteville State University.)
*In 2002, the Library of America added a major collection of Chesnutt&#x27;s fiction and non-fiction to its important &quot;American Authors&quot; series, under the title &quot;Stories, Novels and Essays: The Conjure Woman, The Wife of His Youth &amp; Other Stories of the Color Line, The House Behind the Cedars, The Marrow of Tradition, Uncollected Stories, Selected Essays&quot; (Werner Sollors, ed.). His two major novels and some collected short stories are available online at the University of North Carolina, Wikisource. and other websites (see below).
*On 31 January 2008, the United States Postal Service honored Chesnutt with the 31st stamp in the Black Heritage Series.
*Several of Chesnutt&#x27;s works have been published posthumously, including essays. In 1989 William L. Andrews wrote of him:
Today Chesnutt is recognized as a major innovator in the tradition of Afro American fiction, an important contributor to the deromanticizing trend in post-Civil War southern literature and a singular voice among turn-of-the-century realists who treated the color line in American life.

<doc id="202845" wikidata="Q433617" url="?curid=202845" title="James Iha">
<text>(born March 26, 1968) is an American rock musician. He is best known as a guitarist and co-founder of the alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins. He was a member until the band&#x27;s initial breakup in 2000 and rejoined in 2018. 

Iha has produced songs, contributed guitar, keyboards and vocals and produced remixes for a number of artists, including Midnight Movies, Isobel Campbell, Marilyn Manson, Whiskeytown, Scott Weiland and Michael Stipe. Among his other musical projects, Iha has been a permanent fixture of supergroup A Perfect Circle since 1999. He was also a member of Tinted Windows, a group with members of Cheap Trick, Fountains of Wayne, and Hanson. He previously co-owned independent record label Scratchie Records with Adam Schlesinger and, from 1999 to 2012, owned a recording studio with Schlesinger and Andy Chase of Ivy called Stratosphere Sound.

==Early life and background==
Iha was born in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, which he described as &quot;a boring, middle-class suburb of Chicago.&quot; Iha received average grades in high school, and, after a successful two-year stint at a local junior college, he majored in graphic design at Loyola University Chicago before dropping out to dedicate himself to the Smashing Pumpkins.

He is a second-generation Japanese-American and is able to speak only a little Japanese.

Like his bandmate Billy Corgan, Iha has a brother with a disability.

==The Smashing Pumpkins==
In 1987 Iha, then playing guitar in the Chicago band Snake Train, met Billy Corgan via a friend. Corgan had already been telling people he was in a band called &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot;, and decided to make it a real band with Iha.

Iha later became romantically involved with the band&#x27;s bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, but the couple broke up just prior to the band&#x27;s performance at the Reading Festival in 1992. After a brief feud between the two, Iha sustained a friendly and close relationship with Wretzky, citing her as a best friend.

Iha wrote and sang a number of Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; songs, such as: &quot;Blew Away&quot; on &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;, &quot;Bugg Superstar&quot; on &quot;Vieuphoria&quot;, &quot;Take Me Down&quot; on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, &quot;...Said Sadly&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;The Boy&quot;, and &quot;The Bells&quot; on &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot; on the &quot;Perfect&quot; single and &quot;Go&quot; on &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;. He co-wrote with Billy Corgan &quot;I Am One&quot; on &quot;Gish&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot; and &quot;Mayonaise&quot; on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;Plume&quot; on &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; and &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot; on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;. He sang the band&#x27;s covers of the Cure&#x27;s &quot;A Night Like This&quot; and Syd Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Terrapin&quot;. During his time with the Pumpkins, Iha recorded with other bands, including Ivy, to which Adam Schlesinger contributed, and Swedish New Wave band the Sounds.

Billy Corgan has claimed that Iha played very little guitar on the first two Smashing Pumpkins albums, with Corgan himself playing most of the parts in the studio that Iha played live.

Iha was often considered the &quot;quiet one&quot; in Smashing Pumpkins, but he was known to engage in ad-libbed jokes and rap sessions at live performances. His humor was encapsulated in his use of the catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a million faces, and I&#x27;ve rocked them all,&quot; originally from the Bon Jovi song &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.

In 1998, Iha released a moderately successful solo album, &quot;Let It Come Down&quot;. One music video was produced from this album, for the song &quot;Be Strong Now&quot;, which was released as a four-track single.

When his former bandmates Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin revived the &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot; name, Iha did not participate, and in fact had not spoken to Corgan in years. Corgan stated in a 2008 blog entry that when he and Chamberlin reunited, the &quot;door was open&quot; for Iha to rejoin, but he declined, and Corgan said that he &quot;can now say definitively that Iha isn&#x27;t ever coming back.&quot; However, in a 2012 interview about the band reformation, Iha stated that he was never even asked back into the band in the first place. Iha also admitted within the interview that he had not heard any of the band&#x27;s new music since the reformation.

In a March 2013 interview, he was asked about looking back at the band&#x27;s history and explained that he never really thought about his former success with the band, but did look back with fondness when asked about the six studio albums he made with them. He revealed that he and Corgan had not spoken in around ten years, but that he did speak to Wretzky &quot;once in a while&quot;.

On March 26, 2016 and March 27, 2016, Iha joined Corgan and Chamberlin on stage unannounced at back-to-back Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Iha played a third show with the band in their hometown of Chicago at the Civic Opera house on April 14, 2016. In 2017, reunion rumors were leaked through various sources, and in 2018, Iha was spotted with Corgan, Chamberlin, and former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder in the studio and at a photo shoot, confirming his return to the band. In summer 2018, the reunited band embarked on the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour, which was followed at the end of the year by the release of their album &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.&quot; Iha would go on to also record &quot;Cyr&quot; with the reunited lineup, which was released in November 2020.

==Post-Pumpkins work==

===2001–2004: A Perfect Circle, producing, Japan===

After the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; breakup in 2000, Iha pursued many projects. He continues to contribute to other artists&#x27; recordings, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Sad&quot; on Whiskeytown&#x27;s &quot;Pneumonia&quot; released in 2001 and further guest appearances for bands Ivy and Fountains of Wayne, both of which he remained close to, appearing on virtually every release by both bands since 1997. Andy Chase of Ivy, and Adam Schlesinger of both Ivy and Fountains, recorded on most songs James produced or wrote for other artists. Schlesinger first recorded on Iha&#x27;s song on &quot;The Bells&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins.

Iha made bigger news when he joined the alternative rock supergroup A Perfect Circle in July 2003 in time for their &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; club tour. He has since recorded on their 2004 album &quot;eMOTIVe&quot; as well as contributed remixes of &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Outsider&quot;, and is back with the band following its near 6-year long hiatus. In 2003, he joined Vanessa and the O&#x27;s. The group released an EP &quot;Plus Rien&quot; in Sweden the same year and followed up with the album &quot;La Ballade d&#x27;O&quot; in 2005–06 on the band&#x27;s independent record company Rushmore Recordings playing live shows in Sweden during the summer of 2005.

Iha has collaborated on musical and fashion design projects in Japan. He collaborated on and produced two tracks with Japanese musician Chara for her 2001 album &quot;Madrigal&quot; called &quot;Boku ni Utsushite&quot; and &quot;Skirt&quot;. The latter was accompanied by a music video featuring Iha as a hunter in a forest. With the help of longtime friend and manager Isao Izutsu, Iha started the clothing label Vaporize (f.k.a. &#x27;Vapor&#x27;) in 2001, and recorded &quot;Never Ever&quot;, his first solo song since the Smashing Pumpkins demise, for Vaporize&#x27;s first runway show. The brand has been a collaboration with the Japanese label Beams since 2001.

In 2001, Iha played live with the Blank Theory and recorded on their album &quot;Beyond the Calm of the Corridor&quot; producing the song &quot;Addicted&quot; together with Schlesinger and contributing guitar playing.

===2005–2007: Soundtracks, collaborations, remixes===
Iha scored the Japanese film &quot;Linda, Linda, Linda&quot;, released in late summer of 2005. The same year he teamed with Schlesinger again to produce a duet cover of Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;Splish Splash&quot; for the soundtrack to the Wayne Wang film &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot;. The same year Iha contributed guitar to some tracks of Chino Moreno&#x27;s band Team Sleep second album, which has yet to be released.

Iha produced two tracks on the 2006 tribute album to Serge Gainsbourg, &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot;, &quot;I Love You (Me Either)&quot;, that featured Cat Power and model Karen Elson singing and &quot;L&#x27;Hotel&quot; with Michael Stipe on vocals. Iha recorded on the track &quot;The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde&quot; in a duet with singer Kazu Makino (of Blonde Redhead) on the US edition of the album.

In February 2006, a digital EP &quot;In the Sun&quot; produced by Iha featuring Michael Stipe and Chris Martin was released. The EP was for the benefit of Gulf Coast victims of Hurricane Katrina. The song was featured on an episode of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. In collaboration with Stipe, Iha played guitar at the &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Home Now&quot; concert in March 2006 in New York City to benefit Iraq War veterans peace groups such as Veterans for Peace.

Iha remixed &quot;Me Plus One&quot;, a track from Norwegian pop singer Annie&#x27;s debut album &quot;Anniemal&quot;. Released in October 2006, Florida pop group the Postmarks&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye&quot; EP features a remix by Iha. That same year, Iha teamed up with Schlesinger to co-produce folk band America&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, and recorded on Scottish singer Isobel Campbell&#x27;s album, collaborating on her renditions of traditional Irish and Scottish folk songs. In 2006 Iha recorded a cover of &quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; by the Ramones for 30th anniversary of a Japanese clothing label Beams.

In February 2007, Side-Line announced that Iha delivered a remix for the Ladytron single &quot;Weekend Mixes&quot; out on March 9 via Smoke &amp; Mirrors. In April 2007, he recorded a remix for the Midnight Movies track &quot;Patient Eye&quot;.

Iha appeared on stage with Swedish band the Sounds, on the season finale of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; in April 2007 and contributed guitar to the song &quot;Seatbacks and Traytables&quot;, on Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Traffic and Weather&quot;. His former bandmate Melissa Auf der Maur contributed to that album.

===2007–present: Second solo album and Smashing Pumpkins reunion===
In the spring of 2007, Iha told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that he was writing and recording songs for a second solo album. In the spring of 2007, Iha remixed Midnight Movies and the Postmarks as freebies on the Internet. A Chicago weekly reported in June 2007 that Iha had been living in New York City for some time, running a recording studio and independent label. Iha had lived in Manhattan since 2000 and has since moved to Brooklyn.

In May 2008, Marilyn Manson said that Iha would be making a guest appearance on his new record; however, Iha was not credited as a guitarist on the album.

On December 22, 2008, the Swedish band A Camp (the solo project of the Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson) put out a press release announcing that their new album would come out on April 28, 2009, featuring guest appearances by Iha and other musicians.

On February 17, 2009, it was announced that Iha had, together with Taylor Hanson, Fountains of Wayne bassist Adam Schlesinger, and Cheap Trick drummer Bun E. Carlos formed a new band called Tinted Windows. The band played their first publicized gig at SXSW in Austin, Texas on March 20. Their first album was released on April 21, 2009 to generally positive reviews.

In April 2010, Iha&#x27;s website reopened. According to the site, Iha considered his next solo album &quot;halfway done (in his mind)&quot;. Shortly thereafter, a picture of Iha with Kelly Pratt and Jon Natchez from the band Beirut was posted on the Web site saying they would be playing horns on the album.

In August 2010, members of A Perfect Circle posted messages to their Twitter accounts telling fans of their return after a 6-year long hiatus. The band later announced tour dates in which they would be playing the entirety of each of their three albums at each concert, with one album being played per night. It was announced that the lineup would consist of Maynard James Keenan, Billy Howerdel, Josh Freese, Matt McJunkins, and Iha.

Iha&#x27;s second solo album titled &quot;Look to the Sky&quot; was released in March 2012. To begin its promotion, Iha performed at the 2nd EMI ROCKS festival in Saitama, Japan in February 2012, and later in December that year performing a small European tour in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon.

In 2013, under management of David Bason, Iha collaborated with Japanese musician Yukihiro Takahashi, writing songs for and performing on Takahashi&#x27;s album &quot;Life Anew&quot;, and performing as part of Takahashi&#x27;s band &quot;In Phase&quot; on tours in Japan.

In 2014 Iha scored the soundtrack to Lionsgate/Hulu series &quot;Deadbeat&quot;.

In 2016 Iha composed the score for James Franco&#x27;s film &quot;Mother, May I Sleep with Danger?&quot;

In 2017 Iha composed the score for the drama series &quot;The Arrangement&quot;. 

In 2023 Iha did the music for That 90s Show.

<text>The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (also known as &quot;Tohopeka&quot;, &quot;Cholocco Litabixbee&quot;, or &quot;The Horseshoe&quot;), was fought during the War of 1812 in the Mississippi Territory, now central Alabama. On March 27, 1814, United States forces and Indian allies under Major General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Sticks, a part of the Creek Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the Creek War.

==Background==

The Creek Indians of Georgia and the eastern part of the Mississippi Territory had become divided into two factions: the Upper Creek (or Red Sticks), a majority who opposed American expansion and sided with the British and the colonial authorities of Spanish Florida during the War of 1812; and the Lower Creek, who were more assimilated into the Anglo culture, had a stronger relationship with the U.S. Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins, and sought to remain on good terms with the Americans.

The Shawnee war leader Tecumseh visited Creek and other Southeast Indian towns in 1811–1812 to recruit warriors to join his war against American territorial encroachment. The Red Sticks, young men who wanted to revive traditional religious and cultural practices, were already forming, resisting assimilation. They began to raid American frontier settlements. When the Lower Creek helped U.S. forces to capture and punish leading raiders, the Lower Creek were punished in turn by the Red Sticks.

In 1813, militia troops intercepted a Red Stick party returning from obtaining arms in (Spanish colonial) Pensacola. While they were looting the material, the Red Sticks returned and defeated them, at what became known as the Battle of Burnt Corn. Red Sticks&#x27; raiding of enemy settlements continued; and in August 1813 they attacked an American outpost at Fort Mims.

After the Fort Mims massacre, frontier settlers appealed to the government for help. Since Federal military forces were committed to waging the War of 1812 against Great Britain, the governments of Tennessee, Georgia, and the Mississippi Territory organized militia forces, which together with Lower Creek and Cherokee allies, fought against the Red Sticks.

After leaving Fort Williams in the spring of 1814, Jackson&#x27;s army cut its way through the forest to within six miles (10 km) of Chief Menawa&#x27;s Red Stick camp &quot;Tehopeka&quot;, near a bend in the Tallapoosa River called &quot;Horseshoe Bend&quot;—located in what is now central Alabama, east of present-day Alexander City. Jackson sent General John Coffee with the mounted infantry and the Indian allies south across the river to surround the Red Sticks&#x27; camp, while Jackson stayed with the rest of the 2,000 infantry north of the camp. Added to the militia units were the 39th United States Infantry and about 600 Cherokee, Choctaw, and Lower Creek, fighting against the Red Stick Creek warriors.

===American Forces===
West Tennessee Militia: Major General Andrew Jackson

==Battle==

On March 27, 1814, General Andrew Jackson led troops consisting of 2,700 American soldiers, 500 Cherokee, and 100 Lower Creek allies up a steep hill near Tehopeka. From this vantage point, Jackson would begin his attack on the Red Stick fortification. At 6:30am, he split his troops and sent roughly 1,300 men to cross the Tallapoosa River and surround the Creek village. Then, at 10:30 a.m., Jackson&#x27;s remaining troops began an artillery barrage which consisted of two cannons firing for about two hours. Little damage was caused to the Red Sticks or their 400-yard-long, log-and-dirt fortifications. In fact, Jackson was quite impressed with the measures the Red Sticks took to protect their position. As he later wrote:

Soon, Jackson ordered a bayonet charge. The 39th U.S. Infantry, led by Colonel John Williams, charged the breastworks and engaged the Red Sticks in hand-to-hand combat. Sam Houston (the future statesman and leader of Texas) served as a third lieutenant in Jackson&#x27;s army. Houston was one of the first to make it over the log barricade alive and received a wound from a Creek arrow that troubled him for the rest of his life.

Meanwhile, the troops under the command of General John Coffee had successfully crossed the river and surrounded the encampment. They joined the fight and gave Jackson a great advantage. The Creek warriors refused to surrender, though, and the battle lasted for more than five hours. At the end, roughly 800 of the 1,000 Red Stick warriors present at the battle were killed. In contrast, Jackson lost fewer than 50 men during the fight and reported 154 wounded.

After the battle, Jackson&#x27;s troops allegedly made bridle reins from skin taken from Indian corpses, conducted a body count by cutting off the tips of their noses, and sent their clothing as souvenirs to the &quot;ladies of Tennessee.&quot;

Chief Menawa was severely wounded but survived; he led about 200 of the original 1,000 warriors across the river and toward safety, to join the Seminole tribe in Spanish Florida.

==Results==
On August 9, 1814, Andrew Jackson forced the Creek to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The Creek Nation was forced to cede —half of central Alabama and part of southern Georgia—to the United States government; this included territory of the Lower Creek, who had been allies of the United States. Jackson had determined the areas from his sense of security needs. Of the Jackson forced the Creek to cede , which was claimed by the Cherokee Nation, which had also allied with the United States. Jackson was promoted to major general in the U.S. Army after getting agreement to the treaty.

==Legacy==
The battlefield is preserved in the Horseshoe Bend National Military Park.

Two currently active battalions of the Regular Army (2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment) perpetuate the lineage of the old 39th Infantry Regiment, which fought at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

==In fiction==
Eric Flint has written a series of alternate history novels, &quot;Trail of Glory,&quot; that begin with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In Flint&#x27;s version, Houston is only lightly wounded in the battle, allowing him freedom to develop his career, in turn facilitating the author&#x27;s objectives.

The main character of Paulette Jiles&#x27; novel News of the World, &#x27;Captain&#x27; Jefferson Kyle Kidd, has a backstory that includes fighting as a youth of 16 in this battle under Jackson.

<text>Soyuz 21 (, &quot;Union 21&quot;) was a 1976 Soviet crewed mission to the Salyut 5 space station, the first of three flights to the station. The mission&#x27;s objectives were mainly military in scope, but included other scientific work. The mission ended abruptly with cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov returning to Earth after 49 days in orbit. The precise reason for the early end of the mission was the subject of much speculation, but was reported to be an emergency evacuation after the Salyut atmosphere developed an acrid odor.

*Period: 88.7 minutes

== Mission highlights ==
Salyut 5, the last dedicated military space station in the Soviet space program, was launched 22 June 1976. Its first crew was launched 14 days later on 6 July 1976, with Commander Volynov and Flight Engineer Zholobov aboard Soyuz 21. Based on landing opportunities, observers estimated the mission was intended to last 54 to 66 days. They docked with the station the next day, and gave a televised tour 8 July 1976.

Their stay coincided with the start of the Siber military exercise in Siberia, which they observed as part of an assessment of the station&#x27;s military surveillance capabilities. They conducted only a few scientific experiments, including the first use of the Kristall furnace for crystal growth. Engineering experiments included propellant transfer system tests with implications for future operation of the freight-carrying Progress spacecraft.

Experiments conducted during the mission were mainly of a military nature as part of the Almaz program. Various purely scientific tasks were also carried out, including solar observations and biological observations of an aquarium of fish carried into orbit. A television link-up with school children on 17 August 1976 was also undertaken.

On 24 August 1976, it was announced the mission was to end in only 10 hours, a development which caught even the reporters of Radio Moscow by surprise. The reason for the sudden termination of the mission was reported at the time to have been an acrid odor that developed in the environmental control system. The problem was said to have begun as early as 17 August 1976. The Soviets made no comments at the time, but the next crew to board the station wore breathing masks. Later reports indicate that the mission may have ended owing to a deterioration in the health of Zholobov. The mission was to last two months but was cut short by a gradually worsening illness of Zholobov.

The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 21 but as Volynov tried to undock from the station, the docking latches failed to release properly. As he fired the jets to move the spacecraft away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved out of range of ground communications, the cosmonauts received only the first set of emergency procedures. Volynov tried a second time to undock but only managed slightly to loosen the latches. The situation persisted for an entire orbit, 90 minutes, when the final set of emergency procedures were received and the crew finally disengaged the latches.

Because Soyuz 21 was returning early, it was outside the normal recovery window. It then encountered strong winds as it descended, which caused uneven firing of the retrorockets. It made a hard landing around midnight at the southwest of Kokchetav, Kazakhstan.

Zholobov&#x27;s illness was apparently caused by nitric acid fumes leaking from the Salyut&#x27;s propellant tanks; other reports, however, indicate that the crew failed to follow their physical exercise program and suffered from lack of sleep. Sources at NASA have reported that psychologists with the Russian Aviation and Space Agency cited Soyuz 21 as ending prematurely due to unspecified &quot;interpersonal issues&quot; with the crew. The next mission to successfully dock with the station, Soyuz 24, would vent Salyut 5&#x27;s air to space and replace it due to concerns the air had become toxic.

<text>Daniel Pearl (October 10, 1963 – February 1, 2002) was an American journalist who worked for &quot;The Wall Street Journal.&quot; On January 23, 2002, he was kidnapped by Islamist militants while he was on his way to what he had expected would be an interview with Pakistani religious cleric Mubarak Ali Gilani in the city of Karachi. Pearl had moved to Mumbai, India, upon taking up a regional posting by his newspaper and later entered Pakistan to cover the war on terror, which was launched by the United States in response to the September 11 attacks in 2001. At the time of his abduction, he had been investigating the alleged links between British citizen Richard Reid (or the &quot;Shoe Bomber&quot;) and al-Qaeda; Reid had reportedly completed his training at a facility owned by Gilani, who had been accused by the United States of being affiliated with the Pakistani terrorist organization Jamaat ul-Fuqra.

A few days after his disappearance, Pearl&#x27;s captors released a video in which he is recorded condemning American foreign policy and repeatedly telling the camera that he and his family are Jewish and have visited Israel, following which his throat is slit and his head severed from his body. Before killing Pearl, the captors had issued an ultimatum to the United States government, namely including the demands that all Pakistani terrorists be freed from American prisons and that the United States move forward with a halted shipment of F-16s for the Pakistani government.

Gilani refuted allegations of involvement with Jamaat ul-Fuqra and Pearl&#x27;s killing. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested by Pakistani authorities and sentenced to death in July 2002 for the execution, but his conviction was overturned by a Pakistani court in 2020. Sheikh had previously been arrested by Indian authorities for his involvement in the 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India, and is also an affiliate of Jaish-e-Mohammed and al-Qaeda, among other armed jihadist organizations.

==Early life and education==
Pearl was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1963, to Judea and Ruth Pearl (née Rejwan). His father is an Israeli-American of Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was an Iraqi Jew whose family was saved from the Farhud by Muslim neighbors. His family moved to Encino, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, when his father took a position with the University of California, Los Angeles as professor of computer science and statistics and later director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory. In 2011, Judea Pearl received the Turing Award, the &#x27;Nobel Prize for Computer Science&#x27;. The history of the family and its connections to Israel are described by Judea Pearl in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, &quot;Roots in the Holy Land&quot;.

Pearl attended Portola Junior High School and Birmingham High School. He then attended Stanford University from 1981 to 1985, where he was a Communication major with Phi Beta Kappa honors, a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, a co-founder of a student newspaper called the &quot;Stanford Commentator&quot;, as well as a reporter for the campus radio station KZSU. Pearl graduated from Stanford with a B.A. in Communication, after which he spent a summer as a Pulliam Fellow intern at &quot;The Indianapolis Star.&quot;

==Journalism career==

Following a trip to the Soviet Union, China and Europe, Pearl started his professional journalism career at the &quot;North Adams Transcript&quot; and &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; in western Massachusetts. From there he moved to the &quot;San Francisco Business Times&quot;.

In 1990, Pearl moved to the Atlanta bureau of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and moved again in 1993 to its Washington, D.C., bureau to cover telecommunications. In 1996, he was assigned to the London bureau and in 1999 to Paris. His articles covered a range of topics, such as the October 1994 story of a Stradivarius violin allegedly found on a highway on-ramp and a June 2000 story about Iranian pop music.

He became more involved in international affairs: his most notable investigations covered the ethnic wars in the Balkans, where he discovered that charges of an alleged genocide committed in Kosovo were unsubstantiated. He also explored the American missile attack on a supposed military facility in Khartoum, which he proved to have been a pharmaceutical factory.

==Marriage and family==
In 1999 in Paris, Pearl met and married French journalist Mariane van Neyenhoff, a former reporter and columnist for &quot;Glamour&quot;. Their son, Adam Daniel Pearl, was born in Paris on May 28, 2002, approximately four months after Pearl&#x27;s abduction and death.

==South Asia and murder==
The Pearls settled in Mumbai, India, after Daniel Pearl was made Southeast Asia bureau chief of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. They travelled to Karachi, Pakistan, which he used as a base for reporting on the United States&#x27; War on Terrorism following the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda terrorists in 2001 in the United States.

===Abduction===
On January 23, 2002, on his way to what he thought was an interview with Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani at the Village Restaurant in downtown Karachi about terrorist Richard Reid&#x27;s alleged training at one of Gilani&#x27;s camps in Pakistan, Pearl was kidnapped near the Metropole Hotel at 7:00 p.m. by several Islamist jihadist groups working in collaboration. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a member of the Harkat ul-Ansar/Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and later Jaish-e-Mohammed, has admitted to planning and committing the kidnapping but denied being involved in Pearl&#x27;s murder. The beheading video of Pearl was released by Jaish-e-Mohammed, under the pseudonym of &quot;National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty&quot; (also used in ransom emails) and Jaish member Amjad Farooqi was reportedly involved in the kidnapping and murder. In a January 2011 report prepared by the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), members of other Pakistani terrorist groups such as Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan were also stated to be involved in Pearl&#x27;s kidnapping and murder. The lead author of the report was Pearl&#x27;s friend and colleague in Pakistan, journalist Asra Nomani. All of the aforementioned groups were operating under the Lashkar-e-Omar umbrella. Al-Qaeda leaders were also involved in the kidnapping and murder of Pearl, with Saif al-Adel playing a role in organizing the kidnapping and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was personally identified in investigative reports as the one who killed Pearl. Pearl was detained and later killed at an Al-Qaeda safe house in Karachi owned by Pakistani businessman Saud Memon. Matiur Rehman, another al-Qaeda leader has been identified as being involved in the kidnapping.

The militants claimed Pearl was a spy and—using a Hotmail e-mail address—sent the United States a range of demands, including the freeing of all Pakistani terror detainees, and the release of a halted U.S. shipment of F-16 fighter jets to the Pakistani government.

The message read:
We give you one more day if America will not meet our demands we will kill Daniel. Then this cycle will continue and no American journalist could enter Pakistan.

Photos of Pearl handcuffed with a gun at his head and holding up a newspaper were attached. The group did not respond to public pleas for release of the journalist by his editor and his wife Mariane. United States intelligence forces tried to track down the kidnappers.

===Death===
Nine days later, the terrorists beheaded Pearl. On May 16, his severed head and decomposed body were found cut into ten pieces, and buried, along with an identifying jacket, in a shallow grave at Gadap, about north of Karachi. When the police found Pearl&#x27;s remains three months after his murder, Abdul Sattar Edhi, a Pakistani philanthropist, collected all of the body parts and took them to the morgue. He helped ensure that Pearl&#x27;s remains were returned to the United States, where he was later interred in the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

===Video of his murder===

On February 21, 2002, a video was released titled &quot;The Slaughter of the Spy-Journalist, the Jew Daniel Pearl&quot;. The video shows Pearl&#x27;s mutilated body, and lasts 3 minutes and 36 seconds.

During the video, Pearl said:

My name is Daniel Pearl. I&#x27;m a Jewish-American from Encino, California, USA. I come from, uh, on my father&#x27;s side the family is Zionist. My father&#x27;s Jewish, my mother&#x27;s Jewish, I&#x27;m Jewish. My family follows Judaism. We&#x27;ve made numerous family visits to Israel.

Pearl condemned American foreign policy in the video. His family stated that he did so under duress, describing him as &quot;a proud American, and he abhorred extremist ideologies&quot;. They also said that he gave signals that indicated that he did not agree with what he was saying. Following these statements, Pearl&#x27;s throat was slit, and his head was severed.

The video was released under the name of the &quot;National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty&quot;, a pseudonym of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, with the captors repeating their earlier emailed demands for the release of all Muslim prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and repatriation of all Pakistani nationals detained by the US, the end of US presence in Pakistan and the delivery of F-16 fighter planes paid for by Pakistan in the 1980s but not delivered at the time. It concluded by vowing similar attacks on Americans in Pakistan in the future. They warned that, if their demands were not met, they would repeat such a beheading &quot;again and again&quot;.

==Murder investigation==

===Arrests===
Three suspects were caught by February 6, 2002, after the IP address of those who sent the ransom e-mail was traced by police in Karachi. The arrests were carried out after investigation by Pakistani detective Mir Zubair Mahmood, assisted by an FBI computer expert. The man responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, surrendered to a former ISI officer, Brig. Ijaz Shah, who concealed Sheikh&#x27;s whereabouts from the Karachi police for a week. Sheikh had been in an Indian prison in connection with 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India. In December 1999, Sheikh was released by the Indian government in exchange for the safe release of passengers aboard hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.

On March 21, 2002, in Pakistan, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and three other suspects were charged with murder for their part in the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. They were convicted on July 15, 2002, and Sheikh was sentenced to death. Sheikh appealed the sentence. On April 2, 2020, Sheikh&#x27;s murder conviction was overturned by a Pakistani court, and his death sentence was reduced to seven years&#x27; time for his kidnapping conviction, previously served.

In his book, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;, President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf stated that Sheikh may have been an agent of MI6, and at some point may have become a double agent.

On March 10, 2007, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed claimed responsibility for personally killing Pearl by beheading. He is an alleged Al Qaeda operative reported to be third in command under Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the 2001 attacks. In a confession read during his Tribunal hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said, &quot;I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan.&quot; This confession repeated word for word the phrasing leaked in 2002 from his interrogation at a CIA black site interrogation center.

On March 19, 2007, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh&#x27;s lawyers cited Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s confession as part of an appeal in defense of their client. They said they had always acknowledged that their client played a role in Pearl&#x27;s murder, but they had argued that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the actual murderer. They plan to feature Mohammed&#x27;s confession as central in their appeal of their client&#x27;s death sentence.

According to an investigative report published in January 2011 by Georgetown University, the Federal Bureau of Investigation used vein matching to determine that the perpetrator in the video of the killing of Pearl was most likely Mohammed, identifying him through a &quot;bulging vein&quot; running across his hand that was visible in the video. Federal officials had been concerned that Mohammed&#x27;s confession obtained through waterboarding would not hold up in court. They intended to use this forensic evidence to bolster their case that he had murdered Pearl.

A Pakistani official announced on March 19, 2013, that another suspect was captured in connection with Pearl&#x27;s murder and was in police custody. Pakistan&#x27;s Inter Services Public Relations Directorate confirmed the arrest by a paramilitary unit known as the Pakistan Rangers.

On April 24, 2019, Pakistan arrested the last suspect involved in the murder, named Azam Jan. Azam Jan had eluded the authorities for two decades and was responsible for several terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.

=== Court proceedings 2020/2021 ===
On April 2, 2020, The High Court of Pakistan&#x27;s Southern Province of Sindh vacated the 2007 murder conviction of Omar Said Sheikh and his three co-conspirators (i.e., Fahad Nasim Ahmed, Syed Salman Saqib and Sheikh Mohammad Adil). The High Court reduced their sentences to a 7-year prison term for kidnapping, counting their prison detainment as time served. At the time, Omar Said Sheikh had been awaiting the death penalty and his co-conspirators were serving life sentences.

On April 3, 2020, Pakistani government authorities ordered the detention of the four men (despite the Sindh High Court&#x27;s ruling for their release the prior day), and stated that they would challenge the vacated case and hold the men on a measure that allows the government to detain terrorism suspects for up to three months with repeated extensions allowed. 

On May 2, 2020, the parents of Daniel Pearl filed an appeal to the Pakistani Supreme Court to reverse the April 2 decision of the Sindh High Court which had overturned the convictions of the four men in Pearl&#x27;s case. They hired Pakistani attorney Faisal Siddiqi to represent them. In making their appeal, Daniel&#x27;s father, Judea Pearl, said &quot;We are standing up for justice not only for our son, but for all our dear friends in Pakistan so they can live in a society free of violence and terror and raise their children in peace and harmony.&quot;

On July 1, 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court refused to overturn the lower court&#x27;s ruling vacating the sentence of Omar Said Sheikh for the kidnapping and murder of Pearl, and as a result, Sheikh would be freed from prison.

On September 28, 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court accepted the appeal by the family of Daniel Pearl seeking to keep Omar Said Sheikh on death row as punishment for beheading their son, and to uphold the life sentences of the three co-conspirators.

On December 24, 2020, a Pakistani court ordered the release of Omar Said Sheikh and his three accomplices, again arguing that they were due for release given time served, and that their continued detention was illegal.

On December 29, 2020, United States Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen released a strongly worded statement affirming that if Omar Said Sheikh and his co-conspirators were not held accountable in Pakistan, &quot;The United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here. We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearl&#x27;s abduction and murder.&quot; Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie confirmed that a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted Omar Said Sheikh and his co-conspirators for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl on March 14, 2002, during Christie&#x27;s tenure as U.S. Attorney for the state of New Jersey.

On January 28, 2021, Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court dismissed an appeal against the vacated sentence of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh aka Omar Said Sheikh in connection with the kidnapping and murder of journalist Daniel Pearl. The court also ordered that the three Pakistanis co-conspirators, who were sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl&#x27;s kidnapping and murder by beheading, should be freed. In a statement, Pearl&#x27;s family called the decision &quot;illegal and unfair&quot; and said they would appeal. At her daily briefing, White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki expressed outrage at the verdict and asked Pakistan to review all of its legal options, including possible extradition to the United States. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken issued a statement declaring that the &quot;US is committed to securing justice for Daniel Pearl&#x27;s family and holding terrorists accountable.&quot;

Two days later, the Pakistani government decided to formally join the Sindh High Court&#x27;s review petition against the Supreme Court judgment on the acquittal of all accused persons involved in the abduction and murder of Daniel Pearl. The Pakistani government filed a move application for the constitution of a larger bench to hear the review petition.

On February 2, 2021, Pakistan&#x27;s Supreme Court ordered Omar Said Sheikh (the alleged mastermind of Pearl&#x27;s abduction and beheading) to be taken off death row after 18 years and moved to a so-called government safe house. Omar Said Sheikh is under guard and not allowed to leave said facility. However, Sheikh is permitted visits from his wife and children.

On March 8, 2021, authorities in Karachi sent Omar Saeed Sheikh (whose sentence was reduced to time served of 7 years for murdering American journalist Daniel Pearl) to a rest house within the premises of Kot Lakhpat Jail. He is expected to remain there while the rest of the appeal process plays out in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

==Legacy==
A collection of Pearl&#x27;s writings (&quot;At Home in the World&quot;) was published posthumously in 2002. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that these demonstrated his &quot;extraordinary skill as a writer&quot; and his &quot;eye for quirky stories—many of which appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; &quot;middle column&quot;.

The Daniel Pearl Foundation was formed by Pearl&#x27;s parents Ruth and Judea Pearl; other family and friends have joined to continue Pearl&#x27;s mission. They intend to carry out the work in the spirit, style, and principles that shaped Pearl&#x27;s work and character. Daniel Pearl World Music Days has been held worldwide since 2002, and has promoted over 1,500 concerts in over 60 countries.

Pearl&#x27;s widow, Mariane Pearl, wrote the memoir &quot;A Mighty Heart&quot;, which tells the full story of Pearl&#x27;s life. The book was adapted into a film starring Dan Futterman as Daniel Pearl, Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl, Irfan Khan, Adnan Siddiqui, Archie Panjabi, and Will Patton.

On September 1, 2003, a book titled &quot;Who Killed Daniel Pearl?&quot; was published, written by Bernard-Henri Lévy. The book, which Lévy characterized as an &quot;investigative novel&quot;, was highly controversial because of its speculative conclusions about the killing, for its broad characterizations of Pakistan, and for the author&#x27;s decision to engage in a fictionalization of Pearl&#x27;s thoughts during the final moments of his life. Lévy was widely criticized for the book.

There were plans for a film adaptation of the book, to be directed by Tod Williams and star Josh Lucas, focusing on the last few days of Daniel Pearl&#x27;s life. These plans did not come to fruition, however, HBO Films produced a 79-minute documentary titled &quot;The Journalist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel Pearl&quot;. It premiered on HBO on October 10, 2006. The documentary chronicles Pearl&#x27;s life and death, and features extensive interviews with his immediate family. It is narrated by Christiane Amanpour, and was nominated for two Emmy Awards.

Pearl&#x27;s parents edited and published a collection of responses sent to them from around the globe, entitled &quot;I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl&quot;. At one point in the video, Daniel Pearl said: &quot;My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish&quot;, after which Pearl added a seemingly obscure detail, that a street in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak is named after his great-grandfather, who was one of the founders of the town. The family has written that this last detail authenticates Daniel&#x27;s own voice and demonstrates his willingness to claim his identity. Judea Pearl has written that at first this statement surprised him, but he later understood it to be a reference to the town-building tradition of his family, in contrast with the destructive aims of his captors. Judea Pearl then enlarged upon the idea by inviting responses from artists, government leaders, authors, journalists, scientists, scholars, rabbis, and others. All wrote personal responses to what they thought upon hearing that these were Pearl&#x27;s last words. Some responses were one sentence while others were several pages in length.

The book is organized by five themes: Identity; Heritage; Covenant, Chosenness, and Faith; Humanity and Ethnicity; Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) and Justice. Contributors include Theodore Bikel, Alan Dershowitz, Kirk Douglas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Larry King, Amos Oz, Shimon Peres, Daniel Schorr, Elie Wiesel, Peter Yarrow, and A.B. Yehoshua.

In western Massachusetts, where Pearl had been a young journalist, his friend and former bandmate, Todd Mack, established a new nonprofit organization called Fodfest (later renamed Music in Common), to continue Pearl&#x27;s legacy of &quot;bridge building&quot;, Mack said.

==Posthumous recognition==

In 2002, Pearl posthumously received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award from Colby College and in 2007, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award from the Houston Holocaust Museum.

On April 16, 2007, Pearl was added to the Holocaust Memorial on Miami Beach as the first non-Holocaust victim. His father gave his consent for the induction in order to remind generations to come that &quot;The forces of barbarity and evil are still active in our world. The Holocaust didn&#x27;t finish in 1945.&quot; Journalist Bradley Burston criticized the addition of a post-Holocaust victim to the memorial, saying &quot;it diminishes the uniqueness of the Holocaust&quot;.

In 2010, the International Press Institute named Pearl one of its World Press Freedom Heroes.

On December 10, 2007, President George W. Bush and Laura Bush invited Ruth and Judea Pearl, parents of Daniel Pearl, to the White House Hanukkah reception. They lighted the Pearl family menorah that once belonged to Daniel&#x27;s great-grandparents, Chaim and Rosa Pearl, who brought it with them when they moved from Poland to Mandatory Palestine in 1924. There they helped establish the town of Bnei Brak.

The late former mayor of New York City Ed Koch requested that his own tombstone be inscribed with Pearl&#x27;s words: &quot;My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.&quot;

===Films===
&quot;The Journalist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel Pearl&quot; (2006) a television documentary by Indian directors Ahmed Alauddin Jamal and Ramesh Sharma which aired on HBO compares the contrasting lives of Sheikh and Daniel Pearl. In 2007, the film &quot;A Mighty Heart&quot; was released, based on Mariane Pearl&#x27;s memoir of the same name. &quot;Omerta&quot;, an Indian biographical film based on the life of Sheikh, was released in 2017 and received positive reviews.

===Music===
American minimalist composer Steve Reich wrote his 2006 work &quot;Daniel Variations&quot;, jointly commissioned by the Daniel Pearl Foundation and the Barbican Centre, which interweaves Pearl&#x27;s own words with verses from the Book of Daniel.

===Institutions and awards in Pearl&#x27;s name===
Shortly after Pearl&#x27;s death, his parents founded the Daniel Pearl Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to promote cross-cultural understanding through journalism, music, and dialogue. The honorary board of the Daniel Pearl Foundation includes Christiane Amanpour, former US President Bill Clinton, Abdul Sattar Edhi, John L. Hennessy, Ted Koppel, Queen Noor of Jordan, Sari Nusseibeh, Mariane Pearl, Itzhak Perlman, and Elie Wiesel.

The Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture at UCLA was established by the foundation in 2002. Christopher Hitchens delivered a lecture on March 3, 2010. Other lecturers have included Anderson Cooper, David Brooks, Ted Koppel, Larry King, Jeff Greenfield, Daniel Schorr, and Thomas Friedman. Soka University of America&#x27;s student news magazine, titled &quot;the Pearl&quot;, is named in honor of Daniel Pearl. The 2021 Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture will be given on February 2, 2021, by CNN&#x27;s lead Washington correspondent Jake Tapper

On May 19, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act, which protects U.S. journalists around the world. The act is also designed to use tools from the Secretary of State to ensure that freedom of press is upheld in other countries.

In 2010, &quot;Moment&quot; established The Daniel Pearl Investigative Journalism Initiative to provide grants and mentors for independent journalists to conduct in-depth reporting on anti-Semitism and other prejudices. The edited stories are published in &quot;Moment&quot;. The project has already produced two stories that have been nominated for the prestigious Livingston Award—the equivalent of the Pulitzer for journalists under 35.

* – &#x27;The intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that information from American intelligence agencies helped Pakistani investigators track down the ring involved in the plot.

<doc id="202854" wikidata="Q2414596" url="?curid=202854" title="Alfredo Escalera">
<text>Alfredo &quot;El Salsero&quot; Escalera (born March 21, 1952) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer and is the former World Boxing Council Super Featherweight world champion. A native of Carolina, his nickname was &quot;Salsero&quot; because he was a fan of Salsa music. Escalera is also a 2023 Florida Boxing Hall of Fame Inductee.

==Early boxing career==
Escalera had his first professional bout on September 4, 1970, against Bob Payzant, in Portland. He won by a knockout in round four. He would suffer his first defeat in his third fight, when faced against Doug McClendon, who beat him by a decision in six rounds on January 26, 1971, in New York. He won five bouts in a row, and then lost by decision in eight rounds to future world title challenger Edwin Viruet.

He began 1972 by losing to another future world title challenger, Diego Alcala, by knockout in round eight, but he won his three other fights that year.

In 1973, he began, once again, by losing to another future world title challenger, Miguel Montilla, by a decision in ten rounds. Before the year was over, however, he was able to avenge that defeat, defeating Montilla by a knockout in round eight, and he won seven of his eight other fights that year.

By 1974, he began climbing up the super featherweight rankings, going 8-2 that year. He beat his own future world title challenger Sigfredo Rodriguez by a knockout in round one, and former world champion Ricardo Arredondo by a disqualification in round eight.

==Champion==
On July 4, 1975, he fought the WBC super featherweight champion Kuniaki Shibata in Mito, Japan, knocking Shibata out in round two to become the WBC super featherweight champion. Coincidentally, Escalera won his world title the same day that Angel Espada won the WBA world Welterweight championship at a fight that took place in Puerto Rico; this was the first time two Puerto Ricans became world champions the same day and as a consequence, Puerto Rico, a country that had only produced two world boxing champions in its history, doubled their number of champions in one day with Escalera and Espada&#x27;s victories.

Escalera became a household name in Puerto Rico during his tenure as world champion. He appeared in television commercials and was a popular public figure.

He defended his title ten times, including wins over Ray Lunny, Sigfredo Rodriguez and Tyrone Everett. Most observers consider the Everett &quot;win&quot; as one of the worst decisions in boxing history, as it appeared that Everett clearly won. A rematch was being negotiated when Everett was murdered.

Escalera lost his title on January 28, 1978, to Alexis Argüello of Nicaragua by a technical knockout in round 13 in Bayamón. In this fight, Escalera suffered a broken nose and tooth, a cut on his tongue and above his left eye, and a closed right eye before submitting to Argüello. The first Arguello-Escalera encounter has been dubbed as &quot;The Bloody Battle of Bayamon&quot;. The fight was described as &quot;brutal&quot;.

==Post-championship career==
Escalera and Argüello had a rematch, on February 4, 1979, in Rimini, and Escalera held a small lead on the judges&#x27; cards after 12 rounds. However, he was knocked out in round 13 by Argüello. Shortly after drawing (tying) with Antonio Cruz in ten rounds in October of that year, he announced his retirement.

In 1980, Escalera dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling, competing on the Puerto Rican professional wrestling circuit. However, in 1981, he launched a boxing comeback. He lost to future world light welterweight champion Gene Hatcher in San Antonio, but he beat former world title challenger Maurice Termite Watkins at &quot;The Battle of the Champions&#x27;&quot; undercard in Miami, to complete his 1982 boxing campaign.

In 1983, he avenged his loss to Hatcher, scoring a ten-round unanimous decision win at the Roberto Durán-Davey Moore world title fight undercard in Madison Square Garden. On September 15 of that year he lost to future world title challenger Charlie White Lighting Brown.

==Professional boxing record==

==Retirement==
After the Brown fight, Escalera announced his retirement from boxing once again. Shortly after, it was discovered that he had eyesight problems and had been fighting almost blinded for his last few fights.

Escalera now enjoys the fruits of his career in his farm in Puerto Rico. His son, Alfredo Escalera Jr., was once a boxer himself, who is based in Florida.

==Legacy==
The avid autograph signer left a boxing record of 53 wins, 14 losses and 3 draws, with 31 wins by knockout. His two fights with Argüello are considered by many to be boxing classics, Argüello-Escalera I making &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest fights of all time at number 67, and Argüello-Escalera II making it at number 40.

<text>In physics, especially in multilinear algebra and tensor analysis, covariance and contravariance describe how the quantitative description of certain geometric or physical entities changes with a change of basis. Briefly, a contravariant vector is a list of numbers that transforms oppositely to a change of basis, and a covariant vector is a list of numbers that transforms in the same way. Contravariant vectors are often just called &quot;vectors&quot; and covariant vectors are called &quot;covectors&quot; or &quot;dual vectors&quot;. The terms &quot;covariant&quot; and &quot;contravariant&quot; were introduced by James Joseph Sylvester in 1851.

Curvilinear coordinate systems, such as cylindrical or spherical coordinates, are often used in physical and geometric problems. Associated with any coordinate system is a natural choice of coordinate basis for vectors based at each point of the space, and covariance and contravariance are particularly important for understanding how the coordinate description of a vector changes by passing from one coordinate system to another. Tensors are objects in multilinear algebra that can have aspects of both covariance and contravariance.

==Introduction==
In physics, a vector typically arises as the outcome of a measurement or series of measurements, and is represented as a list (or tuple) of numbers such as

:formula_1

The numbers in the list depend on the choice of coordinate system. For instance, if the vector represents position with respect to an observer (position vector), then the coordinate system may be obtained from a system of rigid rods, or reference axes, along which the components &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2, and &quot;v&quot;3 are measured. For a vector to represent a geometric object, it must be possible to describe how it looks in any other coordinate system. That is to say, the components of the vectors will &quot;transform&quot; in a certain way in passing from one coordinate system to another.

A simple illustrative case is that of a Euclidean vector. For a vector, once a set of basis vectors has been defined, then the components of that vector will always vary &quot;opposite&quot; to that of the basis vectors. That vector is therefore defined as a &quot;contravariant&quot; tensor. Take a standard position vector for example. By changing the scale of the reference axes from meters to centimeters (that is, &quot;dividing&quot; the scale of the reference axes by 100, so that the basis vectors now are formula_2 meters long), the components of the measured position vector are &quot;multiplied&quot; by 100. A vector&#x27;s components change scale &quot;inversely&quot; to changes in scale to the reference axes, and consequently a vector is called a &quot;contravariant&quot; tensor.

A &quot;vector&quot;, which is an example of a &quot;contravariant&quot; tensor, has components that transform inversely to the transformation of the reference axes, (with example transformations including rotation and dilation). The vector itself does not change under these operations; instead, the components of the vector change in a way that cancels the change in the spatial axes. In other words, if the reference axes were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in exactly the opposite way. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector, would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the coordinate system undergoes a transformation described by an formula_3 invertible matrix &quot;M&quot;, so that the basis vectors transform according to formula_4, then the components of a vector v in the original basis ( formula_5 ) must be similarly transformed via formula_6. The components of a &quot;vector&quot; are often represented arranged in a column.

By contrast, a &quot;covector&quot; has components that transform like the reference axes. It lives in the dual vector space, and represents a linear map from vectors to scalars. The dot product operator involving vectors is a good example of a covector. To illustrate, assume we have a covector defined as formula_7 , where formula_8 is a vector. The components of this covector in some arbitrary basis are formula_9, with formula_10 being the basis vectors in the corresponding vector space. (This can be derived by noting that we want to get the correct answer for the dot product operation when multiplying by an arbitrary vector formula_11 , with components formula_12). The covariance of these covector components is then seen by noting that if a transformation described by an formula_3 invertible matrix &quot;M&quot; were to be applied to the basis vectors in the corresponding vector space, formula_4, then the components of the covector formula_7 will transform with the same matrix formula_16, namely, formula_17. The components of a &quot;covector&quot; are often represented arranged in a row.

A third concept related to covariance and contravariance is invariance. A scalar (also called type-0 or rank-0 tensor) is an object that does not vary with the change in basis. An example of a physical observable that is a scalar is the mass of a particle. The single, scalar value of mass is independent to changes in basis vectors and consequently is called &quot;invariant&quot;. The magnitude of a vector (such as distance) is another example of an invariant, because it remains fixed even if geometrical vector components vary. (For example, for a position vector of length formula_18 meters, if all Cartesian basis vectors are changed from formula_19 meters in length to formula_2 meters in length, the length of the position vector remains unchanged at formula_18 meters, although the vector components will all increase by a factor of formula_22). The scalar product of a vector and a covector is invariant, because one has components that vary with the base change, and the other has components that vary oppositely, and the two effects cancel out. One thus says that covectors are &quot;dual&quot; to vectors.

Thus, to summarize:
* A vector or tangent vector, has components that &quot;contra-vary&quot; with a change of basis to compensate. That is, the matrix that transforms the vector components must be the inverse of the matrix that transforms the basis vectors. The components of vectors (as opposed to those of covectors) are said to be contravariant. In Einstein notation (implicit summation over repeated index), contravariant components are denoted with &quot;upper indices&quot; as in
*:formula_23
* A covector or cotangent vector has components that &quot;co-vary&quot; with a change of basis in the corresponding (initial) vector space. That is, the components must be transformed by the same matrix as the change of basis matrix in the corresponding (initial) vector space. The components of covectors (as opposed to those of vectors) are said to be covariant. In Einstein notation, covariant components are denoted with &quot;lower indices&quot; as in
*:formula_24
* The scalar product of a vector and covector is the scalar formula_25, which is invariant. It is the duality pairing of vectors and covectors.

==Definition==
The general formulation of covariance and contravariance refers to how the components of a coordinate vector transform under a change of basis (passive transformation). Thus let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space of dimension &quot;n&quot; over a field of scalars &quot;S&quot;, and let each of and be a basis of &quot;V&quot;. Also, let the change of basis from f to f′ be given by

for some invertible &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; with entries formula_26.
Here, each vector &quot;Y&quot;&quot;j&quot; of the f′ basis is a linear combination of the vectors &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; of the f basis, so that

:formula_27

which are the columns of the matrix product formula_28.

===Contravariant transformation===

A vector formula_29 in &quot;V&quot; is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the elements formula_30 of the f basis as

where &quot;v&quot;[f] are elements of the field &quot;S&quot; known as the components of &quot;v&quot; in the f basis. Denote the column vector of components of &quot;v&quot; by v[f]:

:formula_31

so that () can be rewritten as a matrix product

:formula_32

The vector &quot;v&quot; may also be expressed in terms of the f′ basis, so that

:formula_33

However, since the vector &quot;v&quot; itself is invariant under the choice of basis,

:formula_34

The invariance of &quot;v&quot; combined with the relationship () between f and f′ implies that

:formula_35

giving the transformation rule

:formula_36

In terms of components,

:formula_37

where the coefficients formula_38 are the entries of the inverse matrix of &quot;A&quot;.

Because the components of the vector &quot;v&quot; transform with the &quot;inverse&quot; of the matrix &quot;A&quot;, these components are said to transform contravariantly under a change of basis.

The way &quot;A&quot; relates the two pairs is depicted in the following informal diagram using an arrow. The reversal of the arrow indicates a contravariant change:
:formula_39

===Covariant transformation===

A linear functional &quot;α&quot; on &quot;V&quot; is expressed uniquely in terms of its components (elements in &quot;S&quot;) in the f basis as

:formula_40

These components are the action of &quot;α&quot; on the basis vectors &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; of the f basis.

Under the change of basis from f to f′ (via ), the components transform so that

Denote the row vector of components of &quot;α&quot; by &quot;α&quot;[f]:

:formula_41

so that () can be rewritten as the matrix product

:formula_42

Because the components of the linear functional α transform with the matrix &quot;A&quot;, these components are said to transform covariantly under a change of basis.

The way &quot;A&quot; relates the two pairs is depicted in the following informal diagram using an arrow. A covariant relationship is indicated since the arrows travel in the same direction:
:formula_43

Had a column vector representation been used instead, the transformation law would be the transpose
:formula_44

==Coordinates==
The choice of basis f on the vector space &quot;V&quot; defines uniquely a set of coordinate functions on &quot;V&quot;, by means of
:formula_45
The coordinates on &quot;V&quot; are therefore contravariant in the sense that
:formula_46
Conversely, a system of &quot;n&quot; quantities &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; that transform like the coordinates &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; on &quot;V&quot; defines a contravariant vector (or simply vector). A system of &quot;n&quot; quantities that transform oppositely to the coordinates is then a covariant vector (or covector).

This formulation of contravariance and covariance is often more natural in applications in which there is a coordinate space (a manifold) on which vectors live as tangent vectors or cotangent vectors. Given a local coordinate system &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; on the manifold, the reference axes for the coordinate system are the vector fields
:formula_47
This gives rise to the frame at every point of the coordinate patch.

If &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a different coordinate system and
:formula_48
then the frame f&#x27; is related to the frame f by the inverse of the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transition:
:formula_49
Or, in indices,
:formula_50

A tangent vector is by definition a vector that is a linear combination of the coordinate partials formula_51. Thus a tangent vector is defined by
:formula_52

Such a vector is contravariant with respect to change of frame. Under changes in the coordinate system, one has
:formula_53

Therefore, the components of a tangent vector transform via
:formula_54

Accordingly, a system of &quot;n&quot; quantities &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; depending on the coordinates that transform in this way on passing from one coordinate system to another is called a contravariant vector.

==Covariant and contravariant components of a vector with a metric==
In a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; with a symmetric bilinear form (which may be referred to as the metric tensor), there is little distinction between covariant and contravariant vectors, because the bilinear form allows covectors to be identified with vectors. That is, a vector &quot;v&quot; uniquely determines a covector &quot;α&quot; via
:formula_55
for all vectors &quot;w&quot;. Conversely, each covector &quot;α&quot; determines a unique vector &quot;v&quot; by this equation. Because of this identification of vectors with covectors, one may speak of the covariant components or contravariant components of a vector, that is, they are just representations of the same vector using the reciprocal basis.

Given a basis of &quot;V&quot;, there is a unique reciprocal basis of &quot;V&quot; determined by requiring that
:formula_56
the Kronecker delta. In terms of these bases, any vector &quot;v&quot; can be written in two ways:
:formula_57
The components &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot;[f] are the contravariant components of the vector &quot;v&quot; in the basis f, and the components &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot;[f] are the covariant components of &quot;v&quot; in the basis f. The terminology is justified because under a change of basis,

:formula_58

===Euclidean plane===
In the Euclidean plane, the dot product allows for vectors to be identified with covectors. If formula_59 is a basis, then the dual basis formula_60 satisfies
:formula_61

Thus, e1 and e2 are perpendicular to each other, as are e2 and e1, and the lengths of e1 and e2 normalized against e1 and e2, respectively.

====Example====
For example, suppose that we are given a basis e1, e2 consisting of a pair of vectors making a 45° angle with one another, such that e1 has length 2 and e2 has length 1. Then the dual basis vectors are given as follows:
* e2 is the result of rotating e1 through an angle of 90° (where the sense is measured by assuming the pair e1, e2 to be positively oriented), and then rescaling so that holds.
* e1 is the result of rotating e2 through an angle of 90°, and then rescaling so that holds.
Applying these rules, we find
:formula_62
and
:formula_63

Thus the change of basis matrix in going from the original basis to the reciprocal basis is
:formula_64
since
:formula_65

For instance, the vector
:formula_66
is a vector with contravariant components
:formula_67

The covariant components are obtained by equating the two expressions for the vector &quot;v&quot;:
:formula_68
so
:formula_69

===Three-dimensional Euclidean space===

In the three-dimensional Euclidean space, one can also determine explicitly the dual basis to a given set of basis vectors e1, e2, e3 of &quot;E&quot;3 that are not necessarily assumed to be orthogonal nor of unit norm. The dual basis vectors are:

:formula_70

Even when the ei and ei are not orthonormal, they are still mutually reciprocal:
:formula_71

Then the contravariant components of any vector v can be obtained by the dot product of v with the dual basis vectors:

:formula_72

Likewise, the covariant components of v can be obtained from the dot product of v with basis vectors, viz.

:formula_73

Then v can be expressed in two (reciprocal) ways, viz.
:formula_74
or
:formula_75
Combining the above relations, we have
:formula_76
and we can convert between the basis and dual basis with
:formula_77
and
:formula_78

If the basis vectors are orthonormal, then they are the same as the dual basis vectors.

===General Euclidean spaces===
More generally, in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space &quot;V&quot;, if a basis is
:formula_79
the reciprocal basis is given by (double indices are summed over),
:formula_80
where the coefficients &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot; are the entries of the inverse matrix of
:formula_81
Indeed, we then have
:formula_82

The covariant and contravariant components of any vector

:formula_83

are related as above by
:formula_84
and
:formula_85

==Use in tensor analysis==

The distinction between covariance and contravariance is particularly important for computations with tensors, which often have mixed variance. This means that they have both covariant and contravariant components, or both vector and covector components. The valence of a tensor is the number of covariant and contravariant terms, and in Einstein notation, covariant components have lower indices, while contravariant components have upper indices. The duality between covariance and contravariance intervenes whenever a vector or tensor quantity is represented by its components, although modern differential geometry uses more sophisticated index-free methods to represent tensors.

In tensor analysis, a covariant vector varies more or less reciprocally to a corresponding contravariant vector. Expressions for lengths, areas and volumes of objects in the vector space can then be given in terms of tensors with covariant and contravariant indices. Under simple expansions and contractions of the coordinates, the reciprocity is exact; under affine transformations the components of a vector intermingle on going between covariant and contravariant expression.

On a manifold, a tensor field will typically have multiple, upper and lower indices, where Einstein notation is widely used. When the manifold is equipped with a metric, covariant and contravariant indices become very closely related to one another. Contravariant indices can be turned into covariant indices by contracting with the metric tensor. The reverse is possible by contracting with the (matrix) inverse of the metric tensor. Note that in general, no such relation exists in spaces not endowed with a metric tensor. Furthermore, from a more abstract standpoint, a tensor is simply &quot;there&quot; and its components of either kind are only calculational artifacts whose values depend on the chosen coordinates.

The explanation in geometric terms is that a general tensor will have contravariant indices as well as covariant indices, because it has parts that live in the tangent bundle as well as the cotangent bundle.

A contravariant vector is one which transforms like formula_86, where formula_87 are the coordinates of a particle at its proper time formula_88. A covariant vector is one which transforms like formula_89, where formula_90 is a scalar field.

==Algebra and geometry==

In category theory, there are covariant functors and contravariant functors. The assignment of the dual space to a vector space is a standard example of a contravariant functor. Contravariant (resp. covariant) vectors are contravariant (resp. covariant) functors from a formula_91-torsor to the fundamental representation of formula_91. Similarly, tensors of higher degree are functors with values in other representations of formula_91. However, some constructions of multilinear algebra are of &quot;mixed&quot; variance, which prevents them from being functors.

In differential geometry, the components of a vector relative to a basis of the tangent bundle are covariant if they change with the same linear transformation as a change of basis. They are contravariant if they change by the inverse transformation. This is sometimes a source of confusion for two distinct but related reasons. The first is that vectors whose components are covariant (called covectors or 1-forms) actually pull back under smooth functions, meaning that the operation assigning the space of covectors to a smooth manifold is actually a &quot;contravariant&quot; functor. Likewise, vectors whose components are contravariant push forward under smooth mappings, so the operation assigning the space of (contravariant) vectors to a smooth manifold is a &quot;covariant&quot; functor. Secondly, in the classical approach to differential geometry, it is not bases of the tangent bundle that are the most primitive object, but rather changes in the coordinate system. Vectors with contravariant components transform in the same way as changes in the coordinates (because these actually change oppositely to the induced change of basis). Likewise, vectors with covariant components transform in the opposite way as changes in the coordinates.

<doc id="202893" wikidata="Q627644" url="?curid=202893" title="Bogon filtering">
<text>Bogon filtering is the practice of blocking packets known as bogons, which are ones sent to a computer network claiming to originate from invalid or bogus IP addresses, known as bogon addresses.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;bogon&quot; stems from hacker jargon, with the earliest appearance in the Jargon File in version 1.5.0 (dated 1983). It is defined as the quantum of &quot;bogosity&quot;, or the property of being bogus. A bogon packet is frequently bogus both in the conventional sense of being forged for illegitimate purposes, and in the hackish sense of being incorrect, absurd, and useless. An alternative etymology suggests that &#x27;bogon&#x27; derives from a portmanteau of &quot;bogus logon&quot;, or a logon from a place you know no one can actually logon.

==Types of bogon addresses==
Areas of unallocated address space are called the bogon space. These are that are not in any range allocated the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or a regional Internet registry (RIR) for public internet use.

Bogon IPs also include some address ranges from allocated space. For example, addresses reserved for private networks, such as those in , , and , loopback interfaces like and , and link-local addresses like and can be bogon addresses. Addresses for Carrier-grade NAT, Teredo, and 6to4 and documentation prefixes also fall into this category. IP packets using these as source addresses are sometimes known as Martian packets.

==Blocking and filtering==
Many ISPs and end-user firewalls filter and block bogons, because they have no legitimate use, and usually are the result of accidental misconfiguration or malicious intent. Bogons can be filtered by using router access-control lists (ACLs), or by BGP blackholing.

==Former bogon addresses==
IP addresses in the bogon space may cease to be bogons because IANA frequently assigns new address. Announcements of new assignments are often published on network operators&#x27; mailing lists (such as NANOG) to ensure that bogon filtering can be removed for addresses that have become legitimate. For example, addresses in were not allocated prior to August 2010, but are now used by APNIC. 

, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommends that, since there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 s, IPv4 bogon filters based on registration status should be removed.
However, bogon filters still need to check for Martian packets.

<doc id="202894" wikidata="Q270990" url="?curid=202894" title="General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark">
<text>The General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark is a retired supersonic, medium-range, multirole combat aircraft. Production models of the F-111 had roles that included attack (e.g. interdiction), strategic bombing (including nuclear weapons capabilities), reconnaissance and electronic warfare. &quot;Aardvark&quot; comes from a South African animal that has a long nose and hugs the terrain. It is an Afrikaans word that translates literally as &quot;earth pig&quot;—hence the aircraft&#x27;s &quot;Pig&quot; nickname during its Australian service. 

Developed in the 1960s by General Dynamics under Robert McNamara&#x27;s TFX Program, the F-111 pioneered variable-sweep wings, afterburning turbofan engines, and automated terrain-following radar for low-level, high-speed flight. Its design influenced later variable-sweep wing aircraft, and some of its advanced features have become commonplace. The F-111 suffered problems during initial development, largely related to the engines. A fighter variant intended for the United States Navy, the F-111B, was canceled before production; it was intended for aircraft carrier-based roles, including long-range interception. Several specialized models, such as the FB-111A strategic bomber and the EF-111A electronic warfare aircraft, were also developed.

The F-111 entered service in 1967 with the United States Air Force (USAF). The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) also ordered the F-111 and began operating the F-111C in 1973. As early as March 1968, the USAF were deploying F-111s into active combat situations; the type saw heavy use during the latter half of the Vietnam War to conduct low-level ground-attack missions, flying in excess of 4,000 combat missions while incurring only six combat losses in the theatre. The F-111s also participated in the Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) in 1991; the F-111Fs completed 3.2 successful strike missions for every unsuccessful one, better than any other U.S. strike aircraft used in the operation. RAAF F-111s never saw offensive action, but were deployed periodically as a deterrent, such as for the Australian-led International Force East Timor.

Being relatively expensive to maintain amid post-Cold War budget cuts, the USAF elected to retire its F-111 fleet during the 1990s; the last F-111Fs were withdrawn in 1996 while the remaining EF-111s also departed in 1998. The F-111 was replaced in USAF service by the Strike Eagle for medium-range precision strike missions, while the supersonic bomber role has been assumed by the B-1B Lancer. The RAAF continued to operate the type up until December 2010, when the last F-111C was retired; its role was transitioned to the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as an interim measure until the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II became available.

==Development==

===Early requirements===
The May 1960 U-2 incident, in which an American CIA U-2 reconnaissance plane was shot down over the USSR, stunned the United States government. Besides greatly damaging US–Soviet relations, the incident showed that the Soviet Union had developed a surface-to-air missile that could reach aircraft above 60,000 feet (18,000 meters). Consequently, the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s plans to send subsonic, high-altitude Boeing B-47 Stratojet and V bomber formations into the USSR were realized to be much less viable.

By 1960, SAC had begun moving to low-level penetration, which greatly reduced radar detection distances. At the time, SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft while interceptor aircraft had less of a speed advantage at low altitudes. The USAF&#x27;s Tactical Air Command (TAC) was largely concerned with the fighter-bomber and deep strike/interdiction roles. TAC was in the process of receiving its latest design, the Republic Thunderchief, which was designed to deliver nuclear weapons fast and far, but required long runways. A simpler variable geometry wing configuration with the pivot points farther out from the aircraft&#x27;s centerline was reported by NASA in 1958, which made swing-wings viable. This led USAF leaders to encourage its use.

In June 1960, the USAF issued specification &quot;SOR 183&quot; for a long-range interdiction/strike aircraft able to penetrate Soviet air defenses at very low altitudes and high speeds. Specifically, it was to be capable of at least 800 miles of low-level flight, 400 of which was to be at a speed of no less than Mach 1.2. Furthermore, the specification also called for the aircraft to possess short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities to permit operations from short, unprepared airstrips that had a length of no more than 3,000 feet. An internal payload of 1,000lb was to be carried in the primary mission role. A variant suitable for aerial reconnaissance flights was also included in the specification.

In the 1950s, the United States Navy sought a long-range, high-endurance interceptor aircraft to protect its carrier battle groups against long-range anti-ship missiles launched from Soviet jet bombers and submarines. The Navy needed a fleet air defense (FAD) fighter with a more powerful radar, and longer range missiles than the F-4 Phantom II to intercept both enemy bombers and missiles. Seeking a FAD fighter, the Navy started with the subsonic, straight-winged aircraft, the Douglas F6D Missileer in the late 1950s. The Missileer was designed to carry six long-range missiles and loiter for five hours, but would be defenseless after firing its missiles. The program was formally canceled in 1961. The Navy had tried variable geometry wings with the XF10F Jaguar, but abandoned it in the early 1950s. It was NASA&#x27;s simplification which made the variable geometry wings practical. By 1960, increases in aircraft weights required improved high-lift devices, such as variable geometry wings. Variable geometry offered high speeds, and maneuverability with heavier payloads, long range, and the ability to take off and land in shorter distances.

===Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX)===
The USAF and Navy were both seeking new aircraft when Robert McNamara was appointed secretary of defense in January 1961. The aircraft sought by the two armed services shared the need to carry heavy armament and fuel loads, feature high supersonic speed, twin engines and two seats, and probably use variable geometry wings. On 14 February 1961, McNamara formally directed the services to study the development of a single aircraft that would satisfy both requirements. Early studies indicated that the best option was to base the design on the USAF requirement, and use a modified version for the Navy. In June 1961, Secretary McNamara ordered the go ahead of Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX), despite USAF and Navy efforts to keep their programs separate. According to aviation author Peter E. Davis, military officials were disconcerted by McNamara&#x27;s focus on compromised requirements for financial reasons.
The two services could agree only on swing-wing, two-seat, twin-engine design features. The USAF wanted a tandem-seat aircraft for low-level penetration ground-attack, while the Navy wanted a shorter, high altitude interceptor with side-by-side seating to allow the pilot and radar operator to share the radar display. Also, the USAF wanted the aircraft designed for 7.33 g with Mach 2.5 speed at altitude and Mach 1.2 speed at low level with an approximate length of . The Navy had less strenuous requirements of 6 g with Mach 2 speed at altitude and high subsonic speed (approx. Mach 0.9) at low level with a length of . The Navy also wanted the aircraft with a nose large enough for a diameter radar dish.

McNamara developed a basic set of requirements for TFX based largely on the USAF&#x27;s requirements and, on 1 September 1961, ordered the USAF to develop it. Nevertheless, a request for proposals (RFP) for the TFX was provided to industry in October 1961. In December, proposals were received from Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic. The evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to submit enhanced designs. Boeing&#x27;s proposal was recommended by the selection board in January 1962, with the exception of the engine, which was not considered acceptable. Switching to a crew escape capsule, instead of ejection seats and alterations to radar and missile storage were also needed. Both companies provided updated proposals in April 1962. USAF reviewers favored Boeing&#x27;s offering, while the Navy found both submissions unacceptable for its operations. Two more rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted, with Boeing being picked by the selection board.

In November 1962, McNamara selected General Dynamics&#x27; proposal due to its greater commonality between USAF and Navy versions. The Boeing aircraft shared less than half of the major structural components. On 21 December 1962, General Dynamics signed the TFX contract. A congressional investigation into the procurement processed was conducted, but did not change the selection. On 1 May 1964, the definitized contract was issued for the program, including flight testing, spares, ground equipment, training devices, static and fatigue test data, and the production of an initial 23 F-111 aircraft; it was structured as a fixed price incentive fee (FPIF) contract with a ceiling price of $529 million along with provisions for deficiency correction amongst other operational clauses and performance criteria.

===Design phase===
General Dynamics&#x27; design team was led by Robert H. Widmer. Recognizing its lack of experience with carrier-based fighters, General Dynamics teamed with Grumman in November 1963 for the assembly and testing of the F-111B. In addition, Grumman would also build the aft fuselage and the landing gear of the F-111A. The General Dynamics and Grumman team faced ambitious requirements for range, weapons load, and aircraft weight. Thus, the F-111 was designed to incorporate numerous features that were new to production military aircraft, such as variable-geometry wings and afterburning turbofan engines. This use of unfamiliar features has been attributed as a major cause of the aircraft&#x27;s protracted development and weight increases.

The F-111A and F-111B shared the same airframe structural components and Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured side-by-side crew seating in an escape capsule as required by the Navy. The F-111B&#x27;s nose was shorter as the aircraft could fit on existing carrier elevator decks, and had wingtips to improve on-station endurance time; it also carried an AN/AWG-9 Pulse-Doppler radar to guide its AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. The USAF&#x27;s F-111A would be equipped with the AN/APQ-113 attack radar and the AN/APQ-110 terrain-following radar and air-to-ground armament.

During September 1963, the F-111A mockup was inspected. On 15 October 1964, the first test F-111A was rolled out of Plant 4 of General Dynamics&#x27; facility in Fort Worth, Texas; it was powered by YTF30-P-1 turbofans and used a set of ejector seats as the escape capsule was not yet available. On 21 December 1964, the F-111A made its first flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. Lasting for 22 minutes, less than planned due to a flap malfunction, this initial flight was considered to be satisfactory overall; category I testing commenced immediately thereafter. Early flights of the F-111, which included supersonic flights, demonstrated favorably simplistic maintenance requirements, amongst other qualities.

Various changes to the program were enacted throughout 1965; this was chiefly in response to a steep climb in unit costs from $4.5 million to $6 million. The cause of the cost rises has been attributed, at least partially, to a directive issued to General Dynamics to incorporate improved avionics as well as to work on strategic bomber and aerial reconnaissance variants of the aircraft, the latter of which was eventually cancelled. During April 1965, General Dynamics was authorized to produce 431 F-111s, less than half the number of aircraft which had originally been forecast. On 10 May 1967, a new multi-year FPIP contract replaced the prior procurement process, increasing the total aircraft on order to 493 F-111s of multiple models, including 23 F-111Bs intended for the US Navy, 24 F-111Cs for the Royal Australian Air Force, and 50 F-111Ks intended for the Royal Air Force.

Early flights of the F-111 were troubled by compressor surges and stalls across certain portions of the flight regime. General Dynamics had elected to use an uncommon spike-shaped variable intake for the engine for the performance. Studies performed by NASA, the USAF, and General Dynamics led to the engine inlet being redesigned; modifications were implemented between 1965 and 1966, culminating with the &quot;Triple Plow I&quot; and &quot;Triple Plow II&quot; designs. During February 1965, the F-111A achieved a speed of Mach 1.3 while flying with an interim intake design. On 18 May 1965, the F-111B made its first flight; it was also equipped with ejector seats initially.

Separately, cracks in the F-111&#x27;s wing attach points were first discovered in 1968 during ground fatigue testing; during the following year, the crash of an F-111 was attributed to a cracked wingbox. On 22 December 1969, the USAF opted to ground the fleet due to this issue, save for those involved in flight testing. The resolution involved the redesigning of the attach structure and necessitated testing to ensure adequate design and workmanship. On 31 July 1970, the grounding was lifted. Category I flight testing of the F-111A, which had started in 1964, continued through to 31 March 1972. Category II tests started in January 1966, while Category III testing was repeatedly postponed before being cancelled, having been deemed to be unnecessary.

During 1968, the F-111B was canceled by the Navy on account of weight and performance issues together with revised tactical requirements. Australia would procure its own model, the F-111C. Subsequently, the improved F-111E, F-111D, and F-111F models were developed for the USAF. The strategic bomber FB-111A and the EF-111 electronic warfare versions were later developed for the USAF. Production of the F-111 ended in 1976, following the completion of 563 aircraft.

==Design==

===Overview===
The F-111 was an all-weather attack aircraft, capable of low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit was part of an escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin. The horizontal stabilizer was an all-moving stabilator.

The F-111 used a three-point landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel main landing gear units. The landing gear door for the main gear, which was positioned in the center of the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111&#x27;s variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.

===Armament===

==== Weapons bay ====
The F-111 featured an internal weapons bay that could carry bombs, a removable 20 mm M61 cannon or auxiliary fuel tanks. For bombs, the bay could hold two 750 lb (340 kg) M117 conventional bombs, one nuclear bomb or practice bombs. The F-111B for the US Navy was to carry two AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles in the bay. The cannon had a large 2,084-round ammunition tank, and its muzzle was covered by a fairing; however, it was rarely fitted on F-111s.

The F-111C and F-111F were equipped to carry the AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack targeting system on a rotating carriage that kept the pod protected within the weapons bay when not in use. Pave Tack featured a forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, optical camera and laser rangefinder/designator. The Pave Tack pod allowed the F-111 to designate targets and drop laser-guided bombs on them. Australian RF-111Cs carried a pallet of sensors and cameras for aerial reconnaissance use.

The FB-111 could carry two AGM-69 SRAM air-to-surface nuclear missiles in its weapons bay. General Dynamics trialed an arrangement with two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles carried on rails in a trapeze arrangement from the bay, but this was not adopted. Early F-111 models had radars equipped to guide the AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missile, but it was never fitted.

==== External ordnance ====
Each wing was equipped with four underwing pylons. The inner two pylons on each wing rotated to align with the fuselage, while the outer two were fixed. Each pylon had a capacity of . Various bombs and missiles could be carried on the pylons. Auxiliary fuel drop tanks with capacity each could be fitted.

The design of the F-111&#x27;s fuselage prevented the carriage of external weapons under the fuselage, but two stations were available on the underside for electronic countermeasures (ECM) pods and/or datalink pods; one station was on the weapons bay, and the other on the rear fuselage between the engines. The F-111&#x27;s maximum practical weapons load was limited, since the fixed pylons could not be used with the wings fully swept.

Tactical F-111s were fitted with shoulder rails on the four inner swiveling pylons to mount AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for self-defense. Australian F-111Cs were equipped to launch the Harpoon anti-ship missile, and the Popeye stand-off missile. FB-111As could carry the same conventional ordnance as the tactical variants, but their wing pylons were more commonly used for either fuel tanks or strategic nuclear gravity bombs. They could carry up to four AGM-69 SRAM nuclear missiles on the pylons.

===Historical significance===
The F-111 was the first production variable-geometry wing aircraft. Several other types have followed with similar swing-wing configuration, including the Soviet Sukhoi Su-17 &quot;Fitter&quot; (1965), Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 &quot;Flogger&quot; (1967), Tupolev Tu-22M &quot;Backfire&quot; (1969), Sukhoi Su-24 &quot;Fencer&quot; (1970) and Tupolev Tu-160 &quot;Blackjack&quot; (1981); the U.S. Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber (1974); and the European Panavia Tornado (1974). The Sukhoi Su-24 was very similar to the F-111. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s role intended for the F-111B was instead filled by another variable-geometry design, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force===
The first of six initial production F-111s was delivered on 17 July 1967 to fighter squadrons at Nellis Air Force Base. These aircraft were used for crew training. 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron achieved initial operational capability on 28 April 1968.

After early testing, a detachment of six aircraft from the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing (474th TFW Roadrunners) were sent in March 1968 to Southeast Asia for Combat Lancer testing in real combat conditions in the Vietnam War. During the deployment, 55 night missions were flown against targets in North Vietnam, but two aircraft had been lost. 66–0022 was lost on 28 March, and 66-0017 on 30 March. Replacement aircraft left Nellis, but the loss of a third F-111A (66-0024) on 22 April halted F-111A combat operations. The squadron returned to the United States in November. The cause of the first two losses is unknown as the wreckages were never recovered. It turned out that the third loss was traced to a failure of a hydraulic control-valve rod for the horizontal stabilizer which caused the aircraft to pitch up uncontrollably. Further inspection of the remaining fleet of F-111As revealed 42 aircraft with the same potential failures. It is speculated that this failure could also have contributed to the two earlier losses had the failure caused a pitch down while at low altitude. It was not until 1971 that 474 TFW was fully operational.

The word &quot;aardvark&quot; is Afrikaans for &quot;earthpig&quot; and reflects the look of the long nose of the aircraft that might remind one of the nose of the aardvark. The origin of the name has been attributed to F-111A Instructor Pilot Al Mateczun in 1969, as the aircraft had not received an official USAF name.

During September 1972, the F-111 returned to Southeast Asia, stationed at Takhli Air Base, Thailand. F-111As from Nellis AFB participated in the final month of Operation Linebacker and later flew 154 low-level missions in the Operation Linebacker II aerial offensive against the North Vietnamese, who called the aircraft &quot;Whispering Death&quot;. They also supported regional aerial operations against other communist forces such as Operation Phou Phiang III during the Laotian Civil War in Laos. Crews described their flying in Vietnam as &quot;speed is life&quot;, &quot;one pass, haul ass&quot;, and &quot;you do more than one pass in a target area you die&quot;. The F-111&#x27;s ability with terrain-following radar (&quot;the best in the fighter world&quot;, according to F-111 pilot Richard Crandall) to fly as low as above ground level at or faster in most weather conditions made it very effective; missions did not require tankers or ECM support, and they could operate in weather that grounded most other aircraft. One F-111 could carry the bomb load of four McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs. The worth of the new aircraft was beginning to show; F-111s flew more than 4,000 combat missions in Vietnam with only six combat losses.

From 30 July 1973, F-111As of the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing (347th TFW) were stationed at Takhli Air Base. The 347th TFW conducted bombing missions in Cambodia in support of Khmer Republic forces until 15 August 1973 when US combat support ceased in accordance with the Case–Church Amendment. The 347th TFW was stationed at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base from 12 July 1974 until 30 June 1975. In May 1975, 347th TFW F-111s provided air support during the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; incident.

One of the most unusual missions occurred on 14 February 1986, when two FB-111s of the 509th Bombardment Wing were dispatched from then Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire to Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma to pick up a heart for transplant. The aircraft landed at Bradley International Airport to deliver the organ to a waiting ambulance.
On 14 April 1986, 18 F-111s and approximately 25 Navy aircraft conducted air strikes against Libya under Operation El Dorado Canyon. The 18 F-111s of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing and 4 EF-111As from the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing flew what turned out to be the longest fighter combat mission in history. The round-trip flight between RAF Lakenheath/RAF Upper Heyford, United Kingdom and Libya of spanned 13 hours. One F-111 was lost over Libya and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, probably shot down.

F-111s participated in the Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) in 1991. During Desert Storm, F-111Fs completed 3.2 successful strike missions for every unsuccessful one, better than any other U.S. strike aircraft used in the operation. The group of 66 F-111Fs dropped almost 80% of the war&#x27;s laser-guided bombs, including the penetrating bunker-buster GBU-28. Eighteen F-111Es were also deployed during the operation. The US Air Force credited F-111s with destroying more than 1,500 Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles. Their use in the anti-armor role was dubbed &quot;tank plinking&quot;.

Expensive to operate—Crandall said that the aircraft &quot;was nine percent of Tactical Air Command&#x27;s fleet but ate up a whopping 25 percent of the maintenance budget&quot;—the F-111 was in service with the USAF from 1967 through 1998. The FB-111s were operated by Strategic Air Command from 1969 before conversion to F-111G and transferred to Air Combat Command (ACC) until their retirement in 1993. At a ceremony marking the F-111&#x27;s USAF retirement, on 27 July 1996, it was officially named Aardvark, its long-standing unofficial name. The USAF retired the EF-111 electronic warfare variant in 1998.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
The Australian government ordered 24 F-111C aircraft to replace the RAAF&#x27;s English Electric Canberras in the bombing and tactical strike role. While the first aircraft was officially handed over in September 1968, structural issues delayed the entry into service. The first F-111C was accepted at Nellis Air Force Base on 15 March 1973. The RAAF&#x27;s first six F-111Cs arrived at RAAF Base Amberley on 1 July 1973, and three subsequent flights of six F-111s arrived on 27 July, 28 September and 4 December. F-111Cs were allocated to No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron, under the control of No. 82 Wing. In Australia, the F-111 was affectionately known as the &quot;Pig&quot;.

The purchase proved to be highly successful for the RAAF. Although it never saw combat, the F-111C was the fastest, longest range combat aircraft in Southeast Asia, providing Australia with independent strike capability. Benny Murdani told Kim Beazley that when others became upset with Australia during Indonesian cabinet meetings, Murdani told them &quot;Do you realise the Australians have a bomber that can put a bomb through that window on to the table here in front of us?&quot;

Australian F-111s were ready to attack Indonesian forces during the establishment of East Timor&#x27;s independence and the deployment of the Australian-led International Force for East Timor. In 2006, an RAAF F-111 scuttled the North Korean ship &quot;Pong Su&quot; on 23 March 2006.

Because of the high maintenance time required for every flight hour, the F-111&#x27;s retirement began with the F-111G models operated by No. 6 Squadron in late 2007. Twenty-four Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets were procured as an interim replacement as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II program was delayed. The last F-111s were retired on 3 December 2010.

==Variants==

===F-111A===
The F-111A was the initial production version of the F-111. Early A-models used the TF30-P-1 engine. Most A-models used the TF30-P-3 engine with 12,000 lbf (53 kN) dry and 18,500 lbf (82 kN) afterburning thrust and &quot;Triple Plow I&quot; variable intakes, providing a maximum speed of Mach 2.3 (1,450 mph, 2,300 km/h) at altitude. The variant had a maximum takeoff weight of and an empty weight of .

The F-111A&#x27;s Mark I avionics suite included the General Electric AN/APQ-113 attack radar mated to a separate Texas Instruments AN/APQ-110 terrain-following radar lower in the nose and a Litton AJQ-20 inertial navigation and nav/attack system. The terrain-following radar (TFR) was integrated into the automatic flight control system, allowing for &quot;hands-off&quot; flight at high speeds and low levels (down to ).

A total of 159 F-111As were produced, including 30 pre-production aircraft that were rebuilt to production standards. 42 F-111As were converted to EF-111A Ravens for an electronic warfare tactical electronic jamming role. In 1982, four surviving F-111As were provided to Australia as attrition replacements and modified to F-111C standard, including its longer-span wings and reinforced landing gear. Three pre-production F-111A were used by NASA for various tests. The 13th F-111A received new wing designs for the Transonic Aircraft Technology and Advanced Fighter Technology Integration programs in the 1970s and 1980s. It retired to the United States Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1989. Unconverted F-111As were mothballed at Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in June 1991.

===F-111B===

The F-111B was to be a fleet air defense (FAD) fighter for the U.S. Navy, fulfilling a requirement for a carrier-based fighter aircraft armed with heavy, long-range missiles to defend aircraft carriers and their battle groups from Soviet bombers and fighter-bombers equipped with anti-ship missiles. General Dynamics, lacking experience with carrier-based aircraft, partnered with Grumman for this version. Seven F-111Bs were completed for testing but it never entered fleet service. It had a troubled development and Navy requirements changed to a maneuverable aircraft for dogfighting. The swing-wing configuration, TF-30 engines, AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles and AWG-9 radar developed for the F-111B were used on its replacement, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The Tomcat was large enough to carry the AWG-9 and Phoenix missiles while exceeding both the F-111&#x27;s and the F-4&#x27;s maneuverability.

===F-111C===

The F-111C is the export version for Australia, combining the F-111A with longer F-111B wings and strengthened FB-111A landing gear. Australia ordered 24 F-111s and, following delays, the Royal Australian Air Force accepted the aircraft in 1973. Four were converted to the RF-111C reconnaissance variant in 1979–80. Australia also purchased four ex-USAF F-111As and converted them into F-111Cs.&lt;ref name=&quot;support F/RF-111C&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the F-111C underwent a comprehensive digital avionics upgrade program (AUP) which introduced new nav/attack systems (PAVE TACK Laser/infrared targeting system) and digital flight control computers. Later, the C model was upgraded with a unique version of the TF-30 engine known as the P-108. This local version mated the P-109 engine to a P-107 afterburner, delivering 20,840 lb of thrust and significantly increased reliability. The RAAF retired its last F-111Cs in December 2010 after 37 years of service.

===F-111D===
The F-111D was an upgraded F-111A equipped with newer Mark II avionics, more powerful engines, improved intake geometry, and an early glass cockpit. It was first ordered in 1967 and delivered from 1970–73 after delays due to avionics issues. The F-111D reached initial operational capability in 1972; the sole operator was the 27th TFW stationed at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. 96 were built.

The F-111D used the new Triple Plow II intakes, which were located four inches (100 mm) further away from the airframe to prevent engine ingestion of the sluggish boundary layer air that was known to cause stalls in the TF30 turbofans. It had more powerful TF30-P-9 engines with 12,000 lbf (53 kN) dry and 18,500 lbf (82 kN) afterburning thrust.

The Mark II avionics used digitally integrated microprocessors, some of the first used by the USAF, offering new capability but substantial problems. The Rockwell Autonetics digital bombing-navigation system included an inertial navigation system, AN/APQ-130 attack radar system, Doppler radar, digital computer set, and multi-function displays (MFDs). The terrain-following radar was the Sperry AN/APQ-128. The attack radar featured a Doppler beam-sharpening, moving target indication (MTI), and Continuous-wave radar for guiding semi-active radar homing missiles. Avionics reliability improved but some issues were never fully resolved; according to Crandall, &quot;The truth is that the D model didn&#x27;t work. They parked every single one of them in Fort Worth for several years as they worked to fix the bugs&quot;. The F-111D was withdrawn from service in 1991 and 1992.

===F-111E===
A simplified, interim variant ordered after the F-111D was delayed, the F-111E used the Triple Plow II intakes, but retained the F-111A&#x27;s TF30-P-3 engines and Mark I avionics. The weapon stores management system was improved and other small changes made. Crandall described the F-111E as &quot;all analog, just like the A model, but It worked&quot;.

The F-111E was first ordered in 1968. Its first flight occurred on 20 August 1969 and achieved initial operational capability late that year. 94 F-111Es were delivered between 1969 and 1971. Many F-111Es were assigned to the 20th TFW at Upper Heyford, UK until 1991. It saw action during the Gulf War. Some F-111Es received an Avionics Modernization Program and improved TF30-P-109 engines in the early 1990s. All were retired to AMARC by 1995.

===F-111F===
The F-111F was the final variant produced for Tactical Air Command, with a modern, but less expensive, Mark IIB avionics system, more powerful TF30-P-100 engine, and strengthened wing carry-through box. Crandall described it as &quot;the Cadillac of the F-111 force&quot;. The USAF approved its development in 1969. 106 F-111Fs were produced between 1970 and 1976.

The F-111F could reach Mach 1.2 at sea level on full afterburner. It had the Triple Plow II intakes along with the substantially more powerful TF30-P-100 turbofan with 25,100 lbf (112 kN) afterburning thrust, 35% more thrust than the F-111A and E. An adjustable engine nozzle was added to decrease drag. The P-100 engine greatly improved performance. The engines were upgraded to the TF30-P-109 version between 1985 and 1986.

The F-111F&#x27;s Mark IIB avionics suite used a simplified version of the FB-111A&#x27;s AN/APQ-144 radar, which lacked some operating modes but added a new 2.5 mi (4.0 km) display ring. Although tested with digital moving-target indicator (MTI) capacity, it was not used in production sets. The Mark IIB avionics combined some Mark II components with FB-111A components, such as the AN/APQ-146 terrain-following radar. The F-111E&#x27;s weapon management system was also included. In the early 1980s, the F-111F began to be equipped with the AVQ-26 Pave Tack forward looking infrared (FLIR) and laser designator system, which enabled the use of precision laser-guided munitions and was mounted in the internal weapons bay. The Pacer Strike avionics update program replaced analog equipment with new digital equipment and multi-function displays. The last USAF F-111s were withdrawn from service in 1996, replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle.

===F-111K===
The British government canceled the BAC TSR-2 strike aircraft in 1965, citing the lower costs for the TFX and ordered 50 F-111K aircraft in February 1967 for the Royal Air Force. The F-111K was to be supplemented later by the Anglo-French Variable Geometry Aircraft then under development. The F-111K was based on the F-111A with longer F-111B wings, FB-111 landing gear, Mark II navigation/fire control system, and British supplied mission systems. Other changes included weapons bay modifications, addition of a centerline pylon, a retractable refueling probe, provisions for a reconnaissance pallet, and a higher gross weight with the use of FB-111A landing gear.

In January 1968, the United Kingdom terminated its F-111K order, citing higher cost; increased costs along with devaluation of the pound had raised the cost to around £3 million each. The first two F-111Ks (one strike/recon F-111K and one trainer/strike TF-111K) were in the final stages of assembly when the order was canceled. All of the components that had been assembled for the production of the main F-111K fleet that shared commonality were diverted to the FB-111A program, while the two aircraft under construction were re-designated as YF-111As with the intention that they be used as test aircraft in the F-111A program. Ultimately however, the two F-111Ks were never operated as test aircraft – in July 1968, almost exactly a year after the first airframe began construction, the USAF decided not to take them over, and General Dynamics were ordered to use them for component recovery.

===FB-111A / F-111G===
The FB-111A was a strategic bomber version of the F-111. The USAF&#x27;s Strategic Air Command needed an interim bomber due to the Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft program proceeding slowly and the B-52 fleet&#x27;s fatigue. The FB-111A was selected in 1965 and ordered in 1966 to replace the supersonic Convair B-58 Hustler and early B-52s. In 1968, plans called for 263 FB-111s, but the total was reduced to 76 aircraft in 1969. The first production aircraft flew in 1968. After the UK canceled its order for the F-111K in 1968, components for the 48 F-111Ks in production were reused on the FB-111A. Deliveries began in 1969 and ended in 1971.

The FB-111A had a redesigned aft fuselage, longer F-111B wings for greater range and load-carrying ability, and a maximum speed of Mach 2. Fuel capacity was increased by 585 gallons (2,214 L) and strengthened landing gear permitted a higher maximum takeoff weight of 119,250 lb (54,105 kg). All but the first FB-111A had the Triple Plow II intakes and the TF30-P-7 with 12,500 lbf (56 kN) dry and 20,350 lbf (90 kN) afterburning thrust.

The FB-111A was fitted with the SAC Mark IIB avionics suite. It had an attack radar improved from the F-111A&#x27;s radar, along with kit later used on the F-111D, such as the inertial navigation system, digital computers, and multi-function displays. The suite also had custom items to support the strategic mission, such as a star tracker navigation system mounted forward of the cockpit, a satellite communications receiver, and an automatic stores release system that replaced the manual arrangement on other F-111 models. Armament for the strategic bombing role was the Boeing AGM-69 SRAM (short-range attack missile); two could be carried in the internal weapons bay and four more on the inner underwing pylons; nuclear gravity bombs were also usable. Fuel tanks were often carried on the third non-swivelling pylon of each wing. The FB-111A had a total weapon load of .
Multiple advanced FB-111 strategic bomber proposals were made in the 1970s. The first, referred to as &quot;FB-111G&quot; by General Dynamics, was a larger aircraft with more powerful engines, greater payload and range. The next was a lengthened &quot;FB-111H&quot; fitted with more powerful General Electric F101 turbofan engines, a 12 ft 8.5 in longer fuselage and redesigned fixed intakes. The rear landing gear were moved outward so armament could be carried on the fuselage there. The FB-111H was offered as an alternative to the B-1A in 1975. The similar FB-111B/C was offered in 1979 without success.

The FB-111A became surplus to SAC&#x27;s needs after the B-1B Lancer entered service; they were subsequently reconfigured for tactical use and redesignated &quot;F-111G&quot;. The conversions began in 1989 and ended after 34 F-111Gs were produced. After SAC&#x27;s disestablishment, the FB-111As and F-111Gs were transferred to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC) and used primarily for training. The remaining FB-111As were retired in 1991 and the F-111Gs were retired in 1993. Australia bought 15 F-111Gs in 1993 to supplement its F-111Cs. They were retired in 2007.

===EF-111A Raven===
To replace the aging Douglas EB-66, the USAF contracted Grumman in 1972 to convert 42 existing F-111As into electronic warfare aircraft. The EF-111A can be distinguished from the F-111A by the equipment bulge atop their tails. In May 1998, the USAF withdrew the final EF-111As from service, placing them in storage at Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base.

<text>The atmosphere of Earth is composed of a layer of gas mixture that surrounds the Earth&#x27;s planetary surface (both lands and oceans), known collectively as air, with variable quantities of suspended aerosols and particulates (which create weather features such as clouds and hazes), all retained by Earth&#x27;s gravity. The atmosphere serves as a protective buffer between the Earth&#x27;s surface and outer space, shields the surface from most meteoroids and ultraviolet solar radiation, keeps it warm and reduces diurnal temperature variation (temperature extremes between day and night) through heat retention (greenhouse effect), redistributes heat and moisture among different regions via air currents, and provides the chemical and climate conditions allowing life to exist and evolve on Earth.

By mole fraction (i.e., by quantity of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other trace gases (see Composition below for more detail). Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. 

Earth&#x27;s early atmosphere consisted of accreted gases from the solar nebula, but the atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, impact events, weathering and the evolution of life (particularly the photoautotrophs). Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as climate change (mainly through deforestation and fossil fuel-related global warming), ozone depletion and acid deposition.

The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15 kg, three quarters of which is within about of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Kármán line, at or 1.57% of Earth&#x27;s radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around . Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere based on characteristics such as temperature and composition, namely the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere (formally the ionosphere) and exosphere. Air composition, temperature and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude. Air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and respiration of terrestrial animals is found within the troposphere.

The study of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics. Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann. The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.

==Composition==
The three major constituents of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by mole fraction in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by mole fraction in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor). The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are other greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Besides argon, other noble gases, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon are also present. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

The average molecular weight of dry air, which can be used to calculate densities or to convert between mole fraction and mass fraction, is about 28.946 or 28.964 g/mol. This is decreased when the air is humid.

The relative concentration of gases remains constant until about .

== Stratification ==
In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile, or lapse rate, is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. This &quot;atmospheric stratification&quot; divides the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere into five main layers:
* Exosphere: 
* Thermosphere: 
* Mesosphere: 
* Stratosphere: 
* Troposphere: 

===Exosphere===

The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (though it is so tenuous that some scientists consider it to be part of interplanetary space rather than part of the atmosphere). It extends from the thermopause (also known as the &quot;exobase&quot;) at the top of the thermosphere to a poorly defined boundary with the solar wind and interplanetary medium. The altitude of the exobase varies from about to about in times of higher incoming solar radiation.

The upper limit varies depending on the definition. Various authorities consider it to end at about or about —about halfway to the moon, where the influence of Earth&#x27;s gravity is about the same as radiation pressure from sunlight. The geocorona visible in the far ultraviolet (caused by neutral hydrogen) extends to at least .

This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometres without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind. Every second, the Earth loses about 3 kg of hydrogen, 50 g of helium, and much smaller amounts of other constituents.

The exosphere is too far above Earth for meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, Earth&#x27;s auroras—the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights)—sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains many of the artificial satellites that orbit Earth.

===Thermosphere===

The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about up to the thermopause at an altitude range of . The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from above Earth&#x27;s surface, contains the ionosphere.

The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height and can rise as high as , though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of between collisions with other molecules. Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between . It is this layer where many of the satellites orbiting the Earth are present.

===Mesosphere===
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about to the mesopause at above sea level.

Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around .

Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can condense into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds of ice particles. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or similarly before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.

===Stratosphere===
The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly above Earth&#x27;s surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about .

The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0 °C.

The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.

===Troposphere===
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It extends from Earth&#x27;s surface to an average height of about , although this altitude varies from about at the geographic poles to at the Equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone that is isothermal with height.

Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth&#x27;s surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, &quot;tropos&quot;, meaning &quot;turn&quot;). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The troposphere is denser than all its overlying layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower of the troposphere.

Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth&#x27;s weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer accessible by propeller-driven aircraft.

===Other layers===
Within the five principal layers above, which are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:
* The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about , though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for auroras. During daytime hours, it stretches from and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.
* The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the &quot;turbopause&quot; found at about , the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about above the mesopause.
:Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
* The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth&#x27;s surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about on clear, calm nights to or more during the afternoon in dry regions.

The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth&#x27;s surface is or , depending on the reference.

==Physical properties==
===Pressure and thickness===
The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as . This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is , about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea-level pressure and Earth&#x27;s area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth&#x27;s mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.

If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density equal to sea-level density (about 1.2 kg/m3) from sea level upwards, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of .

Air pressure actually decreases exponentially with altitude, for altitudes up to around , dropping by half every , or by a factor of 1/e ≈ 0.368 every , which is called the scale height. However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account. At heights over 100 km, an atmosphere may no longer be well mixed. Then each chemical species has its own scale height.

In summary, the mass of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:
* 50% is below ,
* 90% is below ,
* 99.99997% is below , the Kármán line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts.

By comparison, the summit of Mount Everest is at ; commercial airliners typically cruise between , where the lower density and temperature of the air improve fuel economy; weather balloons reach and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached .

Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100 km and extend beyond 500 km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350–400 km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere, where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months, otherwise orbital decay will occur, resulting in a return to Earth. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800 km.

===Temperature===

The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature stabilizes over a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by the capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90 km.

==== Speed of sound ====

Because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

===Density and mass===


The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m3 (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict the orbital decay of satellites.

The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, &quot;The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27 kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003 kg.&quot;

=== Tabulated properties ===
==Optical properties==

Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that humans cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

===Scattering===

When light passes through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, photons interact with it through &quot;scattering&quot;. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called &quot;direct radiation&quot; and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. &quot;Indirect radiation&quot; is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow, there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun&#x27;s rays pass through more atmosphere than normal before reaching your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

===Absorption===

Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all radiation with wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometres. Water (H2O) absorbs at many wavelengths above 700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave &quot;windows&quot; of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300 nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400–700 nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100 nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimetre to about eleven-metre waves.

===Emission===
&quot;Emission&quot; is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their &quot;black body&quot; emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately , its radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately , so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth&#x27;s surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are and H2O.

===Refractive index===


The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than, 1. Systematic variations in the refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers on board ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth&#x27;s surface.

The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.

==Circulation==

&quot;Atmospheric circulation&quot; is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth&#x27;s rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

==Evolution of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere==
===Earliest atmosphere===
The first atmosphere, during the Early Earth&#x27;s Hadean eon, consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen, and probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.
During this earliest era, the Moon-forming collision and numerous impacts with large meteorites heated the atmosphere, driving off the most volatile gases. The collision with Theia, in particular, melted and ejected large portions of Earth&#x27;s mantle and crust and outgassed significant amounts of steam which eventually cooled and condensed to contribute to ocean water at the end of the Hadean.

===Second atmosphere===

The increasing solidification of Earth&#x27;s crust at the end of the Hadean closed off most of the advective heat transfer to the surface, causing the atmosphere to cool, which condensed most of the water vapor out of the air precipitating into a superocean. Further outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases introduced by huge asteroids during the Late Heavy Bombardment, created the subsequent Archean atmosphere, which consisted largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide, methane and inert gases. A major part of carbon dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.

About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major component of the then-stable &quot;second atmosphere&quot;. The influence of the evolution of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of earliest life forms appeared as early as 3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the &quot;faint young Sun paradox&quot;.

The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth – with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Neoarchean, an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently due to a billion years of cyanobacterial photosynthesis (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.

Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2.15 and 2.08 billion years ago provide a record of Earth&#x27;s dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.

===Third atmosphere===
The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of banded iron formations (which signals the depletion of substrates that can react with oxygen to produce ferric deposits) during the early Proterozoic eon.

Before this time, any oxygen produced by cyanobacterial photosynthesis would be readily removed by the oxidation of reducing substances on the Earth&#x27;s surface, notably ferrous iron, sulfur and atmospheric methane. Free oxygen molecules did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reductant materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations during the Proterozoic, including a billion-year period of euxinia, until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian. The rise of the more robust eukaryotic photoautotrophs (green and red algae) injected further oxygenation into the air, especially after the end of the Cryogenian global glaciation, which was followed by an evolutionary radiation event during the Ediacaran period known as the Avalon explosion, where complex metazoan life forms (including the earliest cnidarians, placozoans and bilaterians) first proliferated. The following time span from 539 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, more actively moving metazoan life began to appear and rapidly diversify in another radiation event called the Cambrian explosion, whose locomotive metabolism was fuelled by the rising oxygen level.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, significantly higher than today&#x27;s 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: the evolution of plants and their increasing role in carbon fixation, and the consumption of oxygen by rapidly diversifying animal faunae and also by plants for photorespiration and their own metabolic needs at night. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which reacts and hence reduces oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which can fuel oxygenic photosynthesis by terrestrial and aquatic plants. The cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not precisely understood. Periods with more oxygen in the atmosphere were often associated with more rapid development of animals.

== Air pollution ==
 is the introduction of airborne chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms. The population growth, industrialization and motorization of human societies have significantly increased the amount of airborne pollutants in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, causing noticeable problems such as smogs, acid rains and pollution-related diseases. The depletion of stratospheric ozone layer, which shields the surface from harmful ionizing ultraviolet radiations, is also caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.

Since 1750, human activity, especially after the Industrial Revolution, has increased the concentrations of various greenhouse gases, most importantly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gas emissions, coupled with deforestation and destruction of wetlands via logging and land developments, have caused an observed rise in global temperatures, with the global average surface temperatures being higher in the 2011–2020 decade than they were in 1850. It has raised concerns of man-made climate change, which can have significant environmental impacts such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, glacial retreat (which threatens water security), increasing extreme weather events and wildfires, ecological collapse and mass dying of wildlife.

<text>An atmosphere () is a layer of gases that envelop an astronomical object, held in place by the gravity of the object. A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules.

The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and trace gases. Most organisms use oxygen for respiration; lightning and bacteria perform nitrogen fixation which produces ammonia that is used to make nucleotides and amino acids; plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The layered composition of the atmosphere minimises the harmful effects of sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, solar wind, and cosmic rays and thus protects the organisms from genetic damage. The current composition of the atmosphere of the Earth is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.

==Occurrence and compositions==
===Origins===
Atmospheres are clouds of gas bound to and engulfing an astronomical focal point of sufficiently dominating mass, adding to its mass, possibly escaping from it or collapsing into it.
Because of the latter, such planetary nucleus can develop from interstellar molecular clouds or protoplanetary disks into rocky astronomical objects with varyingly thick atmospheres, gas giants or fusors.

Composition and thickness is originally determined by the stellar nebula&#x27;s chemistry and temperature, but can also by a product processes within the astronomical body outgasing a different atmosphere.

===Compositions===

The atmospheres of the planets Venus and Mars are principally composed of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, argon and oxygen.

The composition of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is determined by the by-products of the life that it sustains. Dry air (mixture of gases) from Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and other &quot;noble&quot; gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.

The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System&#x27;s giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—allow them more readily to retain gases with low molecular masses. These planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.

Two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. Titan, a moon of Saturn, and Triton, a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of nitrogen. When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, Pluto has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton&#x27;s, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.

Other bodies within the Solar System have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the Moon (sodium gas), Mercury (sodium gas), Europa (oxygen), Io (sulfur), and Enceladus (water vapor).

The first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is HD 209458b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the constellation Pegasus. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000 K, and is steadily escaping into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet&#x27;s inflated atmosphere.

==Structure of atmosphere==

===Earth===

The atmosphere of Earth is composed of layers with different properties, such as specific gaseous composition, temperature, and pressure.

The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. This extends from the planetary surface to the bottom of the stratosphere. The troposphere contains 75–80% of the mass of the atmosphere, and is the atmospheric layer wherein the weather occurs; the height of the troposphere varies between 17 km at the equator and 7.0 km at the poles.

The stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the mesosphere, and contains the ozone layer, at an altitude between 15 km and 35 km. It is the atmospheric layer that absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation that Earth receives from the Sun.

The mesosphere ranges from 50 km to 85 km and is the layer wherein most meteors are incinerated before reaching the surface.

The thermosphere extends from an altitude of 85 km to the base of the exosphere at 690 km and contains the ionosphere, where solar radiation ionizes the atmosphere. The density of the ionosphere is greater at short distances from the planetary surface in the daytime and decreases as the ionosphere rises at night-time, thereby allowing a greater range of radio frequencies to travel greater distances.

The exosphere begins at 690 to 1,000 km from the surface, and extends to roughly 10,000 km, where it interacts with the magnetosphere of Earth.

==Pressure==

Atmospheric pressure is the force (per unit-area) perpendicular to a unit-area of planetary surface, as determined by the weight of the vertical column of atmospheric gases. In said atmospheric model, the atmospheric pressure, the weight of the mass of the gas, decreases at high altitude because of the diminishing mass of the gas above the point of barometric measurement. The units of air pressure are based upon the standard atmosphere (atm), which is 101,325 Pa (equivalent to 760 Torr or 14.696 psi). The height at which the atmospheric pressure declines by a factor of &quot;e&quot; (an irrational number equal to 2.71828) is called the scale height (&quot;H&quot;). For an atmosphere of uniform temperature, the scale height is proportional to the atmospheric temperature and is inversely proportional to the product of the mean molecular mass of dry air, and the local acceleration of gravity at the point of barometric measurement.

==Escape==

Surface gravity differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet Jupiter retains light gases such as hydrogen and helium that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules&#x27; thermal motion exceed the planet&#x27;s escape velocity, allowing those to escape a planet&#x27;s gravitational grasp. Thus, distant and cold Titan, Triton, and Pluto are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.

Since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal kinetic energy, and so gases of low molecular weight are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that Venus and Mars may have lost much of their water when, after being photodissociated into hydrogen and oxygen by solar ultraviolet radiation, the hydrogen escaped. Earth&#x27;s magnetic field helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen. The net effect, taking the most important escape processes into account, is that an intrinsic magnetic field does not protect a planet from atmospheric escape and that for some magnetizations the presence of a magnetic field works to increase the escape rate.

Other mechanisms that can cause atmosphere depletion are solar wind-induced sputtering, impact erosion, weathering, and sequestration—sometimes referred to as &quot;freezing out&quot;—into the regolith and polar caps.

== Terrain ==
Atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies. Objects that have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in craters. Without an atmosphere, the planet has no protection from meteoroids, and all of them collide with the surface as meteorites and create craters.

For planets with a significant atmosphere, most meteoroids burn up as meteors before hitting a planet&#x27;s surface. When meteoroids do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.

Wind erosion is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and volcanoes. In addition, since liquids cannot exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in lakes, rivers and oceans. Earth and Titan are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that Mars had liquid on its surface in the past.

==Circulation==

The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when convection becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than thermal radiation. On planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation, excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes. When a planet generates a significant amount of heat internally, such as is the case for Jupiter, convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface.

==Importance==
From the perspective of a planetary geologist, the atmosphere acts to shape a planetary surface. Wind picks up dust and other particles which, when they collide with the terrain, erode the relief and leave deposits (eolian processes). Frost and precipitations, which depend on the atmospheric composition, also influence the relief. Climate changes can influence a planet&#x27;s geological history. Conversely, studying the surface of the Earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of other planets.

For a meteorologist, the composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a factor affecting the climate and its variations.

For a biologist or paleontologist, the Earth&#x27;s atmospheric composition is closely dependent on the appearance of life and its evolution.

<text>is the Japanese term for a bow. As used in English, refers more specifically to traditional Japanese asymmetrical bows, and includes the longer and the shorter used in the practice of and , or Japanese archery.

The was an important weapon of the samurai warrior during the feudal period of Japan. It is typically shot with Japanese arrows known as .

The most famous style of is an asymmetrically shaped long bow with a length of more than , characterized by the archer holding the part of the bow below the center to shoot the arrow.

==History==
Most of the excavated Jōmon period () bows are in length, while most of the Yayoi period () bows are in length. The bows in these periods were made from a single processed wood, and the bows with this structure were called and were used until the Nara period (710–794 CE). It is unknown when the asymmetrical came into use, but the first written record is found in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, a Chinese historical manuscript dating to the 3rd century CE, which describes the people of the Japanese islands using &quot;spears, shields, and wooden bows for arms; the wooden bows are made with the lower limbs short and the upper limbs long; and bamboo arrows with points of either iron or bone.&quot; The oldest asymmetrical found to date was discovered in Nara Prefecture, and is estimated to be from the 5th century.

Some of the bows found as burial goods in (ancient tombs) during the Kofun period (300–538 CE) were decorated with gold or silver, and it is believed that they were also used in ceremonies. The length of most bows in this period ranged from , and it is thought that they were powerful enough to shoot enemies and animals at close range.

In the Nara period, lacquered bows with more weather resistance and decorative features appeared. &quot;Euonymus hamiltonianus&quot;, &quot;Zelkova serrata&quot;, and &quot;Toxicodendron succedaneum&quot;, which are highly elastic wood, came to be used for making , and many became as long as roughly 7 3 (), increasing their power and range. Since then, the structure of the bow has gradually evolved, but its length of roughly 7 3 has been passed down to the present day.

From the mid to late Heian period (794–1185), the Japanese developed the style of , the first in Japan with a laminated structure. This style of was made by attaching bamboo to a wooden with a flat front side using glue made from a fish float, and the elasticity of the bamboo improved the bow&#x27;s range, power and durability. Nasu no Yoichi was famous as a master of archery in the late Heian period; his fame was depicted in &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; and , and he was the subject of various Japanese traditional performing arts and fine arts such as Noh, , , kabuki, and ukiyo-e of later generations.

From the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the was developed, and bamboo was glued not only on the front side but also on the reverse side of the . In the late Kamakura period, the shape of the bow became more asymmetrical, with the upper part bent from the lower part, so that it resembled a modern bow, further increasing the range and power of the .

From the middle of the Heian period, the style of , in which rattan was wrapped around a laminated-structure to improve its elasticity and sturdiness, became popular. The style in particular was the strongest weapon of the Kamakura period, with a maximum range of and an effective range of that could inflict fatal wounds on targets. There are more than 20 varieties of , depending on how and where on the bow the rattan is wound. In the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the went from its luxurious exterior to a piece of equipment that symbolized the rank of commander.

During the Kamakura period, when the samurai class came to power, (archery) became more and more popular, especially the three types of mounted archery: , , and .

The was developed during the Muromachi period, and bamboo was used on the side of the bow to increase its range and power.

During the Sengoku period (1467–1615), the used in modern was developed, completing the original form of the Japanese bow now known around the world. The characteristic of the bow is that it has a greatly changed laminated structure from the conventional bow. The core of the structure is about four pieces of bonded bamboo, with bamboo glued to the front side and the other side and wood glued to the sides. This improved the range and power of the bow and enabled it to shoot through targets away in the Sanjusangen-do archery contest, , a famous event still held today. Research on (arrowheads) was actively conducted to enhance their killing ability, and of various shapes were developed. During this period, the was mass-produced by Japanese swordsmiths, and mobilized (foot soldiers) used them to exert tremendous power on the battlefield. However, because took a long time to load, were inconvenient in rainy weather when damp gunpowder would not fire, and were not exactly subtle in terms of noise, the did not go out of fashion and continued to be used as an important military force on the battlefield.

When Japanese society became more peaceful in the Edo period (1603–1867), the spirituality and decorativeness of the became important, and developed as a samurai&#x27;s way of doing things.

Even today, the is used in and ceremonies, and in Grand sumo tournaments, a ceremony called the , which is dedicated to Shinto , is held.

== Shape ==
The is exceptionally tall, standing over in height, and typically surpasses the height of the . They are traditionally made by laminating bamboo, wood and leather, using techniques which have not changed for centuries, although some archers (particularly beginners) may use a synthetic .

The is asymmetrical; according to the All Nippon Kyudo Federation, the grip () has to be positioned at about two thirds of the distance from the upper tip.

The upper and lower curves also differ. Several hypotheses have been offered for this asymmetric shape. Some believe it was designed for use on a horse, where the could be moved from one side of the horse to the other with ease; however, there is evidence that the asymmetrical shape predates its use on horseback.

Others claim that asymmetry was needed to enable shooting from a kneeling position. Yet another explanation is the characteristics of the wood from a time before laminating techniques. In case the bow is made from a single piece of wood, its modulus of elasticity is different between the part taken from the treetop side and the other side. A lower grip balances it.

The hand holding the may also experience less vibration due to the grip being on a vibration node of the bow. A perfectly uniform pole has nodes at 1/4 and 3/4 of the way from the ends, or 1/2 if held taut at the ends – these positions will change significantly with shape and consistency of the bow material.

== String ==
The string of a , a , is traditionally made of hemp, although most modern archers will use strings made of synthetic materials such as Kevlar, which will last longer.

The nocking-point on the string is built up through the application of hemp and glue to protect the string and to provide a thickness which helps hold the nock ( of the arrow, a , in place while drawing the . However, it can also be made of strands of waxed bamboo.

== Care and maintenance ==
A bamboo requires careful attention. Left unattended, the can warp out of shape and may eventually become unusable. The shape of a will change through normal use and can be re-formed when needed through manual application of pressure, through shaping blocks, or by leaving it strung or unstrung when not in use.

The shape of the curves of a is greatly affected by whether it is left strung or unstrung when not in use. The decision to leave a strung or unstrung depends upon the current shape of the . A that is relatively flat when unstrung will usually be left unstrung when not in use (a in this state is sometimes referred to as being &#x27;tired&#x27;). A that has excessive curvature when unstrung is typically left strung for a period of time to &#x27;tame&#x27; the .

A well cared-for can last many generations, while the usable life of a mistreated can be very short.

<text>Thomas Venner (died 19 January 1661) was a cooper and rebel who became the last leader of the Fifth Monarchy Men, who tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Oliver Cromwell in 1657, and subsequently led a coup in London against the newly restored government of Charles II. This event, known as &quot;Venner&#x27;s Rising&quot;, lasted four days beginning on January 6, 1661, before the royal authorities captured the rebels. The rebel leadership suffered execution on 19 January 1661.

==Biography==
Venner had moved to New England in 1637 and stayed for 22 years before returning to plot against Cromwell. He assumed leadership of the Fifth Monarchists after the execution of General Thomas Harrison at Charing Cross on 19 October 1660. Venner led a congregation, which included New Model Army veterans, that met in a rented room above a tavern in Swan&#x27;s Alley off Coleman Street.
On 6 January 1661 he led a number of his men – Samuel Pepys said they later turned out to be only 50, although it had been thought they were 500 at first – to a bookseller called Mr. Johnson at St. Paul&#x27;s to demand the Cathedral keys. On being refused they broke in and accosted passers-by asking who they were for. One answered &quot;King Charles&quot; and they shot him through the heart. Several musketeers sent to dislodge them were beaten back and a detachment from the London Trained Bands under the Lord Mayor, Major General Sir Richard Browne, attacked them and they retreated to Ken Wood near Highgate.

On January 9 they attacked again at Wood Street and Threadneedle Street forcing the King&#x27;s Life Guard of Foot (a force of 1200 men commanded by John Russell) to retreat. They then attempted to storm the Comptor Prison to liberate the inmates in order to join them but were repulsed by fierce fighting. Venner is said to have killed three men with a halberd in Threadneedle Street.

A force of General Monck&#x27;s men under Colonel Cox pursued them to their last stands in the Helmet Tavern on Threadneedle Street and the Blue Anchor on Coleman Street. Royalist troops broke through the clay roof tiles with musket butts and fired upon the wounded defenders, breaking in through the ceiling. Venner was captured after being wounded nineteen times. Others were shot out of hand.

He was put on trial at the Old Bailey and hanged, drawn and quartered on 19 January 1661. According to Tobias Smollett, Venner and his followers &quot;affirmed to the last that if they had been deceived, the Lord himself was their deceiver&quot;.

==Family==
Venner&#x27;s son, also Thomas (born 1641), a fellow-rebel, led the Monmouth cavalry in 1688.
His grand-daughter Elizabeth married a linen draper&#x27;s son, John Potter, later Bishop of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury.

<doc id="202928" wikidata="Q207520" url="?curid=202928" title="List of regions of Japan">
<text>Japan is often divided into regions, each containing one or more of the country&#x27;s 47 prefectures at large. Sometimes, they are referred to as &quot;blocs&quot; (ブロック, &quot;burokku&quot;), or &quot;regional blocs&quot; (地域ブロック, &quot;chiiki burokku&quot;) as opposed to more granular regional divisions. They are not official administrative units, though they have been used by government officials for statistical and other purposes since 1905. They are widely used in, for example, maps, geography textbooks, and weather reports, and many businesses and institutions use their home regions in their names as well, for example Kyushu National Museum, Kinki Nippon Railway, Chūgoku Bank, and Tōhoku University.

One common division, preferred by the English Wikipedia, groups the prefectures into eight regions. In that division, of the four main islands of Japan, Hokkaidō, Shikoku, and Kyūshū make up one region each, the latter also containing the Satsunan Islands, while the largest island Honshū is divided into five regions. Okinawa Prefecture is usually included in Kyūshū, but is sometimes treated as its own ninth region.

Japan has eight High Courts, but their jurisdictions do not correspond to the eight Wikipedia regions (see #Other regional divisions and Judicial system of Japan for details).

==Table==


== Regions and islands ==
This is a list of Japan&#x27;s major islands, traditional regions, and subregions, going from northeast to southwest. The eight traditional regions are marked in bold.

* Hokkaidō (the island and its archipelago)
* Honshū
** Tōhoku region (northern part)
** Kantō region (eastern part)
*** Nanpō Islands (part of Tokyo Metropolis)
** Chūbu region (central part)
*** Hokuriku region (northwestern Chūbu)
*** Kōshin&#x27;etsu region (northeastern Chūbu)
*** Tōkai region (southern Chūbu)
** Kansai (or Kinki) region (south-central part)
** Chūgoku region (western part)
*** San&#x27;in region (northern Chūgoku)
*** San&#x27;yō region (southern Chūgoku)
* Shikoku
* Kyūshū
** Northern Kyūshū
** Southern Kyūshū
** Ryukyu Islands
*** Satsunan Islands
*** Okinawa

== Other regional divisions ==
In many contexts in Japan (government, media markets, sports, regional business or trade union confederations), regions are used that deviate from the above-mentioned common geographical 8-region division that is sometimes referred to as &quot;the&quot; regions of Japan in the English Wikipedia and some other English-language publications. Examples of regional divisions of Japan as used by various institutions are:







== Regions as administrative units ==

In the later stages of World War II, in preparation for an Allied invation of the home islands, regions served as administrative units between the Home Ministry and the governments of prefectures from 1943. Initially, nine &quot;regional administrative joint conferences&quot; (地方行政協議会, &quot;chihō gyōsei kyō-kaigi&quot;) were set up, each comprising several prefectural governments under the leadership of one prefectural government. In 1945, they were consolidated into eight centralized &quot;regional governorates-general&quot; (地方総監府, &quot;chihō sōkan-fu&quot;) with authority of command over the subordinate prefectural governments. The regions corresponded territorially to the military districts (軍管区, &quot;gunkan-ku&quot;) as used by the Imperial Army in 1945. They were namely:

After capitulation, the governorates-general were immediately dissolved by GHQ/SCAP and the (in the Empire: very limited) local autonomy of prefectural governments and their elected assemblies restored to be eventually substantially expanded by the Constitution and the Local Autonomy Law in 1947.
