<text>William Collins (25 December 1721 – 12 June 1759) was an English poet. Second in influence only to Thomas Gray, he was an important poet of the middle decades of the 18th century. His lyrical odes mark a progression from the Augustan poetry of Alexander Pope&#x27;s generation and towards the imaginative ideal of the Romantic era.

==Biography==
Born in Chichester, Sussex, the son of a hatmaker and former mayor of the town, Collins was educated at The Prebendal School, Winchester and Magdalen College, Oxford. While still at the university, he published the &quot;Persian Eclogues&quot;, which he had begun at school. After graduating in 1743 he was undecided about his future. Failing to obtain a university fellowship, being judged by a military uncle as &#x27;too indolent even for the army&#x27;, and having rejected the idea of becoming a clergyman, he settled for a literary career and was supported in London by a small allowance from his cousin, George Payne. There he was befriended by James Thomson and Dr Johnson as well as the actors David Garrick and Samuel Foote.

Following the failure of his collection of odes in 1747, Collins&#x27; discouragement, aggravated by drunkenness, so unsettled his mind that he eventually sank into insanity and by 1754 was confined to McDonald&#x27;s Madhouse in Chelsea. From there he moved to the care of an elder sister in Chichester, who lived with her clergyman husband within the cathedral precincts. There Collins continued to stay, with periods of lucidity during which he was visited by the Warton brothers. On his death in 1759, he was buried in St Andrew-in-the-Oxmarket Church.

==Poems==
===Eclogues===
The pastoral eclogue had been a recognised genre in English poetry for the two centuries before Collins wrote his, but in the 18th century there was a disposition to renew its subject matter. Jonathan Swift, John Gay and Mary Wortley Montagu had all transposed rural preoccupations to life in London in a series of &quot;town eclogues&quot;; at the same period William Diaper had substituted marine divinities for shepherds in his &quot;Nereides: or Sea-Eclogues&quot; (1712). Collins&#x27; &quot;Persian Eclogues&quot; (1742) also fell within this movement of renewal. Though written in heroic couplets, their Oriental settings are explained by the pretence that they are translations. Their action takes place in &quot;a valley near Bagdat&quot; (1), at midday in the desert (2), and within sight of the Caucasus mountains in Georgia (3) and war-torn Circassia (4).

The poems were sufficiently successful for a revised version to be published in 1757, retitled as &quot;Oriental Eclogues&quot;. In the following decades they were frequently republished and on the Continent were twice translated into German in 1767 and 1770. They were also an influence on later eclogues that were given exotic locations. The three dating from 1770 by Thomas Chatterton had purely imaginary African settings and their versification was distinguished by &quot;crude imaginative force and incoherent, almost Ossianic, fervor&quot;. By contrast, the &quot;Oriental Eclogues&quot; of Scott of Amwell (1782) can stand &quot;favourable comparison&quot; with Collins&#x27; and their background details are supported by contemporary scholarship.

In addition, Scott&#x27;s introductory &quot;Advertisement&quot; justifies his poems as both a homage to and variation upon the work of Collins. The Oriental Eclogues of the elder poet, he says, &quot;have such excellence, that it may be supposed they must preclude the appearance of any subsequent Work with the same title. This consideration did not escape the Author of the following Poems; but, as the scenery and sentiment of his Predecessor were totally different from his own, he thought it matter of little consequence.&quot; Scott&#x27;s poems are set in Asian areas well beyond Persia&#x27;s former dominions: in Arabia in his first, Bengal in his second and Tang dynasty China in the time of Li Bai (Li Po) in his third.

===Odes===
Collins&#x27; &quot;Odes&quot; also fit within the context of a movement towards the renewal of the genre, although in this case it was largely formal and showed in his preference for pindarics and occasionally dispensing with rhyme. Here he was in the company of Thomas Gray, Mark Akenside, and his Winchester schoolfellow Joseph Warton. At first Collins intended his &quot;Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegorical Subjects&quot; (1747) to be jointly published with Warton&#x27;s &quot;Odes on Various Subjects&quot; (1746) until Warton&#x27;s publisher refused the proposal. Following their appearance, Gray commented in a letter that each poet &quot;is the half of a considerable Man, &amp; one the Counter-part of the other. [Warton] has but little Invention, very poetical choice of Expression, &amp; a very good Ear; [Collins] a fine Fancy, model&#x27;d upon the Antique, a bad Ear, a great variety of Words &amp; Images, with no Choice at all. They both deserve to last some years, but will not.&quot; Moreover, their new manner and stylistic excess lent themselves to burlesque parody, and one soon followed from a university miscellany in the shape of an &quot;Ode to Horror: In the Allegoric Descriptive, Alliterative, Epithetical, Fantastic, Hyperbolical, and Diabolical Style&quot;. Rumour had it even then that the culprit was Warton&#x27;s brother Thomas, and his name was coupled with it in later reprintings.

As Gray had forecast, little favourable notice was taken at the time of poems so at odds with the Augustan spirit of the age, characterised as they were by strong emotional descriptions and the personal relationship to the subject allowed by the ode form. Another factor was dependence on the poetic example of Edmund Spenser and John Milton, where Collins&#x27; choice of evocative word and phrase, and his departures from prose order in his syntax, contributed to his reputation for artificiality. Warton was content to refuse later republication of the products of his youthful enthusiasm, but Collins was less resilient. Although he had many projects in his head in the years that followed, few came to fruition. Republication of his eclogues apart, his closest approach to success was when the composer William Hayes set &quot;The Passions&quot; as an oratorio that was received with some acclaim.

Collins&#x27; only other completed poem afterwards was the &quot;Ode written on the death of Mr Thomson&quot; (1749), but his unfinished works suggest that he was moving away from the contrived abstraction of the &quot;Odes&quot; and seeking inspiration in an idealised time uncorrupted by the modern age. Collins had showed the Wartons an &quot;Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland, Considered as the Subject of Poetry&quot;, an incomplete copy of which was discovered in Scotland in 1788. Unfortunately, a spuriously completed version, published in London the same year as the Scottish discovery, was passed off as genuine in all collections of Collins until the end of the 19th century. The former text was then restored in scholarly editions and confirmed by the rediscovery of the original manuscript in 1967. The poem appealed to bardic subject matter &quot;whose power had charm’d a Spenser’s ear&quot; to the imaginative rehabilitation of true poetry.

Another indication of the new direction his work was taking was the &quot;Ode on the Music of the Grecian Theatre&quot; that Collins proposed sending to Hayes in 1750. There, he asserted, &quot;I have, I hope, Naturally introduc’d the Various Characters with which the Chorus was concern’d, As Oedopus, Medea, Electra, Orestes, &amp;c &amp;c. The Composition too is probably more correct, as I have chosen the ancient Tragedies as my Models.&quot; But all that has remained to substantiate this large claim is an 18-line fragment titled &quot;Recitative Accompanied&quot; and beginning &quot;When Glorious Ptolomy by Merit rais&#x27;d&quot;.

==Legacy==
Thomas Warton in his &quot;History of English Poetry&quot; (1774) made retrospective amends for his youthful lampoon by speaking there of &quot;My late lamented friend Mr William Collins, whose Odes will be remembered while any taste for true poetry remains&quot;. Nevertheless, it was not until a few years after the poet&#x27;s death that his work was collected in the edition of John Langhorne in 1765, after which it slowly gained more recognition, although never without criticism. While Dr Johnson wrote a sympathetic account of his former friend in &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; (1781), he echoed Gray in dismissing the poetry as contrived and poorly executed. At a much later date, Charles Dickens was dismissive for other reasons in his novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. There Pip describes his youthful admiration for a recitation of Collins&#x27; &quot;The Passions&quot; and commented ruefully, &quot;I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stain&#x27;d Sword in Thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing Trumpet with a withering Look. It was not with me then as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen&quot;.
But among the posthumous enthusiasts for Collins&#x27; poetry had been Scott of Amwell whose &quot;Stanzas written at Medhurst, in Sussex, on the Author&#x27;s return from Chichester, where he had attempted in vain to find the Burial-place of Collins&quot; was published in 1782. This charged that while the tombs of the unworthy were &quot;by Flatt&#x27;ry&#x27;s pen inscrib&#x27;d with purchas&#x27;d praise&quot;, those possessing genius and learning were &quot;Alive neglected, and when dead forgot&quot;.

That state of affairs was remedied by the commissioning of a monument to Collins in Chichester Cathedral in 1795, which brought a later tribute from the Wesleyan preacher Elijah Waring in &quot;Lines, composed on paying a visit to the tomb of Collins, in Chichester Cathedral&quot;. This, after initially noting the subject matter of the &quot;Odes&quot;, soon turned to a celebration of the poet&#x27;s faith in religion and his exemplary death. The poem is a response to John Flaxman&#x27;s design for the memorial, which depicted Collins seated at a table and studying the New Testament. This in turn was based on the anecdote perpetuated by Johnson in his life of the poet that he &quot;travelled with no other book than an English Testament, such as children carry to the school. When his friend took it into his hand, out of curiosity to see what companion a man of letters had chosen, &#x27;I have but one book,&#x27; said Collins, &#x27;but that is the best.&#x27;&quot;

Flaxman&#x27;s monument to the poet was funded by public subscription. As well as showing the poet in pious contemplation, it depicts a lyre left upon the floor, accompanied by a scrolled copy titled &quot;The Passions: an ode&quot;, representing his abandonment of poetry. On the ridge over the memorial tablet, the female figures of love and piety are lying with arms about each other. Beneath is an epitaph by William Hayley which also makes reference to Johnson&#x27;s anecdote of the poet &quot;Who in reviving reason&#x27;s lucid hours, | Sought on one book his troubled mind to rest, | And rightly deem&#x27;d the book of God the best.&quot;

St Andrews, the church where Collins was buried, was converted to an arts centre in the 1970s, but the poet is now commemorated by a window on the south side drawing on the Flaxman memorial and showing him at his reading. There is also a blue plaque placed on the Halifax building in East Street on the site of his birthplace.

==Works==
* &quot;Persian Eclogues&quot; (1742); these were revised as &quot;Oriental Eclogues&quot; in 1759.
* &quot;Verses humbly address&#x27;d to Sir Thomas Hanmer on his edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works&quot; (1743); republished in a revised edition in 1744, in which &quot;A Song from Shakespeare&#x27;s Cymbeline&quot; was included.
* &quot;Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegoric Subjects&quot; (1747) (including The Passions: an Ode to Music). 
* &quot;Ode on the Death of Thomson&quot; (1749)
* &quot;Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands&quot; (written 1750, unpublished until later editions)

==Editions==
*&quot;Poetical works of William Collins&quot;, ed. John Langhorne, originally published in 1765; several editions followed, to which Dr Johnson&#x27;s life of Collins was added.
* A scholarly edition was published in &quot;The Poetical Works of Gray and Collins&quot; (ed. Austin Poole) by Oxford University Press in 1926; from the same press there followed the definitive edition of &quot;The Works of William Collins&quot; (ed. Wendorf &amp; Ryskamp) in 1979.

==Musical settings==
Because the song &quot;To fair Fidele&#x27;s grassy tomb&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;A Song or Dirge from Shakespear&#x27;s Cymbeline&quot;) was included in 18th century adaptations of the play, settings by several composers were common at the time. Thomas Arne&#x27;s was the earliest, included in his &quot;Second Volume of Lyric Harmony&quot; (1746), followed by others by William Jackson of Exeter (c. 1755), Maria Hester Park (1790) and Venanzio Rauzzini (c. 1805). There were also settings of the song as a glee by Benjamin Cooke, as well as of Arne&#x27;s, as harmonised by Thomas Billington (c.1790). 

Following the already mentioned setting of &quot;The Passions&quot; by William Hayes, other composers took up the poem, including Benjamin Cooke (1784); Laura Wilson Barker (1846); Alice Mary Smith as a cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra (1882); and Frederic Cowen for chorus and orchestra (1898). In addition, the final section of the poem was set for choral performance by Zoltán Kodály under the title &quot;An Ode for Music&quot; (1963). One other poem by Collins, &quot;Ode to Evening&quot;, was set by Granville Bantock as the introductory piece in his &quot;Choral Suite&quot; for men&#x27;s voices (1926).

<text>Catch a Fire is the fifth studio album by the reggae band The Wailers (aka Bob Marley and the Wailers), released in April 1973. It was their first album released by Island Records. After finishing a UK tour with Johnny Nash, they had started laying down tracks for JAD Records when a disputed CBS contract with Danny Sims created tensions. The band did not have enough money to return to Jamaica, so their road manager Brent Clarke approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance The Wailers money for an album. They instead used this money to pay their fares back home, where they completed the recordings that constitute &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;. The album has nine songs, two of which were written and composed by Peter Tosh; the remaining seven were by Bob Marley. While Bunny Wailer is not credited as a writer, the group&#x27;s writing style was a collective process. For the immediate follow-up album, &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;, also released in 1973, he contributed four songs. After Marley returned with the tapes to London, Blackwell reworked the tracks at Island Studios, with contributions by Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on three overdubbed tracks. The album had a limited original release under the name The Wailers in a sleeve depicting a Zippo lighter, designed by graphic artists Rod Dyer and Bob Weiner; subsequent releases had an alternative cover designed by John Bonis, featuring an Esther Anderson portrait of Marley smoking a &quot;spliff&quot;, and crediting the band as Bob Marley and the Wailers.

The Catch a Fire Tour, which covered England and the United States, helped generate international interest in the band. &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; peaked at number 171 on the Billboard 200 and number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Albums charts. Critical acclaim has included the album being listed at number 126 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, second only to &quot;Legend&quot; among five Bob Marley albums on the list. It is regarded as one of the top reggae albums of all time.

The group title Bob Marley and the Wailers being used on Bob Marley solo albums has created a lot of marketing and identity confusion for The Wailers&#x27; catalog. This follows the confusion generated by their company Tuff Gong Records (registered in 1973) and the similarly-named Tuff Gong International (registered by the Bob Marley Estate in 1991); this resulted in the 1999 Tuff Gong Settlement Agreement, which sought to separate the group&#x27;s catalog from Bob Marley&#x27;s solo catalog. The dual releases of &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; under both group names is where this marketing confusion began.

==Background==
Bob Marley, without Peter Tosh or Bunny Wailer, moved to Sweden to work with Johnny Nash, writing and composing songs for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Want So Much to Believe.&quot; From November to December 1971, Marley toured Great Britain with Nash. Under their CBS international arm, Columbia Records released the Nash-produced &quot;Reggae on Broadway&quot; as a single, which was intended to break Marley as a solo artist; the single instead &quot;sank like a stone&quot;. After this solo tour, Marley returned to Jamaica, reuniting with Peter and Bunny. They came back to the UK to complete the tour and continue recording with CBS as a group. The sessions were abandoned because of clashes with Johnny Nash and Danny Sims about the process, causing the band to not have the funds to return to Jamaica, nor could they earn money due to work-permit restrictions. The group&#x27;s London road manager, Brent Clarke, recommended they get in contact with Chris Blackwell from Island Records, who had released licensed singles by The Wailers from Studio One in Great Britain. Blackwell gave the group an advance of £4000 to help them get home to Jamaica, and to complete the recording of their next album.

==Recording==
The album was recorded in 1972 at three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica – Dynamic Sound, Harry J&#x27;s, and Randy&#x27;s, respectively – on eight-track tape by engineer Sylvan Morris. According to Aston Barrett, &quot;some of the songs had been recorded before ... in different studios and with different musicians, but we gave them that strict timing and brought the feeling out of them more.&quot; &quot;Baby We&#x27;ve Got a Date (Rock It Baby)&quot; is similar to &quot;Black Bitter&quot;, recorded in an earlier session. The musicians consisted of Marley on vocals and acoustic guitar, Peter Tosh on vocals, guitar and keyboards, Bunny Wailer on backing vocals and bongos, Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett on bass, and Carlton Barrett on drums. In addition, Robbie Shakespeare played the bass on &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, Tyrone Downie played organ on &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, Winston Wright played organ on all other tracks, and Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson played akete drums on several tracks. The female backing singing was performed by Rita Marley and her friend Marcia Griffiths. Tommy McCook played the flute.

In the winter of 1972, Marley flew back to London to present the master tapes to Chris Blackwell. CBS and Sims, with whom the band were already contracted, took Blackwell and the Island Records label to court over the recording. Island won the case, and received US$9,000 (about $68,000 in 2024) and two percent of royalties from the band&#x27;s first six albums, while Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs. Blackwell remixed the tracks at the Island Studios on Basing Street, and included overdubs. Muscle Shoals session guitarist Wayne Perkins, who at that time was recording a new Smith, Perkins &amp; Smith album at the Island studio, recorded a guitar solo overdub for &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot;, including the three-octave feedback at the end, slide guitar on &quot;Baby We&#x27;ve Got a Date (Rock It Baby)&quot;, and the wah-wah-laced lead on &quot;Stir It Up&quot;.

The songs&#x27; lyrics deal with political injustice towards blacks and poverty, as is the case in much of their musical output. &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is about &quot;the current state of urban poverty&quot;, and &quot;Slave Driver&quot; &quot;connects the present to past injustices&quot;. However, politics are not the only theme; &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, for example, is a love song. &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, along with other Marley songs, was later covered by Johnny Nash on the &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; album, peaking at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Cover art==
The original 1973 vinyl release, designed by graphic artists Rod Dyer and Bob Weiner, was enclosed in a sleeve depicting a Zippo lighter. The sleeve functioned like a real Zippo lighter case, opening at a side hinge to reveal the record within. Only the original pressing of 20,000 had the Zippo cover; because each cover had to be hand-riveted, which was not cost-effective, subsequent pressings had an alternative cover designed by John Bonis, featuring an Esther Anderson portrait of Marley smoking a &quot;spliff&quot;, with the album now credited to Bob Marley and the Wailers. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Jamaican police raided Anderson&#x27;s house and seized the cover photo and film, which were never returned. Copies of the record from the original pressings have since become collector&#x27;s items. The original cover art was reproduced in 2001 for the deluxe compact disc edition.

==Release==
The first release from the album sessions was the &quot;Baby We&#x27;ve Got a Date&quot; single, released in early 1973 on Island&#x27;s Blue Mountain subsidiary. &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; was released on 13 April 1973 on the Island label with a supporting tour. The album sold around 14,000 copies in its first weeks, and peaked at number 171 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and at number 51 on &quot;Billboard R&amp;B&quot; chart.

&quot;Catch a Fire&quot; has been re-released under different recording labels with different track lengths. In 2001, a special collection edition was released containing the unreleased, non-overdubbed (&quot;Jamaican&quot;) versions of the songs on the first side and the original, overdubbed album on the second side. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released an Ultradisc II version in 1995.

A documentary about the album, directed by Jeremy Marre, was released in 2000, featuring interviews with the musicians and engineers who worked on the album, archive performance footage, and home video footage filmed by members of the band.

==Tour==
The album&#x27;s supporting tour began in 1973 in the United Kingdom, and then moved to the United States. In England, they performed 19 shows at universities and clubs. While in London, the band performed on the BBC shows &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The UK leg of the tour was the last time singer Bunny Wailer performed with The Wailers; the reason for his departure was his unhappiness with the record marketing and promotion process, which made touring outside Jamaica difficult, with contributing factors being the difficulty in finding food suitable to his strict Ital diet and other cultural clashes as a Rastafari. After Bunny&#x27;s departure from the tour, Tosh consulted with Marley and finally picked Joe Higgs as a replacement. Blackwell hired the concert promoter Lee Jaffe to book gigs in North America. The Wailers performed at Paul&#x27;s Mall in Boston and then three gigs in New York City, alongside Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band; in October, they opened for Sly and the Family Stone in Las Vegas. These concerts marked an important step towards international acknowledgement. The tensions surrounding the marketing, promotions and income from the tour continued, causing Peter Tosh to also depart. Back in Jamaica, the group agreed to pursue solo albums, and their early solo singles were released under their Tuff Gong Records company, based at 56 Hope Road in Kingston.

==Critical reception==

The critical reception to &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; was positive. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said &quot;half these songs are worthy of St. John the Divine&quot;, and &quot;Barrett brothers&#x27; bass and drums save those that aren&#x27;t from limbo&quot;. Reviewers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also praised the brothers&#x27; playing, concluding that &quot;&quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is a blazing debut&quot;. According to the review, &quot;&#x27;Concrete Jungle&#x27; and &#x27;Slave Driver&#x27; crackle with streetwise immediacy, while &#x27;Kinky Reggae&#x27; and &#x27;Stir It Up&#x27; ... revel in the music&#x27;s vast capacity for good-time skanking. &#x27;Stop That Train&#x27; and &#x27;400 Years,&#x27; both written by Peter Tosh, indicate the original Wailers weren&#x27;t strictly a one-man show&quot;.

Critics have called &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; one of the greatest reggae albums of all time. Vik Iyengar from AllMusic comments that &quot;Marley would continue to achieve great critical and commercial success during the 1970s, but &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is one of the finest reggae albums ever. This album is essential for any music collection&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 123 on its list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, moving to 126 in a 2012 revised listing, the second highest placement for a reggae album; only &quot;Legend&quot;, ranked higher at number 46. It was later ranked at number 140 in the 2020 reboot of the list. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; arts blog in 2012, David Rodigan described it as &quot;quite simply, one of the greatest reggae albums ever made&quot;. The album was voted number 285 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

<doc id="200044" wikidata="Q2479238" url="?curid=200044" title="Straight-eight engine">
<text>The straight-eight engine or inline-eight engine (often abbreviated as I8) is an eight-cylinder internal combustion engine with all eight cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankcase. The type has been produced in side-valve, IOE, overhead-valve, sleeve-valve, and overhead-cam configurations.

A straight-eight can be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance, with no unbalanced primary or secondary forces or moments. However, crankshaft torsional vibration, present to some degree in all engines, is sufficient to require the use of a harmonic damper at the accessory end of the crankshaft. Without such damping, fatigue cracking near the rear main bearing journal may occur, leading to engine failure.

Although an inline six-cylinder engine can also be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance, a straight-eight develops more power strokes per revolution and, as a result, will run more smoothly under load than an inline six. Also, due to the even number of power strokes per revolution, a straight-eight does not produce unpleasant odd-order harmonic vibration in the vehicle&#x27;s driveline at low engine speeds.

The smooth running characteristics of the straight-eight made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past. However, the engine&#x27;s length demanded the use of a long engine compartment, making the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles. Also, due to the length of the engine, torsional vibration in both crankshaft and camshaft can adversely affect reliability and performance at high speeds. In particular, a phenomenon referred to as &quot;crankshaft whip,&quot; caused by the effects of centrifugal force on the crank throws at high engine rpm, can cause physical contact between the connecting rods and crankcase walls, leading to the engine&#x27;s destruction. As a result, the design has been displaced almost completely by the shorter V8 engine configuration.

==Early period (1903–1918)==
The first straight-eight was conceived by Charron, Girardot et Voigt (CGV) in 1903, but never built. Great strides were made during World War I, as Mercedes made straight-eight aircraft engines like the Mercedes D.IV. Advantages of the straight-eight engine for aircraft applications included the aerodynamic efficiency of the long, narrow configuration, and the inherent balance of the engine making counterweights on the crankshaft unnecessary. The disadvantages of crank and camshaft twisting were not considered at this time, since aircraft engines of the time ran at low speeds to keep propeller tip speed below the speed of sound.

Unlike the V8 engine configuration, examples of which were used in De Dion-Bouton, Scripps-Booth, and Cadillac automobiles by 1914, no straight-eight engines were used in production cars before 1920.

==Inter-war period (1919–1941)==

===Luxury automobiles===
Italy&#x27;s Isotta Fraschini introduced the first production automobile straight-eight in their Tipo 8 at the Paris Salon in 1919 Leyland Motors introduced their OHC straight-eight powered Leyland Eight luxury car at the International Motor Exhibition at Olympia, London in 1920. The Duesenberg brothers introduced their first production straight-eight in 1921.

Straight-eight engines were used in expensive luxury and performance vehicles until after World War II. Bugattis and Duesenbergs commonly used double overhead cam straight-eight engines. Other notable straight-eight-powered automobiles were built by Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Isotta Fraschini, Alfa Romeo, Stutz, Stearns-Knight and Packard. One marketing feature of these engines was their impressive length — some of the Duesenberg engines were over long, resulting in the long hoods (bonnets) found on these automobiles.

===Premium automobiles in the United States===
In the United States in the 1920s, automobile manufacturers, including Hupmobile (1925), Chandler (1926), Marmon (1927), Gardner (1925), Kissel (1925), Locomobile (1925) and Auburn (1925) began using straight-eight engines in cars targeted at the middle class. Engine manufacturer Lycoming built straight-eight engines for sale to automobile manufacturers, including Gardner, Auburn, Kissel, and Locomobile. Hupmobile built their own engine. Lycoming was purchased by Auburn owner Errett Lobban Cord, who used a Lycoming straight-eight in his front-drive Cord L-29 automobile, and had Lycoming build the straight-eight engine for the Duesenberg Model J, which had been designed by the Duesenberg brothers for the Cord-owned Duesenberg Inc. The automobile manufacturers within the Cord Corporation, comprising Auburn, Cord, and Duesenberg, were shut down in 1937. Lycoming continues to this day as an aircraft engine manufacturer.

In the late 1920s, volume sellers Hudson and Studebaker introduced straight-eight engines for the premium vehicles in their respective lines. They were followed in the early 1930s by Nash (with a dual-ignition unit), REO, and the Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac divisions of General Motors.

The Buick straight-eight was an overhead valve design, while the Oldsmobile straight-8 and Pontiac straight-8 straight-eights were flathead engines. Chevrolet, as an entry-level marque, did not have a straight-eight. Cadillac, the luxury brand of General Motors, stayed with their traditional V8 engines. In order to have engines as smooth as the straight-eights of its competitors, Cadillac introduced the crossplane crankshaft for its V8, and added V12 and V16 engines to the top of its lineup.

Ford never adopted the straight-eight; their entry-level Ford cars used flathead V8 engines until the 1950s while their Lincoln luxury cars used V8 from the 1930s to the 1980s and V12 engines in the 1930s and 1940s. Chrysler used flathead straight-eights in its premium Chrysler cars, including the Imperial luxury model.

===Airships===
The British R101 rigid airship was fitted with five Beardmore Tornado Mk I inline eight-cylinder diesel engines. These engines were intended to give an output of at 1,000 rpm but in practice had a continuous output rating of only at 900 rpm.

==Post-war==

After World War II, changes in the automobile market resulted in the decline and final extinction of the straight-eight as an automobile engine. The primary users of the straight-eight were American luxury and premium cars that were carried over from before the war. A Flxible inter-city bus used the Buick straight-eight.

During World War II, improvements in the refinery technology used to produce aviation gasoline resulted in the availability of large amounts of inexpensive high octane gasoline. Engines could be designed with higher compression ratios to take advantage of high-octane gasoline. This led to more highly stressed engines which amplified the limitations of the long crankshaft and camshaft in the straight-eight engines.
Oldsmobile replaced their straight-eight flathead engine with an overhead valve V8 engine in 1949, at which time Cadillac&#x27;s V8 was changed to one with overhead valves. Chrysler replaced its straight-eight with its famous Hemi V-8 for 1951. Hudson retired its straight-eight at the end of the 1952 model year. Buick introduced a (4.0&quot; bore × 3 &quot; stroke = 322 in³ (5.277 L)) V8 in 1953, with similar displacement as their (3 &quot; bore × 4 &quot; stroke = 320.2 in³ (5.247 L)) straight-8, the latter being produced until the end of the 1953 model year. Pontiac maintained production on their straight-eight, as well as a L-head inline six, through the end of the 1954 model year, after which a V8 became standard. Packard ended production of their signature straight-eight at the end of 1954, replacing it with an overhead valve V8.

By the end of the 1970s overhead valve V8s powered 80% of automobiles built in the US, and most of the rest had six-cylinder engines.

In Europe, many automobile factories had been destroyed during World War II, and it took many years before war-devastated economies recovered enough to make large cars popular again. The change in the design of cars from a long engine compartment between separate fenders to the modern configuration with its shorter engine compartment quickly led to the demise of the straight-8 engine. As a result of this, and of gasoline prices several times as expensive as in the U.S., four- and six-cylinder engines powered the majority of cars in Europe, and the few eight-cylinder cars produced were in the V8 configuration.

===Military use===
The British Army selected Rolls-Royce B80 series of straight-eight engines in the Alvis FV 600 armoured vehicle family. The Alvis Saladin armoured car was a 6x6 design with the engine compartment in the rear, a 76.2mm low pressure gun turret in the centre and the driver in front. The Saracen armoured personnel carrier had the engine in front with the driver in the centre and space for up to nine troops in the rear. The Stalwart amphibious logistics carrier has the driver&#x27;s compartment over the front wheels, the larger B81 engine in the rear and a large load compartment over the middle and rear. The Salamander firefighting vehicle was unarmoured, and resembled the Stalwart with a conventional fire engine superstructure.

The Rolls-Royce B80 series of engines were also used in other military and civilian applications, such as the Leyland Martian military truck, the winch engine in the Centurion ARV, and various Dennis fire engines.

==Performance and racing cars==
Despite the shortcomings of length, weight, bearing friction, and torsional vibrations that led to the straight-eight&#x27;s post-war demise, the straight-eight was the performance engine design of choice from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, and continued to excel in motorsport until the mid-1950s. Bugatti, Duesenberg, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, and Miller built successful racing cars with high-performance dual overhead camshaft straight-eight engines in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight-eight racing engine in 1920, when their 3 L engine placed third, fourth, and sixth at the Indianapolis 500. The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix, while two others placed fourth and sixth in the race. Based on work the company had done on 16-cylinder aircraft engines during World War I, the overhead camshaft, three-valve-per-cylinder engine produced at 4,250 rpm, and was capable of revving to an astonishing (at the time) 5,000 rpm. No Grand Prix engine before the war had peaked at more than 3,000 rpm.

Bugatti experimented with straight-eight engines from 1922, and in 1924, he introduced the 2 L Bugatti Type 35, one of the most successful racing cars of all time, which eventually won over 1000 races. Like the Duesenbergs, Bugatti got his ideas from building aircraft engines during World War I, and like them, his engine was a high-revving overhead camshaft unit with three valves per cylinder. It produced at 5,000 rpm and could be revved to over 6,000 rpm. Nearly 400 of the Type 35 and its derivatives were produced, an all-time record for Grand Prix motor racing.

Alfa Romeo were the first to react to the engineering problems of the straight-eight: in their racing car engines for the P2 and P3 and in their Alfa Romeo 8C 2300/2600/2900 sports cars of Mille Miglia and Le Mans fame the camshaft drive had been moved to the engine centre, between cylinders four and five, thus reducing the aforementioned limitations. The straight-eight was actually built as a symmetrical pair of straight-four engines joined in the middle at common gear trains for the camshafts and superchargers. It had two overhead camshafts, but only two valves per cylinder.

The Alfa Romeo straight-eight would return after World War II to dominate the first season of Formula One racing in 1950, and to win the second season against competition from Ferrari&#x27;s V12-powered car in 1951. The Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta was originally designed in 1937 and won 47 of 54 Grands Prix entered between 1938 and 1951 (with a six-year gap in the middle caused by the war). By 1951, their 1.5 L supercharged engines could produce at 9,300 rpm, and could rev as high as 10,500 rpm. However, the engines were at the end of their potential, and rule changes for the 1952 season made the Alfettas obsolete.

Mercedes-Benz would create the last notable straight-eight racing cars in 1955, with the championship-winning W196 Formula One racing car and the 300SLR sports racing car. The 300SLR was famous for Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson&#x27;s victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia, but notorious for Pierre Levegh&#x27;s deadly accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 300SLR was the final development of the Alfa Romeo design of the early 1930s as not only the camshaft, but now also the gearbox was driven from the engine&#x27;s centre. Engineers calculated that torsional stresses would be too high if they took power from the end of the long crankshaft, so they put a central gear train in the middle (which also ran the dual camshafts, dual magnetos, and other accessories) and ran a drive shaft to the clutch housing at the rear.

<text>‘Live’ Bullet is a live album by American rock band Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band, released on April 12, 1976. It was recorded at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, during the heyday of that arena&#x27;s time as an important rock concert venue. The album is credited, along with &quot;Night Moves&quot;, with launching Seger&#x27;s mainstream popularity.

==History==
&quot;&#x27;Live&#x27; Bullet&quot; became a staple of FM rock radio in Detroit. Classics such as the live version of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; and the medley of &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man/Beautiful Loser&quot; were among the most widely played live tracks on Detroit stations such as WWWW (W4), WRIF, and WABX. Other tracks such as &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, &quot;Turn the Page&quot; and &quot;Get Out of Denver&quot; also received wide airplay in Detroit.

The success of Seger&#x27;s music at this time, however, was highly regional, with Seger still remaining quite unknown in adjacent media markets such as Chicago. Even in his home state of Michigan, Seger often struggled to garner mass appeal outside the Metro Detroit area. In December, 1975, 3 months after &quot;&#x27;Live&#x27; Bullet&quot; was recorded, a scheduled concert at Western Michigan University was cancelled after only a few hundred advance tickets were sold. In June 1976, Seger played the Pontiac Silverdome in metropolitan Detroit at a historic concert that also included Point Blank, Elvin Bishop and Todd Rundgren. 78,000 people were in attendance and the concert lasted until nearly 1:30 a.m. The next night, Seger played for fewer than a thousand people in Chicago.

However, it was only in the following winter that the release of his next recording, &quot;Night Moves&quot;, launched Seger into more national markets. Over time, the life-on-the-road tale &quot;Turn the Page&quot; would become the most nationally played song from &quot;&#x27;Live&#x27; Bullet&quot;, and a perennial favorite on album-oriented rock and classic rock stations.

For Detroit fans, however, the entire &quot;″Live&#x27; Bullet&quot; recording captured a Detroit artist at the height of his energy and creativity, in front of a highly appreciative hometown crowd. &quot;&#x27;Live&#x27; Bullet&quot; also captured the wild and free spirit of rock concerts in the 1970s, and has great historic value in that regard.

==Critical reception==
Critic Dave Marsh called &quot;Live Bullet&quot; &quot;one of the best live albums ever made.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;Live Bullet&quot; was ranked No. 26 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time&quot; list. Readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 10 in a 2012 poll of all-time favourite live albums. In an article supporting the 2015 list, Seger states, &quot;We were doing 250 to 300 shows a year before &quot;Live Bullet&quot;. We were playing five nights a week, sometimes six, as the Silver Bullet Band, and we just had that show down.&quot;

==Track listing==



The 2011 remastered CD reissue has one extra track, &quot;I Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody’s Home&quot;, (3:05), recorded live at the Pontiac Silverdome on June 26, 1976.
The live version of the song &quot;Katmandu&quot; was also featured as the sole Bob Seger track as part of a promotional-only compilation album issued by Capitol records entitled &quot;The Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot;, which was distributed to record stores during the 1976 holiday season as part of Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot; campaign, promoting 15 &quot;best of&quot; albums released by the record label. &quot;&#x27;Live&#x27; Bullet&quot; is a live album and not a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, though several tracks were major regional hits (&quot;Lookin&#x27; Back&quot; #2 in Detroit, etc.).

Many songs from the album such as &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Back&quot;, and &quot;Turn the Page&quot; became hit singles off the album, whereas their original studio versions were overlooked. &quot;Lookin Back&quot; was released as a single in 1971 but had very short lived success as it was not on an actual Seger album. It was originally performed by Seger&#x27;s first band, The Bob Seger System, whereas the Live Bullet version featured The Silver Bullet Band.

Two of the songs on the album are actually medleys. &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; is a medley of &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, while &quot;Let It Rock&quot; is a medley of &quot;Let It Rock&quot; and &quot;Little Queenie&quot; with some minor lyrical changes. Additionally, the tracks &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; feature no audible pause between the two, and are played as a single medley (though the CD has a digital track marker for each). As a result, many album-oriented rock and classic rock radio stations have played them together as a medley.

<text>Paul Charles Joseph Bourget (; 2 September 185225 December 1935) was a French poet, novelist and critic. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.

Paul Bourget was born in Amiens, France. He initially abandoned Catholicism but eventually returned to it in the late 19th century. Bourget is known for his psychological and moralistic novels that often portrayed the complex emotions of women and the ideas, passions, and failures of young men in France. Some of his notable works include &quot;Le Disciple&quot; (1889), a bestseller that explored the consequences of materialism and positivism, and other novels such as &quot;Cruelle Enigme&quot; (1885), &quot;André Cornelis&quot; (1886), and &quot;Mensonges&quot; (1887). He was admitted to the Académie Française in 1894 and was promoted to be an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1895.

Bourget&#x27;s early career was marked by volumes of verse, but he later found success in literary journalism, and his critical works such as &quot;Sensations d&#x27;Italie&quot; (1891) are highly regarded. Though his novels were widely popular in his time, they have since been largely forgotten by the general reading public. Nonetheless, Bourget remains an important figure in French literature for his psychological and moralistic approach to fiction, and his influence can be seen in the works of several composers, including Claude Debussy, who set some of Bourget&#x27;s poems to music.

==Life==
Paul Bourget was born in Amiens in the Somme &quot;département&quot; of Picardy, France. His father, a professor of mathematics, was later appointed to a post in the college at Clermont-Ferrand, where Bourget received his early education. He afterwards studied at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and at the École des Hautes Études.

Between 1872 and 1876, he produced a volume of verse, &quot;Au Bord de la Mer&quot;, which was followed by others, the last, &quot;Les Aveux&quot;, appearing in 1882. Meanwhile, he was making a name in literary journalism and in 1883 he published &quot;Essais de Psychologie Contemporaine&quot;, studies of eminent writers first printed in the &quot;Nouvelle Revue&quot;, and now brought together. In 1884 Bourget paid a long visit to Britain, where he wrote his first published story (&quot;L&#x27;Irréparable&quot;). &quot;Cruelle Enigme&quot; followed in 1885; then &quot;André Cornelis&quot; (1886) and &quot;Mensonges&quot; (1887) - inspired by Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s life - were received with much favour.

Bourget, who had abandoned Catholicism in 1867, began a gradual return to it in 1889, fully converting only in 1901. In 1893, in an interview he gave in America, he spoke about his changed views: &quot;For many years I, like most young men in modern cities, was content to drift along in agnosticism, but I was brought to my senses at last by the growing realization that...the life of a man who simply said &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, and not knowing I do the thing that pleases me,&#x27; was not only empty in itself and full of disappointment and suffering, but was a positive influence for evil upon the lives of others.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;those men and women who follow the teachings of the church are in a great measure protected from the moral disasters which...almost invariably follow when men and women allow themselves to be guided and swayed by their senses, passions and weaknesses.&quot; These were the themes of his novel &quot;Le Disciple&quot; (1889), which he wrote, as he says in his American interview, just after abandoning his &quot;drifting and comfortable belief in agnosticism&quot;. It is the story of philosopher Adrien Sixte, whose advocacy of materialism and positivism wields a terrible influence over an admiring but unstable student, Robert Geslon, whose actions, in turn, lead to the tragic death of a young woman. &quot;Le Disciple&quot; caused a stir in France and became a bestseller. Exemplifying the novelist&#x27;s graver side, it was one of William Gladstone&#x27;s favourite books. John Cowper Powys listed &quot;Le Disciple&quot; at number 33 in his &quot;One Hundred Best Books&quot;.

&quot;Études et portraits&quot;, first published in 1888, contains impressions of Bourget&#x27;s stay in England and Ireland—especially reminiscences of the months which he spent at Oxford and in 1891 &quot;Sensations d&#x27;Italie&quot;, notes of a tour in that country, revealed a fresh phase of his powers; and &quot;Outre-Mer&quot; (1895), a book in two volumes, is his critical journal of a visit to the United States in 1893. Also in 1891 appeared the novel &quot;Coeur de Femme&quot;, and &quot;Nouveaux Pastels&quot;, &quot;types&quot; of the characters of men, the sequel to a similar gallery of female types (&quot;Pastels&quot;, 1890). His later novels include &quot;La Terre Promise&quot; (1892); &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; (1892), a psychological novel with Rome as a background; &quot;Une Idylle tragique&quot; (1896); &quot;La Duchesse bleue&quot; (1897); &quot;Le Fantôme&quot; (1901); &quot;Les Deux Sœurs&quot; (1905); and some volumes of shorter stories—&quot;Complications Sentimentales&quot; (1896), &quot;Drames de famille&quot; (1898), and &quot;Un Homme d&#x27;Affaires&quot; (1900). &quot;L&#x27;Etape&quot; (1902) was a study of the inability of a family raised too rapidly from the peasant class to adapt itself to new conditions. This study of contemporary manners was followed by &quot;Un Divorce&quot; (1904), a defence of the Roman Catholic position that divorce is a violation of natural laws. He was admitted to the Académie Française in 1894, and in 1895 was promoted to be an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, having received the decoration of the order ten years before.

Several new novels were to follow, including &quot;La Vie Passe&quot; (1910), &quot;Le Sens de la Mort&quot; (1915), &quot;Lazarine&quot; (1917), &quot;Némésis&quot; (1918), and &quot;Laurence Albani&quot; (1920), as well as three volumes of short stories and plays, &quot;La Barricade&quot; (1910) and &quot;Le Tribun&quot; (1912). He wrote two other plays, &quot;Un Cas de Conscience&quot; (1910) and &quot;La Crise&quot; (1912), in collaboration with others. A volume of his critical studies appeared in 1912, and another set of travel sketches, &quot;Le Démon du Midi&quot;, in 1914.

On 16 March 1914, he was present in the offices of the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; when the newspaper&#x27;s editor, his friend Gaston Calmette, was shot and killed by Henriette Caillaux, the wife of a former Prime Minister of France. Her subsequent trial caused an enormous scandal at the time.

He was a contributor to &quot;Le Visage de l&#x27;Italie&quot;, a 1929 book about Italy prefaced by Benito Mussolini.

Bourget died on Christmas Day 1935, aged 83, in Paris.

==Literary significance and criticism==
As a writer of verse Bourget&#x27;s poems, which were collected in two volumes (1885–1887), throw light upon his mature method and the later products of his art. It was in criticism that he excelled. Notable are the &quot;Sensations d&#x27;Italie&quot; (1891), and the various psychological studies.

Bourget&#x27;s reputation as a novelist is assured in some academic and intellectual circles but while they were widely popular in his time, his novels have long been largely forgotten by the general reading public. Impressed by the art of Henry Beyle (Stendhal), he struck out on a new course at a moment when the realist school was the vogue in French fiction. With Bourget, observation was mainly directed to the human character. At first his purpose seemed to be purely artistic, but when &quot;Le Disciple&quot; appeared, in 1889, the preface to that story revealed his moral enthusiasm. After that, he varied between his earlier and his later manner, but his work in general was more seriously conceived. He painted the intricate emotions of women, whether wronged, erring or actually vicious; and he described the ideas, passions and failures of the young men of France.

One of his poems was the inspiration for an art song by Claude Debussy titled Beau Soir.
Other settings by Debussy of poems by Bourget include &#x27;Romance&#x27; and &#x27;Les Cloches&#x27;.

<doc id="200053" wikidata="Q309788" url="?curid=200053" title="Don Johnson">
<text>Don Wayne Johnson (born December 15, 1949) is an American actor and singer-songwriter. He played the role of James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett in the 1980s television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, for which he won a Golden Globe, and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also played the titular character in the 1990s series &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Johnson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1996.

Johnson has appeared in films such as &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; (1975), &quot;Tin Cup&quot; (1996), &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012) and &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019). He released the albums &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1986) and &quot;Let It Roll&quot; (1989) as a singer. His cover version of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== Early life ==
Johnson was born on December 15, 1949, in his grandmother&#x27;s house in Flat Creek, Missouri. His mother, Nell (née Wilson), was a beautician. His father, Fredie Wayne Johnson, was a farmer. At the time of his birth, Johnson&#x27;s mother and father were 16 and 19 years old, respectively. Johnson was raised in Wichita, Kansas, where his parents relocated when he was five years old and where his father worked for Boeing Aircraft. He has described his childhood as &quot;incredibly dysfunctional and abusive&quot; as his parents were both frequently absent and stressed. His father subjected the children to corporal punishment. According to Johnson, he was 12 years old when he lost his virginity to his 16-year-old babysitter. Johnson&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 12. He continued to live with his mother, younger sister and two younger brothers until he was 13, at which time he ended up in juvenile court and was sent to live with his father in Missouri.

He moved back home to Wichita for his senior year of high school, working part-time as a butcher&#x27;s apprentice and ladies&#x27; shoe salesman. He attended Wichita South High School, from which he graduated in 1967. When he was kicked off the school&#x27;s football team, Johnson enrolled in a drama class to earn enough credits to graduate. Encouraged by his teacher, he played the lead role of Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot;. He was also exposed to the plays of Molière, Tennessee Williams and Shakespeare. During his last semester, he auditioned for the summer repertory program at the University of Kansas and won a partial scholarship. He was subsequently awarded a full scholarship to attend as a drama major. There, Johnson, 18, dated his 29-year-old acting teacher. In his sophomore year, he left to San Francisco after passing an audition for the American Conservatory Theater.

== Acting career ==
=== Early years ===
Johnson&#x27;s first major role was in the 1969 Los Angeles stage production of &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, in which he played the lead role of Smitty. The play included a &quot;shockingly realistic prison rape&quot; scene portrayed by Johnson. This exposure led to the quickly forgotten film &quot;The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart&quot; (1970). Johnson continued to work on stage, film and television without breaking into stardom. His notable films from this period were &quot;Zachariah&quot; (1971), &quot;The Harrad Experiment&quot; (1973) (a film in which Johnson displayed frontal nudity), &quot;Lollipop and Roses&quot; (1974) and &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; (1975). In 1976, Johnson was the roommate of actor Sal Mineo at the time Mineo was murdered.

=== &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and stardom ===

In 1984, after years of struggling to establish himself as a TV actor, Johnson landed a starring role as undercover police detective Sonny Crockett in the Michael Mann/Universal Television cop series, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The show ran from 1984 to 1990. &quot;Miami Vice&quot; made Johnson &quot;a major international star&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;No one had more swagger in the Reagan era than Don Johnson. As Miami Vice&#x27;s Sonny Crockett, the undercover detective and professional stubble-cultivator who lived on a houseboat with his pet alligator Elvis, he embodied masculine cool in the era of coke binges and Lamborghinis&quot;. The Sonny Crockett character typically wore thousand-dollar Versace and Armani suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari, wore expensive timepieces by Rolex and Ebel, and lived on an Endeavour yacht. &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was noted for its revolutionary use of music and cinematography, and for its glitzy take on the police drama genre. In the show, Crockett&#x27;s partner was Ricardo Tubbs, played by Philip Michael Thomas.

Johnson&#x27;s work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama, in 1986. Johnson was nominated for the same award in 1987. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.

Between seasons on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Johnson gained further renown through the TV miniseries &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; (1985), a remake of the 1958 film. During the time he was on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, he had set up an hour-long music video/pay cable program with videocassette versions of the programs Johnson had hosted being handled by distributor CBS/Fox Video. The project was a tie-in to his first album &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, which was released by CBS/Epic Records in 1986.

In 1988, he starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Sweet Hearts Dance&quot;, alongside Susan Sarandon, Jeff Daniels and Elizabeth Perkins. In 1989 he played the sheriff of Los Angeles County Jerry Beck in John Frankenheimer&#x27;s film &quot;Dead Bang&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Johnson played a variety of roles in well-produced films, including the role of drifter and car salesman Harry Maddox in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; (1990) opposite Jennifer Connelly and Virginia Madsen. He worked on two films with his wife Melanie Griffith, &quot;Paradise&quot; (1991) and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1993). He appeared alongside Mickey Rourke in &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot; (1991), and in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s thriller &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot; (1993), opposite Rebecca De Mornay.

=== &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; ===
Johnson later starred in the 1996–2001 CBS-TV police drama &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; with Yasmine Bleeth, Cheech Marin, Jeff Perry, Jaime P. Gomez, Kelly Hu, Wendy Moniz, Annette O&#x27;Toole, Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe as his daughter Cassidy, and James Gammon as his father Nick. Johnson portrayed the title role, an inspector (later promoted to captain) for the San Francisco Police Department. In &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, Johnson was again paired with a flashy convertible car, a yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda.

=== 2001–2010 ===
In the fall of 2005, Johnson briefly starred in The WB courtroom television drama show &quot;Just Legal&quot; as a jaded lawyer with a young and idealistic protégé/partner (Jay Baruchel); the show was canceled in October 2005 after just three of the eight produced episodes aired. In January 2007, Johnson began a run in the West End of London production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; as Nathan Detroit.

Johnson also had a role in the Norwegian comedy &quot;Lange Flate Ballær 2&quot; (&quot;Long Flat Balls II&quot;), directed by Johnson&#x27;s friend Harald Zwart. Johnson did the movie as a favor to Zwart. The movie was launched on March 14, 2008, in Norway, with Johnson making an appearance at the premiere. He next appeared in &quot;When in Rome&quot; with Danny DeVito, Anjelica Huston and Kristen Bell.

Johnson had a supporting role in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s film &quot;Machete&quot;. Johnson played Von Jackson, &quot;a twisted border vigilante leading a small army&quot;. The film was released on September 3, 2010. In October 2010, he began appearing on the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, playing Kenny Powers&#x27; long-lost father, going by the alias &quot;Eduardo Sanchez&quot;. He also reprised his role as Sonny Crockett for a Nike commercial with LeBron James in which the NBA player contemplates acting and appears alongside Johnson on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

=== 2011–present ===
In September 2011, Johnson had a cameo in the comedy &quot;A Good Old Fashioned Orgy&quot; with Jason Sudeikis. Johnson had a supporting role in the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, playing a southern plantation owner named Spencer &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; Bennett. In 2014, Johnson starred as the character &quot;Jim Bob&quot; opposite Sam Shepard and Michael C. Hall in Jim Mickle&#x27;s critically acclaimed crime film, &quot;Cold in July&quot;. In 2015, Johnson began starring in the ABC prime time soap opera &quot;Blood &amp; Oil&quot;.

In 2018, he starred as the character of Arthur, the love interest of Vivian, played by Jane Fonda in Bill Holderman&#x27;s romantic-comedy &quot;Book Club&quot;. In 2019, Johnson played the role of Richard Drysdale in Rian Johnson&#x27;s murder-mystery &quot;Knives Out&quot;; and starred as Police Chief Judd Crawford in the HBO series &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

In 2021, Johnson co-starred on &quot;Kenan&quot; until its cancellation in May 2022. He also appeared in a &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; television film with co-star Cheech Marin on the USA Network in 2021.

In April 2024, it was revealed that Johnson would be starring in the Ryan Murphy drama television series, &quot;Doctor Odyssey&quot;, which premiered on ABC and Hulu on September 26, 2024.
== Music career ==
Johnson released two albums of pop music in the 1980s. &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was released in 1986. &quot;Let it Roll&quot; was released in 1989. His single &quot;Heartbeat&quot; reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

&quot;Till I Loved You&quot;, a duet with then-girlfriend Barbra Streisand, was a top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was released on the Columbia Records studio album &quot;Till I Loved You&quot; on October 25, 1988. The song was re-released on the Streisand album &quot;Duets&quot; in 2002.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and family ===
Johnson has been married five times to four women, and has four children with two of them (one daughter with Melanie Griffith, three children with Kelley Phleger) plus one son with Patti D&#x27;Arbanville.

Three of his marriages were brief; the first two were annulled within a matter of days. The names of Johnson&#x27;s first two wives have not been made public, though he has said that one of them was a dancer and the other a &quot;rich bimbo&quot;.

Circa 1971, Johnson lived with self-described &quot;groupie&quot; Pamela Des Barres.

During the first half of 1972, Johnson met Melanie Griffith, the 14-year-old daughter of his &quot;Harrad Experiment&quot; co-star Tippi Hedren. The pair moved in together when Griffith was 15 and Johnson was 23. On her 18th birthday they became engaged, and were married in January 1976; they separated that July and divorced in November.

In 1980, Johnson dated Sally Adams, mother of actress Nicollette Sheridan.

In January of the following year, he met former Warhol model Patti D&#x27;Arbanville at a Los Angeles restaurant. The pair lived together from 1981 to 1985 but never married. Johnson and D&#x27;Arbanville have a son, Jesse Wayne Johnson (born December 7, 1982).

In her 2000 autobiography &quot;Cybill Disobedience&quot;, Cybill Shepherd wrote of a liaison with Johnson during the making of the television miniseries &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; (1985).

Johnson next had a relationship with Barbra Streisand, lasting into at least September 1988.

Just days after breaking up with Streisand, Johnson, then 38, was linked to 18-year-old Uma Thurman.

Johnson was then briefly involved with &quot;Dead Bang&quot; co-star Penelope Ann Miller before reuniting with Melanie Griffith. They conceived a child close to the start of 1989, Dakota Johnson (born October 4, 1989), and were married again from June of that year until 1996.

In 1996–1997, Johnson dated Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe, who played his daughter on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Johnson was 47 at the time while O&#x27;Keefe was 18.

On April 29, 1999, Johnson married San Francisco socialite and Montessori nursery school teacher Kelley Phleger, former longtime girlfriend of Governor Gavin Newsom, at the Pacific Heights mansion of Ann and Gordon Getty. Actor Robert Wagner served as best man, and Mayor Willie Brown presided over the civil ceremony. Johnson and Phleger have three children together: a daughter, Atherton Grace (born December 28, 1999), and two sons, Jasper Breckinridge (born June 6, 2002), and Deacon (born April 29, 2006).

Johnson was &quot;best friends&quot; with journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote for &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, and his daughter Dakota saw Thompson as a &quot;godfather figure.&quot;

=== Powerboat racing ===
Johnson entered powerboat racing and sometimes raced with Kurt Russell and Chuck Norris. In 1986, Johnson achieved his first motor sport victory. He won a 1,100-mile powerboat race up the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis. Characterized by shipmates as an aggressive, fearless pilot who did not make mistakes, Johnson became American Power Boat Association&#x27;s World Champion of the Offshore World Cup in 1988.

=== Legal matters ===
In November 2002, German customs officers at the SwissGerman border performed a routine search of Johnson&#x27;s car. Bank statements evidencing US$8 billion in transactions were found in the trunk of his car. He was accompanied in his black Mercedes-Benz by three men: an investment adviser, a personal assistant, and a third unknown individual who could not be identified. Initially it was thought Johnson was involved in money laundering, but he was cleared of wrongdoing.

In May 2008, within hours of losing his Woody Creek, Colorado, home to foreclosure, Johnson paid off his $14.5 million debt.

In July 2010, a Los Angeles jury awarded Johnson $23.2 million in a lawsuit against production company Rysher Entertainment, from whom Johnson sought a share of profits commensurate with his ownership of half the copyright of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Rysher announced it would appeal the verdict. In January 2013, Rysher settled the suit with a $19 million payment.

<text>STS-50 (U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-1) was a NASA Space Shuttle mission, the 12th mission of the &quot;Columbia&quot; orbiter. &quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center for the first time ever due to bad weather at Edwards Air Force Base caused by the remnants of Hurricane Darby.

== Crew ==

The astronauts were divided into a red team and a blue team to allow around-the-clock monitoring of experiments.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights==
The U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-1 was a spacelab mission that included experiments in material science, fluid physics and biotechnology. It was the first flight of a Space Shuttle with the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) hardware, which allowed longer flight durations.

The primary payload was the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-1 (USML-1), which made its first flight. It featured a pressurized Spacelab module. USML-1 was the first in a planned series of flights to advance U.S. microgravity research efforts in several disciplines. Experiments conducted were: Crystal Growth Furnace (CGF); Drop Physics Module (DPM); Surface Tension Driven Convection Experiments (STDCE); Zeolite Crystal Growth (ZCG); Protein Crystal Growth (PCG); Glovebox Facility (GBX); Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS); Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (GBA); Astroculture-1 (ASC); Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP); Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE). Secondary experiments were: Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP); Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX-II); and Ultraviolet Plume Instrument (UVPI).

=== Major mission accomplishments ===
* Completed first dedicated United States Microgravity Laboratory-1 flight laying the groundwork for Space Station Freedom science operations.
* Completed 31 microgravity experiments in five basic areas: fluid dynamics, crystal growth, combustion science, biological science, and technology demonstration.
* Introduced several new microgravity experiment facilities for multiple users and multiple flights (including the Crystal Growth Furnace, Drop Physics Module, and the Surface Tension Driven Convection Experiment).
* Demonstrated the efficiency of interactive science operations between crewmembers and scientists on the ground for optimizing science return.
* Completed longest period of protein crystal growth in Space Shuttle program.
* Conducted iterative crystal growing experiments where chemical compositions were altered based upon microscopic observations of growth processes.
* Completed longest Space Shuttle mission (13 days 19 hours 30 minutes) at that time and the first Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) flight of the Space Shuttle program.
* Demonstrated versatility of the new Glovebox Facility (GBX) for crewmember interaction with multiple experiments for maximum science.

The Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; rocketed into orbit for the longest Shuttle flight in history. &quot;Columbia&quot; touched down almost 14 days later, returning with data and specimens amassed from an important suite of microgravity experiments. Shuttle mission STS-50 carried the first United States Microgravity Laboratory-1 (USML-1) to space, conducting long-duration microgravity experiments. Microgravity is a gravitational acceleration that is small when compared to the gravitational attraction at Earth&#x27;s surface. Through the action of free fall (e.g., Space Shuttle orbiting Earth), the local effects of gravity are greatly reduced, thus creating a microgravity environment.

During the extended mission of &quot;Columbia&quot;, scientist crew members working inside the Spacelab long module carried in the payload bay of &quot;Columbia&quot;, conducted more than 30 microgravity investigations and tests. To maximize the scientific return from the mission, experiments took place around the clock. The investigations fell under five basic areas of microgravity science research: fluid dynamics (the study of how liquids and gases respond to the application or absence of differing forces), materials science (the study of materials solidification and crystal growth), combustion science (the study of the processes and phenomena of burning), biotechnology (the study of phenomena related to products derived from living organisms), and technology demonstrations that sought to prove experimental concepts for use in future Shuttle missions and on Space Station Freedom.

Three new major experiment facilities were flown on USML-1: the Crystal Growth Furnace, Surface Tension Driven Convection Experiment apparatus, and Drop Physics Module. An additional piece of new hardware on this flight was the versatile glovebox, which permitted &quot;hands-on&quot; manipulation of small experiments while isolating the crew from the liquids, gases, or solids involved. Some of the USML-1 experiments are described below.

=== Spacelab experiments ===

The Crystal Growth Furnace (CGF) is a reusable facility for investigating crystal growth in microgravity. It is capable of automatically processing up to six large samples at temperatures up to . Additional samples can be processed upon performing manual sample exchange. Two methods of crystal growth, directional solidification and vapor transport, were used on USML-1. By analyzing the composition and the atomic structure of crystals grown without the dominating influence of gravity, scientists will gain insight into correlations between fluid flows during solidification and the defects in a crystal. CGF operated for 286 hours and processed seven samples, three more than scheduled, including two gallium arsenide semiconductor crystals. Gallium arsenide crystals are used in high-speed digital integrated circuits, optoelectronic integrated circuits, and solid-state lasers. Crew members were able to exchange samples using a specially designed flexible glovebox to provide additional experiment operations.

The Surface Tension Driven Convection Experiment (STDCE) was the first space experiment to use state-of-the-art instruments to obtain quantitative data on surface tension-driven flows on the surface of liquids over a wide range of variables in a microgravity environment. Very slight surface temperature differences are sufficient to generate subtle fluid flows on the surface of liquids. Such flows, referred to as &quot;thermocapillary&quot;, exist on fluid surfaces on Earth. However, thermocapillary flows on Earth are very difficult to study because they are often masked by much stronger buoyancy-driven flows. In microgravity, buoyancy-driven flows are greatly reduced, permitting the study of this phenomenon. STDCE provided the first observations of thermocapillary flow in a curved surface fluid and demonstrated that surface tension is a powerful driving force for fluid motion.

The Drop Physics Module (DPM) permitted the study of liquids without the interference of a container. Liquids on Earth take the shape of the container that holds them. Furthermore, the materials that make up the container may chemically contaminate the liquids under study. The DPM uses acoustical (sound) waves to position a drop in the center of a chamber. By studying drops in this manner, scientists have the opportunity to test basic fluid physics theories in the areas of nonlinear dynamics, capillary waves, and surface rheology (changes in the form and flow of matter). Crew members, through manipulation of the sound waves, were able to rotate, oscillate, merge, and even split drops. In another test, the crew members were able to create the first compound drop, a drop within a drop, to investigate a process that could eventually be employed to encapsulate living cells within a semi-permeable membrane for use in medical transplantation treatments.

The Glovebox Facility (GBX) perhaps proved to be the most versatile new space laboratory equipment introduced in the last few years. The glovebox offers crew members the opportunity to manipulate many different kinds of test activities, demonstrations and materials (even toxic, irritating, or potentially infectious ones) without making direct contact with them. The GBX has a viewport (window) into a clean workspace, built-in gloves for the manipulation of samples and equipment, a negative air pressure system, a filter system, and an entry door for passing materials and experiments into and out of the work area. The primary use of the glovebox was to selectively mix protein crystals and monitor their growth. The Glovebox allowed crew members to periodically change compositions to optimize the growth, a first for space. Other tests conducted inside the glovebox included studies on candle flames, fiber pulling, particle dispersion, surface convection in liquids, and liquid/container interfaces. Sixteen tests and demonstrations in all were conducted inside the glovebox. The glovebox also provided crew members the opportunity to perform backup operations on the Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus, which were not planned.

Another of the Spacelab experiments was the Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (GBA), a device for processing biological materials. The GBA processed 132 individual experiments with volumes of several milliliters. The apparatus studied living cells, microorganisms used in ecological waste treatment, and the development of brine shrimp and wasp eggs, and other biomedical test models which are used in cancer research. One sample studied, Liposomes, consist of spherical structures that could be used to encapsulate pharmaceuticals. If this biological product can be formed properly, it could be used to deliver a drug to a specific tissue in the body, such as a tumor.

The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) instrument measured the low-level acceleration (aka microgravity) conditions experienced by the microgravity experiments during the mission. These data are invaluable for the scientists to ascertain whether effects seen in their experimental data are due to external disturbances or not. The SAMS instruments flew on more than twenty Shuttle missions, 3.5 years on &quot;Mir&quot;, and a new version is presently (2006) on the International Space Station.

=== Mid-deck microgravity experiments ===
While most STS-50 experiments were conducted in the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-1 (USML-1), others were operating in &quot;Columbia&quot;″s mid-deck. Included in the mid-deck experiments were studies of Protein Crystal Growth, Astroculture, and Zeolite Crystal Growth.

The Protein Crystal Growth experiment made its fourteenth shuttle flight, but USML-1 represented the first time crew members were able to optimize growth conditions using the glovebox. About 300 samples were seeded from 34 protein types including HIV Reverse Transcriptase Complex (an enzyme that is a chemical key to the replication of AIDS) and Factor D (an important enzyme in human immune systems). About 40% of the proteins flown will be used for X-ray diffraction studies. The increased size and yield can be attributed to the extended crystal growth time provided by this mission. Scientists on the ground will use X-ray crystallography to study each protein&#x27;s three-dimensional structure which, when determined, may aid in controlling each protein&#x27;s activity through rational drug design.

The Astroculture experiment evaluated a water delivery system to be used for supporting the growth of plants in microgravity. Plant growth in space is looked at as a possible method of providing food, oxygen, purified water, and carbon dioxide removal for long-term human habitation in space. Since fluids behave differently in microgravity than they do on Earth, plant watering systems used on Earth do not adapt well to microgravity use.

The Zeolite Crystal Growth experiment processed 38 separate samples which were mixed in the glovebox. Zeolite crystals are used to purify biological fluids, as additives in laundry detergents, and in waste clean-up applications.

=== Extended duration orbiter (EDO) ===
STS-50 not only marked the first U.S. Microgravity Laboratory-1 (USML-1) flight, but also the first Extended Duration Orbiter flight. To prepare for long-term (months) microgravity research aboard Space Station Freedom, scientists and NASA need practical experience in managing progressively longer times for their experiments. The Space Shuttle usually provides a week to ten days of microgravity. Thanks to the Extended Duration Orbiter kit, the Space Shuttle orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; remained in orbit for almost 14 days and future missions with &quot;Columbia&quot; could last as long as a month. The kit consists of extra hydrogen and oxygen tanks for power production, extra nitrogen tanks for the cabin atmosphere, and an improved regeneration system for removing carbon dioxide from the cabin air.

One of the practical aspects of remaining in space longer will be the requirement to maintain crew member health and performance. During STS-50, crew members conducted biological tests as part of the EDO Medical Project. Crew members monitored their blood pressure and heart rate and took samples of the cabin atmosphere during the flight. They also evaluated the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) device as a countermeasure to the normal reduction of body fluids that takes place in space. If the beneficial effects of the LBNP could last for 24 hours, it would improve crew member performance on reentry and landing.

=== Other payloads ===
The STS-50 crew members also operated the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX). Through the experiment, crew members were able to contact amateur radio operators, a Polynesian sailing vessel replica out in the Pacific Ocean, and selected schools around the world. It was arguably the first time that the astronauts received amateur television video from the ham radio club station (W5RRR) at Johnson Space Center (JSC).

The Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) experiment has flown previously on six Shuttle missions. It is used to study the formation of polymer membranes in microgravity with the aim of improving their quality and use as filters in biomedical and industrial processes.

== Mission insignia ==
The mission insignia shows the space shuttle in the typical flying position for microgravity. The USML banner extends from the payload bay, in which the Spacelab module with the text μg—the symbol for microgravity. Both the stars and stripes on the USML letters, as well as the highlighted United States on the Earth below the shuttle, depict the fact that it was an all-American science mission.

== Impacts with debris and micrometeoroids ==
Columbia&#x27;s &quot;stand-up&quot; orbital attitude, although ideal for microgravity experiments, was very far from optimal from the point of view of D&amp;M (Debris and Micrometeoroid) vulnerability. The orbiter received 40 radiation debris impacts, impacts on eight windows, and three impacts on the carbon-carbon wing leading edges.

<doc id="200058" wikidata="Q600363" url="?curid=200058" title="E. 1999 Eternal">
<text>E. 1999 Eternal is the second studio album by American hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, released July 25, 1995, on Ruthless Records. The album was released four months after the death of rapper Eazy-E, the group&#x27;s mentor and the executive producer of the album. Both the album and single &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot; are dedicated to him. Following up on the surprise success of their breakthrough single &quot;Thuggish Ruggish Bone&quot;, it became a popular album and received positive reviews from music critics, earning praise for the group&#x27;s melodic rapping style. The album title is a portmanteau of Cleveland&#x27;s eastside neighborhood centering on East 99th Street and St. Clair Avenue where the group is based and the then-future year 1999.

The album sold 307,000 copies in the first week. &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; became the group&#x27;s best-selling album, with four million copies sold in the United States. It topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for two consecutive weeks. The album was nominated for the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, ultimately losing to Naughty by Nature&#x27;s &quot;Poverty&#x27;s Paradise&quot; at the 1996 Grammy Awards. In 2015, the group toured in support of the 20th anniversary of the album, performing it in its entirety for the first time.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;E.1999 Eternal&quot; sold 307,000 copies in its first week and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums charts. It remained at No. 1 in its second week on both charts, selling 222,000 copies. In its third week, &quot;E.1999 Eternal&quot; dropped to number 2 on the Billboard 200, behind Hootie &amp; the Blowfish&#x27;s &quot;Cracked Rear View&quot;, selling 162,000 copies. The album sold 123,000 copies in its fourth week and got outsold by &quot;The Show: The Soundtrack&quot;, dropping to No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Critical reception==

Upon release, &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; met with critical acclaim. Cheo H. Coker of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the group &quot;has raised the stakes of the gangsta rap game, not only in terms of pure, gritty excess, but also in rhyme-style, cadence and delivery&quot;, concluding: &quot;This is the kind of album that starts out good and gets better with repeated listenings—as the dark, subliminal references clear up. Easily one of the most worthwhile rap purchases of the year.&quot;

Retrospectively, Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; as &quot;an impressive debut full-length that dismisses any notion that the group was merely a one-hit wonder&quot;, adding that it &quot;maintains a consistent tone, one that&#x27;s menacing and somber, produced entirely by DJ U-Neek, a Los Angeles-based producer who frames the songs with dark, smoked-out G-funk beats and synth melodies.&quot; &quot;The Source&quot; hailed &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; as one of The Top 100 Rap Albums of 1990s.

In a second thought review in &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, the album was described as &quot;Lyrically speaking, Bone Thugs have much in common with countless mainstream rap acts. The themes running throughout E.1999 Eternal are familiar—drugs, violent crime and death make regular appearances. It&#x27;s the manner in which the lyrics are framed and delivered that makes the group such a bizarre proposition. Bone Thugs had a melodic flow—frequently delivered in unison—that bordered on singing. They could rap together at a lightning fast pace, without losing their sweetness.&quot; &quot;Stylus&quot; also praised producer DJ U-Neek for his production style on the album stating &quot;The album was entirely produced by DJ U-Neek (although he did collaborate on some tracks), endowing cohesiveness to the unique Bone Thugs sound. U-Neek was, like the vocal group members of Bone Thugs, unorthodox in the rap field. It wouldn&#x27;t be far off to describe him as a songwriter as well as a producer. He was always keen to flesh out interesting sounds—usually based around rumbling piano chords, mellotron and synthesised strings. Yet, the focus was largely on song craft and melody—the album frequently strays into gloomy territory, but never loses its sense of tunefulness. The beats were not particularly striking—usually low-key and sluggish, but the album&#x27;s strengths are not rhythm-related.&quot;

<text>Nick of Time is the tenth studio album by the American singer Bonnie Raitt, released on March 21, 1989. It was Raitt&#x27;s first album released by Capitol Records. A commercial breakthrough after years of personal and professional struggles, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling five million copies, and won three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, which was presented to Raitt and producer Don Was. In 2003, the album was ranked number 229 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, then was re-ranked at number 230 on the 2012 list. As of September 2020, it is ranked at number 492. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
In 1983, Bonnie Raitt was dropped from Warner Bros. Records for not selling enough copies of her two previous albums, &quot;The Glow&quot; (1979) and &quot;Green Light&quot; (1982). This decision came just one day after she had finished recording her upcoming album, titled &quot;Tongue in Groove&quot;. Two years later, Raitt&#x27;s affair with producer Rob Fraboni came to an end, and she was forced to dissolve her backing band as she could no longer afford to pay them. In addition to these personal problems, Warner Bros. announced they would release &quot;Tongue in Groove&quot; in 1986, now titled &quot;Nine Lives&quot;. This upset Raitt, as she now had to promote an album that she no longer had full control over. Raitt began to suffer from depression, and tried to distract herself with excessive eating, drinking, and partying. When asked about this period in her life, Raitt said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t kicking and screaming into dementia, but I did have a complete emotional, physical, and spiritual breakdown.&quot;

After the release of &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, Raitt went on a concert tour. Pop star Prince was a fan of Raitt, and attended her performance at the Beverly Theater in Los Angeles. He later offered her a recording contract on his own label Paisley Park Records. Raitt agreed, and traveled to Minneapolis. Before she recorded any material however, she suffered a skiing accident and was hospitalized for two months. The injury gave her time to reflect on recent life choices. &quot;It seemed that some changes needed to be made. I looked at myself and just felt I wasn&#x27;t being the best version of me as I could. I wasn&#x27;t going to blame anyone other than myself.&quot; Raitt attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, which she credits with giving her a new outlook on life.

Despite her newfound sobriety, Raitt was still in financial trouble. She left Paisley Park Records after the planned collaboration between her and Prince fell through. Without enough money to afford a backing band, Raitt played a series of acoustic gigs to simply keep afloat. It was during this period that Raitt met musician Don Was of the band Was (Not Was). They collaborated on the song &quot;Baby Mine&quot; for the 1988 album &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot;, which featured contemporary interpretations of songs from Disney films. Raitt enjoyed working with Was, and he agreed to produce her upcoming album. The search for a record label proved more difficult, as many labels felt Raitt no longer had commercial viability. Co-manager Danny Golberg said at least fourteen executives passed on Raitt before Tim Devine of Capitol Records took an interest. In 1988, Raitt signed a recording contract with Capitol Records for $150,000.

==Composition==
&quot;Nick of Time&quot; features a smooth and understated rock sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;[Raitt] never rocks too hard, but there is grit to her singing and playing, even when the surfaces are clean and inviting.&quot; There are many genres explored in &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, including blues rock, country, R&amp;B, and pop. When Was was announced as the producer, some listeners wondered if he would instill a funk rock sound into the album, given his reputation with Was (Not Was). Was decided to instead maintain the laid-back blues sound Raitt had developed earlier in her career. According to Raitt: &quot;There&#x27;s less production, less slickness. Basically, it&#x27;s a return to my roots.&quot;

Before Raitt signed with Capitol Records, she and Was had recorded some early demos at Was&#x27; home studio. These early demos focused on music that was stripped down, similar to Raitt&#x27;s acoustic gigs. Was wanted to showcase her musical talents by choosing songs that worked without a backing band. These demos were then properly recorded over the course of a week at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles on preparation for the album&#x27;s release. Because they had already worked on the songs, recording sessions were fairly quick. About two tracks were recorded a day. Engineer Ed Cherney noted how most of the music was recorded live in studio as opposed to recording each instrument individually. This was because Raitt was comfortable jamming with other musicians.

Many of the songs deal with personal issues Raitt was struggling with at the time. For example, Raitt was almost forty years old when &quot;Nick of Time&quot; was released, and the album&#x27;s title track is about coming to terms with middle age. According to biographer Mark Bego, Raitt sought to make an album for the baby boomer generation. &quot;Unlike her past releases, there were no &#x27;you&#x27;ve done me wrong&#x27; songs or tearful laments about love lost. The songs were much more personal&quot; said Bego. &quot;Nick of Time&quot; features two original songs and nine cover songs.

==Release==
&quot;Nick of Time&quot; was released on March 21, 1989. Devine was unable to convince Capitol Records&#x27; marketing team to promote Raitt, and instead had to ask the president of the company to put full-page ads in music magazines. Despite the limited promotion, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; sold very well for the first few months, and quickly became the best selling album of Raitt&#x27;s career. It debuted at number 105 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and slowly climbed the chart until peaking at number 1 on April 6, 1990. The seventeen and a half year stretch between Raitt&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200–&quot;Give It Up&quot; in 1972–and &quot;Nick of Time&quot; broke the record for the longest period of time it took an artist to have a number 1 album. By 2019, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; had sold over five million copies, and helped revitalize Raitt&#x27;s career. When asked why &quot;Nick of Time&quot; sold as well as it did, publicist Joan Myers said: &quot;Bonnie&#x27;s personality and sincerity just won people&#x27;s hearts, in addition to her music. There was nothing ever pretentious about her.&quot;

Bego identifies the music video for &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; as an important factor to the commercial success of &quot;Nick of Time&quot;. With the rise of MTV and VH1 in the 1980s, the music video helped expose Raitt to a younger generation of listeners. In the video, Raitt performs in a bar, and acts flirtateous with a patron played by Dennis Quaid. &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; was one of three singles from &quot;Nick of Time&quot;; the other two were &quot;Love Letter&quot; and &quot;Have a Heart,&quot; the latter of which reached number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Reception==
In 2003, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; was ranked number 229 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was ranked number 230 on the 2012 edition of the list, and number 492 on the 2020 edition. The record was voted number 615 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), and was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2022, the Library of Congress selected &quot;Nick of Time&quot; for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry as a &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; work.

<text>Green Onions is the debut album by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, released on Stax Records in October 1962. It reached number 33 on the pop album chart in the month of its release. The title single was a worldwide hit and has been covered by dozens of artists, including the Blues Brothers and Roy Buchanan (both with Steve Cropper on guitar), as well as The Ventures, Al Kooper, The Shadows, Mongo Santamaría, Deep Purple (Live and studio versions) and Count Basie.

Three previous Stax LPs – two by the Mar-Keys, one by Carla Thomas – had been issued on Atlantic Records. &quot;Green Onions&quot; was the first album released on the Stax label. It was also Stax&#x27;s first charting album, peaking at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album features only instrumental songs and features Steve Cropper playing a Fender Telecaster.

The cover photo was shot by Irving Schild, who would go on to have a 52-year career as &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;&#x27;s primary photographer. The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2012, the album was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, and/or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Stretchin&#x27; Out in Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band is the first album by American funk and soul band Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, an offshoot act of Parliament-Funkadelic led by bassist and vocalist William &quot;Bootsy&quot; Collins. It was released on January 30, 1976, on Warner Bros. Records.

==Recording and release==

The album was recorded around the same time as Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; and Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It To The Stage&quot; at United Sound Systems in Detroit, Michigan. The album was produced by Collins and George Clinton. Collins co-wrote all of the album&#x27;s seven songs (two with Clinton, one with vocalist Leslyn Bailey and four with Clinton and other band members) and did the arrangements (horn arrangements in collaboration with Fred Wesley).

Since its original release, &quot;Stretchin&#x27; Out in Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band&quot; has been reissued and remastered several times. In 2007, the album was licensed through Rhino Records and reissued through the Collectors Choice Music service.

<text>A primary standard in metrology is a standard that is sufficiently accurate such that it is not calibrated by or subordinate to other standards. Primary standards are defined via other quantities like length, mass and time. Primary standards are used to calibrate other standards referred to as working standards. See Hierarchy of Standards.

==In chemistry==
Standards are used in analytical chemistry. Here, a primary standard is typically a reagent which can be weighed easily, and which is so pure that its weight is truly representative of the number of moles of substance contained. Features of a primary standard include:
# High 
# Stability (low reactivity)
# Low hygroscopicity (to minimize weight changes due to humidity)
# High equivalent weight (to minimize weighing errors)
# Long lasting molar solution i.e. concentration remains unchanged for long periods of time
# Non-toxicity
# Ready and cheap availability

(The last two are not as essential as the first four.)

Some examples of primary standards for titration of solutions, based on their high purity, are provided:

*Arsenic trioxide for making sodium arsenite solution for standardisation of sodium periodate solution (until Ph. Eur. 3, Appendix 2001 also for iodine and cerium(IV) sulfate solutions, since Ph. Eur. 4, 2002 standardised by sodium thiosulfate)
*Benzoic acid for standardisation of waterless basic solutions: ethanolic sodium and potassium hydroxide, TBAH, and alkali methanolates in methanol, isopropanol, or DMF
*Potassium bromate (KBrO3) for standardisation of sodium thiosulfate solutions
*Potassium hydrogen phthalate (usually called KHP) for standardisation of aqueous base and perchloric acid in acetic acid solutions
*Sodium carbonate for standardisation of aqueous acids: hydrochloric, sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions (but not acetic acid)
*Sodium chloride for standardisation of silver nitrate solutions
*Sulfanilic acid for standardisation of sodium nitrite solutions
*Zinc powder, after being dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, for standardization of EDTA solutions

Such standards are often used to make standard solutions. These primary standards are used in titration and are essential for determining unknown concentrations or preparing working standards.

<doc id="200071" wikidata="Q1667948" url="?curid=200071" title="Old Harry's Game">
<text>Old Harry&#x27;s Game is a UK radio comedy written, directed and starring Andy Hamilton, who plays the cynical, world-weary Satan. &quot;Old Harry&quot; is one of many names for the devil. The show&#x27;s title is a humorous play on the title of the 1982 TV series &quot;Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;.

Beginning in 1995, four series, of six half-hour episodes each, were aired by 2001, and a two-part Christmas special followed in 2002. A fifth full series was frequently delayed because of a cast member&#x27;s illness, but recording of the four episodes of series five took place in April 2005 (postponed from January). The first episode of that series was broadcast on 20 September 2005 on BBC Radio 4. James Grout (the Professor during the first four series) did not take part. Series 6 (comprising a further six episodes) began on BBC Radio 4 on 27 September 2007, and Series 7 aired on BBC Radio 4 in 2009. Christmas and New Year specials were broadcast on 23 and 30 December 2010 respectively, and a two-part Olympics special on 12 and 19 July 2012.

Apart from series 3 and 4, the episodes were not given official titles.

Andy Hamilton (Satan), James Grout (The Professor), Robert Duncan (Scumspawn), David Swift (God) and Michael Fenton Stevens had all worked together previously, in the UK television comedy series &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; between 1990 and 1998, which had been co-written by Hamilton. Both of the latter were written into the 1998 series by Hamilton when the run of &quot;Donkey&quot; ended that year. The majority of the guest and recurring actors also had roles in &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;, including Jasper Jacob (series one), Philip Pope (recurring), Nick Revell (recurring), Nigel Pegram, Penelope Nice (Deborah Whittingham, before being replaced by Felicity Montagu) and Geoffrey Whitehead (Roland).

A 30-minute animated version was created in 2012, as the pilot for a possible television series, by the UK animation house Flickerpix, but in the event a series was not commissioned.

==Plot==
The series is set mainly in Hell, and the plot usually centres on the relationships and conflicts between Satan, his various minions, and the damned with (occasionally) interventions by God and other denizens of Heaven. Satan himself is identified with the fallen angel in Christianity and portrayed as jaded from millennia in charge of Hell and the expectation that he will continue to be so for eternity. Although he enjoys some aspects of the job, such as the opportunity to play pranks in the world of the living, and devising ironic torments for those damned souls whom he believes deserve it. His greatest wish is to someday be accepted back into Heaven, and he often wistfully recalls his past as an archangel.

The series regularly features famous historical figures and celebrities, most of whom are portrayed as being less likeable than (or at least different from) the version recorded by history. This includes a foul-mouthed and extremely violent Jane Austen, a sexually predatory Florence Nightingale, a less-than-heroic Samson, and a vacuous Helen of Troy (accompanied by her plain-looking friend, Daphne).

This subversive approach was also applied to God (first name Nigel), who makes the occasional appearance, originally played by David Swift, then in series 7 by Timothy West. God is usually portrayed as being quick-tempered and vengeful; in the series he says he created the universe accidentally, when he was messing about with some matter and energy. He put it down to have a sip of his drink and then, kaboom! he had a universe on his hands. Life on Earth was created for a bet, as Earth was dull viewing; God, for a bit of fun, sprinkled some mutating bacteria into the oceans and ran a book with the other Angels to see which one would evolve into a creature that would develop a language first; the Angel Gabriel&#x27;s bacteria were doing very well until they randomly mutated into carrots, and it was one of the Seraphim whose bacteria eventually became Homo sapiens. God seems rather annoyed that things &#x27;got out of hand&#x27;.

The Angels are also portrayed somewhat differently. The Angel who delivered the news that Mary was to give birth to the Messiah was in fact named Graham, while Gabriel is a separate entity who was credited with doing so due to a transcription error early in the making of the Bible. They are also presented as rather arrogant when dealing with Satan, but at the same time behaving as suck-ups around God. They are forbidden to indulge in physical pleasures, but are still tempted by them (which has been used against them).

=== Series 1 to 4 ===
The first four series centred on the philosophical arguments between Satan and the somewhat idealistic main human character known as &quot;The Professor&quot; (played by James Grout). The Professor represents the undeserving damned, being a man of high moral virtue and having been consigned to Hell only on the technicality that he did not believe in God. The character was originally called Professor Richard Whittingham, although in series 2 he is referred to as Professor Richard Hope, when in episodes 5 &amp; 6 Satan gets his book &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; published. Generally, Satan seeks to prove to the Professor that mankind is inherently base or flawed, with the Professor taking the opposing position. Usually Satan travels to the living world to display the more contemptible sides of human nature, such as snipers shooting old ladies in Bosnia or prostitution in Thailand, to a generally horrified Professor. At other times he introduces the Professor to historical personages the Professor holds in high esteem but who are now languishing in Hell, such as Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, showing him how petty and mendacious they really are. However, the Professor&#x27;s idealism is usually shown to have some validity as well, and more often than not he wins the argument although Satan always insists he hasn&#x27;t.

The other main human character is Thomas Quentin Crimp (Jimmy Mulville), an execrable type with no morals, held out by Satan as an example of all that is detestable about humanity and often described (especially by God himself) as the most venal and corrupt human being who ever lived. In the first episode, it transpires that Thomas caused the car crash which landed him and the Professor in Hell. The latter, despite his moral idealism, is consigned to Hell because of his atheism (since, as Satan remarks caustically, God does not have a sense of humour). The fact of the afterlife — which the Professor originally optimistically views as a hallucination - does not change his views. Despite (or perhaps because of) their conflicting attitudes, the Professor and Thomas are billeted together by Satan.

Regular plot elements involve the Professor visiting, or being shown, his beloved wife Deborah as she gets on with her life following his death. His widow&#x27;s eventual marriage to a corrupt Irish jockey and her near-fatal coma were important plot strands in series 3 and 4. Throughout the first four series, the Professor also has an ongoing bet with Satan that he can demonstrate that even Thomas has some decency within him; if he can do so, then Satan will allow Deborah and the Professor to be billeted together should Deborah be sent to Hell when she dies. These plot strands ended when Satan finally arranged for the Professor to be accepted into Heaven a short time after the events of the 2002 Christmas special (an incident not covered in the series).

Other characters featured are Satan&#x27;s minions. Satan&#x27;s personal assistant and most venomous demon, Gary (Steve O&#x27;Donnell), was featured in the first series because Thomas was on his list of tormentees. Thomas later manipulates Gary and convinces him to rebel against Satan, with a distinct lack of success. Gary is mentioned only once in later series and his absence is never explained (although the implication is that he fell from favour due to his rebellion). Scumspawn (Robert Duncan), featured from the second series onwards, takes Gary&#x27;s place, having applied (repeatedly) to become Satan&#x27;s new personal assistant. Although Satan initially refuses, he later relents, and Scumspawn proves a surprisingly effective assistant. His subplots usually involve attempts to become a better demon (with help from Thomas). Much of the humour surrounding Scumspawn derives from his sensitive, caring and highly artistic personality, which is a constant irritant to Satan, who often complains that Scumspawn does not act very much like a demon.

According to Andy Hamilton in an interview broadcast on 5 April 2008, on BBC Radio 7&#x27;s &quot;I Did It My Way&quot;, one episode in series 3 was partially re-recorded due to a tragic confluence of events. In the episode, Satan disrupts Deborah&#x27;s wedding to Irish jockey Rory O&#x27;Donnell by taking the form of BBC reporter Jill Dando and accusing the presiding vicar of being a Satan worshipper (which he actually is). Later in the episode, Satan reveals that Jill Dando never existed at all and was just a disguise that he used to stir up unrest in the realm of the living. After the episode was originally broadcast, the 37-year-old reporter was murdered outside her home, and the episode was partially re-recorded for repeats with Satan manifesting himself instead as a different BBC reporter, Gaby Roslin. (The re-recorded lines are fairly obvious, as they were not performed in front of an audience.) A later episode in the third series referenced Satan&#x27;s &quot;Jill Dando&quot; alter ego, and also had to have some lines re-recorded.

=== Christmas Special 2002 ===
In a double-bill Special, broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002 (&quot;The Roll of the Dice&quot;) and New Year&#x27;s Day 2003 (&quot;Knocking on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;), Hope (Claire Skinner), an extraordinarily beautiful Salvation Army worker and tambourine player, is killed by accident years too early and sent to Hell by mistake. This results in Satan trying to have her brought back to life by taking her to Death. But he only gets as far as meeting the Welsh Death (Dai-the-Death), and contacting the Head Death on his mobile. After Death refuses to bring her back to life (for fear of legal recriminations), as a last resort Satan travels to Heaven (now protected with barbed wire, CCTV and Rottweilers). After talking to Saint Peter (who Satan implies had sex with call girls in Rome as well as stealing the other 100 pieces of silver which had been contracted by Judas Iscariot but went missing), Satan blackmails St Peter into letting Hope into Heaven.

While all this is going on, the Professor has been changed into a buzzing bluebottle and Thomas has been painted like a zebra and is awaiting the &quot;attentions&quot; of some special crocodiles (they have a sense of humour).

=== Series 5 ===
Series Five retains some of the themes from earlier series, but most of the action does not revolve around Satan&#x27;s relationships with his minions and the damned. Instead, the episodes focus on Satan&#x27;s efforts to reduce overcrowding in Hell.

After an unsuccessful appeal to God in Episode One for planning permission to enlarge Hell, expanding Hell&#x27;s demonic workforce or adjusting the entrance requirements, the action divides between Hell and various locations on Earth. The basic plot of the subsequent episodes involves Satan taking on the guise of a leading world figure in order to meet influential people, such as Queen Elizabeth II, whom he tries to convince to lead more of mankind to Heaven by encouraging them to change their ways. However, these efforts are largely unsuccessful, and finally abandoned after Satan successfully takes control of the world&#x27;s media to promote messages of peace, co-operation and so on, only to find that this has no effect and humanity just carries on committing mortal sins regardless.

The subplot of each episode focuses on Scumspawn&#x27;s ineffective attempts to run Hell in Satan&#x27;s absence. This normally involves trying to cope with a strange new arrival in Hell, unionised demons, or overcrowding. He generally enlists Thomas&#x27;s help (as well as that of Vlad the Impaler in one episode, though he has no lines) in trying to find a solution, which usually fails. At the end of the episode, Satan returns and sorts out whatever new problem Scumspawn has managed to create.

The final two episodes of the series feature a new arrival, Roland (Geoffrey Whitehead), a damned soul even more venal and corrupt than Thomas who tries to organise a rebellion of the demons in Hell with Thomas&#x27;s help, with exactly the same degree of success that Gary and Thomas had in Series 1. In the end, after easily dealing with the insurrection, Satan decides he need not worry, as humans will soon be extinct anyway. In order to hasten mankind&#x27;s demise, he turns himself into Jeb Bush and plots to convince Jeb&#x27;s brother George Bush to launch a nuclear strike on the polar icecaps.

=== Series 6 ===
For Series Six, Andy Hamilton returned to the style of the original series, with most of the action taking place in Hell. He introduces a new member of the damned: Edith Cordelia Barrington (Annette Crosbie), an academic and historian who has recently arrived in Hell after having apparently died by suicide due to an apparent overdose of barbiturates while watching &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. She is also Thomas&#x27;s former mother-in-law, and as Edith and Thomas have a mutual hatred of each other, Satan decides they would be perfect dungeon-mates (the series temporarily ignoring the overcrowding issue).

Edith is not pleased with the situation, as Thomas had subjected her daughter to emotional abuse, to divorce, and had tried to obtain custody of her breast implants (on the grounds that he paid for them). She also insists that she did not take her own life, and Satan makes a deal with her: he grudgingly agrees to find out how she really died if she will write a definitive biography of Satan in return for new accommodation.

The basic plot of an episode generally involved Satan trying to find out more about Edith&#x27;s death, while Edith interviewed members of the damned about Satan&#x27;s past. These interviews closely followed the pattern of series 4, in which the Professor had interviewed famous historical personalities in attempting to win a bet with Satan (by showing that mankind was capable of redemption). There were also various sub-plots, including Scumspawn&#x27;s attempts to uncover a &quot;decent&quot; side to Thomas&#x27;s personality, in much the same way as the Professor had tried to in earlier series. Thus were the various aspects of the Professor&#x27;s character re-distributed between Edith and Scumspawn.

Eventually, Satan does discover the true circumstances of Edith&#x27;s death (she had been murdered: but that revelation, as well as the discovery of the murderer&#x27;s identity and the motive for her murder, still does not make her happy). In the final episode, Thomas discovers a fact about his ancestry that makes him even more insufferable.

Following the initial broadcast of Series 6, selected episodes from the first six series were repeated on BBC Radio 7 on 5 April 2008, together with an interview with the show&#x27;s writer and star, Andy Hamilton, in which he discusses the series up to that point, in an edition of Radio 7&#x27;s occasional feature entitled &quot;I Did It My Way&quot;.

=== Series 7 ===
A seventh series aired from 19 February 2009, with recordings taking place at the BBC Radio Theatre in London. The cast was the same as in Series Six.

In the first episode, a dog named Scamp arrives unexpectedly in Hell. Satan attempts to talk to God about both the new arrival and a possible plan to ease the general overcrowding in Hell (involving destroying 75% of the damned), but he can&#x27;t, because God is bored with Satan and indeed with his whole Creation, and has left two rather insufferable angels in charge as &quot;site managers&quot; (who are more interested in admiring their laminated &quot;site manager&quot; badges than in doing anything).

In the second episode, God goes away for some &quot;me time&quot;, leaving the Archangel Gabriel in charge. Unfortunately, Heaven&#x27;s new computer system is having software problems, causing a further unexpected arrival in Hell — a baby — and Satan&#x27;s renewed attempts to get help from God bring him face to face with Gabriel. Meanwhile, Scumspawn decides the baby needs a name and dubs it &quot;Satan Junior&quot;. Taking care of the dog Scamp begins to bring out the best in Thomas, while Satan&#x27;s meeting with Gabriel about the baby brings some slight results.

In the fourth episode Timothy West guest-stars as God (previously played by David Swift), and after being apprised of the situation orders Satan to arrange with Gabriel for both the dog and the baby&#x27;s immediate transfer to Heaven. Since people in both Heaven and Hell remain forever the same age as they were when they died, this would mean the baby would remain a baby and never have a chance to live a full life, a fact that distresses Scumspawn and Edith so much that they convince Satan to disobey God&#x27;s orders and try to return the baby to the world of the living.

The fifth episode sees Satan trying to find adoptive parents for the baby (now called &quot;Patrick&quot;), while Edith has a major crisis of confidence concerning her completed biography of Satan, and the dog Scamp is successfully transferred to Heaven (with one or two minor incidents thanks to Thomas teaching him some unusual tricks). With the aid of some photoshopped pictures, Satan blackmails Gabriel into helping him about baby Patrick.

In the final episode, a very angry God returns to put Satan and Gabriel on trial for not obeying His instructions about what should be done with the baby, but the trial quickly degenerates into chaos (God remarks at one point, &quot;This place is a madhouse!&quot;). Events ultimately resolve into a relatively happy conclusion (that is, for everyone except Thomas and Gabriel).

=== Christmas and New Year Specials 2010 ===

In &quot;Christmas Spirit&quot;, broadcast on 23 December 2010, Satan decides to ban Christmas. During a visitation to the world of Men he disguises himself as various religious figures, including the Pope, in order to more effectively denounce Christmas and then impersonates the new Editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper (the previous Editor somehow got knocked down by a charging five-ton rhino while cycling around Hyde Park Corner) so as to publish made-up headlines undermining Christmas, such as &quot;Mince Pies Cause Cancer&quot; and &quot;Taliban Targets Panto&quot;. However, in Hell the Spirit of Christmas is alive and well thanks to Scumspawn&#x27;s efforts to cheer up Edith.

In &quot;Ring in the New&quot;, broadcast on 30 December 2010, Satan decides he needs a holiday. On Edith&#x27;s advice he heads off to the English Lake District for some New Year solitude, leaving Scumspawn in charge of Hell. But Scumspawn isn&#x27;t sure his leadership skills are up to the task, and a management seminar with Genghis Khan, Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Queen Elizabeth I and football manager Brian Clough proves no help. This is the only episode that ends relatively happily for Thomas.

=== Olympics Special 2012 ===

In mid-2012 the BBC announced a two-part special with an Olympic theme, both parts of which were recorded on 8 July 2012: with Andy Hamilton, Annette Crosbie, Robert Duncan and Jimmy Mulville all returning in their established roles.

The first part was broadcast on 12 July 2012, in which Satan attempts to show Edith that the ancient Greeks and the original Games were not as altruistic as she originally thought, while Thomas&#x27;s participation in the Infernal Games ends up a crushing and painful disaster (thanks to an incident involving a hippo and later a rhinoceros).

The second part was broadcast on 19 July 2012, in which Satan is blackmailed by Edith into taking her to the 2012 London Olympics to see her grand-niece competing, but Satan discovers that the grand-niece isn&#x27;t quite as Edith remembers her. Meanwhile, Thomas tries to get himself certified insane in order to escape from continued punishment and instead be eternally consigned to Hell&#x27;s TV Lounge.

=== Television Pilot 2012 ===

Also in 2012, Andy Hamilton proposed a transfer of the show to television. A pilot episode was made for Sky TV (not for the BBC) by UK animation house Flickerpix, using stop motion animation. Based on scenes from some of the early radio episodes, it featured the voices of the radio cast (with James Grout&#x27;s part recast following his death). The proposed series was not commissioned.

==Cast==
==Episodes==

=== Music ===
The opening and closing themes for each episode are taken from Christopher Young&#x27;s soundtrack for the 1987 horror film &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (&quot;Resurrection&quot;). There are also uses of the cues &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;The Lament Configuration&quot; from the same score. The episodes also make use of &quot;Ave Satani&quot; from Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s 1976 soundtrack to &quot;The Omen&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a polynomial sequence, i.e., a sequence of polynomials indexed by non-negative integers formula_1 in which the index of each polynomial equals its degree, is said to be of binomial type if it satisfies the sequence of identities
:formula_2

Many such sequences exist. The set of all such sequences forms a Lie group under the operation of umbral composition, explained below. Every sequence of binomial type may be expressed in terms of the Bell polynomials. Every sequence of binomial type is a Sheffer sequence (but most Sheffer sequences are not of binomial type). Polynomial sequences put on firm footing the vague 19th century notions of umbral calculus.

==Examples==
* In consequence of this definition the binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the sequence formula_3 is of binomial type.
* The sequence of &quot;lower factorials&quot; is defined byformula_4(In the theory of special functions, this same notation denotes upper factorials, but this present usage is universal among combinatorialists.) The product is understood to be 1 if &quot;n&quot; = 0, since it is in that case an empty product. This polynomial sequence is of binomial type.
* Similarly the &quot;upper factorials&quot;formula_5are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.
* The Abel polynomialsformula_6are a polynomial sequence of binomial type.
* The Touchard polynomialsformula_7where formula_8 is the number of partitions of a set of size formula_9 into formula_10 disjoint non-empty subsets, is a polynomial sequence of binomial type. Eric Temple Bell called these the &quot;exponential polynomials&quot; and that term is also sometimes seen in the literature. The coefficients formula_8 are &quot;Stirling numbers of the second kind&quot;. This sequence has a curious connection with the Poisson distribution: If formula_12 is a random variable with a Poisson distribution with expected value formula_13 then formula_14. In particular, when formula_15, we see that the formula_9th moment of the Poisson distribution with expected value formula_17 is the number of partitions of a set of size formula_9, called the formula_9th Bell number. This fact about the formula_9th moment of that particular Poisson distribution is &quot;Dobinski&#x27;s formula&quot;.

==Characterization by delta operators==
It can be shown that a polynomial sequence { &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(x) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, … } is of binomial type if and only if all three of the following conditions hold:

* The linear transformation on the space of polynomials in &quot;x&quot; that is characterized byformula_21is shift-equivariant, and
* &quot;p&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 for all &quot;x&quot;, and
* &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(0) = 0 for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0.

(The statement that this operator is shift-equivariant is the same as saying that the polynomial sequence is a Sheffer sequence; the set of sequences of binomial type is properly included within the set of Sheffer sequences.)

===Delta operators===
That linear transformation is clearly a delta operator, i.e., a shift-equivariant linear transformation on the space of polynomials in &quot;x&quot; that reduces degrees of polynomials by 1. The most obvious examples of delta operators are difference operators and differentiation. It can be shown that every delta operator can be written as a power series of the form
:formula_22
where &quot;D&quot; is differentiation (note that the lower bound of summation is 1). Each delta operator &quot;Q&quot; has a unique sequence of &quot;basic polynomials&quot;, i.e., a polynomial sequence satisfying
#formula_23
#formula_24
#formula_25
It was shown in 1973 by Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko, that a polynomial sequence is of binomial type if and only if it is the sequence of basic polynomials of some delta operator. Therefore, this paragraph amounts to a recipe for generating as many polynomial sequences of binomial type as one may wish.

==Characterization by Bell polynomials==
For any sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, … of scalars, let

:formula_26

where &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;+1) is the Bell polynomial. Then this polynomial sequence is of binomial type. Note that for each &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1,

:formula_27

Here is the main result of this section:

Theorem: All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.

A result in Mullin and Rota, repeated in Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko (see &quot;References&quot; below) states that every polynomial sequence { &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) }&quot;n&quot; of binomial type is determined by the sequence { &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;′(0) }&quot;n&quot;, but those sources do not mention Bell polynomials.

This sequence of scalars is also related to the delta operator. Let

:formula_28

Then

:formula_29

where formula_30, is the delta operator of this sequence.

==Characterization by a convolution identity==
For sequences &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, …, define a sort of convolution by

:formula_31

Let formula_32 be the &quot;n&quot;th term of the sequence

:formula_33

Then for any sequence &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., with &quot;a&quot;0 = 0, the sequence defined by &quot;p&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 and

:formula_34

for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1, is of binomial type, and every sequence of binomial type is of this form.

==Characterization by generating functions==
Polynomial sequences of binomial type are precisely those whose generating functions are formal (not necessarily convergent) power series of the form

:formula_35

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a formal power series whose constant term is zero and whose first-degree term is not zero. It can be shown by the use of the power-series version of Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula that

:formula_36

The delta operator of the sequence is the compositional inverse formula_37, so that

:formula_38

===A way to think about these generating functions===
The coefficients in the product of two formal power series

:formula_39

and

:formula_40

are

:formula_41

(see also Cauchy product). If we think of &quot;x&quot; as a parameter indexing a family of such power series, then the binomial identity says in effect that the power series indexed by &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is the product of those indexed by &quot;x&quot; and by &quot;y&quot;. Thus the &quot;x&quot; is the argument to a function that maps sums to products: an exponential function

:formula_42

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) has the form given above.

==Umbral composition of polynomial sequences==
The set of all polynomial sequences of binomial type is a group in which the group operation is &quot;umbral composition&quot; of polynomial sequences. That operation is defined as follows. Suppose { &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } and { &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) : &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } are polynomial sequences, and

:formula_43

Then the umbral composition &quot;p&quot; o &quot;q&quot; is the polynomial sequence whose &quot;n&quot;th term is

:formula_44

(the subscript &quot;n&quot; appears in &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;, since this is the &quot;n&quot; term of that sequence, but not in &quot;q&quot;, since this refers to the sequence as a whole rather than one of its terms).

With the delta operator defined by a power series in &quot;D&quot; as above, the natural bijection between delta operators and polynomial sequences of binomial type, also defined above, is a group isomorphism, in which the group operation on power series is formal composition of formal power series.

==Cumulants and moments==
The sequence κ&quot;n&quot; of coefficients of the first-degree terms in a polynomial sequence of binomial type may be termed the cumulants of the polynomial sequence. It can be shown that the whole polynomial sequence of binomial type is determined by its cumulants, in a way discussed in the article titled &quot;cumulant&quot;. Thus

:formula_45 the &quot;n&quot;th cumulant

and

:formula_46 the &quot;n&quot;th moment.

These are &quot;formal&quot; cumulants and &quot;formal&quot; moments, as opposed to cumulants of a probability distribution and moments of a probability distribution.

Let

:formula_47

be the (formal) cumulant-generating function. Then

:formula_48

is the delta operator associated with the polynomial sequence, i.e., we have

:formula_49

==Applications==
The concept of binomial type has applications in combinatorics, probability, statistics, and a variety of other fields.

<text>Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers: How Agriculture Really Began is a book on prehistoric agriculture and anthropology by the British science writer Colin Tudge. 

The book is one of a series of long essays by respected contemporary Darwinian thinkers, which were published under the collective title &quot;Darwinism Today&quot;. The series was inspired by a course of &#x27;Darwin Seminars&#x27; which took place at the London School of Economics−LSE in London in the late 1990s. 

In &quot;Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers&quot;, Tudge offers an explanation for the beginning of the population explosion and that farming was not suddenly invented 10,000 years ago, but had existed as what he called proto-farming or hobby farming for at least 30,000 years earlier. What happened 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent was the raising of sea level at the end of the last ice age over a relatively short period of time. This forced a population who were primarily hunter-gatherers to leave a rich prey region and to move inland. The new area was less able to support these immigrants as hunter-gatherers, and they were forced to increase their labors to extend their use of farming in order to maintain their population. 

Tudge explains what happened next:
:&quot;Hunter gatherers take from their environment only what their environment happens to produce; and if they take too much, the desirable prey species collapse. [...] But the whole point of agriculture is to manipulate the environment so as to increase the amount of food that it will provide. [...] And if you increase the food supply, you can increase your own population. But then, of course, the farmers find themselves in a vicious spiral. The more they farm, the more their population rises and the more they are obliged to farm, because only by farming can they feed the extra mouths.&quot;

<text>The Kionga Triangle (, ) was a small region of German East Africa situated at the mouth of the Ruvuma River. The Ruvuma served as the border between the German colony and Portuguese Mozambique, and the Kionga Triangle was the only section of German East Africa south of the river. Its principal settlement was Kionga (now ) which had a population of 4,000 in 1910. It became a German possession in 1894 but came under Portuguese control in April 1916 during World War I. The post-war Treaty of Versailles reaffirmed that the river was the border between Tanganyika, then under British control, and Portuguese Mozambique. The triangle was the only territory that the treaty awarded to Portugal.

Today, the former Kionga Triangle forms part of Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique.

<doc id="200085" wikidata="Q23718" url="?curid=200085" title="Cardinal direction">
<text>The four cardinal directions, or cardinal points, are the four main compass directions: north, south, east, and west, commonly denoted by their initials N, S, E, and W respectively. Relative to north, the directions east, south, and west are at 90 degree intervals in the clockwise direction.

The ordinal directions (also called the intercardinal directions) are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). The intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary intercardinal direction. These eight shortest points in the compass rose shown to the right are:

# West-northwest (WNW)
# North-northwest (NNW)
# North-northeast (NNE)
# East-northeast (ENE)
# East-southeast (ESE)
# South-southeast (SSE)
# South-southwest (SSW)
# West-southwest (WSW)

Points between the cardinal directions form the points of the compass. Arbitrary horizontal directions may be indicated by their azimuth angle value.

==Determination==
==Additional points==
===Azimuth=== 

The directional names are routinely associated with &quot;azimuths&quot;, the angle of rotation (in degrees) in the unit circle over the horizontal plane. It is a necessary step for navigational calculations (derived from trigonometry) and for use with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. The four cardinal directions correspond to the following degrees of a compass:
* North (N): 0° = 360°
* East (E): 90°
* South (S): 180°
* West (W): 270°

===Intercardinal directions===
The intercardinal (intermediate, or, historically, ordinal) directions are the four intermediate compass directions located halfway between each pair of cardinal directions.
* Northeast (NE), 45°, halfway between north and east, is the opposite of southwest.
* Southeast (SE), 135°, halfway between south and east, is the opposite of northwest.
* Southwest (SW), 225°, halfway between south and west, is the opposite of northeast.
* Northwest (NW), 315°, halfway between north and west, is the opposite of southeast.

These eight directional names have been further compounded known as tertiary intercardinal directions, resulting in a total of 32 named points evenly spaced around the compass: north (N), north by east (NbE), north-northeast (NNE), northeast by north (NEbN), northeast (NE), northeast by east (NEbE), east-northeast (ENE), east by north (EbN), east (E), etc.

==Beyond geography==
&quot;Cardinal directions&quot; or &quot;cardinal points&quot; may sometimes be extended to include vertical position (elevation, altitude, depth): north and south, east and west, up and down; or mathematically the six directions of the x-, y-, and z-axes in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. Topographic maps include elevation, typically via contour lines.
Alternatively, elevation angle may be combined with cardinal direction (or, more generally, arbitrary azimuth angle) to form a local spherical coordinate system.

===In astronomy===
In astronomy, the &quot;cardinal points&quot; of an astronomical body as seen in the sky are four points defined by the directions toward which the celestial poles lie relative to the center of the disk of the object in the sky.
A line (a great circle on the celestial sphere) from the center of the disk to the North celestial pole will intersect the edge of the body (the &quot;&quot;) at the North point. The North point will then be the point on the limb that is closest to the North celestial pole. Similarly, a line from the center to the South celestial pole will define the South point by its intersection with the limb. The points at right angles to the North and South points are the East and West points. Going around the disk clockwise from the North point, one encounters in order the West point, the South point, and then the East point. This is opposite to the order on a terrestrial map because one is looking up instead of down.

Similarly, when describing the location of one astronomical object relative to another, &quot;north&quot; means closer to the North celestial pole, &quot;east&quot; means at a higher right ascension, &quot;south&quot; means closer to the South celestial pole, and &quot;west&quot; means at a lower right ascension. If one is looking at two stars that are below the North Star, for example, the one that is &quot;east&quot; will actually be further to the left.

==Germanic origin of names==
During the Migration Period, the Germanic names for the cardinal directions entered the Romance languages, where they replaced the Latin names &quot;borealis&quot; (or &quot;septentrionalis&quot;) with north, &quot;australis&quot; (or &quot;meridionalis&quot;) with south, &quot;occidentalis&quot; with west and &quot;orientalis&quot; with east. It is possible that some northern people used the Germanic names for the intermediate directions. Medieval Scandinavian orientation would thus have involved a 45 degree rotation of cardinal directions.
*&quot;north&quot; (Proto-Germanic &quot;*norþ-&quot;) from the proto-Indo-European *&quot;nórto-s&quot; &#x27;submerged&#x27; from the root *&quot;ner-&quot; &#x27;left, below, to the left of the rising sun&#x27; whence comes the Ancient Greek name &quot;Nereus&quot;.
*&quot;east&quot; (&quot;*aus-t-&quot;) from the word for dawn. The proto-Indo-European form is *&quot;austo-s&quot; from the root *&quot;aues&quot;- &#x27;shine (red)&#x27;. See &quot;Ēostre&quot;.
*&quot;south&quot; (&quot;*sunþ-&quot;), derived from proto-Indo-European *&quot;sú-n-to-s&quot; from the root *&quot;seu&quot;- &#x27;seethe, boil&#x27;. Cognate with this root is the word &quot;Sun&quot;, thus &quot;the region of the Sun&quot;.
*&quot;west&quot; (&quot;*wes-t-&quot;) from a word for &quot;evening&quot;. The proto-Indo-European form is *&quot;uestos&quot; from the root *ues- &#x27;shine (red)&#x27;, itself a form of *&quot;aues&quot;-. Cognate with the root are the Latin words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; and the Ancient Greek &quot;Hestia&quot;, &quot;Hesperus&quot; and &quot;Hesperides&quot;.

==Cultural variations==
In many regions of the world, prevalent winds change direction seasonally, and consequently many cultures associate specific named winds with cardinal and intercardinal directions. For example, classical Greek culture characterized these winds as Anemoi.

In pre-modern Europe more generally, between eight and 32 points of the compass – cardinal and intercardinal directions – were given names. These often corresponded to the directional winds of the Mediterranean Sea (for example, southeast was linked to the &quot;Sirocco&quot;, a wind from the Sahara).

Particular colors are associated in some traditions with the cardinal points. These are typically &quot;natural colors&quot; of human perception rather than optical primary colors.

Many cultures, especially in Asia, include the center as a fifth cardinal point.

===Northern Eurasia===
Central Asian, Eastern European and North East Asian cultures frequently have traditions associating colors with four or five cardinal points.

Systems with five cardinal points (four directions and the center) include those from pre-modern China, as well as traditional Turkic, Tibetan and Ainu cultures. In Chinese tradition, the five cardinal point system is related to I Ching, the Wu Xing and the five naked-eye planets. In traditional Chinese astrology, the zodiacal belt is divided into the four constellation groups corresponding to the directions.

Each direction is often identified with a color, and (at least in China) with a mythological creature of that color. Geographical or ethnic terms may contain the name of the color instead of the name of the corresponding direction.

=== Arabic world ===
Countries where Arabic is used refer to the cardinal directions as &quot;Ash Shamal&quot; (N), &quot;Al Gharb&quot; (W), &quot;Ash Sharq&quot; (E) and &quot;Al Janoob&quot; (S). Additionally, &quot;Al Wusta&quot; is used for the center. All five are used for geographic subdivision names (&quot;wilayahs&quot;, states, regions, governorates, provinces, districts or even towns), and some are the origin of some Southern Iberian place names (such as Algarve, Portugal and Axarquía, Spain).

===North America===

In Mesoamerica and North America, a number of traditional indigenous cosmologies include four cardinal directions and a center. Some may also include &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; as directions, and therefore focus on a cosmology of seven directions. For example, among the Hopi of the Southwestern United States, the four named cardinal directions are not North, South, East and West but are the four directions associated with the places of sunrise and sunset at the winter and summer solstices. Each direction may be associated with a color, which can vary widely between nations, but which is usually one of the basic colors found in nature and natural pigments, such as black, red, white, and yellow, with occasional appearances of blue, green, or other hues. There can be great variety in color symbolism, even among cultures that are close neighbors geographically.

===India===
Ten Hindu deities, known as the &quot;Dikpālas&quot;, have been recognized in classical Indian scriptures, symbolizing the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions with the additional directions of up and down. Each of the ten directions has its own name in Sanskrit.

===Indigenous Australia===
Some indigenous Australians have cardinal directions deeply embedded in their culture. For example, the Warlpiri people have a cultural philosophy deeply connected to the four cardinal directions and the Guugu Yimithirr people use cardinal directions rather than relative direction even when indicating the position of an object close to their body. (For more information, see: Cultures without relative directions.)

The precise direction of the cardinal points appears to be important in Aboriginal stone arrangements.

Many aboriginal languages contain words for the usual four cardinal directions, but some contain words for 5 or even 6 cardinal directions.

==Unique (non-compound) names of intercardinal directions==

In some languages, such as Estonian, Finnish and Breton, the intercardinal directions have names that are not compounds of the names of the cardinal directions (as, for instance, &quot;northeast&quot; is compounded from &quot;north&quot; and &quot;east&quot;). In Estonian, those are &quot;kirre&quot; (northeast), &quot;kagu&quot; (southeast), &quot;edel&quot; (southwest), and &quot;loe&quot; (northwest), in Finnish &quot;koillinen&quot; (northeast), &quot;kaakko&quot; (southeast), &quot;lounas&quot; (southwest), and &quot;luode&quot; (northwest). In Japanese, there is the interesting situation that native Japanese words (yamato kotoba, kun readings of kanji) are used for the cardinal directions (such as &quot;minami&quot; for 南, south), but borrowed Chinese words (on readings of kanji) are used for intercardinal directions (such as &quot;tō-nan&quot; for 東南, southeast, lit. &quot;east-south&quot;). In the Malay language, adding &quot;laut&quot; (sea) to either east (&quot;timur&quot;) or west (&quot;barat&quot;) results in northeast or northwest, respectively, whereas adding &quot;daya&quot; to west (giving &quot;barat daya&quot;) results in southwest. Southeast has a special word: &quot;tenggara&quot;.

Sanskrit and other Indian languages that borrow from it use the names of the gods associated with each direction: east (Indra), southeast (Agni), south (Yama/Dharma), southwest (Nirrti), west (Varuna), northwest (Vayu), north (Kubera/Heaven) and northeast (Ishana/Shiva). North is associated with the Himalayas and heaven while the south is associated with the underworld or land of the fathers (Pitr loka). The directions are named by adding &quot;disha&quot; to the names of each god or entity: e.g. Indradisha (direction of Indra) or Pitrdisha (direction of the forefathers i.e. south).

The cardinal directions of the Hopi language and the Tewa dialect spoken by the Hopi-Tewa are related to the places of sunrise and sunset at the solstices, and correspond approximately to the European intercardinal directions.

==Non-compass directional systems==
Use of the compass directions is common and deeply embedded in European and Chinese culture (see south-pointing chariot). Some other cultures make greater use of other referents, such as toward the sea or toward the mountains (Hawaii, Bali), or upstream and downstream (most notably in ancient Egypt, also in the Yurok and Karuk languages). Lengo (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands) has four non-compass directions: landward, seaward, upcoast, and downcoast.

Some languages lack words for body-relative directions such as left/right, and use geographical directions instead.

<doc id="200088" wikidata="Q368743" url="?curid=200088" title="Five pence (British coin)">
<text>The British decimal five pence coin (often shortened to 5p in writing and speech) is a denomination of sterling coinage worth of a pound. Its obverse has featured the profile of the British monarch since the coin’s introduction on 23 April 1968, replacing the shilling in preparation for decimalisation in 1971. It remained the same size as the one shilling coin, which also remained legal tender, until a smaller version was introduced in June 1990 with the older coins being withdrawn on 31 December 1990. 

five pence coins are legal tender up to the sum of £5 when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

The five pence coin was originally minted from cupro-nickel (75% Cu, 25% Ni), but since 2011 it has been minted in nickel-plated steel due to the increasing price of metal. From January 2013, the Royal Mint began a programme to gradually remove the previous cupro-nickel coins from circulation, replacing them with nickel-plated steel versions.

In March 2014, an estimated 3,847 million 5p coins were in circulation with an estimated face value of £192.370 million.

== Design ==
The original reverse of the coin, designed by Christopher Ironside, and used from 1968 to 2008, is a crowned thistle (formally, &quot;The Badge of Scotland, a thistle royally crowned&quot;), with the numeral &quot;5&quot; below the thistle, and either (1968–1981) or (1982–2008) above the thistle.

To date, three different obverses have been used. In all cases, the inscription is , where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. In the original design, both sides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as beading.

As with all new decimal currency, until 1984 the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wears the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.

Between 1985 and 1997, the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem.

On 27 June 1990 a reduced-size version of the five pence coin was introduced. The older larger coins were withdrawn on 31 December 1990. The design remained unchanged.

From 1998 to 2015, the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait.

In June 2015, coins bearing the portrait by Jody Clark were introduced into circulation.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The 5p coin depicts the centre of the Royal shield, showing the meeting point of the four quarters. The coin&#x27;s obverse remains largely unchanged, but the beading (the ring of dots around the coin&#x27;s circumference), which no longer features on the coin&#x27;s reverse, has also been removed from the obverse.

In October 2023 the King Charles III five-pence coin, featuring an oak leaf with acorns, was presented.

==Mintages==

Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;0&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.

<text>In number theory, an integer &quot;q&quot; is a quadratic residue modulo &quot;n&quot; if it is congruent to a perfect square modulo &quot;n&quot;; that is, if there exists an integer &quot;x&quot; such that

:formula_1

Otherwise, &quot;q&quot; is a quadratic nonresidue modulo &quot;n&quot;.

Quadratic residues are used in applications ranging from acoustical engineering to cryptography and the factoring of large numbers.

==History, conventions, and elementary facts==
Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and other number theorists of the 17th and 18th centuries established theorems and formed conjectures about quadratic residues, but the first systematic treatment is § IV of Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1801). Article 95 introduces the terminology &quot;quadratic residue&quot; and &quot;quadratic nonresidue&quot;, and says that if the context makes it clear, the adjective &quot;quadratic&quot; may be dropped.

For a given &quot;n&quot;, a list of the quadratic residues modulo &quot;n&quot; may be obtained by simply squaring all the numbers 0, 1, ..., . Since &quot;a&quot;≡&quot;b&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;) implies &quot;a&quot;2≡&quot;b&quot;2 (mod &quot;n&quot;), any other quadratic residue is congruent (mod &quot;n&quot;) to some in the obtained list. But the obtained list is not composed of mutually incongruent quadratic residues (mod n) only. Since &quot;a&quot;2≡(&quot;n&quot;−&quot;a&quot;)2 (mod &quot;n&quot;), the list obtained by squaring all numbers in the list 1, 2, ..., (or in the list 0, 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;) is symmetric (mod &quot;n&quot;) around its midpoint, hence it is actually only needed to square all the numbers in the list 0, 1, ..., formula_2 &quot;n&quot;/2 formula_3. The list so obtained may still contain mutually congruent numbers (mod &quot;n&quot;). Thus, the number of mutually noncongruent quadratic residues modulo &quot;n&quot; cannot exceed &quot;n&quot;/2 + 1 (&quot;n&quot; even) or (&quot;n&quot; + 1)/2 (&quot;n&quot; odd).

The product of two residues is always a residue.

===Prime modulus===

Modulo 2, every integer is a quadratic residue.

Modulo an odd prime number &quot;p&quot; there are (&quot;p&quot; + 1)/2 residues (including 0) and (&quot;p&quot; − 1)/2 nonresidues, by Euler&#x27;s criterion. In this case, it is customary to consider 0 as a special case and work within the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the field formula_4. In other words, every congruence class except zero modulo &quot;p&quot; has a multiplicative inverse. This is not true for composite moduli.

Following this convention, the multiplicative inverse of a residue is a residue, and the inverse of a nonresidue is a nonresidue.

Following this convention, modulo an odd prime number there is an equal number of residues and nonresidues.

Modulo a prime, the product of two nonresidues is a residue and the product of a nonresidue and a (nonzero) residue is a nonresidue.

The first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity is that if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) then −1 is a quadratic residue modulo &quot;p&quot;, and if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4) then −1 is a nonresidue modulo &quot;p&quot;. This implies the following:

If &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) the negative of a residue modulo &quot;p&quot; is a residue and the negative of a nonresidue is a nonresidue.

If &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4) the negative of a residue modulo &quot;p&quot; is a nonresidue and the negative of a nonresidue is a residue.

===Prime power modulus===
All odd squares are ≡ 1 (mod 8) and thus also ≡ 1 (mod 4). If &quot;a&quot; is an odd number and &quot;m&quot; = 8, 16, or some higher power of 2, then &quot;a&quot; is a residue modulo &quot;m&quot; if and only if &quot;a&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 8).

For example, mod (32) the odd squares are
:12 ≡ 152 ≡ 1
:32 ≡ 132 ≡ 9
:52 ≡ 112 ≡ 25
:72 ≡ 92 ≡ 49 ≡ 17

and the even ones are
:02 ≡ 82 ≡ 162 ≡ 0
:22 ≡ 62≡ 102 ≡ 142≡ 4
:42 ≡ 122 ≡ 16.

So a nonzero number is a residue mod 8, 16, etc., if and only if it is of the form 4&quot;k&quot;(8&quot;n&quot; + 1).

A number &quot;a&quot; relatively prime to an odd prime &quot;p&quot; is a residue modulo any power of &quot;p&quot; if and only if it is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot;.

If the modulus is &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;,
:then &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;a&quot;
::is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; if &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;
::is a nonresidue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; if &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; is odd
::is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; if &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; is even and &quot;a&quot; is a residue
::is a nonresidue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; if &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; is even and &quot;a&quot; is a nonresidue.

Notice that the rules are different for powers of two and powers of odd primes.

Modulo an odd prime power &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, the products of residues and nonresidues relatively prime to &quot;p&quot; obey the same rules as they do mod &quot;p&quot;; &quot;p&quot; is a nonresidue, and in general all the residues and nonresidues obey the same rules, except that the products will be zero if the power of &quot;p&quot; in the product ≥ &quot;n&quot;.

Modulo 8, the product of the nonresidues 3 and 5 is the nonresidue 7, and likewise for permutations of 3, 5 and 7. In fact, the multiplicative group of the non-residues and 1 form the Klein four-group.

===Composite modulus not a prime power===

The basic fact in this case is
:if &quot;a&quot; is a residue modulo &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;every&quot; prime power dividing &quot;n&quot;.
:if &quot;a&quot; is a nonresidue modulo &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; is a nonresidue modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;at least one&quot; prime power dividing &quot;n&quot;.

Modulo a composite number, the product of two residues is a residue. The product of a residue and a nonresidue may be a residue, a nonresidue, or zero.
For example, from the table for modulus 6   
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (residues in bold).

The product of the residue 3 and the nonresidue 5 is the residue 3, whereas the product of the residue 4 and the nonresidue 2 is the nonresidue 2.

Also, the product of two nonresidues may be either a residue, a nonresidue, or zero.
For example, from the table for modulus 15   
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (residues in bold).

The product of the nonresidues 2 and 8 is the residue 1, whereas the product of the nonresidues 2 and 7 is the nonresidue 14.

This phenomenon can best be described using the vocabulary of abstract algebra. The congruence classes relatively prime to the modulus are a group under multiplication, called the group of units of the ring formula_5, and the squares are a subgroup of it. Different nonresidues may belong to different cosets, and there is no simple rule that predicts which one their product will be in. Modulo a prime, there is only the subgroup of squares and a single coset.

The fact that, e.g., modulo 15 the product of the nonresidues 3 and 5, or of the nonresidue 5 and the residue 9, or the two residues 9 and 10 are all zero comes from working in the full ring formula_5, which has zero divisors for composite &quot;n&quot;.

For this reason some authors add to the definition that a quadratic residue &quot;a&quot; must not only be a square but must also be relatively prime to the modulus &quot;n&quot;. (&quot;a&quot; is coprime to &quot;n&quot; if and only if &quot;a&quot;2 is coprime to &quot;n&quot;.)

Although it makes things tidier, this article does not insist that residues must be coprime to the modulus.

==Notations==

Gauss used and to denote residuosity and non-residuosity, respectively;
:for example, and , or and .

Although this notation is compact and convenient for some purposes, a more useful notation is the Legendre symbol, also called the quadratic character, which is defined for all integers and positive odd prime numbers as
:formula_7

There are two reasons why numbers ≡ 0 (mod ) are treated specially. As we have seen, it makes many formulas and theorems easier to state. The other (related) reason is that the quadratic character is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of nonzero congruence classes modulo to the complex numbers under multiplication. Setting formula_8 allows its domain to be extended to the multiplicative semigroup of all the integers.

One advantage of this notation over Gauss&#x27;s is that the Legendre symbol is a function that can be used in formulas. It can also easily be generalized to cubic, quartic and higher power residues.

There is a generalization of the Legendre symbol for composite values of , the Jacobi symbol, but its properties are not as simple: if is composite and the Jacobi symbol formula_9 then , and if then formula_10 but if formula_11 we do not know whether or . For example: formula_12 and formula_13, but and . If is prime, the Jacobi and Legendre symbols agree.

==Distribution of quadratic residues==

Although quadratic residues appear to occur in a rather random pattern modulo &quot;n&quot;, and this has been exploited in such applications as acoustics and cryptography, their distribution also exhibits some striking regularities.

Using Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) it is easy to see that for any &quot;M&quot; &gt; 0 there are primes &quot;p&quot; such that the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;M&quot; are all residues modulo &quot;p&quot;.
For example, if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 8), (mod 12), (mod 5) and (mod 28), then by the law of quadratic reciprocity 2, 3, 5, and 7 will all be residues modulo &quot;p&quot;, and thus all numbers 1–10 will be. The CRT says that this is the same as &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 840), and Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem says there are an infinite number of primes of this form. 2521 is the smallest, and indeed 12 ≡ 1, 10462 ≡ 2, 1232 ≡ 3, 22 ≡ 4, 6432 ≡ 5, 872 ≡ 6, 6682 ≡ 7, 4292 ≡ 8, 32 ≡ 9, and 5292 ≡ 10 (mod 2521).

===Dirichlet&#x27;s formulas===

The first of these regularities stems from Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s work (in the 1830s) on the analytic formula for the class number of binary quadratic forms. Let &quot;q&quot; be a prime number, &quot;s&quot; a complex variable, and define a Dirichlet L-function as
:formula_14

Dirichlet showed that if &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), then
:formula_15

Therefore, in this case (prime &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4)), the sum of the quadratic residues minus the sum of the nonresidues in the range 1, 2, ..., &quot;q&quot; − 1 is a negative number.

For example, modulo 11,

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (residues in bold)

:1 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 3 = 22, 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 = 33, and the difference is −11. 

In fact the difference will always be an odd multiple of &quot;q&quot; if &quot;q&quot; &gt; 3. In contrast, for prime &quot;q&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4), the sum of the quadratic residues minus the sum of the nonresidues in the range 1, 2, ..., &quot;q&quot; − 1 is zero, implying that both sums equal formula_16.

Dirichlet also proved that for prime &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4),
:formula_17
This implies that there are more quadratic residues than nonresidues among the numbers 1, 2, ..., (&quot;q&quot; − 1)/2.

For example, modulo 11 there are four residues less than 6 (namely 1, 3, 4, and 5), but only one nonresidue (2).

An intriguing fact about these two theorems is that all known proofs rely on analysis; no-one has ever published a simple or direct proof of either statement.

===Law of quadratic reciprocity===

If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are odd primes, then:

((&quot;p&quot; is a quadratic residue mod &quot;q&quot;) if and only if (&quot;q&quot; is a quadratic residue mod &quot;p&quot;)) if and only if (at least one of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; is congruent to 1 mod 4).

That is:

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the Legendre symbol.

Thus, for numbers &quot;a&quot; and odd primes &quot;p&quot; that don&#x27;t divide &quot;a&quot;:

===Pairs of residues and nonresidues===

Modulo a prime &quot;p&quot;, the number of pairs &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + 1 where &quot;n&quot; R &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; + 1 R &quot;p&quot;, or &quot;n&quot; N &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n&quot; + 1 R &quot;p&quot;, etc., are almost equal. More precisely, let &quot;p&quot; be an odd prime. For &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; = 0, 1 define the sets
:formula_20
and let
:formula_21

That is,
:α00 is the number of residues that are followed by a residue,
:α01 is the number of residues that are followed by a nonresidue,
:α10 is the number of nonresidues that are followed by a residue, and
:α11 is the number of nonresidues that are followed by a nonresidue.

Then if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4)

:formula_22

and if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4)

:formula_23

For example: (residues in bold)

Modulo 17
:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
::&quot;A&quot;00 = {1,8,15},
::&quot;A&quot;01 = {2,4,9,13},
::&quot;A&quot;10 = {3,7,12,14},
::&quot;A&quot;11 = {5,6,10,11}.

Modulo 19
:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
::&quot;A&quot;00 = {4,5,6,16},
::&quot;A&quot;01 = {1,7,9,11,17},
::&quot;A&quot;10 = {3,8,10,15},
::&quot;A&quot;11 = {2,12,13,14}. 

Gauss (1828) introduced this sort of counting when he proved that if &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) then &quot;x&quot;4 ≡ 2 (mod &quot;p&quot;) can be solved if and only if &quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2 + 64 &quot;b&quot;2.

===The Pólya–Vinogradov inequality===

The values of formula_24 for consecutive values of &quot;a&quot; mimic a random variable like a coin flip. Specifically, Pólya and Vinogradov proved (independently) in 1918 that for any nonprincipal Dirichlet character χ(&quot;n&quot;) modulo &quot;q&quot; and any integers &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;,

:formula_25

in big O notation. Setting

:formula_26

this shows that the number of quadratic residues modulo &quot;q&quot; in any interval of length &quot;N&quot; is

:formula_27

It is easy to prove that

:formula_28

In fact,

:formula_29

Montgomery and Vaughan improved this in 1977, showing that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true then

:formula_30

This result cannot be substantially improved, for Schur had proved in 1918 that

:formula_31

and Paley had proved in 1932 that

:formula_32

for infinitely many &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0.

===Least quadratic non-residue===
The least quadratic residue mod &quot;p&quot; is clearly 1. The question of the magnitude of the least quadratic non-residue &quot;n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is more subtle, but it is always prime, with 7 appearing for the first time at 71.

The Pólya–Vinogradov inequality above gives O( log &quot;p&quot;). 

The best unconditional estimate is &quot;n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) ≪ &quot;p&quot;θ for any θ&gt;1/4, obtained by estimates of Burgess on character sums. 

Assuming the Generalised Riemann hypothesis, Ankeny obtained &quot;n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) ≪ (log &quot;p&quot;)2. 

Linnik showed that the number of &quot;p&quot; less than &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) &gt; Xε is bounded by a constant depending on ε.

The least quadratic non-residues mod &quot;p&quot; for odd primes &quot;p&quot; are:
:2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, ... 

===Quadratic excess===
Let &quot;p&quot; be an odd prime. The quadratic excess &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is the number of quadratic residues on the range (0,&quot;p&quot;/2) minus the number in the range (&quot;p&quot;/2,&quot;p&quot;) . For &quot;p&quot; congruent to 1 mod 4, the excess is zero, since −1 is a quadratic residue and the residues are symmetric under &quot;r&quot; ↔ &quot;p&quot;−&quot;r&quot;. For &quot;p&quot; congruent to 3 mod 4, the excess &quot;E&quot; is always positive.

==Complexity of finding square roots==

That is, given a number &quot;a&quot; and a modulus &quot;n&quot;, how hard is it
# to tell whether an &quot;x&quot; solving &quot;x&quot;2 ≡ &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;) exists
# assuming one does exist, to calculate it?

An important difference between prime and composite moduli shows up here. Modulo a prime &quot;p&quot;, a quadratic residue &quot;a&quot; has 1 + (&quot;a&quot;|&quot;p&quot;) roots (i.e. zero if &quot;a&quot; N &quot;p&quot;, one if &quot;a&quot; ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;), or two if &quot;a&quot; R &quot;p&quot; and gcd(&quot;a,p&quot;) = 1.)

In general if a composite modulus &quot;n&quot; is written as a product of powers of distinct primes, and there are &quot;n&quot;1 roots modulo the first one, &quot;n&quot;2 mod the second, ..., there will be &quot;n&quot;1&quot;n&quot;2... roots modulo &quot;n&quot;.

The theoretical way solutions modulo the prime powers are combined to make solutions modulo &quot;n&quot; is called the Chinese remainder theorem; it can be implemented with an efficient algorithm.

For example:
:Solve x2 ≡ 6 (mod 15).
::x2 ≡ 6 (mod 3) has one solution, 0; x2 ≡ 6 (mod 5) has two, 1 and 4.
:: and there are two solutions modulo 15, namely 6 and 9.

:Solve x2 ≡ 4 (mod 15).
::x2 ≡ 4 (mod 3) has two solutions, 1 and 2; x2 ≡ 4 (mod 5) has two, 2 and 3.
:: and there are four solutions modulo 15, namely 2, 7, 8, and 13.
:Solve x2 ≡ 7 (mod 15).
::x2 ≡ 7 (mod 3) has two solutions, 1 and 2; x2 ≡ 7 (mod 5) has no solutions.
:: and there are no solutions modulo 15.
===Prime or prime power modulus===

First off, if the modulus &quot;n&quot; is prime the Legendre symbol formula_33 can be quickly computed using a variation of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm or the Euler&#x27;s criterion. If it is −1 there is no solution.
Secondly, assuming that formula_34, if &quot;n&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), Lagrange found that the solutions are given by
:formula_35
and Legendre found a similar solution if &quot;n&quot; ≡ 5 (mod 8):
:formula_36

For prime &quot;n&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 8), however, there is no known formula. Tonelli (in 1891) and Cipolla found efficient algorithms that work for all prime moduli. Both algorithms require finding a quadratic nonresidue modulo &quot;n&quot;, and there is no efficient deterministic algorithm known for doing that. But since half the numbers between 1 and &quot;n&quot; are nonresidues, picking numbers &quot;x&quot; at random and calculating the Legendre symbol formula_37 until a nonresidue is found will quickly produce one. A slight variant of this algorithm is the Tonelli–Shanks algorithm.

If the modulus &quot;n&quot; is a prime power &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;e&quot;, a solution may be found modulo &quot;p&quot; and &quot;lifted&quot; to a solution modulo &quot;n&quot; using Hensel&#x27;s lemma or an algorithm of Gauss.

===Composite modulus===

If the modulus &quot;n&quot; has been factored into prime powers the solution was discussed above.

If &quot;n&quot; is not congruent to 2 modulo 4 and the Kronecker symbol formula_38 then there is no solution; if &quot;n&quot; is congruent to 2 modulo 4 and formula_39, then there is also no solution. If &quot;n&quot; is not congruent to 2 modulo 4 and formula_40, or &quot;n&quot; is congruent to 2 modulo 4 and formula_41, there may or may not be one.

If the complete factorization of &quot;n&quot; is not known, and formula_40 and &quot;n&quot; is not congruent to 2 modulo 4, or &quot;n&quot; is congruent to 2 modulo 4 and formula_41, the problem is known to be equivalent to integer factorization of &quot;n&quot; (i.e. an efficient solution to either problem could be used to solve the other efficiently).
The above discussion indicates how knowing the factors of &quot;n&quot; allows us to find the roots efficiently. Say there were an efficient algorithm for finding square roots modulo a composite number. The article congruence of squares discusses how finding two numbers x and y where and suffices to factorize &quot;n&quot; efficiently. Generate a random number, square it modulo &quot;n&quot;, and have the efficient square root algorithm find a root. Repeat until it returns a number not equal to the one we originally squared (or its negative modulo &quot;n&quot;), then follow the algorithm described in congruence of squares. The efficiency of the factoring algorithm depends on the exact characteristics of the root-finder (e.g. does it return all roots? just the smallest one? a random one?), but it will be efficient.

Determining whether &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic residue or nonresidue modulo &quot;n&quot; (denoted or ) can be done efficiently for prime &quot;n&quot; by computing the Legendre symbol. However, for composite &quot;n&quot;, this forms the quadratic residuosity problem, which is not known to be as hard as factorization, but is assumed to be quite hard.

On the other hand, if we want to know if there is a solution for &quot;x&quot; less than some given limit &quot;c&quot;, this problem is NP-complete; however, this is a fixed-parameter tractable problem, where &quot;c&quot; is the parameter.

In general, to determine if &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic residue modulo composite &quot;n&quot;, one can use the following theorem:

Let , and . Then is solvable if and only if:

* The Legendre symbol formula_44 for all odd prime divisors &quot;p&quot; of &quot;n&quot;.
* if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by 4 but not 8; or if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by 8.

Note: This theorem essentially requires that the factorization of &quot;n&quot; is known. Also notice that if , then the congruence can be reduced to , but then this takes the problem away from quadratic residues (unless &quot;m&quot; is a square).

==The number of quadratic residues==

The list of the number of quadratic residues modulo &quot;n&quot;, for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3 ..., looks like:
:1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 6, 6, 4, 7, 8, 6, ... 

A formula to count the number of squares modulo &quot;n&quot; is given by Stangl.

==Applications of quadratic residues==

===Acoustics===

Sound diffusers have been based on number-theoretic concepts such as primitive roots and quadratic residues.

===Graph theory===

Paley graphs are dense undirected graphs, one for each prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4), that form an infinite family of conference graphs, which yield an infinite family of symmetric conference matrices.

Paley digraphs are directed analogs of Paley graphs, one for each &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), that yield antisymmetric conference matrices.

The construction of these graphs uses quadratic residues.

===Cryptography===

The fact that finding a square root of a number modulo a large composite &quot;n&quot; is equivalent to factoring (which is widely believed to be a hard problem) has been used for constructing cryptographic schemes such as the Rabin cryptosystem and the oblivious transfer. The quadratic residuosity problem is the basis for the Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystem.

The discrete logarithm is a similar problem that is also used in cryptography.

===Primality testing===

Euler&#x27;s criterion is a formula for the Legendre symbol (&quot;a&quot;|&quot;p&quot;) where &quot;p&quot; is prime. If &quot;p&quot; is composite the formula may or may not compute (&quot;a&quot;|&quot;p&quot;) correctly. The Solovay–Strassen primality test for whether a given number &quot;n&quot; is prime or composite picks a random &quot;a&quot; and computes (&quot;a&quot;|&quot;n&quot;) using a modification of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm, and also using Euler&#x27;s criterion. If the results disagree, &quot;n&quot; is composite; if they agree, &quot;n&quot; may be composite or prime. For a composite &quot;n&quot; at least 1/2 the values of &quot;a&quot; in the range 2, 3, ..., &quot;n&quot; − 1 will return &quot;&quot;n&quot; is composite&quot;; for prime &quot;n&quot; none will. If, after using many different values of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;n&quot; has not been proved composite it is called a &quot;probable prime&quot;.

The Miller–Rabin primality test is based on the same principles. There is a deterministic version of it, but the proof that it works depends on the generalized Riemann hypothesis; the output from this test is &quot;&quot;n&quot; is definitely composite&quot; or &quot;either &quot;n&quot; is prime or the GRH is false&quot;. If the second output ever occurs for a composite &quot;n&quot;, then the GRH would be false, which would have implications through many branches of mathematics.

===Integer factorization===

In § VI of the &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; Gauss discusses two factoring algorithms that use quadratic residues and the law of quadratic reciprocity.

Several modern factorization algorithms (including Dixon&#x27;s algorithm, the continued fraction method, the quadratic sieve, and the number field sieve) generate small quadratic residues (modulo the number being factorized) in an attempt to find a congruence of squares which will yield a factorization. The number field sieve is the fastest general-purpose factorization algorithm known.

==Table of quadratic residues==

The following table lists the quadratic residues mod 1 to 75 (a means it is not coprime to &quot;n&quot;). (For the quadratic residues coprime to &quot;n&quot;, see , and for nonzero quadratic residues, see .)

<doc id="200093" wikidata="Q7699406" url="?curid=200093" title="Ten pence (British coin)">
<text>The British decimal ten pence coin (often shortened to 10p in writing and speech) is a denomination of sterling coinage worth of a pound. Its obverse has featured the profile of the British monarch since the coin&#x27;s introduction in 1968, to replace the florin (two shilling) coin in preparation for decimalisation in 1971. It remained the same size as the florin (which also remained legal tender) until a smaller version was introduced on 30 September 1992, with the older coins being withdrawn on 30 June 1993. 

The ten pence coin was originally minted from cupro-nickel] (75% Cu, 25% Ni), but since 2012 it has been minted in nickel-plated steel due to the increasing price of metal. From January 2013 the Royal Mint began a programme to gradually remove the cupro-nickel coins from circulation and replace them with the nickel-plated steel versions.

 there were an estimated 1,631 million 10p coins in circulation, with an estimated face value of £163.08 million.

Ten pence coins are legal tender for amounts up to the sum of £5 when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

== Design ==

===Obverse===
During Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign, four different obverses were used. The inscription until 2015 was , followed by the year of minting. In the original design both sides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as beading.

As with all new decimal currency, until 1984 the portrait of Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wears the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.

Between 1985 and 1997 the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem.

On 30 September 1992 a reduced-size version of the 10 pence coin was introduced. The older and larger version of the coin was withdrawn from circulation on 30 June 1993. The design remained unchanged.

From 1998 to 2015 the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait.

From 2015, the obverse featured a portrait by Jody Clark.

===Reverse===
==== Original reverse design ====
The original reverse of the coin, designed by Christopher Ironside, and used from 1968 to 2008, is a crowned lion (formally, &quot;Part of the crest of England, a lion passant guardant royally crowned&quot;), with the numeral &quot;10&quot; below the lion, and either (1968–1981) or (1982–2008) above the lion.

==== Royal Shield design ====
In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The 10p coin depicts part of the first quarter of the shield, showing two of the lions passant from the Royal Banner of England, with the words above the shield design. The coin&#x27;s obverse remains largely unchanged, but the beading (the ring of dots around the coin&#x27;s circumference), which no longer features on the coin&#x27;s reverse, has also been removed from the obverse.

==== A to Z design (Great British Coin Hunt) ====
In March 2018, new designs were released, one for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. Anne Jessopp, chief executive of the Royal Mint, described the designs as &quot;iconic themes that are quintessentially British&quot;. The A to Z coins were confirmed to have individual mintage figures of 220,000 on 14 October 2019 – a total of 5,720,000 for all 26.

<doc id="200107" wikidata="Q1577090" url="?curid=200107" title="Tone sandhi">
<text>Tone sandhi is a phonological change that occurs in tonal languages. It involves changes to the tones assigned to individual words or morphemes, based on the pronunciation of adjacent words or morphemes. This change typically simplifies a bidirectional tone into a one-directional tone. Tone sandhi is a type of sandhi, which refers to fusional changes, and is derived from the Sanskrit word for &quot;joining.&quot;

==Languages with tone sandhi==
Tone sandhi occurs to some extent in nearly all tonal languages, manifesting itself in different ways. Tonal languages, characterized by their use of pitch to affect meaning, appear all over the world, especially in the Niger-Congo language family of Africa, and the Sino-Tibetan language family of East Asia, as well as other East Asian languages such as Kra-Dai, and Papuan languages. East and Southeast Asian languages tend to have larger tonal libraries compared to African languages. However, African languages frequently exhibit downdrift and mobility, forms of tone interaction. Tonal languages are also found in many Oto-Manguean and other languages of Central America, as well as in parts of North America (such as Athabaskan in British Columbia, Canada), and Europe.

Many North American and African tonal languages undergo &quot;syntagmatic displacement&quot;, as one tone is replaced by another in the event that the new tone is present elsewhere in the adjacent tones. Usually, these processes of assimilation occur from left to right. In some languages of West Africa, for example, an unaccented syllable takes the tone from the closest tone to its left. However, in East and Southeast Asia, &quot;paradigmatic replacement&quot; is a more common form of tone sandhi, as one tone changes to another in a certain environment, whether or not the new tone is already present in the surrounding words or morphemes.

===Chinese languages===

Many languages spoken in China have tone sandhi; some of it quite complex. Southern Min (Minnan), which includes Hokkien, Taiwanese, and Teochew, has a complex system, with in most cases every syllable changing into a different tone, and which tone it turns into sometimes depending on the final consonant of the syllable that bears it.
Take for example Taiwanese varieties of Hokkien, which have two (numbered 4 and 8 in the diagram above) that occur in checked syllables (those ending in a stop consonant) and five tonemes in syllables that do not end in a stop. In Taiwanese, within a phonological phrase, all its non-neutral-tone syllables save for the last undergo tone sandhi. Among the unchecked syllables, tone 1 becomes 7, 7 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2, and 2 becomes 1. Tone 5 becomes 7 or 3, depending on dialect. Stopped syllables ending in , , or take the opposite tone (phonetically, a high tone becomes low, and a low tone becomes high) whereas syllables ending in a glottal stop (written as in Pe̍h-ōe-jī) drop their final consonant to become tone 2 or 3.
Tone sandhi in Sinitic languages can be classified with a left-dominant or right-dominant system, depending on whether the leftmost or rightmost item keeps its tone. In a language of the right-dominant system, the right-most syllable of a word retains its citation tone. All the other syllables of the word must take their sandhi form. Mandarin Tone 3 Sandhi and Taiwanese Hokkien tone sandhi are both right-dominant. 
In a left-dominant system, the leftmost tone tends to spread rightward.
Shanghainese is an example of a left-dominant system.

===Hmong===

The seven or eight tones of Hmong demonstrate several instances of tone sandhi. In fact the contested distinction between the seventh and eighth tones surrounds the very issue of tone sandhi (between glottal stop (-m) and low rising (-d) tones). High and high-falling tones (marked by -b and -j in the RPA orthography, respectively) trigger sandhi in subsequent words bearing particular tones. A frequent example can be found in the combination for numbering objects (ordinal number + classifier + noun): ib (one) + tus (classifier) + dev (dog) &gt; ib tug dev (note tone change on the classifier from -s to -g).

==Tone sandhi versus morphological tone change==

Tone sandhi is compulsory as long as the environmental conditions that trigger it are met. It is not to be confused with tone changes that are due to derivational or inflectional morphology. For example, Cantonese has a derivational process known as changed tone, which only applies in certain semantic domains. The word (; ) means &quot;sugar&quot;, whereas the derived word (; also written ) means &quot;candy&quot;. Such a change is not triggered by the phonological environment of the tone, and therefore is not an example of sandhi.

== Examples ==

=== Mandarin Chinese ===

Standard Chinese (Standard Mandarin) features several tone sandhi rules:
* When there are two 3rd tones in a row, the first one becomes 2nd tone. E.g. 你好 (&quot;nǐ&quot; + &quot;hǎo&quot; &gt; &quot;ní hǎo&quot;)
* The neutral tone is pronounced at different pitches depending on what tone it follows.
* 不 (&quot;bù&quot;) is 4th tone except when followed by another 4th tone, when it becomes 2nd tone. E.g. 不是 (&quot;bù&quot; + &quot;shì&quot; &gt; &quot;bú shì&quot; )
* 一 (&quot;yī&quot;) is 1st tone when it represents the ordinal &quot;first&quot;. Examples: (&quot;dìyīgè&quot;). It changes when it represents the cardinal number &quot;1&quot;, following a pattern of 2nd tone when followed by a 4th tone, and 4th tone when followed by any other tone. Examples: (for changing to the 2nd tone before a 4th tone) (&quot;yī&quot; + &quot;cì&quot; &gt; &quot;yí cì&quot; ), (&quot;yī&quot; + &quot;bàn&quot; &gt; &quot;yí bàn&quot;), (&quot;yī&quot; + &quot;huìr&quot; &gt; &quot;yí huìr&quot;); (for changing to the 4th tone before another tone) (&quot;yī&quot; + &quot;bān&quot; &gt; &quot;yì bān&quot;), (&quot;yī&quot; + &quot;máo&quot; &gt; &quot;yì máo&quot;).

=== Yatzachi Zapotec ===

Yatzachi Zapotec, an Oto-Manguean language spoken in Mexico, has three tones: high, middle and low. The three tones, along with separate classifications for morpheme categories, contribute to a somewhat more complicated system of tone sandhi than in Mandarin. There are two main rules for Yatzachi Zapotec tone sandhi, which apply in this order:

# (This rule only applies to class B morphemes.) A low tone will change to a mid tone when it precedes either a high or a mid tone: /yèn nājō/ → yēn nājō &quot;neck we say&quot;
# A mid tone will change to a high tone when it is after a low or mid tone, and occurs at the end of a morpheme not preceding a pause: /ẓīs gōlī/ → ẓís gōlī &quot;old stick&quot;

=== Molinos Mixtec ===

Molinos Mixtec, another Oto-Manguean language, has a much more complicated system of tone sandhi. The language has three tones (high, mid, or low, or 1, 2, or 3, respectively), and all roots are disyllabic, meaning that there are nine possible combinations of tones for a root or &quot;couplet&quot;. The tone combinations are expressed here as a two digit number (high-low is represented as 13). Couplets are also classified into either class A or B, as well as verb or non-verb. A number of specific rules depending on these three factors determine tone change. One example of a rule follows:

&quot;Basic 31 becomes 11 when following any couplet of Class B but does not change after Class A (except that after 32(B&#x27;) it optionally remains 31&quot;
ža²ʔa² (class B) &quot;chiles&quot; + ži³či¹ (class A) &quot;dry&quot; &gt; ža²ʔa²ži¹či¹ &quot;dry chiles&quot;

=== Akan ===

Akan, a Niger-Congo language spoken in Ghana, has two tones: high and low. The low tone is default. In Akan, tones at morpheme boundaries assimilate to each other through tone sandhi, the first tone of the second morpheme changing to match the final tone of the first morpheme.

For example:

:àkókɔ́ + òníní &gt; àkókɔ́óníní &quot;cockerel&quot;

:ǹsóró + m̀má &gt; ǹsóróḿmá &quot;star(s)&quot;

==Motivations==

Tone sandhi, especially the case of the Taiwanese Hokkien tone circle, often lacks intuitive phonetic explanations. Specifically, sandhi rules may target classes of phones not previously identified as natural, the conditioning environments may be disjoint, or the tone substitutions may occur without any reason. 
This is because waves of sound change have hidden the original phonetic motivation of the sandhi rule. In the case of Chinese varieties, though, Middle Chinese tones can be used as natural classes for tone sandhi rules in modern varieties, showing that diachronic information needs to be considered to understand tone sandhi.
However, phonetic motivations have been identified for specific varieties.
The phonetic unnaturalness of many tone sandhi processes have made it difficult for phonologists to express such processes with rules or constraints.

Phonologically, tone sandhi is often an assimilatory or dissimilatory process.
Mandarin Tone 3 sandhi, explained above, is an example of an Obligatory Contour Principle effect because it involves two tone 3 syllables next to each other. The first of the two tone 3&#x27;s becomes a tone 2 to dissimilate from the other syllable.

==Transcription==
Sinologists sometimes use reversed Chao tone letters to indicate sandhi, with the left-facing letters of the IPA on the left for the underlying tone, and reversed right-facing letters on the right for the realized tone. For example, the Mandarin example of &quot;nǐ&quot; + &quot;hǎo&quot; &gt; &quot;ní hǎo&quot; above would be transcribed:

The individual Unicode components of the reversed tone letters are .

<doc id="200108" wikidata="Q1688174" url="?curid=200108" title="Jesse Lynch Williams">
<text>Jesse Lynch Williams (August 17, 1871 – September 14, 1929) was an American author and dramatist. He won the first Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play &quot;Why Marry?&quot; (1917). He was a journalist for three New York publications and co-founded the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot; and the Princeton Triangle Club.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Sterling, Illinois, on August 17, 1871, to Elizabeth Brown (Riddle) and Rev. Meade Creighton Williams, pastor of a Presbyterian church in St. Louis, Missouri. His father wrote &quot;Early Mackinac&quot; and was the editor of a Presbyterian journal. Jesse&#x27;s brothers were David. R. Williams, of St. Louis, and Terrell Williams, a law school professor of Washington University in St. Louis.

His grandfather, also Jesse Lynch Williams, was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as the government director of the roads. He was an engineer and constructor for the Union Pacific Railroad.

==Education and career==
Williams studied at Beloit Academy. He began his literary career in college. He won the &quot;Nassau Literary Magazine&quot; short story contest in his junior year. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1892. As a graduate student at Princeton University, he wrote &quot;Princeton Stories&quot; (1895) which often featured the daily life of an undergraduate football player. He graduated from Princeton with a master&#x27;s degree in 1895. In 1898, he wrote &quot;The History of Princeton University&quot; with John de Witt. He and Booth Tarkington co-founded the Triangle Club at Princeton and edited &quot;The Lit&quot;. For three years, beginning in 1900, he co-founded and was the first editor of the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot;. Robert Frost wrote a recommendation to the University of Michigan regarding his suitability for the Fellowship of Creative Arts. Frost indicated that Williams was relevant, open-minded, practical, a &quot;good all-around participator&quot;, and, along with his wife, good company. During the 1925–1926 academic year, he held the Fellowship in Creative Arts at the University of Michigan. He received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Princeton in 1919.

Beginning in 1893, he was a reporter for &quot;The Sun&quot;, and wrote fiction on the side. He joined the staff at the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser&quot; (&quot;The New York Globe&quot;) from 1895 to 1897, followed by the &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. From 1900 to 1903, he was the editor of the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot;, after which he worked full-time writing plays and novels.

He wrote a number of short stories starting in the 1890s. He wrote four plays and six novels by 1929, including &quot;Why Marry?&quot; (1917), for which he was awarded the first Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He wrote the play &quot;The Stolen Story&quot; (1906), based upon his times as a reporter, which he first wrote as a short story, &quot;The Stolen Story and Other Newspaper Stories.&quot; He wrote the play &quot;The Stolen Story&quot; (1906), based upon his times as a reporter. His plays &quot;Why Marry?&quot; (1917) and &quot;Why Not&quot; (1922), and &quot;Lovely Lady&quot; (1925) were produced on Broadway. &quot;Why Not&quot; explores the experiences of divorce. &quot;Lovely Lady&quot; is about the attempts of a lady to attract the attentions of a lawyer and his son. His novels and stories include &quot;Princeton Stories&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of a Freshman&quot; (1899), &quot;The Girl and the Game&quot; (1908), &quot;The Married Life of the Frederic Carrolls&quot; (1910), and &quot;She Knew She Was Right&quot;.

He was a member of the Authors League of America, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and other organizations, in which he sometimes had a leadership role.

==Marriage and children==
He was married to Alice Laidlaw (1872–1960), daughter of Elizabeth C. Onderdonk and Henry Bell Laidlaw, on June 1, 1898, in New York. They had three children, Henry Meade, Jesse Lynch, and Laidlaw Onderdonk Williams. They lived in Princeton, New Jersey. Alice graduated from Veltin School for Girls in 1892. She was a member of the Audubon Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and a number of organizations, including sitting on the executive board of the New Jersey Equal Franchise Society. She wrote a book titled &quot;Sunday Suppers&quot; (1912).

==Death==
Williams died of a heart attack on September 14, 1929, at the home of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Douglas Robinson in Jordanville, New York, or Herkimer, New York.

<text>The British decimal one penny (1p) coin is a unit of currency and denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound. Its obverse featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin&#x27;s introduction on 15 February 1971, the day British currency was decimalised, until her death on 8 September 2022. A new portrait featuring King Charles III was introduced on 30 September 2022, designed by Martin Jennings. Four different portraits of the Queen were used on the obverse; the last design by Jody Clark was introduced in 2015. The second and current reverse, designed by Matthew Dent, features a segment of the Royal Shield and was introduced in 2008. The penny is the lowest value coin (in real terms) ever to circulate in the United Kingdom.

The penny was originally minted from bronze, but since 1992 has been minted in copper-plated steel due to increasing copper prices.

There are an estimated 10.5 billion 1p coins in circulation as of 2016, with a total face value of around £105,000,000.

One penny coins are legal tender only for amounts up to the sum of 20p when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Old English word &quot;penig,&quot; which itself comes from the proto-Germanic *&quot;panninga.&quot; The correct plural form for multiple penny coins is &quot;pennies&quot; (e.g. fifty pennies). The correct term for monetary amounts of pennies greater than one penny is &quot;pence&quot; (e.g. one pound and twenty pence).

== History ==
Prior to 1971, the United Kingdom had been using the pounds, shillings, and pence currency system. Decimalisation was announced by Chancellor James Callaghan on 1 March 1966; one pound would be subdivided into 100 pence, instead of 240 pence as previously was the case.

This required new coins to be minted, to replace the pre-decimal ones. The original specification for the 1p coin was set out in the Decimal Currency Act 1969, which was replaced by the Currency Act 1971. Both mandated the weight of the coin to be 3.564 grams ±0.0750g, and 2.032 cm ±0.125 mm in diameter. Subsequently, the Currency Act 1983 allows for the standards of the 1p coin to be changed by royal proclamation.

The new 1p coins began production in December 1968 in the newly built Royal Mint facility in Llantrisant, South Wales. 1,521,666,250 1p coins were minted between 1968 and the end of 1971. On 15 February 1971, the United Kingdom officially switched to a decimal currency and the new coins entered circulation. The coins continue to be minted at this facility today.

=== Metallic composition ===
The coin was originally minted in bronze (composition 97% copper, 2.5% zinc, 0.5% tin) between 1971 and September 1992. However, increasing world metal prices necessitated a change of composition. Since 1992, the coins are minted in steel and electroplated in copper, making them magnetic. Rising world prices for copper had caused the metal value of the pre-1992 copper 1p coin to exceed 1p (for example, in May 2006, the intrinsic metal value of a pre-1992 1p coin was about 1.5 pence). Melting coins is illegal in the United Kingdom and is punishable by a fine, or up to two years imprisonment.

=== Obverse designs ===
====Elizabeth II====
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, four different obverses were used. The outer inscription on the coin is , where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. In the original design both sides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as beading.

Anticipation of a switch to a decimalised currency led to the commissioning of a new Royal Portrait by artist Arnold Machin, which was approved by the Queen in 1964. This featured the Queen wearing the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara and was used until 1984. A modified form of this portrait has appeared on British Postage stamps since 1967.

Between 1985 and 1997 a portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used. The portrait is couped, and depicts the Queen wearing the George IV State Diadem. Unlike previous portraits, the Queen is wearing jewellery, earrings and a necklace. The initials of Maklouf are shown below the neck of the Queen. His middle name, David, is included so that the mark is not confused with the initials of the Royal Mint.

In 1997, a competition to design the obverse of the 1997 Golden Wedding crown – a coin issued to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s and Prince Philip&#x27;s 50th wedding anniversary – was held. The standard of entry was so high that following this competition, the Royal Mint held another to design the new portrait. Ian Rank-Broadley won this competition, and his design was used between 1998 and 2015. His design again featured the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait. The depiction of the Queen was seen as more realistic, with Rank Broadley himself saying &quot;There is no need to flatter her. She is a 70-year-old woman with poise and bearing&quot;.

In 2014, the Royal Mint again held a competition to design a new portrait. Designer Jody Clark won this competition, with a portrait of the Queen wearing the George IV State Diadem and the initials feature under the neck of the Queen. The portrait was sketched without an official sitting, only using reference material for inspiration.

====Charles III====
In October 2023, a new design featuring a left facing uncrowned bust of the newly crowned King Charles III was revealed. The outer inscription on the coin is , where 2023 is replaced by the year of minting. The design of the 2023 proof and uncirculated sets also included a Tudor crown privy mark. Subsequent sets and coins struck for circulation do not include this mark.

=== Reverse designs ===
Despite no official government confirmation of a switch to decimalised currency, the Royal Mint began the design process for decimal coins in 1962. They invited the Royal Academy, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Faculty of the Royal Designers for Industry and the Royal College of Art to nominate artists to design the hypothetical new coins. British sculptor Christopher Ironside won this competition, and his design was chosen to feature on the potential decimalised currency. His design for the 1p coin featured a Scottish theme, with a coin depicting a thistle above a Scottish flag inside a shield and a Scottish lion inside a shield. However, Chancellor James Callaghan&#x27;s announcement that the United Kingdom would decimalise its currency included an open competition to find the new designs. Over 80 artists and 900 different designs were submitted. Ironside entered this competition with a further, different style of designs and won.

The reverse of the coin, which was minted from 1971 to 2008, featured a crowned portcullis with chains (an adaptation of the Badge of Henry VII which is now the Badge of the Palace of Westminster), with the numeral &quot;1&quot; written below the portcullis, and either (1971–1981) or (1982–2008) above the portcullis.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form much of the whole shield when placed together. The entire shield was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The 1p coin depicts the left section between the first and third quarter of the shield, representing England and Northern Ireland.
The coin&#x27;s obverse remains largely unchanged, but the beading (the ring of dots around the coin&#x27;s circumference), which no longer features on the coin&#x27;s reverse, has also been removed from the obverse.

In October 2023 the King Charles III one penny coin was presented; the coin design features a hazel dormouse.

== Status ==

=== Speculation on withdrawal ===
The proposed withdrawal of the 1p coins has been subject of media speculation, such as in 2015 when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, proposed the withdrawal of the 1p coin. This was vetoed by Prime Minister David Cameron, because of the potential unpopularity with the public.

In March 2018, the Government launched a consultation on the future of payments in the British economy. One question focused on the denominational mix of coins, including &#x27;dormant&#x27; denominations. This prompted speculation that the 1p and 2p coins could be withdrawn from circulation. Analysis from staff at the Bank of England concluded that fears about the withdrawal were &#x27;unfounded&#x27; and that there would be no significant impact on prices if copper coins were scrapped, noting the sharp decline in usage of copper coins. It is estimated that 60% of copper coins are only spent once, before being removed from the cash cycle, as they are saved or binned. Approximately 8% of 1p coins are estimated to be thrown away entirely, requiring the annual minting of new 1p and 2p coins with a face value of £500m to replace coins falling out of circulation. Further, potential inflationary effects from the rounding of prices caused by scrapping the 1p would likely be minimal, given only 3% of payments by value are made in cash and card payments would continue to be made unrounded.

There was concern raised by some charities and businesses over the scrapping of 1p coins. Charities feared that the number of donations made in collection pots would fall and some business models could be severely impacted, for example traditional seaside arcades. However, in May 2019 Chancellor Phillip Hammond announced the outcome of a 2018 consultation, suggesting there were no plans to scrap copper coins and that he wanted the public to &quot;have choice over how they spend their money&quot;. No 1p coins were minted in 2018, as the Treasury said that there were already enough in circulation.

===Value===
Since around 2002, the penny has had the lowest value in real terms of any coin in the history of the United Kingdom, since at least its formation by the Acts of Union in 1707. All previous low-value coins were withdrawn before their purchasing power fell below the current value of the penny. The purchasing power of previous lowest-value coins is:

<doc id="200115" wikidata="Q193139" url="?curid=200115" title="Trajectory">
<text>A trajectory or flight path is the path that an object with mass in motion follows through space as a function of time. In classical mechanics, a trajectory is defined by Hamiltonian mechanics via canonical coordinates; hence, a complete trajectory is defined by position and momentum, simultaneously.

The mass might be a projectile or a satellite. For example, it can be an orbit — the path of a planet, asteroid, or comet as it travels around a central mass.

In control theory, a trajectory is a time-ordered set of states of a dynamical system (see e.g. Poincaré map). In discrete mathematics, a trajectory is a sequence formula_1 of values calculated by the iterated application of a mapping formula_2 to an element formula_3 of its source.

== Physics of trajectories ==
A familiar example of a trajectory is the path of a projectile, such as a thrown ball or rock. In a significantly simplified model, the object moves only under the influence of a uniform gravitational force field. This can be a good approximation for a rock that is thrown for short distances, for example at the surface of the Moon. In this simple approximation, the trajectory takes the shape of a parabola. Generally when determining trajectories, it may be necessary to account for nonuniform gravitational forces and air resistance (drag and aerodynamics). This is the focus of the discipline of ballistics.

One of the remarkable achievements of Newtonian mechanics was the derivation of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. In the gravitational field of a point mass or a spherically-symmetrical extended mass (such as the Sun), the trajectory of a moving object is a conic section, usually an ellipse or a hyperbola. This agrees with the observed orbits of planets, comets, and artificial spacecraft to a reasonably good approximation, although if a comet passes close to the Sun, then it is also influenced by other forces such as the solar wind and radiation pressure, which modify the orbit and cause the comet to eject material into space.

Newton&#x27;s theory later developed into the branch of theoretical physics known as classical mechanics. It employs the mathematics of differential calculus (which was also initiated by Newton in his youth). Over the centuries, countless scientists have contributed to the development of these two disciplines. Classical mechanics became a most prominent demonstration of the power of rational thought, i.e. reason, in science as well as technology. It helps to understand and predict an enormous range of phenomena; trajectories are but one example.

Consider a particle of mass formula_4, moving in a potential field formula_5. Physically speaking, mass represents inertia, and the field formula_5 represents external forces of a particular kind known as &quot;conservative&quot;. Given formula_5 at every relevant position, there is a way to infer the associated force that would act at that position, say from gravity. Not all forces can be expressed in this way, however.

The motion of the particle is described by the second-order differential equation

:formula_8

On the right-hand side, the force is given in terms of formula_9, the gradient of the potential, taken at positions along the trajectory. This is the mathematical form of Newton&#x27;s second law of motion: force equals mass times acceleration, for such situations.

==Examples==

=== Uniform gravity, neither drag nor wind===
The ideal case of motion of a projectile in a uniform gravitational field in the absence of other forces (such as air drag) was first investigated by Galileo Galilei. To neglect the action of the atmosphere in shaping a trajectory would have been considered a futile hypothesis by practical-minded investigators all through the Middle Ages in Europe. Nevertheless, by anticipating the existence of the vacuum, later to be demonstrated on Earth by his collaborator Evangelista Torricelli, Galileo was able to initiate the future science of mechanics. In a near vacuum, as it turns out for instance on the Moon, his simplified parabolic trajectory proves essentially correct.

In the analysis that follows, we derive the equation of motion of a projectile as measured from an inertial frame at rest with respect to the ground. Associated with the frame is a right-hand coordinate system with its origin at the point of launch of the projectile. The formula_3-axis is tangent to the ground, and the formula_11axis is perpendicular to it ( parallel to the gravitational field lines ). Let formula_12 be the acceleration of gravity. Relative to the flat terrain, let the initial horizontal speed be formula_13 and the initial vertical speed be formula_14. It will also be shown that the range is formula_15, and the maximum altitude is formula_16. The maximum range for a given initial speed formula_17 is obtained when formula_18, i.e. the initial angle is 45formula_19. This range is formula_20, and the maximum altitude at the maximum range is formula_21.

====Derivation of the equation of motion====
Assume the motion of the projectile is being measured from a free fall frame which happens to be at (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = (0,0) at &quot;t&quot; = 0. The equation of motion of the projectile in this frame (by the equivalence principle) would be formula_22. The co-ordinates of this free-fall frame, with respect to our inertial frame would be formula_23. That is, formula_24.

Now translating back to the inertial frame the co-ordinates of the projectile becomes formula_25 That is:

: formula_26

(where &quot;v&quot;0 is the initial velocity, formula_27 is the angle of elevation, and &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity).

====Range and height====

The range, &quot;R&quot;, is the greatest distance the object travels along the x-axis in the I sector. The initial velocity, &quot;vi&quot;, is the speed at which said object is launched from the point of origin. The initial angle, &quot;θi&quot;, is the angle at which said object is released. The &quot;g&quot; is the respective gravitational pull on the object within a null-medium.

: formula_28

The height, &quot;h&quot;, is the greatest parabolic height said object reaches within its trajectory
: formula_29

====Angle of elevation====

In terms of angle of elevation formula_27 and initial speed formula_17:

:formula_32

giving the range as

:formula_33

This equation can be rearranged to find the angle for a required range

: formula_34 (Equation II: angle of projectile launch)

Note that the sine function is such that there are two solutions for formula_27 for a given range formula_36. The angle formula_27 giving the maximum range can be found by considering the derivative or formula_38 with respect to formula_27 and setting it to zero.

:formula_40

which has a nontrivial solution at formula_41, or formula_42. The maximum range is then formula_43. At this angle formula_44, so the maximum height obtained is formula_45.

To find the angle giving the maximum height for a given speed calculate the derivative of the maximum height formula_46 with respect to formula_27, that is
formula_48
which is zero when formula_49. So the maximum height formula_50 is obtained when the projectile is fired straight up.

===Orbiting objects===
If instead of a uniform downwards gravitational force we consider two bodies orbiting with the mutual gravitation between them, we obtain Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. The derivation of these was one of the major works of Isaac Newton and provided much of the motivation for the development of differential calculus.

==Catching balls==
If a projectile, such as a baseball or cricket ball, travels in a parabolic path, with negligible air resistance, and if a player is positioned so as to catch it as it descends, he sees its angle of elevation increasing continuously throughout its flight. The tangent of the angle of elevation is proportional to the time since the ball was sent into the air, usually by being struck with a bat. Even when the ball is really descending, near the end of its flight, its angle of elevation seen by the player continues to increase. The player therefore sees it as if it were ascending vertically at constant speed. Finding the place from which the ball appears to rise steadily helps the player to position himself correctly to make the catch. If he is too close to the batsman who has hit the ball, it will appear to rise at an accelerating rate. If he is too far from the batsman, it will appear to slow rapidly, and then to descend.

<text>The Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, also known as Soviet Turkmenistan, the Turkmen SSR, TuSSR, Turkmenistan, or Turkmenia, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union located in Central Asia existed as a republic from 1925 to 1991. Initially, on 7 August 1921, it was established as the Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan ASSR before being made, on 13 May 1925, a separate republic of the USSR as the Turkmen SSR.

Since then the borders of the Turkmenia were unchanged. On 22 August 1990, Turkmenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. On 27 October 1991, it became independent as Turkmenistan.

Geographically, Turkmenistan was bordered between Iran, Afghanistan to the south, Caspian Sea to the west, the Kazakh SSR to the north and the Uzbek SSR to the east.

== History ==
===Annexation to Russia===
Russian attempts to encroach upon Turkmen territory began in earnest in the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1869 the Russian Empire established a foothold in present-day Turkmenistan with the foundation of the Caspian Sea port of Krasnovodsk (now Türkmenbaşy). From there and other points, they marched on and subdued the Khiva Khanate in 1873. Because Turkmen tribes, most notably the Yomud, were in the military service of the Khivan khan, Russian forces undertook punitive raids against Khorazm, in the process slaughtering hundreds of Turkmen and destroying their settlements. In 1881 the Russians under General Mikhail Skobelev besieged and captured Geok Tepe, one of the last Turkmen strongholds, northwest of Ashgabat. With the Turkmen defeat (which is now marked by the Turkmen as a national day of mourning and a symbol of national pride), the annexation of what is present-day Turkmenistan took the Russian Empire repeated attempts after failing the first time. Later the same year, the Russians signed the Treaty of Akhal with Qajar Iran and established what essentially remains the current border between Turkmenistan and Iran. In 1897 a similar agreement was signed between the Russians and Afghans.

Following annexation to Russia, the area was administered as the Transcaspian Region by corrupt and malfeasant military officers and officials appointed by the Turkestan Governor-Generalship in Tashkent. In the 1880s, a railroad was built from Krasnovodsk to Ashgabat and later extended to Tashkent. Urban areas began to develop along the railway. Although the Transcaspian Region essentially was a colony of Russia, it remained a backwater, except for Russian concerns with British colonialist intentions in the region and with possible uprisings by the Turkmen.

===Creation of an SSR===
Because the Turkmen generally were indifferent to the advent of Soviet rule in 1917, little revolutionary activity occurred in the region in the years that followed. However, the years immediately preceding the revolution had been marked by sporadic Turkmen uprisings against Russian rule, most prominently the anti-tsarist revolt of 1916 that swept through the whole of Turkestan. Their armed resistance to Soviet rule was part of the larger Basmachi Revolt throughout Central Asia from the 1920s into the early 1930s. Opposition was fierce and resulted in the death of large numbers of Turkmen. Soviet sources describe this struggle as a minor chapter in the republic&#x27;s history.

In October 1924, when Central Asia was divided into distinct ethno-national political entities, the Transcaspian Oblast of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR) along with the Charjew, Kerki and a part of the Shirabad provinces of the Bukharan People&#x27;s Republic and the Turkmen (Daşoguz) province of Khorezm People&#x27;s Republic were unified to create the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a full-fledged constituent republic of the Soviet Union where Turkmen made up roughly 80% of the population. During the forced collectivization and settlement of nomadic and semi-nomadic groups along with other socioeconomic changes of the first decades of Soviet rule, pastoral nomadism ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s, the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen way of life resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Significant numbers of Russians and other Europeans, as well as groups from various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas. Modest industrial capabilities were developed, and limited exploitation of Turkmenistan&#x27;s natural resources was initiated.

Under Soviet rule, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and &quot;vestiges of the past&quot;. Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia with a headquarters in Tashkent was established during World War II to supervise the Islamic faith in Central Asia. For the most part, the Muslim Board functioned as an instrument of propaganda whose activities did little to enhance the Muslim cause. Atheist indoctrination stifled religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male circumcision, continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in &quot;folk form&quot; as a kind of unofficial Islam not sanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.

===Pre-independence===

The Soviet regime&#x27;s policy of indigenization (korenizatsiia) involved the promotion of national culture and language and the creation of a native administration for each ethnic group in its own territory. During the 1920s, as happened throughout the Soviet Union, there was forthright support and funding for the creation of native language theatres, publishing houses, newspapers as well as universal public schooling, and this was the case for the Turkmen minorities during Soviet administration of Turkmen/Transcaspian province of the Turkestan ASSR and the Bukharan People&#x27;s Republic and the Khorezm (Kivan) People&#x27;s Republic and continued after the creation of the majority-Turkmen national republic.

In the 1920s the Turkmen SSR standardised the Turkmen language (as prior to this, the vast majority of the population was not literate and those that were tended to use the Chaghtai or Persian languages for writing, though in the late 19th and early 20th century there was growing interest in the use of Ottoman Turkish register for writing as it is an Oghuz language and closer linguistically). Rigorous debate in the national press and in various literary and educational journals over Teke, Yomut, and other regional and tribal dialects was followed by centralised decision-making around the creation of a particular national standard, the simplification of the Arabo-Persian alphabet, and the eventual transition to the Cyrillic alphabet.

Beginning in the 1930s, Moscow kept the republic under firm control. The nationalities policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) fostered the development of a Turkmen political elite and promoted Russification. The previous nationality policies of the 1920s and early 1930s involved promoting the use of the Turkmen language for administration in all areas of the state, party, and economy (along with the longer-lasting system of preferential quotas and advancement for ethnic Turkmen in government, party, and industrial jobs with the aim of achieving a majority Turkmen bureaucracy) and attempts at requiring non-Turkmen to learn the Turkmen language. From the 1930s onward, the nationality policy favoured use of the Turkmen language in areas of government &quot;closest to the people&quot;: education, health, etc., paired with an acceptance that knowledge of the Russian language would be required for most government work as well as advancement in many careers: the government would no longer work to make knowledge of Russian superfluous to advancement and would cease active efforts to have Turkmen be the language of administration, and from 1938 onwards non-Russian students throughout the Soviet Union would be required to become fluent in Russian in order to advance through secondary and tertiary education.

Non-Turkmen cadre both in Moscow and Turkmenia closely supervised the national cadre of government officials and bureaucrats; generally, the Turkmen leadership staunchly supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic, and, except for a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary Muhammetnazar Gapurow, Turkmenistan remained a quiet Soviet republic. Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of glasnost and perestroika did not have a significant impact on Turkmenistan, as many people there were self-dependent, and settlers of the territory and the Soviet Union&#x27;s ministers rarely intertwined. The republic found itself rather unprepared for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.

When other constituent republics of the Soviet Union advanced claims to sovereignty in 1988 and 1989, Turkmenia&#x27;s leadership also began to criticize Moscow&#x27;s economic and political policies as exploitative and detrimental to the well-being and pride of the Turkmen. By a unanimous vote of its Supreme Soviet, Turkmenistan declared its sovereignty in August 1990. In March 1990, Turkmenistan participated in the internationally observed referendum on the future of the Soviet Union, where 98% percent of participants voted in support of the preservation of the Soviet Union. After the August 1991 coup in Moscow, Turkmenia&#x27;s communist leader Saparmurat Niyazov called for a popular referendum on independence. The official result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic&#x27;s Supreme Soviet then declared Turkmenistan&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Republic of Turkmenistan on 27 October 1991. Turkmenistan gained independence from the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.

==Space==

There were two active space facilities in Turkmenistan, in the cities of Turkmenabat and Seydi, both equipped for launch. The Soviet Space Programme had manufactured Proton, Mir and Soyuz rockets and crew bomber missiles during the Cold War.

==Development==
Much of Turkmenistan infrastructure were built out during the Soviet period, such as new cities, institutions, buildings, roads, power stations, hospitals, schools, and factories.

==Russification==
When the Soviets came to power in 1920s, People had to add a Russian suffix to their names. The ending ev/ov was added to male names and eva/ova to female names. In Russian, these endings mean &quot;belonging to&quot;, which was part of the effort to promote the idea of a unified Soviet people.

==Politics==

As with the other Soviet republics, Turkmenistan had followed the Marxist–Leninist ideology governed by the republic&#x27;s sole party, Communist Party of Turkmenistan, a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The politics of Turkmenistan took place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic. The Supreme Soviet was a unicameral legislature of the republic headed by a chairman, with its superiority to both the executive and judicial branches and its members meet in Ashkhabad.

==Religion==
98% of Turkmenistan was Muslim, but atheism was the state religion. In the early 1920s, the Soviet government effectively banned Islam in Soviet Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, every mosque was destroyed, books written in Arabic script were burned, in the 1930s Turkmenistan had eventually adapted the Cyrillic alphabet.

<text>The British decimal two pence coin (often shortened to 2p in writing and speech) is a denomination of sterling coinage equalling of a pound. Since the coin&#x27;s introduction on 15 February 1971, the year British currency was decimalised, its obverse has featured four profiles of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2008 the design on its reverse changed from the original depiction of a plume of ostrich feathers with a coronet to a segment of the Royal Shield.

The two pence coin was originally minted from bronze, but changed in 1992 to copper-plated steel.

As of March 2014 there were an estimated 6.55 billion 2p coins in circulation, corresponding to a value of £131 million.

Two pence coins are legal tender for amounts only up to the sum of 20p when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

== Composition ==
From its first minting in 1971 until 1992, two pence coins were made from bronze. In 1992, this was changed to copper-plated steel because of the increasing price of copper used to make bronze. Both the bronze and steel versions were made in 1992 as it was the transition year, however in 1998 a small quantity of bronze two pences were made alongside the standard copper-plated steel. The number of bronze two pences from this year was 98,676,000 versus the 115,154,000 copper-plate steel. 

By May 2006 the pre-1992 (97% copper) coins contained 3p worth of copper each. In May 2006, about 2.55 billion such coins remained in circulation, and the Royal Mint warned that tampering with coinage is illegal in the UK. During 2008, the value of copper fell dramatically from these peaks.

== Design ==
=== Reverse ===
The original reverse of the coin, designed by Christopher Ironside, and used from 1971 to 2008, is the Badge of the Prince of Wales: a plume of ostrich feathers within a coronet, above the German motto (&quot;I serve&quot;). The numeral &quot;2&quot; is written below the badge, and either (1971–1981) or (from 1982) is written above. A small number of 1983 mintage coins exist with the &quot;New Pence&quot; wording. It was originally planned that an alternative version of the 2p would be minted with a design representing Northern Ireland; these plans never came to fruition. The same design was also re-cut in 1993 producing two minor varieties for that year.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The re-designed 2p coin depicts the second quarter of the shield, showing the Lion Rampant from the Royal Banner of Scotland, with the words above.

The beading was removed from both sides of the coin in the 2008 re-design.

In October 2023 the King Charles III two-pence coin was presented; the reverse features a red squirrel.

=== Obverse ===
Five different obverses were used during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II: four different portraits and the removal of the beaded border in 2008. In all cases, the inscription is , where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. In the original design both sides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as beading. 

Four different portraits of Elizabeth II were used on the coin:

* As with all new decimal currency, until 1984 the portrait of Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wears the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.
* Between 1985 and 1997 the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem. In 1992 the metal used in minting this coin was switched from bronze to copper-plated steel, with a single year of using both alloys in 1998.
* From 1998 to 2015 the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait.
* From 2015 to 2022, coins bore the portrait by Jody Clark.

==Mintages==

Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;0&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.

<text>Bernard Annen Auwen Dowiyogo (14 February 1946 – 9 March 2003) was a Nauruan politician who served as President of Nauru on seven separate occasions. During this time, he also served as a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Ubenide.

==Background and early career==
Dowiyogo was born in Nauru on 14 February 1946. He first became an elected member of Nauru&#x27;s 18-seat parliament in 1973. Particularly in his earlier years in the Parliament of Nauru Dowiyogo was seen as an opponent of Nauru&#x27;s first post-independence President, Hammer DeRoburt. Dowiyogo founded the Nauru Institute of Media and Communications which operated between 1984 and 1996 but due to financial difficulties was closed in 1997.

==President of Nauru==
He served his first term as President from 1976 to 1978 after ousting Hammer DeRoburt. Over the next 25 years, Dowiyogo served as President several times, for periods as long as six years (1989–1995) and as short as 8 days (in January 2003). He was the youngest president in Nauru. During the 1980s, he sharply criticized France and the United States for atomic weapons testing in Nauru.

In 1990, Dowiyogo was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

Dowiyogo closed Nauru&#x27;s offshore banks in 2003 when the US alleged they were used for money laundering.

===Death===
He died in office on March 9, 2003 (having been president on this occasion since January 2003) at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. from heart complications brought on by his struggle with diabetes, a common ailment on Nauru. At the time of the deterioration of his final illness, he had been engaged in protracted negotiations with the United States Government, having traveled to the United States a few weeks prior before he would be treated at the Washington D.C.-based hospital for his heart ailment.

==Family==
Dowiyogo married Christina Dowiyogo (died March 2008) on 14 December 1968. They had eight children: 
Clara Augusta Alefaio (née Dowiyogo) who served at the Nauru education Department but now resides in New Zealand; Valdon Kape Dowiyogo, who served as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru;
Jesaulenko Dowiyogo, who served as diplomat and later Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Nauru Fisheries and Marine Resources Authority; Junior Dowiyogo who served as Commissioner for Police in the Nauru Police Force 
Peter Jason Dowiyogo who worked at the Nauru Post Office; David Dowiyogo who is employed at the Republic of Nauru Hospital; Jeff Dowiyogo who currently resides in Australia; and Zita Dowiyogo who now serves at the Nauru Immigration Office.

<doc id="200125" wikidata="Q5641896" url="?curid=200125" title="Halfpenny (British decimal coin)">
<text>The British decimal halfpenny (p) coin was a denomination of sterling coinage introduced in February 1971, at the time of decimalisation, and was worth of one pound. It was ignored in banking transactions, which were carried out in units of 1p.

The decimal halfpenny had the same value as 1.2 pre-decimal pence, and was introduced to enable the prices of some low-value items to be more accurately translated to the new decimal currency. The possibility of setting prices including an odd half penny also made it more practical to retain the pre-decimal sixpence in circulation (with a value of new pence) alongside the new decimal coinage.

The halfpenny coin&#x27;s obverse featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II; the reverse featured an image of St Edward&#x27;s Crown. It was minted in bronze (like the 1p and 2p coins). It was the smallest decimal coin in both size and value, the size being in proportion to 1p and 2p coins.

The halfpenny soon became Britain&#x27;s least favourite coin. The UK Treasury argued the halfpenny was important in the fight against inflation, as it prevented prices from being rounded up. Nevertheless, the coin was demonetised and withdrawn from circulation in December 1984.

==Design==
The reverse of the coin, designed by Christopher Ironside, was a representation of St Edward&#x27;s Crown, with the numeral &quot;&quot; below the crown, and either (1971–1981) or (1982–1984) above the crown. Only one design for the obverse was used on the halfpenny coin. The inscription around the portrait on the obverse was , where 19xx was the year of minting. Both sides of the coin are encircled by dots, a common feature on coins known as beading.

As on all decimal coins produced before 1984, the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse; in this portrait the Queen wore the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.

== Status ==
The half penny coin was legal tender for amounts not exceeding 20 pence.

==Mintages==

Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;none&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.

==Proposed quarter penny coin==
A decimal quarter-penny coin (to be struck in aluminium) was also proposed (which would have allowed the pre-decimal threepence to continue to circulate with a value of ), but was never produced.

<doc id="200127" wikidata="Q672645" url="?curid=200127" title="Chobham armour">
<text>Chobham armour is the informal name of a composite armour developed in the 1960s at the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment, a British tank research centre on Chobham Lane in Chertsey. The name has since become the common generic term for composite ceramic vehicle armour. Other names informally given to Chobham armour include &quot;Burlington&quot; and &quot;Dorchester&quot;. &quot;Special armour&quot; is a broader informal term referring to any armour arrangement comprising &quot;sandwich&quot; reactive plates, including Chobham armour.

Within the Ministry of Defence (MoD), &quot;Chobham&quot; usually refers specifically to the non-explosive reactive armor &amp; ceramic composites, while &quot;Dorchester&quot; is usually in reference to additional armour packages, primarily composed of explosive reactive armour and spaced armour, although these are often conflated when in colloquial usage.

Although the construction details of the Chobham armour remain a secret, it has been described as being composed of ceramic tiles encased within a metal framework and bonded to a backing plate and several elastic layers. Owing to the extreme hardness of the ceramics used, they offer superior resistance against shaped charges such as high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds and they shatter kinetic energy penetrators.

The armour was first tested in the context of the development of a British prototype vehicle, the FV4211, and first applied on the preseries of the American M1. Only the M1 Abrams, Challenger 1, Challenger 2, and K1 88-Tank have been disclosed as being thus armoured. The framework holding the ceramics is usually produced in large blocks, giving these tanks, and especially their turrets, a distinctive angled appearance.

== Protective qualities ==

Due to the extreme hardness of the ceramics used, the tiles offer superior resistance against a shaped charge jet and they shatter kinetic energy penetrators (KE-penetrators). The (pulverised) ceramic also strongly abrades any penetrator. Against lighter projectiles, the hardness of the tiles causes a &quot;shatter gap&quot; effect: a higher velocity will, within a certain velocity range (the &quot;gap&quot;), not lead to a deeper penetration but destroy the projectile instead.

Because the ceramic is so brittle, the entrance channel of a shaped charge jet is not smooth—as it would be when penetrating a metal—but ragged, causing extreme asymmetric pressures which disturb the geometry of the jet (on which its penetrative capabilities are critically dependent) as its mass is relatively low. This initiates a vicious circle as the disturbed jet causes still greater irregularities in the ceramic, until in the end it is defeated. The newer composites, though tougher, optimise this effect as tiles made with them have a layered internal structure conducive to it, causing &quot;crack deflection&quot;. This mechanism, using a jet&#x27;s own energy against it, has caused the effects of Chobham to be compared to those of reactive armour.

This should not be confused with the effect used in non-explosive reactive armour: that of sandwiching an inert but soft elastic material such as rubber, between two armour plates. The impact of either a shaped charge jet or armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) kinetic energy (KE) long rod penetrators, after the first layer has been perforated and while the rubber layer is being penetrated will cause the rubber to deform and expand, so deforming both the back and front plates. Both attack methods will suffer from obstruction to their expected paths, so experience a greater thickness of armour than there is nominally, thus lowering penetration. Also for rod penetrations, the transverse force experienced due to the deformation may cause the rod to shatter, bend, or only change its path, again lowering penetration.

All versions of Chobham armour have incorporated a large volume of non-energetic reactive armour (NERA) plates, with added hard armour ahead of the NERA (intended to protect the NERA elements and disrupt the penetrator before it encounters the NERA) and/or behind the NERA (intended to catch the fragments of long rods or HEAT jets after they have been fractured or disrupted by the front plate and NERA. This is another factor favouring a slab-sided or wedge-like turret: the amount of material the expanding plates push into the path of an attack increases as they are placed closer to parallel to the direction of that attack.

To date, few Chobham armour-protected tanks have been defeated by enemy fire in combat; the relevance of individual cases of lost tanks for determining the protective qualities of Chobham armour is difficult to ascertain as the extent to which such tanks are protected by ceramic modules is undisclosed.

During the second Iraq war in 2003, a Challenger 2 tank became stuck in a ditch while fighting in Basra against Iraqi forces. The crew remained safe inside for many hours, the Burlington LV2 composite armour protecting them from enemy fire, including multiple rocket-propelled grenades.

== Structure ==

Ceramic tiles have a &quot;multiple hit capability&quot; problem in that they cannot sustain successive impacts without quickly losing much of their protective value. To minimise the effects of this the tiles are made as small as possible, but the matrix elements have a minimal practical thickness of about 25 mm (approximately one inch), and the ratio of coverage provided by tiles would become unfavourable, placing a practical limit at a diameter of about ten centimetres (approximately four inches). The small hexagonal or square ceramic tiles are encased within the matrix either by isostatically pressing them into the heated matrix, or by gluing them with an epoxy resin. Since the early 1990s it has been known that holding the tiles under constant compression by their matrix greatly improves their resistance to kinetic penetrators, which is difficult to achieve when using glues.

The matrix has to be backed by a plate, both to reinforce the ceramic tiles from behind and to prevent deformation of the metal matrix by a kinetic impact. Typically the backing plate has half of the mass of the composite matrix. The assemblage is again attached to elastic layers. These absorb impacts somewhat, but their main function is to prolong the service life of the composite matrix by protecting it against vibrations. Several assemblages can be stacked, depending on the available space; this way the armour can be made modular, to be replaceable, and more adaptable to varied tactical situations. The thickness of a typical assemblage is today about five to six centimetres. Earlier assemblages, so-called &quot;depth of penetration&quot; (DOP) matrices, were thicker. The relative interface defeat component of the protective value of a ceramic is much larger than for steel armour. Using a number of thinner matrices again enlarges that component for the entire armour package, an effect analogous to the use of alternate layers of high hardness and softer steel, which is typical for the glacis of modern Soviet tanks.

Ceramic tiles draw little or no advantage from sloped armour as they lack sufficient toughness to significantly deflect heavy penetrators. Indeed, because a single glancing shot could crack many tiles, the placement of the matrix is chosen so as to optimise the chance of a perpendicular hit, a reversal of the previous desired design feature for conventional armour. Ceramic armour normally even offers better protection for a given areal density when placed perpendicularly than when placed obliquely, because the cracking propagates along the surface normal of the plate. Instead of rounded forms, the turrets of tanks using Chobham armour typically have a slab-sided appearance.

The backing plate reflects the impact energy back to the ceramic tile in a wider cone. This dissipates the energy, limiting the cracking of the ceramic, but also means a more extended area is damaged. Spalling caused by the reflected energy can be reduced by a malleable thin graphite layer on the face of the ceramic absorbing the energy without making it strongly rebound again as a metal face plate would.

Tiles under compression suffer far less from impacts; in their case it can be advantageous to have a metal face plate bringing the tile also under perpendicular compression. The confined ceramic tile then reinforces the metal face plate, a reversal of the normal situation.

A gradual technological development has taken place in ceramic armour: ceramic tiles, in themselves vulnerable to low energy impacts, were first reinforced by gluing them to a backplate; in the nineties their resistance was increased by bringing them under compression on two axes; in the final phase a third compression axis was added to optimise impact resistance. To confine the ceramic core several advanced techniques are used, supplementing the traditional machining and welding, including sintering the suspension material around the core; squeeze casting of molten metal around the core and spraying the molten metal onto the ceramic tile.

=== Material ===
Over the years newer and tougher composites have been developed, giving about five times the protection value of the original pure ceramics, the best of which were again about five times as effective as a steel plate of equal weight. These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or metal matrix composites which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix. The latest developments involve the use of carbon nanotubes to improve toughness even further. Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include boron carbide, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide (sapphire or &quot;alumina&quot;), aluminium nitride, titanium boride and Syndite, a synthetic diamond composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most costly and brittle. Boron carbide composites are today favoured for ceramic plates protecting against smaller projectiles, such as used in body armour and armoured helicopters; this was, in the early sixties, the first general application of ceramic armour. Silicon carbide is better suited to protect against larger projectiles than boron carbide as the latter material suffers a phase collapse when impacted by a projectile travelling at a speed over 850 m/s. The ceramics can be created by pressureless sintering or hot pressing. A high density is required, so residual porosity must be minimised in the final part.

A matrix using a titanium alloy is very costly to produce but the metal is favoured for its lightness, strength, and resistance to corrosion, which is a constant problem.

The backing plate can be made from steel, but, as its main function is to improve the stability and stiffness of the assemblage, aluminium is more weight-efficient in light armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) only to be protected against light anti-tank weapons. A deformable composite backing plate can combine the function of a metal backing plate and an elastic layer.

=== Heavy metal modules ===
The armour configuration of the first western tanks using Chobham armour was optimised to defeat shaped charges as guided missiles were seen as the greatest threat. In the eighties however they began to face the improved Soviet 3BM-32, then 3BM-42 kinetic energy penetrators which the ceramic layer was not particularly effective against: the original ceramics had a resistance against penetrators of about a third compared to that against HEAT rounds; for the newest composites it is about one-tenth. A typical example, the 3BM-42 is a segmented projectile which frontal segments are sacrificed in expanding the NERA plates in the front of the armour array, leaving a hole for the rear segment to strike the ceramic with full efficiency. For this reason many modern designs include added layers of heavy metals to add more density to the overall armour package.

The introduction of more effective ceramic composite materials allows for a larger width of these metal layers within the armour shell: given a certain protection level provided by the composite matrix, it can be thinner. Because these metal layers are denser than the rest of the composite array, increasing their thickness requires reducing the armour thickness in non-critical areas of the vehicle. They typically form an inner layer placed below the much more costly matrix, to prevent extensive damage to it should the metal layer strongly deform but not defeat a penetrator. They can also be used as the backing plate for the matrix itself, but this compromises the modularity and thus tactical adaptability of the armour system: ceramic and metal modules can then no longer be replaced independently. Furthermore, due to their extreme hardness, they deform insufficiently and would reflect too much of the impact energy, and in a too wide cone, to the ceramic tile, damaging it even further. Metals used include a tungsten alloy for the Challenger 2 or, in the case of the M1A1HA (Heavy Armor) and later American tank variants, a depleted uranium alloy. Some companies offer titanium carbide modules.

These metal modules function on the principle of perforated armour (typically employing perpendicular rods), with many expansion spaces reducing the weight by up to one third while keeping the protective qualities fairly constant. The depleted uranium alloy of the M1 has been described as &quot;arranged in a type of armour matrix&quot; and a single module as a &quot;stainless-steel shell surrounding a layer (probably an inch or two thick) of depleted uranium, woven into a wire-mesh blanket&quot;.

Such modules are also used by tanks not equipped with Chobham armour. The combination of a composite matrix and heavy metal modules is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;second generation Chobham&quot;.

==Development and application==

The concept of ceramic armour goes back to 1918, when Major Neville Monroe Hopkins discovered that a plate of ballistic steel was much more resistant to penetration if covered with a thin (1–2 millimetres) layer of enamel. Further, the Germans experimented with ceramic armour in World War I.

Since the early 1960s there were, in the US, extensive research programmes ongoing aimed at investigating the prospects of employing composite ceramic materials as vehicle armour. This research mainly focused on the use of an aluminium metal matrix composite reinforced by silicon carbide whiskers, to be produced in the form of large sheets. The reinforced light metal sheets were to be sandwiched between steel layers. This arrangement had the advantage of having a good multiple-hit capability and of being able to be curved, allowing the main armour to benefit from a sloped armour effect. However, this composite with a high metal content was primarily intended to increase the protection against KE-penetrators for a given armour weight; its performance against shaped charge attack was mediocre and would have to be improved by means of a laminate spaced armour effect, as researched by the Germans within the joint MBT-70 project.

An alternative technology developed in the US was based on the use of glass modules to be inserted into the main armour; although this arrangement offered a better shaped charge protection, its multiple hit capability was poor. A similar system using glass inserts in the main steel armour was from the late fifties researched for the Soviet &quot;Obiekt 430&quot; prototype of the T-64; this was later developed into the &quot;Combination K&quot; type, having a ceramic compound mixed with the silicon oxide inserts, which offered about 50% better protection against both shaped charge and KE-penetrator threats, relative to steel armour of the same weight. It was, later in several improved forms, incorporated into the glacis of many subsequent Soviet main battle tank designs. After an initial period of speculation in the West as to its true nature, the characteristics of this type were disclosed when the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the introduction of a market system forced the Russian industries to find new customers by highlighting its good qualities; it is today rarely referred to as Chobham armour. Special armour much more similar to Chobham appeared in 1983 under the name of BDD on the T-62M upgrade to the T-62, was first integrated to an armour array in 1986 on the T-72B, and has been a feature of every Soviet/Russian MBT since. In its original iteration, it is built directly into the cast steel turret of the T-72 and required lifting it to perform repairs.
In the United Kingdom another line of ceramic armour development had been started in the early 1960s, meant to improve the existing cast turret configuration of the Chieftain that already offered excellent heavy penetrator protection; the research by a team headed by Gilbert Harvey of the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE), therefore was strongly oriented at optimising the ceramic composite system for defeating shaped charge attack. The British system consisted of a honeycomb matrix with ceramic tiles backed by ballistic nylon, placed on top of the cast main armour. In July 1973 an American delegation, in search of a new armour type for the XM815 tank prototype, now that the MBT-70 project had failed, visited Chobham Common to be informed about the British system, the development of which had then cost about £6,000,000; earlier information had already been divulged to the US in 1965 and 1968. It was very impressed by the excellent shaped-charge protection combined with the penetrator impact damage limitation, inherent to the principle of using tiles. The Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory, initiated the development of a version that year named &quot;Burlington&quot;, adapted to the specific American situation, characterised by a much higher projected tank production run and the use of a thinner rolled steel main armour. The increased threat posed by a new generation of Soviet guided missiles armed with a shaped charge warhead, as demonstrated in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, when even older-generation missiles caused considerable tank losses on the Israeli side, made Burlington the preferred choice for the armour configuration of the XM1 (the renamed XM815) prototype.

However, on 11 December 1974 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Federal Republic of Germany and the US about the common future production of a main battle tank; this made any application of Chobham armour dependent on the eventual choice for a tank type. Earlier in 1974 the Americans had asked the Germans to redesign the existing Leopard 2 prototypes, considered by them too lightly armoured, and had suggested adoption of &quot;Burlington&quot; for this purpose, of which type the Germans had already been informed in March 1970; the Germans however in response in 1974 initiated a new armour development programme of their own. Having already designed a system that in their opinion offered satisfactory protection against shaped charges, consisting of multiple-laminate spaced armour with the spaces filled with ceramic polystyrene foam as fitted to the Leopard 1A3, they put a clear emphasis on improving KE-penetrator protection, reworking the system into a perforated metal module armour. A version with added Burlington was considered, including ceramic inserts in the various spaces, but rejected as it would push vehicle weight well over sixty metric tonnes, a weight then seen as prohibitive by both armies. The US Army in the summer of 1974 faced the choice between the German system and their own Burlington, a decision made more difficult because Burlington offered, relative to steel armour, no weight advantage against KE-penetrators: the total armour system would have a RHA equivalence against them of about 350 mm (compared to about 700 mm against shaped charges). No consensus developing, General Creighton Abrams himself decided the issue in favour of Burlington. Eventually each army procured its own national tank design, the project of a common tank failing in 1976. In February 1978 the first tanks protected by Burlington left the factory when the first of eleven pilot M1 tanks were delivered by Chrysler Corporation to the US Army.

Beside these state projects, private enterprise in the US during the 1970s also developed ceramic armour types, like the Noroc armour made by the Protective Products Division of the Norton Company, consisting of boron carbide sheets backed by resin-bonded glass cloth.

In the United Kingdom application of Chobham armour was delayed by the failure of several advanced tank projects: first that of a joint German-British main battle tank; then the purely British MBT-80 programme. A first directive to prepare Chobham armour technology for application in 1975 was already given in 1969. It was determined by a study of a possible Chobham-armour protected MICV that a completely new design using only Chobham armour for the most vulnerable front and side sectors (thus without an underlying steel main armour) could be 10% lighter for the same level of protection against KE-ammunition, but to limit costs it was decided to base the first design on the conventional Chieftain. The prototype, FV 4211 or the &quot;Aluminium Chieftain&quot;, was fitted with a welded aluminium add-on armour, in essence a box on the front hull and front and side turret to contain the ceramic modules, of which box the fifty millimetre thick inner wall due to its relative softness could serve as their backing plate. The extra weight of the aluminium was limited to less than two tonnes and it was shown that it was not overly susceptible to cracking, as first feared. Ten test vehicles were ordered but only the original one had been built when the project was cancelled in favour of the more advanced programmes. However, the Iranian government ordered 1,225 vehicles of an upgraded Chieftain type, the &quot;Shir-2&quot; (FV 4030/3), using the same technology of adding Chobham armour to the main cast armour, bringing total weight to 62 metric tonnes. When this order was cancelled in February 1979 because of the Iranian Revolution, the British government, under pressure to modernise its tank fleet to maintain a qualitative superiority relative to the Soviet tank forces, decided to use the sudden surplus production capacity to procure a number of vehicles very close in design to the Shir-2, called the Challenger 1. On 12 April 1983 the first British tank protected by Chobham armour was delivered to the Royal Hussars.

In France from 1966 GIAT Industries performed experiments aimed at developing a light vehicle ceramic armour, in 1970 resulting in the CERALU-system consisting of aluminium-backed alumina weldable to the vehicle, offering a 50% increase in weight-efficiency against ballistic threats compared to steel plate. An improved version was later applied in helicopter seats.

The latest version of Chobham armour is used on the Challenger 2 (called &quot;Dorchester armour&quot;), and (though the composition most probably differs) the M1 Abrams series of tanks, which according to official sources is currently protected by silicon carbide tiles. Given the publicly stated protection level for the earliest M1: 350 mm steel equivalence against armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) kinetic energy (KE) penetrators, it seems to have been equipped with alumina tiles.

Though it is often claimed to be otherwise, the original production model of the Leopard 2 did not use Chobham armour, but a combined spaced armour and perforated armour configuration, cheaper in terms of procurement, maintenance and replacement than a ceramic armour system. For many modern tanks, such the Italian Ariete, it is yet unknown which type is used. There was a general trend in the 1980s away from ceramic armour towards perforated armour, but even many tanks from the 1970s like the Leopard 1A3 and A4, the French AMX 32 and AMX 40 prototypes used the latter system; the Leclerc has an improved version.

== Future ==
The Challenger 3, the successor to the Challenger 2 in the British Army, will feature Epsom armour.

<text>BAE Systems plc is a British multinational aerospace, defence and information security company, based in London. It is the largest manufacturer in Britain as of 2017. It is the largest defence contractor in Europe and the seventh-largest in the world based on applicable 2021 revenues. Its largest operations are in the United Kingdom and in the United States, where its BAE Systems Inc. subsidiary is one of the six largest suppliers to the US Department of Defense. Its next biggest markets are Saudi Arabia, then Australia; other major markets include Canada, Japan, India, Turkey, Qatar, Oman and Sweden. The company was formed on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion purchase of and merger of Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc (GEC), with British Aerospace, an aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer.

BAE Systems is the successor to various aircraft, shipbuilding, armoured vehicle, armaments and defence electronics companies, including the Marconi Company, the first commercial company devoted to the development and use of radio; A.V. Roe and Company, one of the world&#x27;s first aircraft companies; de Havilland, manufacturer of the Comet, the world&#x27;s first commercial jet airliner; Hawker Siddeley, manufacturer of the Harrier, the world&#x27;s first VTOL attack aircraft; British Aircraft Corporation, co-manufacturer of the Concorde supersonic transport; Supermarine, manufacturer of the Spitfire; Yarrow Shipbuilders, builder of the Royal Navy&#x27;s first destroyers; Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, builder of the world&#x27;s first battlecruiser; and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering, builder of the Royal Navy&#x27;s first submarines.

Since its 1999 formation, BAE Systems has made a number of acquisitions, most notably of Ball Aerospace, United Defense and Armor Holdings of the United States, and has sold its shares in Airbus, Astrium, AMS and Atlas Elektronik. It is involved in several major defence projects, including the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, the Eurofighter Typhoon, and the &quot;Astute&quot;, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and SSN-AUKUS submarines. BAE is listed on the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
===Predecessors===

British Aerospace bought Marconi Electronic Systems for £7.7 billion on 30 November 1999 and merged with it to form BAE Systems. The company is the successor to many of the most famous British aircraft, defence electronics and warship manufacturers. Predecessor companies built the Comet, the world&#x27;s first commercial jet airliner; the Harrier &quot;jump jet&quot;, the world&#x27;s first operational vertical/short take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft; the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; Blue Vixen radar carried by Sea Harrier FA2s and which formed the basis of the Eurofighter&#x27;s CAPTOR radar; and co-produced the Concorde supersonic airliner with Aérospatiale.

British Aerospace was a civil and military aircraft manufacturer, as well as a provider of military land systems. The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II. British Aerospace was formed on 29 April 1977, by the nationalisation and merger of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), the Hawker Siddeley Group and Scottish Aviation. Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions.

Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm the General Electric Company (GEC), dealing largely in military systems integration, as well as naval and land systems. Marconi&#x27;s heritage dates back to Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company, founded in 1897. GEC purchased English Electric (which included Marconi) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses (as GEC-Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems). GEC&#x27;s own defence heritage dates back to World War I, when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position, as the company was involved in important technological advances, notably the cavity magnetron for radar. Between 1945 and 1999, GEC-Marconi/Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world&#x27;s most important defence contractors. GEC&#x27;s major defence related acquisitions included Associated Electrical Industries in 1967, Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1985, Plessey companies in 1989, parts of Ferranti&#x27;s defence business in 1990, the rump of Ferranti when it went into receivership in 1993/1994, Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering in 1995 and Kværner Govan in 1999. In June 1998, MES acquired Tracor, a major American defence contractor, for £830 million (about US$1.4 billion).

===Formation===
The 1997 merger of American corporations Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which followed the formation in 1995 of Lockheed Martin, the world&#x27;s largest defence contractor, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997, British Aerospace Defence managing director John Weston commented &quot;Europe ... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.&quot; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a &quot;European Aerospace and Defence Company&quot;.

As early as 1995, British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. The two companies envisaged including Aérospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation. The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, Aérospatiale and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA into an integrated company; with this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale. As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with Matra and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO Jürgen Schrempp.

Meanwhile, GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, &quot;The Independent&quot; said &quot;some analysts believe that Mr Simpson&#x27;s inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national &#x27;champion&#x27; defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations.&quot; When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999. Evans stated in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA. The merger created a vertically integrated company which &quot;The Scotsman&quot; described as &quot;[a combination of British Aerospace&#x27;s] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi&#x27;s coveted electronics systems capability&quot;, for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft&#x27;s electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES&#x27;s largest customer. In contrast, DASA&#x27;s response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with Aérospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), a horizontal integration.

Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE Systems to the Department of Trade and Industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub-contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries. Another condition was the &quot;firewalling&quot; of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). In 2007 the government announced that it had agreed to release BAE Systems from ten of the undertakings due to &quot;a change in circumstances&quot;.

BAE Systems inherited the UK government-owned &quot;golden&quot; share that was established when British Aerospace was privatised. This unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the company&#x27;s Articles of Association without the permission of the Secretary of State. These Articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than 15% of the company&#x27;s shares.

===2000s===
BAE Systems&#x27; first annual report identified Airbus, support services to militaries and integrated systems for air, land and naval applications as key areas of growth. It also stated the company&#x27;s desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe. BAE Systems described 2001 as an &quot;important year&quot; for its European joint ventures, which were reorganised considerably. The company has described the rationale for expansion in the US; &quot;[it] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined. Importantly, US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe.&quot; When Dick Olver was appointed chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company&#x27;s businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a &quot;strategic bias&quot; for expansion and investment in the US. The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and, with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world. This shift in strategy was described as &quot;remarkable&quot; by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Between 2008 and early 2011 BAE acquired five cybersecurity companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on &quot;traditional defence items such as warships and tanks&quot;.

In 2000 Matra Marconi Space, a joint BAE Systems/Matra company, was merged with the space division of DASA to form Astrium. On 16 June 2003 BAE sold its 25% share of Astrium for £84 million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company, BAE Systems invested an equal amount for &quot;restructuring&quot;. BAE Systems sold its 54% majority share of BAE Systems Canada, an electronics company, in April for CA$310 (approx. £197 million as of December 2010). In November 2001, the company announced the closure of the Avro Regional Jet (Avro RJ) production line at Woodford and the cancellation of the Avro RJX, an advanced series of the aircraft family, as the business was &quot;no longer viable&quot;. The final Avro RJ to be completed became the last British civil airliner. In November 2001 BAE sold its 49.9% share of Thomson Marconi Sonar to Thales for £85 million. A further step of European defence consolidation was the merger of BAE&#x27;s share of Matra BAe Dynamics and the missile division of Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) into MBDA in December. MBDA thus became the world&#x27;s second largest missile manufacturer. Although EADS (now Airbus SE) was later reported to be interested in acquiring full control of MBDA, BAE said that, unlike Airbus, MBDA is a &quot;core business&quot;.
In June 2002, BAE Systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with TRW, an American aerospace, automotive and defence business. This was prompted by Northrop Grumman&#x27;s £4.1 billion (approx. US$6 billion c. 2002) hostile bid for TRW in February 2002. A bidding war between BAE Systems, Northrop and General Dynamics ended on 1 June when Northrop&#x27;s increased bid of £5.1 billion was accepted. On 11 December 2002, BAE Systems issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the Nimrod MRA4 maritime reconnaissance/attack aircraft and the projects. On 19 February 2003 BAE took a charge of £750 million against these projects and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) agreed to pay a further £700 million of the cost. In 2000 the company had taken a £300 million &quot;loss charge&quot; on the Nimrod contract which was expected to cover &quot;all the costs of completion of the current contract&quot;. The troubled Nimrod project would ultimately be cancelled as part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).

The UK government, following a cabinet row described as &quot;one of the most bitter Cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the Westland helicopter affair in 1985&quot;, ordered 20 BAE Hawk trainer aircraft with 24 options in July 2003 in a deal worth £800 million. The deal was significant because it was a factor in India&#x27;s decision to finalise a £1 billion order for 66 Hawks in March 2004. Also in July 2003 BAE Systems and Finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as Eurosystems. These companies would have pooled the avionics, C4ISTAR and communications businesses of the two companies. However the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a re-evaluation of the proposal; BAE Systems&#x27; 2004 Annual Report states that &quot;recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed Eurosystems transaction with Finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model&quot;. The main part of this deal was the dissolution of AMS and the establishment of SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems; BAE Systems sold its 25% share of the latter to Finmeccanica for €400 million (approx. £270 million c. 2007) in March 2007.

In May 2004, it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions, BAE Systems Naval Ships and BAE Systems Submarines. It was understood that General Dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at Barrow-in-Furness, while VT Group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the Clyde. Instead, in 2008 BAE Systems merged its Surface Fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of VT Group to form BVT Surface Fleet, an aim central to the British Government&#x27;s Defence Industrial Strategy.
On 4 June 2004, BAE Systems outbid General Dynamics for Alvis Vickers, the UK&#x27;s main manufacturer of armoured vehicles. Alvis Vickers was merged with the company&#x27;s RO Defence unit to form BAE Systems Land Systems. Recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to General Dynamics, BAE Systems executives soon identified the US defence company United Defense Industries (UDI), a major competitor to General Dynamics, as a main acquisition target. On 7 March 2005 BAE announced the £2.25 billion (approx. US$4.2 billion c. 2005) acquisition of UDI. UDI, now BAE Systems Land and Armaments, manufactures combat vehicles, artillery systems, naval guns, missile launchers and precision guided munitions.

In December 2005, BAE Systems announced the sale of its German naval systems subsidiary, Atlas Elektronik, to ThyssenKrupp and EADS. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; described the sale as &quot;cut price&quot; because French company Thales bid €300 million, but was blocked from purchasing Atlas by the German government on national security grounds. On 31 January 2006 the company announced the sale of BAE Systems Aerostructures to Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., having said as early as 2002 that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a &quot;core business&quot;.

On 18 August 2006 Saudi Arabia signed a contract worth £6 billion to £10 billion for 72 Eurofighter Typhoons, to be delivered by BAE Systems. On 10 September 2006 the company was awarded a £2.5 billion contract for the upgrade of 80 Royal Saudi Air Force Tornado IDSs. One of BAE Systems&#x27; major aims, as highlighted in the 2005 Annual Report, was the granting of increased technology transfer between the UK and the US. The F-35 (JSF) programme became the focus of this effort, with British government ministers such as Lord Drayson, Minister for Defence Procurement, suggesting the UK would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the UK to operate and maintain F-35s independently. On 12 December 2006, Lord Drayson signed an agreement which allows &quot;an unbroken British chain of command&quot; for operation of the aircraft. On 22 December 2006 BAE received a £947 million contract to provide guaranteed availability of Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornados.

In May 2007 the company announced its subsidiary BAE Systems Inc. was to purchase Armor Holdings for £2.3 billion (approx. US$4.5 billion c. 2007) and completed the deal on 31 July 2007. The company was a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies. BAE Systems (and British Aerospace previously) was a technology partner to the McLaren Formula One team from 1996 to December 2007. The partnership originally focused on McLaren&#x27;s F1 car&#x27;s aerodynamics, eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques, wireless systems and fuel management. BAE Systems&#x27; main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of McLaren.

The company announced the acquisition of Tenix Defence, a major Australian defence contractor in January 2008. The purchase was completed on 27 June for A$775 million (£373 million) making BAE Systems Australia that country&#x27;s largest defence contractor. The MoD awarded BAE Systems a 15-year munitions contract in August 2008 worth up to £3 billion, known as Munition Acquisition Supply Solution (MASS). The contract guaranteed supply of 80% of the UK Armed Forces&#x27; ammunition and required BAE to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities. BAE Systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £531 million purchase of Detica Group in July 2008. It continued this strategy with purchases of Danish cyber and intelligence company ETI for approximately $210 million in December 2010, and Norkom Group PLC the following month for €217 million. The latter provides counter fraud and anti-money laundering solutions to the global financial services industry where its software assists institutions to comply with regulations on financial intelligence and monitoring.

====Airbus shareholding====
BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace&#x27;s share of Airbus Industrie, which consisted of two factories at Broughton and Filton. These facilities manufactured wings for the Airbus family of aircraft. In 2001 Airbus was incorporated as Airbus SAS, a joint stock company. In return for a 20% share in the new company BAE Systems transferred ownership of its Airbus plants (known as Airbus UK) to the new company.

Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE Systems wished to sell its 20% share of Airbus, the possibility was denied by the company. However, on 6 April 2006 it was reported that it was indeed to sell its stake, then &quot;conservatively valued&quot; at £2.4 billion. Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations, BAE Systems exercised its put option which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation. Six days after this process began, Airbus announced delays to the A380 with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares. On 2 June 2006 Rothschild valued the company&#x27;s share at £1.87 billion, well below its own analysts&#x27; and even EADS&#x27;s expectations. The BAE Systems board recommended that the company proceed with the sale. Shareholders voted in favour and the sale was completed on 13 October. This saw the end of UK-owned involvement in civil airliner production. Airbus Operations Ltd (the former Airbus UK) continued to be the Airbus &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; for wing production, employing over 9,500 in 2007.

===2010s===
In February 2010 BAE Systems announced a £592 million writedown of the former Armor Holdings business following the loss of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles contract in 2009. It was outbid by Oshkosh Corporation for the £2.3 billion ($3.7 billion) contract. Land and Armaments had been the &quot;star performer&quot; of BAE Systems&#x27; subsidiaries, growing from sales of £482 million in 2004 to £6.7 billion in 2009.

BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace&#x27;s 35% share of Saab AB, with which it produced and marketed the Gripen fighter aircraft. In 2005 it reduced this share to 20.5% and in March 2010 announced its intention to sell the remainder. &quot;The Times&quot; stated that the decision brought &quot;to an end its controversial relationship with the Gripen fighter aircraft&quot;. Several of the export campaigns for the aircraft were subject to allegations of bribery and corruption.

The company continued its move into support services in May 2010 with the purchase of the marine support company Atlantic Marine for $352 million. In September 2010 BAE Systems announced plans to sell the Platform Solutions division of BAE Systems Inc., which the &quot;Financial Times&quot; estimated could yield as much as £1.3 billion. Despite &quot;considerable expressions of interest&quot;, the sale was abandoned in January 2011. The purchases of s, the &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarines, and the Type 26 frigates were all confirmed in the 2010 SDSR. A new generation of nuclear missile submarines, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class, was ordered in 2016.

BAE Systems sold the regional aircraft leasing and asset management arm of its Regional Aircraft business in May 2011. This unit leases the BAe 146/Avro RJ family, BAe ATP, Jetstream and BAe 748. The company retained the support and engineering activities of the business. In September 2011, BAE Systems began consultation with unions and workers over plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs, mostly in the company&#x27;s military aircraft division.

In its 2012 half-year report, the company revealed a 10% decline in revenue in the six months up to 30 June due to falling demand for armaments. In May 2012 the governments of the UK and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement on an arms package which saw a £1.6 billion contract awarded to BAE for the delivery of 55 Pilatus PC-21 and 22 BAE Systems Hawk aircraft. The Sultanate of Oman ordered Typhoon and Hawk aircraft worth £2.5 billion in December 2012.

In September 2012, it was reported that BAE Systems and EADS had entered merger talks which would have seen BAE shareholders own 40% of the resulting organisation. On 10 October 2012, the companies said the merger talks had been called off. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that this was due to the German Government&#x27;s concern about the &quot;potential size of the French shareholding in the combined company, as well as disagreements over the location of the group&#x27;s headquarters&quot;.

In November 2013, BAE Systems announced that shipbuilding would cease in Portsmouth in 2014 with the loss of 940 jobs, and a further 835 jobs would be lost at Filton, near Bristol, and at the shipyards in Govan, Rosyth, and Scotstoun in Scotland. On 9 October 2014, the company announced the loss of 440 management jobs across the country, with 286 of the job cuts in Lancashire.

In July 2014 it announced the acquisition of US intelligence company Signal Innovations Group Inc. to augment imagery and data analysis technologies in its Intelligence &amp; Security business. In August 2014, BAE was awarded a £248 million contract from the British government to build three new offshore patrol vessels. In October 2014, BAE Systems won a £600 million contract from the MoD to maintain Portsmouth naval base for five years. During 2014 BAE Systems acquired US-based cybersecurity firm Silversky for $232.5 million.

During Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s visit to Turkey in January 2017, BAE and TAI officials signed an agreement, worth about £100 million, for BAE to provide assistance in developing the TAI TF Kaan aircraft. On 10 October 2017, BAE announced that it would lay off nearly 2,000 out of its approximately 35,000 employees in Britain, mainly due to an order shortage for the Typhoon fighter.

In 2018, the company agreed a £5 billion with the government of Qatar for 24 Typhoon Eurofighters. 

In 2019 BAE Systems sold a 55% share of its UK land business to Rheinmetall. The resultant joint venture (JV), Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), was established in July 2019 following regulatory approval and is headquartered at the existing facility in Telford, Shropshire.

===2020s===
In August 2020 BAE Systems completed the purchase of United Technologies&#x27; military GPS businesses for $1.9 billion and Raytheon&#x27;s military airborne radios business for $275 million. The sale of these two business was a condition of the merger approval that saw their two parent companies merge to form Raytheon Technologies.

In November 2020, the MoD announced the award of a 20-year, £2.4 billion munitions contract to BAE. This will see BAE manufacture 39 different munitions for the UK armed forces and supersedes the 2008 MASS contract. In July 2023, BAE received a related £280 million order to address a munitions shortage caused by the supply of ammunition to Ukraine.

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, major arms manufacturers, including BAE Systems, reported a sharp increase in interim sales and profits.

In August 2023 BAE agreed to acquire the aerospace division of US-based Ball Corporation for $5.6 billion in cash (approximately £4.5 billion); this was BAE&#x27;s largest acquisition up until that point and was completed on 16 February 2024. In October 2023, BAE was awarded a £3.95 billion contract for development work on Aukus-class submarines up to 2028.

==Products==
BAE Systems plays a significant role in the production of military equipment. In 2017, 98% of BAE Systems&#x27; total sales were military related.

It plays important roles in military aircraft production. The company&#x27;s Typhoon fighter is one of the main front line aircraft of the RAF. The company is a major partner in the F-35 Lightning II programme. Its Hawk advanced jet trainer aircraft has been widely exported. In July 2006, the British government declassified the HERTI (High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion), an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which can navigate autonomously. It is currently developing a sixth-generation jet fighter aircraft for the RAF marketed as the &quot;Tempest&quot; along with the MoD, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo and MBDA. It is intended to enter service from 2035 replacing the Typhoon aircraft in service with the RAF.

BAE Systems Land and Armaments manufactures the M2/M3 Bradley fighting vehicle family, the US Navy Advanced Gun System (AGS), M113 armoured personnel carrier (APC), M109 Paladin, Archer, M777 howitzer, the British Army&#x27;s Challenger 2, Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle, Panther Command and Liaison Vehicle, and the SA80 assault rifle.

Major naval projects include the &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarines, Type 26 frigates and &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class submarines.

BAE Systems is indirectly engaged in production of nuclear weapons – through its share of MBDA it is involved with the production and support of the ASMP missile, an air-launched nuclear missile which forms part of the French nuclear deterrent. The company is also the UK&#x27;s only nuclear submarine manufacturer and thus produces a key element of the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear weapons capability.

BAE has operated the Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee, since 1999, and the Radford Army Ammunition Plant in Radford, Virginia since 2012.

==Areas of business==
BAE Systems&#x27; biggest markets are the US 44%, UK 20%, Saudi Arabia 11% and Australia 4%, as of 2022.

===United Kingdom===
BAE Systems is the main supplier to the UK MoD; in 2009/2010 BAE Systems companies in the list of Top 100 suppliers to the MoD received contracts totalling £3.98 billion, with total revenue being higher when other subsidiary income is included. In comparison, the second largest supplier is Babcock International Group and its subsidiaries, with a revenue of £1.1 billion from the MoD. Oxford Economic Forecasting states that in 2002 the company&#x27;s UK businesses employed 111,578 people, achieved export sales of £3 billion and paid £2.6 billion in taxes. These figures exclude the contribution of Airbus UK.

After its creation, BAE Systems had a difficult relationship with the MoD. This was attributed to deficient project management by the company, but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of &quot;fixed price contracts&quot;. CEO Mike Turner said in 2006 &quot;We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn&#x27;t have taken&quot;. These competition rules were introduced by Lord Levene during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to &quot;cost plus contracts&quot; where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit.

BAE Systems was operating in &quot;the only truly open defence market&quot;, which meant it was competing with US and European companies for British defence projects, while they were protected in their home markets. The US defence market is competitive, however largely between American firms, while foreign companies are excluded. In December 2005 the MoD published the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE Systems as the UK&#x27;s &quot;national champion&quot;. The government claimed the DIS would &quot;promote a sustainable industrial base, that retains in the UK those industrial capabilities needed to ensure national security.&quot;

After the publication of the DIS BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner said &quot;If we didn&#x27;t have the DIS and our profitability and the terms of trade had stayed as they were... then there had to be a question mark about our future in the UK&quot;. Lord Levene said in the balance between value for money or maintaining a viable industrial base the DIS &quot;tries as well as it can to steer a middle course and to achieve as much as it can in both directions. ...We will never have a perfect solution.&quot;

===United States===
The attraction of MES to British Aerospace was largely its ownership of Tracor, a major American defence contractor.

BAE Systems Inc. now sells more to the US Department of Defense (DOD) than to the UK MoD. The company has been allowed to buy important defence contractors in the US, however its status as a UK company requires that its US subsidiaries are governed by American executives under Special Security Arrangements. The company faces fewer impediments in this sense than its European counterparts, as there is a high degree of integration between the US and UK defence establishments. BAE Systems&#x27; purchase of Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems in November 2000 was described by John Hamre, CEO of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Deputy Secretary of Defense, as &quot;precedent setting&quot; given the advanced and classified nature of many of that company&#x27;s products.

The possibility of a merger between BAE Systems Inc. and major North American defence contractors has long been reported, including Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon.

===Rest of the world===
BAE Systems Australia is one of the largest defence contractors in Australia, having more than doubled in size with the acquisition of Tenix Defence in 2008. The Al Yamamah agreements between the UK and Saudi Arabia require &quot;the provision of a complete defence package for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&quot;; BAE Systems employs 5,300 people in the country. As of March 2022, BAE Systems employs over 7,000 people in Saudi Arabia and 75 per cent of the employees are Saudi nationals. BAE Systems&#x27; interests in Sweden are a result of the purchases of Alvis Vickers and UDI, which owned Hägglunds and Bofors respectively; the companies are now part of BAE Systems AB.

On 6 April 2022, BAE Systems announced the establishment of BAE Systems Japan, a subsidiary located in Akasaka, Tokyo, Japan. The new company will provide comprehensive cooperation with Japanese industry and aims to strengthen relations with the Japanese Ministry of Defense and the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

In late August 2023, BAE Systems announced that it had opened an office in Ukraine, and had signed an agreement for cooperation on the repair, spare parts, and production of L119 howitzers within Ukraine.

On 4 January 2024, BAE Systems announced an initial agreement, potentially worth up to $50 million, to resume production of titanium structures for the M777 howitzer for the U.S. Army, with the first deliveries expected in 2025.

==Shareholders==
BAE Systems&#x27; 2022 Annual Report listed the following as &quot;significant&quot; shareholders: Barclays 3.98%, BlackRock 9.90%, Capital Group Companies 14.18%, Invesco 4.97% and Silchester International Investors 3.01%.

==Organisation==

BAE Systems has its head office and its registered office in City of Westminster, London. In addition to its central London offices, it has an office in Farnborough, Hampshire, that houses functional specialists and support functions.

==Corporate governance==
BAE Systems&#x27; Chair is Cressida Hogg, CBE. The executive directors are Charles Woodburn (CEO), Brad Greve and Tom Arsenault. The non-executive directors are Crystal E. Ashby, Elizabeth Corley, Chris Grigg, Ewan Kirk, Ian Tyler, Nicole Piasecki, Stephen Pearce, Jane Griffiths and Nick Anderson.

The company&#x27;s first CEO, John Weston, was forced to resign in 2002 in a boardroom &quot;coup&quot; and was replaced by Mike Turner. &quot;The Business&quot; reported that Weston was ousted when non-executive directors informed the chairman that they had lost confidence in him. Further, it was suggested that at least one non-executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MoD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE Systems and the government. As well as the terms of the Nimrod contract, Weston had fought against the MOD&#x27;s insistence that one of the first three Type 45 destroyers should be built by VT Group. &quot;The Business&quot; said he considered this &quot;competition-policy gone mad&quot;.

It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MoD officials, for example with former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. The first meeting between Hoon and BAE&#x27;s new chairman Dick Olver in 2004 was said to have gone well; a MoD official commented &quot;He is a man we can do business with&quot;. It has been suggested that relations between Turner and Olver were tense. On 16 October 2007 the company announced that Mike Turner would retire in August 2008. &quot;The Times&quot; called his departure plans &quot;abrupt&quot; and a &quot;shock&quot;, given previous statements that he wished to retire in 2013 at the age of 65. Despite suggestions that BAE Systems would prefer an American CEO due to the increasing importance of the United States defence market to the company and the opportunity to make a clean break from corruption allegations and investigations related to the Al-Yamamah contracts, the company announced on 27 June 2008, that it had selected the company&#x27;s chief operating officer, Ian King, to succeed Turner with effect from 1 September 2008. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that King&#x27;s career at Marconi distances him from the British Aerospace-led Al Yamamah project.

Charles Woodburn succeeded Ian King as CEO on 1 July 2017. Woodburn joined BAE Systems in May 2016 as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Board Director following over 20 years&#x27; international experience in senior management positions in the oil and gas industry.

==Corruption investigations==
===Serious Fraud Office===
BAE Systems has been investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for the use of corruption to help sell arms to Chile, Czech Republic, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tanzania and Qatar. In response, BAE Systems&#x27; 2006 Corporate Responsibility Report states &quot;We continue to reject these allegations... We take our obligations under the law extremely seriously and will continue to comply with all legal requirements around the world. In June 2007 Lord Woolf was selected to lead what the BBC described as an &quot;independent review... [an] ethics committee to look into how the defence giant conducts its arms deals&quot;. The report, &quot;Ethical business conduct in BAE Systems plc – the way forward&quot;, made 23 recommendations, measures which the company committed to implement. The finding stated that &quot;in the past BAE did not pay sufficient attention to ethical standards in the way it conducted business&quot;, and was described by the BBC as &quot;an embarrassing admission&quot;.

In September 2009, the SFO announced that it intended to prosecute BAE Systems for offences relating to overseas corruption. &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that a penalty more than £500 million might be an acceptable settlement package. On 5 February 2010, BAE Systems agreed to pay criminal fines of £257 million (US$400 million) to the US and £30 million to the UK. The $400 million fine was a result of a plea bargain with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) whereby BAE Systems was convicted of felony conspiracy to defraud the United States government. This was one of the largest fines in the history of the DOJ. Judge Bates said the company&#x27;s conduct involved &quot;deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law, I think it&#x27;s fair to say, on an enormous scale&quot;. BAE Systems did not directly admit to bribery, and is thus not internationally blacklisted from future contracts. Some of the £30 million penalty the company will pay in fines to the UK will be paid &quot;ex gratia&quot; for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. On 2 March 2010, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) and Corner House Research were successful in gaining a High Court injunction on the SFO&#x27;s settlement with BAE Systems; however in April 2010 the two organisations withdrew their application for a judicial review.

===Saudi Arabia===

Both BAE Systems and its predecessor (BAe) have long been the subject of allegations of bribery in relation to its business in Saudi Arabia. The UK National Audit Office (NAO) investigated the Al Yamamah contracts and has so far not published its conclusions, the only NAO report ever to be withheld. The MoD has stated &quot;The report remains sensitive. Disclosure would harm both international relations and the UK&#x27;s commercial interests.&quot; The company has been accused of maintaining a £60 million Saudi slush fund. In November 2006, Saudi Arabia put pressure on the British government to end the SFO investigation by suspending negotiations over a new deal for seventy-two Typhoon fighter jets. On 14 December 2006 it was announced that the SFO was &quot;discontinuing&quot; its investigation into the company. It stated that representations to its director and the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had led to the conclusion that the wider public interest &quot;to safeguard national and international security&quot; outweighed any potential benefits of further investigation. The termination of the investigation has been controversial. In June 2007, the BBC&#x27;s Panorama alleged BAE Systems &quot;paid hundreds of millions of pounds to the ex-Saudi ambassador to the US, Prince Bandar bin Sultan&quot; in return for his role in the Al Yamamah deals. In late June 2007 the DOJ began a formal investigation into BAE&#x27;s compliance with anti-corruption laws. On 19 May 2008 BAE Systems confirmed that its CEO Mike Turner and non-executive director Nigel Rudd had been detained &quot;for about 20 minutes&quot; at two US airports the previous week and that the DOJ had issued &quot;a number of additional subpoenas in the US to employees of BAE Systems plc and BAE Systems Inc as part of its ongoing investigation&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that such &quot;humiliating behaviour by the DOJ&quot; is unusual toward a company that is co-operating fully.

A judicial review of the decision by the SFO to drop the investigation was granted on 9 November 2007. On 10 April 2008 the High Court ruled that the SFO &quot;acted unlawfully&quot; by dropping its investigation. &quot;The Times&quot; described the ruling as &quot;one of the most strongly worded judicial attacks on government action&quot; which condemned how &quot;ministers &#x27;buckled&#x27; to &#x27;blatant threats&#x27; that Saudi cooperation in the fight against terrorism would end unless the ...investigation was dropped.&quot; On 24 April the SFO was granted leave to appeal to the House of Lords against the ruling. There was a two-day hearing before the Lords on 7 and 8 July 2008. On 30 July the House of Lords unanimously overturned the High Court ruling, stating that the decision to discontinue the investigation was lawful.

===Others===
In September 2005 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that banking records showed that BAE Systems paid £1 million to Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has also reported that &quot;clandestine arms deals&quot; have been under investigation in Chile and the UK since 2003 and that British Aerospace and BAE Systems made a number of payments to Pinochet advisers.

BAE Systems is alleged to have paid &quot;secret offshore commissions&quot; of over £7 million to secure the sale of HMS &quot;London&quot; and HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; to the Romanian Navy. The company received a £116 million contract for the refurbishment of the ships prior to delivery; however the British taxpayer only received the scrap value of £100,000 each from the sale.

BAE Systems ran into controversy in 2002 over the abnormally high cost of a radar system sold to Tanzania. The sale was criticised by several opposition MPs and the World Bank; Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short declared that BAE Systems had &quot;ripped off&quot; developing nations.

In January 2007, details of an investigation by the SFO into BAE Systems&#x27; sales tactics in regard to South Africa were reported, highlighting the £2.3 billion deal to supply Hawk trainers and Gripen fighters as suspect. In May 2011, as allegations of bribery behind South Africa&#x27;s Gripen procurement continued, the company&#x27;s partner Saab AB issued strong denials of any illicit payments being made; however in June 2011 Saab announced that BAE Systems had made unaccounted payments of roughly $3.5 million to a consultant; this revelation prompted South African opposition parties to call for a renewed inquiry. The Gripen&#x27;s procurement by the Czech Republic was also under investigation by the SFO in 2006 over allegations of bribery.

==Criticism==
===Espionage===
In September 2003 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that BAE Systems had hired a private security contractor to collect information about individuals working at CAAT and their activities. In February 2007, it was reported that the corporation had again obtained private confidential information from CAAT.

The company was reported in 2012 to have been the target of Chinese cyber espionage that may have stolen secrets related to the F-35 Lightning II.

In 2020 former employee Simon Finch, who became disillusioned when his reports of homophobic attacks in 2013 were not investigated properly, was convicted of a breach of the Official Secrets Act, after &quot;recording from memory highly sensitive details of a UK missile system.&quot; In November 2020 he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison.

===Cluster bombs===
In 2003, BAE Systems was criticised for its role in the production of cluster bombs, due to the long-term risk for injury or death to civilians. Following the 2008 Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions BAE Systems was among the first defence contractors to stop their manufacture and by 2012 the majority of the munitions had been destroyed.

===Saudi war in Yemen===

Saudi Arabia is BAE&#x27;s third biggest market. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that BAE-supplied aircraft were used to bomb Red Cross and MSF hospitals in Yemen.&quot; Sir Roger Carr rejected criticism over BAE&#x27;s continued work in Saudi Arabia, saying &quot;We will stop doing it when they tell us to stop doing it... We maintain peace by having the ability to make war and that has stood the test of time.&quot; BAE Systems sold weaponry worth £17.6 billion to Saudi Arabia during the Yemen war.

===Israel&#x27;s war in Gaza===
Direct action was taken against arms companies in the United Kingdom, including BAE Systems, that supplied weapons to Israel during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. For instance, on 10 November 2023, trade unionists in Rochester, Kent, blocked the entrances to a BAE Systems factory, stating the facility manufactured military aircraft components used to bomb the Gaza Strip.

===Political influence and donations===
Former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said of his time in office that he &quot;came to learn that the chairman of BAE appeared to have the key to the garden door to number 10. Certainly I never knew No 10 to come up with any decision which would be incommoding to BAE.&quot;

In the United States BAE Systems is a significant political donor to both Democratic and Republican candidates and organisations. In 2016 its political action committee (PAC) contributions were the second largest of any foreign corporation after UBS. In January 2021 following the 2021 United States Capitol attack BAE Systems announced that it was suspending political donations in the US. On 30 March it once again began making large political contributions, including one to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

<text>Hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body. Typically at least the head is involved. The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress.
Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss, alopecia areata, and a thinning of hair known as telogen effluvium. The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male hormones; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy.
Less common causes of hair loss without inflammation or scarring include the pulling out of hair, certain medications including chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition including iron deficiency. Causes of hair loss that occurs with scarring or inflammation include fungal infection, lupus erythematosus, radiation therapy, and sarcoidosis. Diagnosis of hair loss is partly based on the areas affected.
Treatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition, which can also include shaving one&#x27;s head. Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil (or finasteride) and hair transplant surgery. Alopecia areata may be treated by steroid injections in the affected area, but these need to be frequently repeated to be effective. Hair loss is a common problem. Pattern hair loss by age 50 affects about half of men and a quarter of women. About 2% of people develop alopecia areata at some point in time.
== Terminology ==
Baldness is the partial or complete lack of hair growth, and part of the wider topic of &quot;hair thinning&quot;. The degree and pattern of baldness varies, but its most common cause is androgenic hair loss, &quot;alopecia androgenetica&quot;, or &quot;alopecia seborrheica&quot;, with the last term primarily used in Europe.

===Hypotrichosis===
Hypotrichosis is a condition of abnormal hair patterns, predominantly loss or reduction. It occurs, most frequently, by the growth of vellus hair in areas of the body that normally produce terminal hair. Typically, the individual&#x27;s hair growth is normal after birth, but shortly thereafter the hair is shed and replaced with sparse, abnormal hair growth. The new hair is typically fine, short and brittle, and may lack pigmentation. Baldness may be present by the time the subject is 25 years old.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Symptoms of hair loss include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns, dandruff, skin lesions, and scarring. Alopecia areata (mild – medium level) usually shows in unusual hair loss areas, e.g., eyebrows, backside of the head or above the ears, areas the male pattern baldness usually does not affect. In male-pattern hair loss, loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and hair either thins out or falls out. Female-pattern hair loss occurs at the frontal and parietal.

People have between 100,000 and 150,000 hairs on their head. The number of strands normally lost in a day varies but on average is 100. In order to maintain a normal volume, hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is lost. The first signs of hair thinning that people will often notice are more hairs than usual left in the hairbrush after brushing or in the basin after shampooing. Styling can also reveal areas of thinning, such as a wider parting or a thinning crown.
=== Skin conditions ===
A substantially blemished face, back and limbs could point to cystic acne. The most severe form of the condition, cystic acne, arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss and is associated with dihydrotestosterone production.

=== Psychological ===

The psychology of hair thinning is a complex issue. Hair is considered an essential part of overall identity: especially for women, for whom it often represents femininity and attractiveness. Men typically associate a full head of hair with youth and vigor. People experiencing hair thinning often find themselves in a situation where their physical appearance is at odds with their own self-image and commonly worry that they appear older than they are or less attractive to others. Psychological problems due to baldness, if present, are typically most severe at the onset of symptoms.

Hair loss induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. Body image does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. In such cases, patients have difficulties expressing their feelings (alexithymia) and may be more prone to avoiding family conflicts. Family therapy can help families to cope with these psychological problems if they arise.

== Causes ==
Although not completely understood, hair loss can have many causes:

=== Pattern hair loss ===


Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.

=== Infection ===
* Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp
* Fungal infections (such as tinea capitis)
* Folliculitis from various causes
** Demodex folliculitis, caused by &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot;, a microscopic mite that feeds on the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, denies hair essential nutrients and can cause thinning. &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; is not present on every scalp and is more likely to live in an excessively oily scalp environment.
* Secondary syphilis

=== Drugs ===
* Temporary or permanent hair loss can be caused by several medications, including those for blood pressure problems, diabetes, heart disease and cholesterol. Any that affect the body&#x27;s hormone balance can have a pronounced effect: these include the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, steroids and acne medications.
* Some treatments used to cure mycotic infections can cause massive hair loss.
* Medications (side effects from drugs, including chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, and birth control pills)

=== Trauma ===
* Traction alopecia is most commonly found in people with ponytails or cornrows who pull on their hair with excessive force. In addition, rigorous brushing and heat styling, rough scalp massage can damage the cuticle, the hard outer casing of the hair. This causes individual strands to become weak and break off, reducing overall hair volume.
* Frictional alopecia is hair loss caused by rubbing of the hair or follicles, most infamously around the ankles of men from socks, where even if socks are no longer worn, the hair often will not grow back.
* Trichotillomania is the loss of hair caused by compulsive pulling and bending of the hairs. Onset of this disorder tends to begin around the onset of puberty and usually continues through adulthood. Due to the constant extraction of the hair roots, permanent hair loss can occur.
* Traumas such as childbirth, major surgery, poisoning, and severe stress may cause a hair loss condition known as telogen effluvium, in which a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing shedding and subsequent thinning. The condition also presents as a side effect of chemotherapy – while targeting dividing cancer cells, this treatment also affects hair&#x27;s growth phase with the result that almost 90% of hairs fall out soon after chemotherapy starts.
* Radiation to the scalp, as when radiotherapy is applied to the head for the treatment of certain cancers there, can cause baldness of the irradiated areas.

=== Pregnancy ===
Hair loss often follows childbirth in the postpartum period without causing baldness. During pregnancy, the hair is thicker owing to increased circulating estrogens. Approximately three months after giving birth (typically between 2 and 5 months), estrogen levels drop and hair loss occurs, often particularly noticeably around the hairline and temple area. Hair typically grows back normally and treatment is not indicated. A similar situation occurs in women taking the fertility-stimulating drug clomiphene.

=== Other causes ===
* Autoimmune disease. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder also known as &quot;spot baldness&quot; that can result in hair loss ranging from just one location (&quot;Alopecia areata monolocularis&quot;) to every hair on the entire body (&quot;Alopecia areata universalis&quot;). Although thought to be caused by hair follicles becoming dormant, what triggers alopecia areata is not known. In most cases the condition corrects itself, but it can also spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or to the entire body (alopecia universalis).
* Skin diseases and cancer. Localized or diffuse hair loss may also occur in cicatricial alopecia (lupus erythematosus, lichen plano pilaris, folliculitis decalvans, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia, etc.). Tumours and skin outgrowths also induce localized baldness (sebaceous nevus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). Tumor alopecia is the hair loss in the immediate vicinity of either benign or malignant tumors of the scalp.
* Hypothyroidism (an under-active thyroid) and the side effects of its related medications can cause hair loss, typically frontal, which is particularly associated with thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows (also seen with syphilis). Hyperthyroidism (an over-active thyroid) can also cause hair loss, which is parietal rather than frontal.
* Sebaceous cysts. Temporary loss of hair can occur in areas where sebaceous cysts are present for considerable duration (normally one to several weeks).
* Congenital triangular alopecia – It is a triangular, or oval in some cases, shaped patch of hair loss in the temple area of the scalp that occurs mostly in young children. The affected area mainly contains vellus hair follicles or no hair follicles at all, but it does not expand. Its causes are unknown, and although it is a permanent condition, it does not have any other effect on the affected individuals.
* Hair growth conditions. Gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as &quot;involutional alopecia&quot;. This is caused by an increasing number of hair follicles switching from the growth, or anagen, phase into a resting phase, or telogen phase, so that remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. An unhealthy scalp environment can play a significant role in hair thinning by contributing to miniaturization or causing damage.
* Obesity. Obesity-induced stress, such as that induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), targets hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) to accelerate hair thinning in mice. It is likely that similar molecular mechanism play a role in human hair loss.

Other causes of hair loss include:
* Alopecia mucinosa
* Biotinidase deficiency
* Chronic inflammation
* Diabetes
* Pseudopelade of Brocq
* Telogen effluvium
* Tufted folliculitis

===Genetics===
Genetic forms of localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis include:

== Pathophysiology ==
Hair follicle growth occurs in cycles. Each cycle consists of a long growing phase (anagen), a short transitional phase (catagen) and a short resting phase (telogen). At the end of the resting phase, the hair falls out (exogen) and a new hair starts growing in the follicle, beginning the cycle again.

Normally, about 40 (0–78 in men) hairs reach the end of their resting phase each day and fall out. When more than 100 hairs fall out per day, clinical hair loss (telogen effluvium) may occur. A disruption of the growing phase causes abnormal loss of anagen hairs (anagen effluvium).

== Diagnosis ==
Because they are not usually associated with an increased loss rate, male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss do not generally require testing. If hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.
* The pull test helps to evaluate diffuse scalp hair loss. Gentle traction is exerted on a group of hairs (about 40–60) on three different areas of the scalp. The number of extracted hairs is counted and examined under a microscope. Normally, fewer than three hairs per area should come out with each pull. If more than ten hairs are obtained, the pull test is considered positive.
* The pluck test is conducted by pulling hair out &quot;by the roots&quot;. The root of the plucked hair is examined under a microscope to determine the phase of growth, and is used to diagnose a defect of telogen, anagen, or systemic disease. Telogen hairs have tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. Telogen effluvium shows an increased percentage of hairs upon examination. Anagen hairs have sheaths attached to their roots. Anagen effluvium shows a decrease in telogen-phase hairs and an increased number of broken hairs.
* Scalp biopsy is used when the diagnosis is unsure; a biopsy allows for differing between scarring and nonscarring forms. Hair samples are taken from areas of inflammation, usually around the border of the bald patch.
* Daily hair counts are normally done when the pull test is negative. It is done by counting the number of hairs lost. The hair from the first morning combing or during washing should be counted. The hair is collected in a clear plastic bag for 14 days. The strands are recorded. If the hair count is &gt;100/day, it is considered abnormal except after shampooing, where hair counts will be up to 250 and be normal.
* Trichoscopy is a noninvasive method of examining hair and scalp. The test may be performed with the use of a handheld dermoscope or a video dermoscope. It allows differential diagnosis of hair loss in most cases.

There are two types of identification tests for female pattern baldness: the Ludwig Scale and the Savin Scale. Both track the progress of diffused thinning, which typically begins on the crown of the head behind the hairline, and becomes gradually more pronounced. For male pattern baldness, the Hamilton–Norwood scale tracks the progress of a receding hairline and/or a thinning crown, through to a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair around the head and on to total baldness.

In almost all cases of thinning, and especially in cases of severe hair loss, it is recommended to seek advice from a doctor or dermatologist. Many types of thinning have an underlying genetic or health-related cause, which a qualified professional will be able to diagnose.

== Management ==
=== Hiding hair loss ===
==== Head ====
One method of hiding hair loss is the comb over, which involves restyling the remaining hair to cover the balding area. It is usually a temporary solution, useful only while the area of hair loss is small. As the hair loss increases, a comb over becomes less effective.

Another method is to wear a hat or a hairpiece such as a wig or toupee. The wig is a layer of artificial or natural hair made to resemble a typical hair style. In most cases the hair is artificial. Wigs vary widely in quality and cost. In the United States, the best wigsthose that look like real haircost up to tens of thousands of dollars. Organizations also collect individuals&#x27; donations of their own natural hair to be made into wigs for young cancer patients who have lost their hair due to chemotherapy or other cancer treatment in addition to any type of hair loss.

==== Eyebrows ====
Though not as common as the loss of hair on the head, chemotherapy, hormone imbalance, forms of hair loss, and other factors can also cause loss of hair in the eyebrows. Loss of growth in the outer one third of the eyebrow is often associated with hypothyroidism. Artificial eyebrows are available to replace missing eyebrows or to cover patchy eyebrows. Eyebrow embroidery is another option which involves the use of a blade to add pigment to the eyebrows. This gives a natural 3D look for those who are worried about an artificial look and it lasts for two years. Micropigmentation (permanent makeup tattooing) is also available for those who want the look to be permanent.

=== Medications ===

Treatments for the various forms of hair loss have limited success. Three medications have evidence to support their use in male pattern hair loss: minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride. They typically work better to prevent further hair loss, than to regrow lost hair. On June 13, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Olumiant (baricitinib) for adults with severe alopecia areatal. It is the first FDA approved drug for systemic treatment, or treatment for any area of the body.
* Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a nonprescription medication approved for male pattern baldness and alopecia areata. In a liquid or foam, it is rubbed into the scalp twice a day. Some people have an allergic reaction to the propylene glycol in the minoxidil solution and a minoxidil foam was developed without propylene glycol. Not all users will regrow hair. Minoxidil may also be taken orally although this route of administration is not approved by the FDA. The longer the hair has stopped growing, the less likely minoxidil will regrow hair. Minoxidil is not effective for other causes of hair loss. Hair regrowth can take 1 to 6 months to begin. Treatment must be continued indefinitely. If the treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes. Any regrown hair and any hair susceptible to being lost, while Minoxidil was used, will be lost. Most frequent side effects are mild scalp irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and unwanted hair in other parts of the body.
* Finasteride (Propecia) is used in male-pattern hair loss in a pill form, taken 1 milligram per day. It is not indicated for women and is not recommended in pregnant women (as it is known to cause birth defects in fetuses). Treatment is effective starting within 6 weeks of treatment. Finasteride causes an increase in hair retention, the weight of hair, and some increase in regrowth. Side effects in about 2% of males include decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Treatment should be continued as long as positive results occur. Once treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes.
* Corticosteroids injections into the scalp can be used to treat alopecia areata. This type of treatment is repeated on a monthly basis. Oral pills for extensive hair loss may be used for alopecia areata. Results may take up to a month to be seen.
* Immunosuppressants applied to the scalp have been shown to temporarily reverse alopecia areata, though the side effects of some of these drugs make such therapy questionable.
* There is some tentative evidence that anthralin may be useful for treating alopecia areata.
* Hormonal modulators (oral contraceptives or antiandrogens such as spironolactone and flutamide) can be used for female-pattern hair loss associated with hyperandrogenemia.

=== Surgery ===
Hair transplantation is usually carried out under local anesthetic. A surgeon will move healthy hair from the back and sides of the head to areas of thinning. The procedure can take between four and eight hours, and additional sessions can be carried out to make hair even thicker. Transplanted hair falls out within a few weeks, but regrows permanently within months.
* Surgical options, such as follicle transplants, scalp flaps, and hair loss reduction, are available. These procedures are generally chosen by those who are self-conscious about their hair loss, but they are expensive and painful, with a risk of infection and scarring. Once surgery has occurred, six to eight months are needed before the quality of new hair can be assessed.
** Scalp reduction is the process of decreasing of the area of bald skin on the head. In time, the skin on the head becomes flexible and stretched enough that some of it can be surgically removed. After the hairless scalp is removed, the space is closed with hair-covered scalp. Scalp reduction is generally done in combination with hair transplantation to provide a natural-looking hairline, especially those with extensive hair loss.
** Hairline lowering can sometimes be used to lower a high hairline secondary to hair loss, although there may be a visible scar after further hair loss.
* Wigs are an alternative to medical and surgical treatment; some patients wear a wig or hairpiece. They can be used permanently or temporarily to cover the hair loss. High-quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available.

=== Chemotherapy ===
Hypothermia caps may be used to prevent hair loss during some kinds of chemotherapy, specifically, when taxanes or anthracyclines are administered. It is not recommended to be used when cancer is present in the skin of the scalp or for lymphoma or leukemia. There are generally only minor side effects from scalp cooling given during chemotherapy.

=== Embracing baldness ===

Instead of attempting to conceal their hair loss, some people embrace it by either doing nothing about it or sporting a shaved head. The general public became more accepting of men with shaved heads in the early 1950s, when Russian-American actor Yul Brynner began sporting the look; the resulting phenomenon inspired many of his male fans to shave their heads. Male celebrities then continued to bring mainstream popularity to shaved heads, including athletes such as Michael Jordan and Zinedine Zidane and actors such as Dwayne Johnson, Ben Kingsley, and Jason Statham. Female baldness is still viewed as less normal in various parts of the world.

=== Alternative medicine ===
Dietary supplements are not typically recommended. There is only one small trial of saw palmetto which shows tentative benefit in those with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia. There is no evidence for biotin. Evidence for most other alternative medicine remedies is also insufficient. There was no good evidence for ginkgo, aloe vera, ginseng, bergamot, hibiscus, or sophora as of 2011.

Many people use unproven treatments to treat hair loss. Egg oil, in Indian, Japanese, Unani (Roghan Baiza Murgh) and Chinese traditional medicine, was traditionally used as a treatment for hair loss.

== Research ==
Research is looking into connections between hair loss and other health issues. While there has been speculation about a connection between early-onset male pattern hair loss and heart disease, a review of articles from 1954 to 1999 found no conclusive connection between baldness and coronary artery disease. The dermatologists who conducted the review suggested further study was needed.

Environmental factors are under review. A 2007 study indicated that smoking may be a factor associated with age-related hair loss among Asian men. The study controlled for age and family history, and found statistically significant positive associations between moderate or severe male pattern hair loss and smoking status.

Vertex baldness is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and the relationship depends upon the severity of baldness, while frontal baldness is not. Thus, vertex baldness might be a marker of CHD and is more closely associated with atherosclerosis than frontal baldness.

=== Hair follicle aging ===

A key aspect of hair loss with age is the aging of the hair follicle. Ordinarily, hair follicle renewal is maintained by the stem cells associated with each follicle. Aging of the hair follicle appears to be primed by a sustained cellular response to the DNA damage that accumulates in renewing stem cells during aging. This damage response involves the proteolysis of type XVII collagen by neutrophil elastase in response to DNA damage in hair follicle stem cells. Proteolysis of collagen leads to elimination of the damaged cells and, consequently, to terminal hair follicle miniaturization.

=== Hedgehog signaling ===

In June 2022 the University of California, Irvine announced that researchers have discovered that hedgehog signaling in murine fibroblasts induces new hair growth and hair multiplication while hedgehog activation increases fibroblast heterogeneity and drives new cell states. A new signaling molecule called SCUBE3 potently stimulates hair growth and may offer a therapeutic treatment for androgenetic alopecia.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;alopecia&quot; () is from the Classical Greek , &quot;alōpēx&quot;, meaning &quot;fox&quot;. The origin of this usage is because this animal sheds its coat twice a year, or because in ancient Greece foxes often lost hair because of mange.

<doc id="200136" wikidata="Q845744" url="?curid=200136" title="Static electricity">
<text>Static electricity is an imbalance of electric charges within or on the surface of a material. The charge remains until it can move away by an electric current or electrical discharge. The word &quot;static&quot; is used to differentiate it from current electricity, where an electric charge flows through an electrical conductor.

A static electric charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and/or slide against each other and then separate. The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can feel, hear, and even see sparks if the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to an electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shockmore specifically, an electrostatic dischargeis caused by the neutralization of a charge.

==Causes==
Materials are made of atoms that are normally electrically neutral because they contain equal numbers of positive charges (protons in their nuclei) and negative charges (electrons in &quot;shells&quot; surrounding the nucleus). The phenomenon of static electricity requires a separation of positive and negative charges. When two materials are in contact, electrons may move from one material to the other, which leaves an excess of positive charge on one material, and an equal negative charge on the other. When the materials are separated, they retain this charge imbalance. It is also possible for ions to be transferred.

=== Contact-induced charge separation ===
Electrons or ions can be exchanged between materials on contact or when they slide against each other, which is known as the triboelectric effect and results in one material becoming positively charged and the other negatively charged. The triboelectric effect is the main cause of static electricity as observed in everyday life, and in common high-school science demonstrations involving rubbing different materials together (e.g., fur against an acrylic rod). Contact-induced charge separation causes one&#x27;s hair to stand up and causes &quot;static cling&quot; (for example, a balloon rubbed against the hair becomes negatively charged; when near a wall, the charged balloon is attracted to positively charged particles in the wall, and can &quot;cling&quot; to it, suspended against gravity).

=== Pressure-induced charge separation ===
Applied mechanical stress generates a electric polarization and in turn this can lead to separation of charge in many types of materials. The free carriers at the surface of a material compensate for the polarization induced by the strains.

=== Heat-induced charge separation ===

Heating can generate electric polarization, which in turn can lead a separation of charge in certain materials. All pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric and do not have inversion symmetry.

=== Charge-induced charge separation ===

A charged object brought close to an electrically neutral conductive object causes a separation of charge within the neutral object. This is called electrostatic induction. Charges of the same polarity are repelled and move to the side of the object away from the external charge, and charges of the opposite polarity are attracted and move to the side facing the charge. As the force due to the interaction of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance, the effect of the closer (opposite polarity) charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction. Careful grounding of part of an object can permanently add or remove electrons, leaving the object with a global, permanent charge.

==Removal and prevention==


Removing or preventing a buildup of static charge can be as simple as opening a window or using a humidifier, to increase the moisture content of the air, making the atmosphere more conductive. Air ionizers can perform the same task.

Items that are particularly sensitive to static discharge may be treated with the application of an antistatic agent, which adds a conducting surface layer that ensures any excess charge is evenly distributed. Fabric softeners and dryer sheets used in washing machines and clothes dryers are an example of an antistatic agent used to prevent and remove static cling.

Many semiconductor devices used in electronics are particularly sensitive to static discharge. Conductive antistatic bags are commonly used to protect such components. People who work on circuits that contain these devices often ground themselves with a conductive antistatic strap.

In the industrial settings such as paint or flour plants as well as in hospitals, antistatic safety boots are sometimes used to prevent a buildup of static charge due to contact with the floor. These shoes have soles with good conductivity. Anti-static shoes should not be confused with insulating shoes, which provide exactly the opposite benefit some protection against serious electric shocks from the mains voltage.

Within medical cable assemblies and lead wires, random triboelectric noise is generated when the various conductors, insulation, and fillers rub against each other as the cable is flexed during movement. Noise generated within a cable is often called handling noise or cable noise, but this type of unwanted signal is more accurately described as triboelectric noise. When measuring low-level signals, noise in cable or wire may present a problem. For example, the noise in an ECG or another medical signal may make accurate diagnosis difficult or even impossible. Keeping triboelectric noise at acceptable levels requires careful material selection, design, and processing as cable material is manufactured.

==Static discharge==
The spark associated with static electricity is caused by electrostatic discharge, or simply static discharge, as excess charge is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings.

The feeling of an electric shock is caused by the stimulation of nerves as the current flows through the human body. The energy stored as static electricity on an object varies depending on the size of the object and its capacitance, the voltage to which it is charged, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. For modelling the effect of static discharge on sensitive electronic devices, a human being is represented as a capacitor of 100 picofarads, charged to a voltage of 4,000 to 35,000 volts. When touching an object this energy is discharged in less than a microsecond. While the total energy is small, on the order of millijoules, it can still damage sensitive electronic devices. Larger objects will store more energy, which may be directly hazardous to human contact or which may give a spark that can ignite flammable gas or dust.

===Lightning===


Lightning is a dramatic natural example of static discharge. While the details are unclear and remain a subject of debate, the initial charge separation is thought to be associated with contact between ice particles within storm clouds. In general, significant charge accumulations can only persist in regions of low electrical conductivity (very few charges free to move in the surroundings), hence the flow of neutralizing charges often results from neutral atoms and molecules in the air being torn apart to form separate positive and negative charges, which travel in opposite directions as an electric current, neutralizing the original accumulation of charge. The static charge in air typically breaks down in this way at around 10,000 volts per centimeter (10 kV/cm) depending on humidity. The discharge superheats the surrounding air causing the bright flash, and produces a shock wave causing the booming sound. A lightning bolt is simply a scaled-up version of the sparks seen in more domestic occurrences of static discharge. The flash occurs because the air in the discharge channel is heated to such a high temperature that it emits light by incandescence. The clap of thunder is the result of the shock wave created as the superheated air expands.

===Electronic components===
Many semiconductor devices used in electronics are very sensitive to the presence of static electricity and can be damaged by a static discharge.
The use of an antistatic strap is mandatory for researchers manipulating nanodevices.
Further precautions can be taken by taking off shoes with thick rubber soles and permanently staying with a metallic ground.

===Static build-up in flowing flammable and ignitable materials===

Discharge of static electricity can create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark might ignite explosive mixtures.

The flowing movement of finely powdered substances or low conductivity fluids in pipes or through mechanical agitation can build up static electricity.
The flow of granules of material such as sand down a plastic chute can transfer charge, which can be measured using a multimeter connected to metal foil lining the chute at intervals, and can be roughly proportional to particulate flow. Dust clouds of finely powdered substances can become combustible or explosive. When there is a static discharge in a dust or vapor cloud, explosions have occurred. Among the major industrial incidents that have occurred due to static discharge are the explosion of a grain silo in southwest France, a paint plant in Thailand, a factory making fiberglass moldings in Canada, a storage tank explosion in Glenpool, Oklahoma in 2003, and a portable tank filling operation and a tank farm in Des Moines, Iowa and Valley Center, Kansas in 2007.

The ability of a fluid to retain an electrostatic charge depends on its electrical conductivity. When low conductivity fluids flow through pipelines or are mechanically agitated, contact-induced charge separation called flow electrification occurs.
Fluids that have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivity above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge accumulation is not significant. In the petrochemical industry, 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.

Kerosines may have conductivity ranging from less than 1 picosiemens per meter to 20 pS/m. For comparison, deionized water has a conductivity of about 10,000,000 pS/m or 10 μS/m.

Transformer oil is part of the electrical insulation system of large power transformers and other electrical apparatus. Re-filling of large apparatus requires precautions against electrostatic charging of the fluid, which may damage sensitive transformer insulation.

An important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant τ (tau) of an RC circuit. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/m has an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge in a fluid dissipates almost completely after four to five times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.

Charge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes 8 inches (200 mm) or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes pipe flow velocity limits. Because water content has a large impact on the fluids dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited to 1 meter per second.

Bonding and earthing are the usual ways charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required. 

====Fueling operations====
The flowing movement of flammable liquids like gasoline inside a pipe can build up static electricity. Non-polar liquids such as gasoline, toluene, xylene, diesel, kerosene and light crude oils exhibit significant ability for charge accumulation and charge retention during high velocity flow. Electrostatic discharges can ignite the fuel vapor.
When the electrostatic discharge energy is high enough, it can ignite a fuel vapor and air mixture. Different fuels have different flammable limits and require different levels of electrostatic discharge energy to ignite.

Electrostatic discharge while fueling with gasoline is a present danger at gas stations. Fires have also been started at airports while refueling aircraft with kerosene. New grounding technologies, the use of conducting materials, and the addition of anti-static additives help to prevent or safely dissipate the buildup of static electricity. Customers who need to fill containers at gas stations are advised to set them on the ground first so that any static buildup will dissipate without risk of fire or explosion.

The flowing movement of gases in pipes alone creates little, if any, static electricity. It is envisaged that a charge generation mechanism only occurs when solid particles or liquid droplets are carried in the gas stream.

===In space exploration===
Due to the extremely low humidity in extraterrestrial environments, very large static charges can accumulate, causing a major hazard for the complex electronics used in space exploration vehicles. Static electricity is thought to be a particular hazard for astronauts on planned missions to the Moon and Mars. Walking over the extremely dry terrain could cause them to accumulate a significant amount of charge; reaching out to open the airlock on their return could cause a large static discharge, potentially damaging sensitive electronics.

===Ozone cracking===

A static discharge in the presence of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.

==Energies involved==
The energy released in a static electricity discharge may vary over a wide range. The energy in joules can be calculated from the capacitance (&quot;C&quot;) of the object and the static potential &quot;V&quot; in volts (V) by the formula &quot;E&quot; = ½&quot;CV&quot;2. One experimenter estimates the capacitance of the human body as high as 400 picofarads, and a voltage of 50,000 volts, discharged e.g. during touching a charged car, creating a spark with energy of 500 millijoules. Another estimate is 100–300 pF and 20,000 volts, producing a maximum energy of 60 mJ. IEC 479-2:1987 states that a discharge with energy greater than 5000 mJ is a direct serious risk to human health. IEC 60065 states that consumer products cannot discharge more than 350 mJ into a person.

The maximal potential is limited to about 35–40 kV, due to corona discharge dissipating the charge at higher potentials. Potentials below 3000 volts are not typically detectable by humans. Maximal potential commonly achieved on human body range between 1 and 10 kV, though in optimal conditions as high as 20–25 kV can be reached. Low relative humidity increases the charge buildup; walking 20 feet (6 m) on vinyl floor at 15% relative humidity causes buildup of voltage up to 12 kV, while at 80% humidity the voltage is only 1.5 kV.

As little as 0.2 millijoules may present an ignition hazard; such low spark energy is often below the threshold of human visual and auditory perception.

Typical ignition energies are:
* 0.017 mJ for hydrogen,
* 0.2–2 mJ for hydrocarbon vapors,
* 1–50 mJ for fine flammable dust,
* 40–1000 mJ for coarse flammable dust.

The energy needed to damage most electronic devices is between 2 and 1000 nanojoules.

A relatively small energy, often as little as 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor–air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimal flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam on the surface of a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.

There are five types of electrical discharges:
* Spark, responsible for the majority of industrial fires and explosions where static electricity is involved. Sparks occur between objects at different electric potentials. Good grounding of all parts of the equipment and precautions against charge buildups on equipment and personnel are used as prevention measures.
* Brush discharge occurs from a nonconductive charged surface or highly charged nonconductive liquids. The energy is limited to roughly 4 millijoules. To be hazardous, the voltage involved must be above about 20 kilovolts, the surface polarity must be negative, a flammable atmosphere must be present at the point of discharge, and the discharge energy must be sufficient for ignition. Further, because surfaces have a maximal charge density, an area of at least 100 cm2 has to be involved. This is not considered to be a hazard for dust clouds.
* Propagating brush discharge is high in energy and dangerous. Occurs when an insulating surface of up to 8 mm thick (e.g. a teflon or glass lining of a grounded metal pipe or a reactor) is subjected to a large charge buildup between the opposite surfaces, acting as a large-area capacitor.
* Cone discharge, also called bulking brush discharge, occurs over surfaces of charged powders with resistance above 1010 ohms, or also deep through the powder mass. Cone discharges are not usually observed in dust volumes below 1 m3. The energy involved depends on the grain size of the powder and the charge magnitude, and can reach up to 20 mJ. Larger dust volumes produce higher energies.
* Corona discharge, considered non-hazardous.

<text>The Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Clark County, Nevada, United States, is an area managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of its National Landscape Conservation System, and protected as a National Conservation Area. It is about west of Las Vegas. More than three million people visit the area each year.

The conservation area showcases a set of large red rock formations: a set of sandstone peaks and walls that were formed by thrust faults including the Keystone Thrust. The walls are up to high, making them a popular hiking and rock climbing destination. The highest point is La Madre Mountain, at .

A one-way, loop road, long, provides vehicle access to many of the features in the area. Several side roads and parking areas allow access to many of the area trails. A visitor center is at the start of the loop road. The loop road is also popular for bicycle touring; it begins with a moderate climb, then is mostly downhill or flat.

The Rocky Gap Road in Red Rock Canyon NCA is a side canyon accessible only by an unmaintained primitive road from the scenic loop which mostly only off-road or high-clearance vehicles can access. State Route 159 cuts through the Cottonwood Valley, also a side trail of the Old Spanish Trail. The Wilson Cliffs, a massive escarpment, can be seen to the west from SR 159.

Toward the southern end of the National Conservation Area are Spring Mountain Ranch State Park; the town of Blue Diamond; and Bonnie Springs Ranch, which includes a replica of a western ghost town, but which in 2019 was sold and closed to the public.

==History==

===Native Americans===
The first humans were attracted to the Red Rock area due to its resources of water, plant, and animal life that could not be easily found in the surrounding desert. Hunters and gatherers such as the historical Southern Paiute and the much older Archaic, or Desert Culture Native Americans, have successively occupied this area.

As many as six different Native American cultures may have been present at Red Rock over the millennia. The following chronology is an approximation, from the present to ancient pre-history:
*Southern Paiute: 900 to modern times
*Patayan Culture: 900 to early historic times in the 1800s
*Ancestral Puebloan: 1 AD to 1150
*Pinto/Gypsum: (Archaic) 3500 BC to 1 AD
*San Dieguito: 7000 to 5500 BC
*Paleo-Indians (Tule Springs): 11,000 to 8000 BC

Numerous petroglyphs, as well as pottery fragments, remain today throughout the area. In addition, several roasting pits used by the early Native Americans at Red Rock provide further evidence of human activity in the past.

===Modern history===
In the early 20th century, around the time the first European Americans settled in nearby Las Vegas, the Excelsior Company operated a small sandstone quarry near the northern area of the scenic loop. It proved to be uneconomical and was shut down. Evidence of the quarry&#x27;s existence includes some of the huge sandstone blocks that have been left behind.

The Red Rocks have been a film location for such movies as Roy Rogers and his horse Trigger in &quot;Bells of San Angelo&quot; (1947) and was a location for &quot;The Stalking Moon&quot; with Gregory Peck in 1968.

In 1967, the Bureau of Land Management designated as the Red Rock Recreation Lands. In 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on Federal Conservation Areas held a special hearing in the Foley Federal Office Building in downtown Las Vegas to review a legislative resolution sponsored by Nevada&#x27;s lone Congressman, David Towell (R-NV) to establish the Red Rock Conservation Area by transferring Federal land to the State of Nevada. Testimony in favor of the bill was given by the Sierra Club and a high school student and environmental activist, Dennis Causey. The subcommittee unanimously approved the resolution, sending it to the full Committee on the Interior and subsequently to the full House, followed by favorable action by the U S. Senate and approval by President George H. W. Bush. Further legislation in 1990 changed the status of the Red Rock Recreation Lands to a National Conservation Area, a status that also provides funds to maintain and protect it. The Federal area was adjacent to the Red Rock State Park.

The Howard Hughes Corporation, developer of Summerlin, has transferred land adjacent to the protected area, to provide a buffer between the development and the conservation area. Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area is adjacent to the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area on the west side.

==Biology==
The conservation area is one of the easternmost parts of the Mojave Desert; the lowest elevation of the area, from , is in the Lower Sonoran Zone, while the area from up is in the Upper Sonoran Zone. The character of the sandstone layers is such that several year-round springs may be found in the recesses of the side canyons.

Some 600 species of plants are known in the area. Common types in the valley floor include the Joshua tree, Mojave yucca, banana yucca, creosote, and blackbrush. Higher up the Utah juniper and Sonoran scrub oak (also called scrub live oak) come to dominate. Agave is easy to spot in red rock niches, with its thick, low leaves and flowering stem reaching twice a man&#x27;s height. The Calico Tanks trail has a plaque about prehistoric agave roasting pits. Ponderosa pines may be found at the top of the valley, where it connects to the Spring Mountains.

Wild burros are a familiar sight, as are rabbits and ground squirrels. Desert bighorn sheep are occasionally seen at higher elevations. During rare spring and summer rainstorms, tiny red-spotted toads can emerge from water pools.

The Conservation Area is a protected habitat for the desert tortoise. A habitat at the Visitor Center houses eight females and two males.

==Climate==
==Geology==
The Red Rock area has a complex geological history, which over millions of years, helped create the region&#x27;s dramatic landscape.

The Red Rock area was under an ocean basin during the Paleozoic Era 600 million years ago. Up to of limey sediments were deposited and eventually lithified to limestone.
During the Mesozoic Era 250 million years ago, the Earth&#x27;s crust started to rise due to tectonic shifts, and marine shales and sandstones were deposited. As the basin became isolated evaporite formations of salt and gypsum were deposited. Oxidation of the iron minerals in the sediments resulted in the red colors of some of the rocks. Deposition by streams and in swamp environments resulted in the formation of petrified wood in the area.

By 180 million years ago, the climate continued to change and the area became a desert with vast expanses of huge shifting sand dunes. These dunes accumulated over a broad area, up to thick, and were lithified, cemented with calcium carbonate and iron oxides. They developed as the colorful Aztec Sandstone.

During a mountain-building period called the Laramide orogeny around 66 million years ago, the Keystone Thrust Fault developed. The Keystone is part of a series of thrust faults that ran through much of western North America and the Red Rock Conservation Area. The movement of this fault forced the older gray sedimentary rock over the younger red rocks, forming the varicolored landscape that can be seen in the mountain today. The thrust is exposed over a distance of along the Red Rock escarpment.

The Lee Canyon thrust plate may contain over 4,000 ft (1,200 m) of terrigenous rocks at the base. The Wheeler Pass thrust may contain at least 11,000 ft (3,300 m) of these rocks as well.

==Recreational activities==

Red Rock provides a wide variety of recreational activities, the most popular being hiking, biking, rock scrambling, and rock climbing. Horseback riding and camping are also allowed on specific trails and in designated areas. Automobile (Flat4LV) and motorcycle (Roughriders) clubs often conduct group drives through the 13-mile scenic drive. ATV use is not permitted in the area.

Aside from the dangers of climbing rock faces and cliffs, visitors are informed that temperatures can routinely exceed in the summer, so they must bring plenty of water. Visitors hiking into the backcountry off established trails are advised against traveling alone and should inform other people of their plans. Risks include the presence of venomous rattlesnakes and flash flooding/lightning from thunderstorms.

===Rock climbing===
Although the Yosemite-size walls offer a host of challenging lines, technical climbing activity in Red Rock was not recorded before 1968. The first modern routes, climbed in the early 1970s, are described in several books. The rock is Aztec Sandstone, a relatively solid variety with hard surface varnish. Many climbs involve ascents of single crack systems hundreds of feet long.

The climbs of Red Rock cover a broad range of length and difficulty. The long, easy routes had made the area a common climbing training ground, but the canyon also offers many difficult climbs as well. In recent decades, this broad appeal and the classic nature of many routes have made the area an international destination for rock climbers.

Popular sport climbing areas include the Calico Hills and Sandstone Quarry. Red Rock has a multitude of traditional climbing areas, including single-pitch areas such as Brass Wall and Necromancer Wall, along with multi-pitch areas such as Eagle Wall, Aeolian Wall, Mescalito, and Solar Slab. Long free and big-wall aid routes are found on features such as the Rainbow Wall and Buffalo Wall. Bouldering is popular in Red Rock as well, primarily at the Kraft Boulders and Black Velvet Canyon.

===Hiking===
Red Rock has hiking trails and picnic areas. Trails are changed and diverted depending on the needs of the ecosystem. In early spring, depending upon the precipitation, waterfalls may be seen on the edge of the canyons. Popular trails within the vicinity of the scenic drive loop include the Moenkopi Loop, Calico Hills, Calico Tanks, Turtlehead Mountain, Keystone Thrust, White Rock/La Madre Springs Loop, and the Ice Box Canyon trail.
==Wildfire history==

Several significant wildfires have burned within the Red Rock Canyon NCA in recent years, including:
*1998 – A fire occurred in the loop area. By 2003, regrowth has made it difficult to find the burn area.
*June 25, 2005 – The &quot;Goodsprings fire&quot; consumed more than , burning into Red Rock NCA&#x27;s southern area.
*July 22, 2005 – Lightning caused an fire in the loop area.
*September 6, 2006 – Another fire was started by lightning in the loop near the visitor center and burned around .
*July 2013 – The &quot;Carpenter I fire&quot; burned mainly in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, but encroached on the northwest portion of Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. It was caused by lightning in Trout Canyon nearby.

Damage caused by wildfires, as well as evidence of the ability of the desert to heal itself over time, is visible from the loop road.

Recent fires were in part fueled by the thick growth of invasive species red brome and cheat grasses. The Bureau of Land Management has not developed plans to control these species, because control methods, such as using herbicides, can be costly and damaging to native plants.

<doc id="200138" wikidata="Q924737" url="?curid=200138" title="Interpress">
<text>Interpress is a page description language developed at Xerox PARC, based on the Forth programming language and an earlier graphics language called JaM. PARC was unable to commercialize Interpress. Two of its creators, Chuck Geschke and John Warnock, left Xerox, formed Adobe Systems, and produced a similar language called PostScript. Interpress is used in some Xerox printers most notable was the DocuTech Network Production Publisher, and is supported in Xerox Ventura Publisher. Interpress is also used as the output format for PARC&#x27;s InterScript system, which is an editable word processor format for rich text documents.
Interpress describes the desired or ideal appearance of a document that has been completely composed by some other process (emitter). All line ending, hyphenation, and line justification decisions, and in fact all decisions about the shapes and positions of the images, are made before creating the master. Since Interpress describes a document in a device-independent manner, a master can be printed on a variety of devices, each of which renders its best approximation to the ideal represented by the master.

==Functional Sets==

Interpress is so extensive, some printer manufacturers may prefer to support only a part of it, perhaps to reduce development time and cost or to improve performance. Recognizing this and also the potential for chaos if every printer were to implement a different portion of the language, Interpress was designed to have defined three standard function sets:

; Commercial Set
: designed for text and form-printing applications, such as might be required in a data center using basic text or scanned images.

; Publication Set
: includes all the Commercial Set plus curved lines, filled outlines, rectangular clipping, synthetic graphics, and gray-level color capabilities.

; Professional Graphics Set
: consist of all of the imaging facilities (types, literals, and operators of the base language), full-color encoding, and Printing Instructions (which were expanded by Ernest L. Legg)

==Printing Instructions==
This feature set allows the ability to instruct the printer which media to use (paper size, type, color), number of copies, sides printed on as well as finishing actions such as stapling. These instructions are optional and their operation is dependent on the printer capability.

===Example===

A more complex structure would include Nested Blocks and CONTENTINSTRUCTIONS, a token used to distinguish content-instructions bodies from page bodies. In general, the content instructions are given precedence over the document instructions. Nested Blocks {BEGIN..END} allow for constructing large documents out of smaller ones.

==Fonts==
These are definitions that often found in the preamble since they usually apply to the entire document.

<doc id="200139" wikidata="Q11976142" url="?curid=200139" title="Huperzia porophila">
<text>Huperzia porophila, the rock clubmoss or rock firmoss, grows throughout the Appalachian province of the Eastern United States and central Canada, from Ontario south to Georgia and Alabama. It is rare east of the Appalachians, being most common in a north–south belt along the western plateau area.

&quot;Huperzia porophila&quot; grows only on or over rock and requires cool, moist, shaded, acid spots. It is a beautiful sight growing over boulders and outcrops. It is often confused with the shining firmoss (&quot;Huperzia lucidula&quot;) whose range it largely shares and which also often grows on rocks. The rock firmoss leaves, 3–8 mm long, are generally not shiny like those of the shining firmoss, and the ascending 12–15 cm stems are seldom branched. Unlike &quot;H. lucidula&quot;, it only grows as individual plants and not as dense colonies. One of the best sites for viewing this species is in the Hocking Hills in southeast Ohio.

This species is of hybrid origin, the parents being &quot;Huperzia lucidula&quot; and &quot;Huperzia selago&quot;.

&quot;H. porophila&quot; hybridizes with &quot;H. lucidula&quot; to produce the sterile hybrid &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;bartleyi&quot;.

<doc id="200142" wikidata="Q726251" url="?curid=200142" title="Elektra Records">
<text>Elektra Records (or Elektra Entertainment) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG&#x27;s Atlantic Records Group. After five years of dormancy, the label was revived as an imprint of Atlantic in 2009. In October 2018, Elektra was detached from the Atlantic Records umbrella and reorganized into Elektra Music Group, once again operating as an independently managed frontline label of Warner Music. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group was merged with 300 Entertainment to create the umbrella label 300 Elektra Entertainment (3EE), though both Elektra and 300 continued to maintain their separate identities as labels.

==History==
===1950–1971: Founding and early history===
Elektra was formed in 1950, as the &quot;Elektra-Stratford Record Corporation&quot;, with a singles label called Stratford Records, by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt in Holzman&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s College dorm room. Each invested $300. The usual spelling of the Greek mythological Pleiad Electra was changed. Holzman famously explained, &quot;I gave her the &#x27;K&#x27; that I lacked&quot;. He found the &#x27;C&#x27; in the original name &quot;too soft&quot;, but liked the &quot;solid bite&quot; of the letter &#x27;K&#x27;, citing its use in the Kodak name.

The first Elektra LP, &quot;New Songs&quot; (EKLP 1 released March 1951), was a collection of &quot;Lieder&quot; and similar art songs, which sold few copies. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the label concentrated on folk music recordings, releasing a number of best-selling albums by Theodore Bikel, Ed McCurdy, Oscar Brand, and Judy Collins, and protest singers such as Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton. Holzman also recorded Josh White, who was without a record deal as a result of McCarthyite blacklisting.

In 1964, Elektra launched Nonesuch Records. This classical budget label was the best-selling budget classical label of the era. Other labels followed suit by starting their own budget series, but Nonesuch remained the most popular and Jac Holzman states in his book that profits from the budget classical label made it possible for Elektra to experiment with their pop releases by the mid-1960s.

In 1965, Elektra began a short-lived joint venture with Survey Music called Bounty Records, which was Elektra&#x27;s first foray into pop music. The most notable signing for Bounty was the Paul Butterfield Band who was moved over to Elektra when Bounty folded.

Elektra&#x27;s entrance into pop gained the label considerable prestige within the music scene by being one of the first labels to sign up leading acts from the new wave of American psychedelic rock of 1966–1967. The label&#x27;s most important signings were the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band (with Mike Bloomfield), the Los Angeles bands Love and The Doors, and the Detroit bands The Stooges and MC5. Included in Elektra&#x27;s Los Angeles-based signings were Tim Buckley and Bread. In 1968, the label also signed pioneering rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack to a three-album deal.

Also in 1967, Elektra launched its Nonesuch Explorer Series, one of the first collections of what is now referred to as world music. Excerpts from several Nonesuch Explorer recordings were later included on the two Voyager Golden Discs, which were sent into deep space in 1977 aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes.

===1971–1989: Elektra/Asylum Records===
Elektra, along with its Nonesuch Records subsidiary, was acquired by Kinney National Services in 1970, which changed its name to Warner Communications in 1972. Soon afterwards, Kinney consolidated their label holdings under the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic umbrella. Holzman remained in charge of Elektra until 1972, when it merged with Asylum Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records; Asylum&#x27;s founder, David Geffen, headed the newly combined label. Holzman, in the meantime, was appointed senior vice president and chief technologist for Warner — ushering the company into home video and the first interactive cable system. Holzman also went on to acquire Discovery Records. In 1975, Geffen stepped down when he was told that he had a terminal illness; He later was revealed to have been falsely diagnosed. He was replaced by Joe Smith, who later went on to become CEO of Capitol Records.

Joe Smith, whose leadership resulted in the biggest market share and gross revenues Elektra Asylum was to have, inherited the A&amp;R services of Chuck Plotkin, famed later for producing many of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s greatest records, followed up by George Daly, who is credited as bringing in seminal new wave band The Cars, setting Elektra, again, on another artist direction.

Although the label was technically listed as &quot;Elektra/Asylum Records&quot; on the label credits, as the years went on, the label began to unofficially call itself Elektra Records again (with Asylum operating as a subsidiary label). In 1982, Elektra launched a jazz subsidiary called Elektra/Musician. The following year, Bob Krasnow became president and CEO of Elektra; under his leadership, the label reached its commercial peak throughout the rest of the 1980s and early to mid-1990s.

===1989–2004: Elektra Entertainment Group===
In 1989, the label officially changed its name to Elektra Entertainment. During the Bob Krasnow era, the label became home to a wide range of artists, such as Metallica, Yngwie Malmsteen, Faster Pussycat, Mötley Crüe, Phish, Tracy Chapman, 10,000 Maniacs, They Might Be Giants, The Cure, The Sugarcubes, Stereolab, Luna, The Call, X, The Afghan Whigs, Anita Baker, Linda Ronstadt, Natalie Cole, Brand Nubian, KMD, Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth, and Ween. The label&#x27;s A&amp;R department included former music journalist Terry Tolkin, who was credited with coining the term &quot;alternative music&quot; in the late 1970s. Also during this time, Elektra developed a relationship with the UK label 4AD. Elektra became the label for 4AD acts such as the Pixies, the Breeders, Frank Black, and The Amps in the United States.

Like its sister labels, Elektra&#x27;s fortunes began to wane in the mid-1990s, in part because of a series of bitter corporate battles between senior Warner label executives, which seriously damaged the collective reputation of the group. Unhappy with major structural changes enacted by then Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, Bob Krasnow abruptly resigned in July 1994, and others soon followed; the highly respected Warner Bros CEO Mo Ostin decided not to renew his contract and left in December 1994, and Ostin&#x27;s friend and protégé Lenny Waronker left early the next year. Krasnow was replaced by Sylvia Rhone, who at the time was a senior vice president at Atlantic Records, and also the CEO of Atlantic&#x27;s EastWest Records America imprint. Upon Rhone&#x27;s arrival at Elektra, the label took over the operations of EastWest, as well as Sire Records (which had previously operated through its sister label Warner Bros. Records) and was renamed Elektra Entertainment Group.

In September 1994, another damaging controversy erupted when heavy metal band Metallica filed suit against Elektra to terminate their contract and gain ownership of their master recordings. The group based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code, that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. By this time, Metallica had been with the label for more than a decade and had racked up sales over 40 million records, but they were still operating under the terms of their original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The group also claimed that they were taking the action because Robert Morgado had refused to honor a new deal they had worked out with Bob Krasnow shortly before he quit the label. Elektra responded by countersuing the group, but in December, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported rumors that then Warner Music US chairman Doug Morris had offered the group a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January, the group and Elektra jointly announced that they had settled the suit, and although a nondisclosure agreement kept the terms secret, media sources claimed, &quot;a significant increase in royalty payments to the band as well as a renegotiation of the group&#x27;s recording contract were key factors in Metallica and Elektra coming to terms.&quot;

Despite having a large stable of noted acts, as the 1990s drew to a close, Elektra began to see a slump in revenue, while noticeably underperforming on the charts. It also developed a bit of a sullen reputation in the industry for not properly promoting many of its releases, thus earning the nickname &quot;Neglektra&quot; from several signed artists, such as Marvelous 3, Jason Falkner, and Greg Dulli, and was easily lagging behind its sister labels Warner Bros. Records and Atlantic Records.

===2004–2018: Atlantic era===
In February 2004, Warner Music Group was sold by Time Warner to a group of private investors made up of Thomas Lee Partners, Bain &amp; Company, and Edgar Bronfman Jr. (who assumed CEO duties).

The new owners of WMG decided to merge Elektra and Atlantic Records. Because it was the lesser performing label of the two, 40% of Elektra&#x27;s operations were put into the new venture, while a commanding 60% of Atlantic&#x27;s went in. Subsequently, the new company was called Atlantic Records Group, with Elektra breaking off into a subsidiary that became dormant until the label was revived in 2009 (though longtime time Elektra artists such as Tracy Chapman, Björk, and Yolanda Adams continued to have releases on the label, while newer signees such as Jason Mraz and Jet were transferred to Atlantic).

Atlantic Records Group announced the revival of Elektra Records as an independent entity within Warner Music on June 1, 2009. The revived label is headed up by two new co-Presidents: Mike Caren, Exec. VP of A&amp;R for Atlantic Records, and John Janick, founder and President of prominent indie label Fueled by Ramen. The revived label uses a modified version of the &quot;circa&quot;-1970s Elektra logo.

The first release of the new label was the original soundtrack of the HBO show &quot;True Blood&quot;, and the first album released was Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;IRM&quot;. The label is now home to artists such as Uffie, Little Boots, Justice, Bruno Mars, and CeeLo Green.

On October 4, 2012, Warner Music announced that Jeff Castelaz, the co-founder of Los Angeles-based independent label Dangerbird Records, had been named president of Elektra Records. Gregg Nadel from Atlantic Records A&amp;R became General Manager of the label in 2015. In September 2015, Castelaz stepped down from his role at Elektra, leaving Nadel to run the label.

In 2016, Elektra&#x27;s releases included &quot;A/B&quot;, the debut album by Icelandic rock band Kaleo, which included the number-one Alternative hit &quot;Way Down We Go&quot;, Fitz and the Tantrums&#x27; self-titled third album and the critically acclaimed &quot;Southern Family&quot;, which garnered a 2016 CMA Nomination for &quot;Musical Event of the Year&quot;. Nadel was officially named president of the label in 2017. In October 2017, Elektra Records partnered with MSG Networks for &quot;Friday Night Knicks&quot;.

===2018–2022: Elektra Music Group===
Announced on June 18, 2018, Warner Music Group relaunched Elektra Music Group on October 1, as a stand-alone, staffed music company with the labels Black Cement, Elektra, Fueled by Ramen (FBR), Low Country Sound, and Roadrunner Records. A handful of major artists transferred from Atlantic. This returned the group to the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic triad that had for decades marked the original company organization. Staff from Elektra, FBR, and Roadrunner labels, plus some from Atlantic, staffed the new standalone group with co-presidents Mike Easterlin and Gregg Nadel coming from Fueled by Ramen and Roadrunner Records and Elektra, respectively, where they served as label presidents. Elektra co-presidents answered, though, to Atlantic Records Group Chairman and CEO Craig Kallman and Chairwoman and COO Julie Greenwald.

On October 3, 2018, Elektra revealed its entire leadership team. The label group&#x27;s first release was &quot;Trench&quot; by Twenty One Pilots on October 5, 2018, on Fueled by Ramen label. Despite that, Atlantic Records is still mentioned in liner notes of the album. In 2019, the label had huge success again with Tones and I&#x27;s hit single &quot;Dance Monkey&quot;. In December 2019, Elektra became the distributor for DTA Records, set up by Travis Barker.

=== 2022–present: 300 Elektra Entertainment ===
On June 22, 2022, Warner Music Group announced the creation of 300 Elektra Entertainment (3EE), a new umbrella group created from the merger of Elektra Music Group and 300 Entertainment. The umbrella group means that Fueled by Ramen, Low Country Sound and Roadrunner have been placed into a singular unit with 300 Entertainment&#x27;s labels. Despite this merger, WMG maintained that 300 and Elektra will keep their separate identities.

<text>The Neandertal (, , ; sometimes called &quot;the Neander Valley&quot; in English) is a small valley of the river Düssel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, located about east of Düsseldorf, the capital city of North Rhine-Westphalia. The valley lies within the limits of the towns of Erkrath and Mettmann. In August 1856, the area became famous for the discovery of Neanderthal 1, one of the first specimens of &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; to be found.
The Neandertal was originally a limestone canyon widely known for its rugged scenery, waterfalls and caves. However, industrial quarrying during the 19th and 20th centuries removed most of the limestone and dramatically changed the shape of the valley. It was during such a quarrying operation that the bones of the original Neanderthal man were found in a cave known as Kleine Feldhofer Grotte. Neither the cave nor the cliff in which the bones were located still exist.

During the 19th century, the valley was called (Neander&#x27;s Cave) and, after 1850, . It was named after Joachim Neander, a 17th-century German pastor and hymnwriter. is the Graeco-Roman translation of his family name ; both names mean &quot;new man&quot;. Neumann lived in nearby Düsseldorf and loved the valley for giving him the inspiration for his compositions. Former names of the gorge were (The Boulders) and (Cliff of dogs, perhaps in the sense of &quot;Cliff of Beasts&quot;).
In 1901, an orthographic reform in Germany changed the spelling of (valley) to . Scientific names, such as &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;Homo sapiens neanderthalensis&quot; for Neanderthal remained unchanged, because the laws of taxonomy retain the original spelling at the time of naming. However, Neanderthal station never changed its name to conform with the new German orthography and the modern Neanderthal Museum retains the original spelling.

==Excavations ==
Since the initial discovery of the specimen of the valley, there have been additional excavations, wherein multiple artifacts and human skeletal fragments have been found. Excavations have found two cranial fragments that seem to fit onto the original Neandertal 1 calotte (bones of the cranial vault). Excavations performed in 1997 and 2000 found new human skeletal pieces. There are questions as to whether these remains are those of Neandertals. Two cranial pieces were unearthed: one, a left zygomatic and partial body and second, a right piece of temporal bone. These pieces appeared to fit the Neandertal 1 calotte perfectly, although these pieces are not specifically from Neandertals. These discoveries may or may not be attributable to the Neandertals but exhibit similar characteristics.

<doc id="200145" wikidata="Q189509" url="?curid=200145" title="The Jungle Book">
<text>The Jungle Book is an 1894 collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. Most stories are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is &quot;Seeonee&quot; (Seoni), in the central
state of Madhya Pradesh.

A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling&#x27;s own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli&#x27;s. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one&#x27;s place in society with &quot;the law of the jungle&quot;, but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.

&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling. The book has been influential in the scout movement, whose founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was a friend of Kipling. Percy Grainger composed his &quot;Jungle Book Cycle&quot; around quotations from the book.

== Context ==

Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s stories were first printed in magazines in 1893 and 1894; the original publications also contained hand-sketched illustrations, with some from John Lockwood Kipling, his father. Rudyard himself was born in Mumbai—then referred to as Bombay—in the western coastal Indian state of Maharashtra, where he spent his first six years of life. After around 10 years back in England, and having completed his schooling, Kipling went back to India to work for nearly 6½ years. Later on, his original stories would be written when he lived at Naulakha, the property and home he owned in Dummerston, Vermont, US. There is evidence that Kipling wrote the collection of stories for his daughter, Josephine (who died from pneumonia in 1899, aged 6); a first-edition copy of the book—including a handwritten note by the author to his young daughter—was discovered at the National Trust&#x27;s Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.

==Book==
=== Description ===

The tales in the book (as well as those in &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;, which followed in 1895 and includes eight further stories, including five about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to teach moral lessons. The verses of &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot;, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or &quot;heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle&quot;. Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.

=== Origins ===

The stories in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; were inspired in part by the ancient Indian fable texts such as the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and the &quot;Jataka tales&quot;. For example, an older moral-filled mongoose and snake version of the &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; story by Kipling is found in Book 5 of &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. In a letter to the American author Edward Everett Hale, Kipling wrote:

In a letter written and signed by Kipling in or around 1895, states Alison Flood in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kipling confesses to borrowing ideas and stories in the &quot;Jungle Book&quot;: &quot;I am afraid that all that code in its outlines has been manufactured to meet &#x27;the necessities of the case&#x27;: though a little of it is bodily taken from (Southern) Esquimaux rules for the division of spoils. In fact, it is extremely possible that I have helped myself promiscuously but at present cannot remember from whose stories I have stolen&quot;.

Shere Khan, the main antagonist of the story, is named after the historical Afghan Emperor Sher Shah Suri.

=== Setting ===

Kipling lived in India as a child, and most of the stories are evidently set there, though it is not entirely clear where. The Kipling Society notes that &quot;Seeonee&quot; (Seoni, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh) is mentioned several times; that the &quot;cold lairs&quot; must be in the jungled hills of Chittorgarh; and that the first Mowgli story, &quot;In the Rukh&quot;, is set in a forest reserve somewhere in North India, south of Simla. &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot; was positioned in the Aravalli hills of Rajasthan (northwestern India) in an early manuscript, later changed to Seonee, and Bagheera treks from &quot;Oodeypore&quot; (Udaipur), a journey of reasonable length to Aravalli but a long way from Seoni. Seoni has a tropical savanna climate, with a dry and a rainy season. This is drier than a monsoon climate and does not support tropical rainforest. Forested parks and reserves that claim to be associated with the stories include Kanha Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, and Pench National Park, near Seoni, but Kipling never visited the area.

== Chapters ==

The book is arranged with a story in each chapter. Each story is followed by a poem that serves as an epigram.

===Characters===

Many of the characters (marked *) are named simply after the Hindustani names of their species: for example, Baloo is a transliteration of Hindustani भालू/بھالو Bhālū, &quot;bear&quot;. The characters (marked ^) from &quot;The White Seal&quot; are transliterations from the Russian of the Pribilof Islands.
* Akela * – a wolf
* Bagheera * – a black panther
* Baloo * – a bear
* Bandar-log * – a tribe of monkeys

* Father Wolf – the father wolf who raised Mowgli as his own cub
* Grey brother – one of Mother and Father Wolf&#x27;s cubs
* Hathi * – an Indian elephant
* Ikki * – a porcupine
* Kaa * – a python

=== Illustrations ===

The early editions were illustrated with drawings in the text by John Lockwood Kipling (Rudyard&#x27;s father), and the American artists W. H. Drake and Paul Frenzeny.

=== Editions and translations ===

The book has appeared in over 500 print editions, and over 100 audiobooks. It has been translated into at least 36 languages. In 2024, page proofs of the book were donated to Cambridge University Library.

==Themes==

===Abandonment and fostering===

Critics such as Harry Ricketts have observed that Kipling returns repeatedly to the theme of the abandoned and fostered child, recalling his own childhood feelings of abandonment. In his view, the enemy, Shere Khan, represents the &quot;malevolent would-be foster-parent&quot; who Mowgli in the end outwits and destroys, just as Kipling as a boy had to face Mrs Holloway in place of his parents. Ricketts writes that in &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, the hero loses his human parents at the outset, and his wolf fosterers at the conclusion; and Mowgli is again rejected at the end of &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot;, but each time is compensated by &quot;a queue of would-be foster-parents&quot; including the wolves, Baloo, Bagheera and Kaa. In Ricketts&#x27;s view, the power that Mowgli has over all these characters who compete for his affection is part of the book&#x27;s appeal to children. The historian of India Philip Mason similarly emphasises the Mowgli myth, where the fostered hero, &quot;the odd man out among wolves and men alike&quot;, eventually triumphs over his enemies. Mason notes that both Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal do much the same.

===Law and freedom===

The novelist Marghanita Laski argued that the purpose of the stories was not to teach about animals but to create human archetypes through the animal characters, with lessons of respect for authority. She noted that Kipling was a friend of the founder of the Scout Movement, Robert Baden-Powell, who based the junior scout &quot;Wolf Cubs&quot; on the stories, and that Kipling admired the movement. Ricketts wrote that Kipling was obsessed by rules, a theme running throughout the stories and named explicitly as &quot;the law of the jungle&quot;. Part of this, Ricketts supposed, was Mrs Holloway&#x27;s evangelicalism, suitably transformed. The rules required obedience and &quot;knowing your place&quot;, but also provided social relationships and &quot;freedom to move between different worlds&quot;. Sandra Kemp observed that the law may be highly codified, but that the energies are also lawless, embodying the part of human nature which is &quot;floating, irresponsible and self-absorbed&quot;. There is a duality between the two worlds of the village and the jungle, but Mowgli, like Mang the bat, can travel between the two.

The novelist and critic Angus Wilson noted that Kipling&#x27;s law of the jungle was &quot;far from Darwinian&quot;, since no attacks were allowed at the water-hole when in drought. In Wilson&#x27;s view, the popularity of the Mowgli stories is thus not literary but moral: the animals can follow the law easily, but Mowgli has human joys and sorrows, and the burden of making decisions. Kipling&#x27;s biographer, Charles Carrington, argued that the &quot;fables&quot; about Mowgli illustrate truths directly, as successful fables do, through the character of Mowgli himself; through his &quot;kindly mentors&quot;, Bagheera and Baloo; through the repeated failure of the &quot;bully&quot; Shere Khan; through the endless but useless talk of the Bandar-log; and through the law, which makes the jungle &quot;an integrated whole&quot; while enabling Mowgli&#x27;s brothers to live as the &quot;Free People&quot;.

The academic Jan Montefiore commented on the book&#x27;s balance of law and freedom that &quot;you don&#x27;t need to invoke Jacqueline Rose on the adult&#x27;s dream of the child&#x27;s innocence or Perry Nodelman&#x27;s theory of children&#x27;s literature colonising its readers&#x27; minds with a double fantasy of the child as both noble savage and embryo good citizen, to see that the &quot;Jungle Books&quot; .. give their readers a vicarious experience of adventure both as freedom and as service to a just State&quot;.

==Reception==

Sayan Mukherjee, writing for the Book Review Circle, calls &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; &quot;one of the most enjoyable books of my childhood and even in adulthood, highly informative as to the outlook of the British on their &#x27;native population&#x27;&quot;.

The academic Jopi Nyman argued in 2001 that the book formed part of the construction of &quot;colonial English national identity&quot; within Kipling&#x27;s &quot;imperial project&quot;. In Nyman&#x27;s view, nation, race and class are mapped out in the stories, contributing to &quot;an imagining of Englishness&quot; as a site of power and racial superiority. Nyman suggested that &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;&#x27;s monkeys and snakes represent &quot;colonial animals&quot; and &quot;racialized Others&quot; within the Indian jungle, whereas the White Seal promotes &quot;&#x27;truly English&#x27; identities in the nationalist allegory&quot; of that story.

Swati Singh, in his &quot;Secret History of the Jungle Book&quot;, notes that the tone is like that of Indian folklore, fable-like, and that critics have speculated that the Kipling may have heard similar stories from his Hindu bearer and his Portuguese &quot;ayah&quot; (nanny) during his childhood in India. Singh observes, too, that Kipling wove &quot;magic and fantasy&quot; into the stories for his daughter Josephine, and that even critics reading Kipling for signs of imperialism could not help admiring the power of his storytelling.

&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book&#x27;s universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author&#x27;s permission for the use of the &quot;Memory Game&quot; from &quot;Kim&quot; in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, has become a senior figure in the movement; the name is traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; has been adapted many times in a wide variety of media. In literature, Robert Heinlein wrote the Hugo Award-winning science fiction novel, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), when his wife, Virginia, suggested a new version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; (2008) is inspired by &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. It follows a baby boy who is found and brought up by the dead in a cemetery. It has many scenes that can be traced to Kipling, but with Gaiman&#x27;s dark twist.

In music, the &quot;Jungle Book&quot; cycle (1958) was written by the Australian composer Percy Grainger, an avid Kipling reader. It consists of quotations from the book, set as choral pieces and solos for soprano, tenor or baritone. The French composer Charles Koechlin wrote several symphonic works inspired by the book.

BBC Radio broadcast an adaptation on 14 February 1994 and released it as a BBC audiobook in 2008. It was directed by Chris Wallis with Nisha K. Nayar as Mowgli, Eartha Kitt as Kaa, Freddie Jones as Baloo, and Jonathan Hyde as Bagheera. The music was by John Mayer.

The book&#x27;s text has been adapted for younger readers with comic book adaptations such as DC Comics Elseworlds&#x27; story, &quot;&quot;, in which an infant Superman is raised by wolves, while Bagheera, Akela, and Shere Khan make appearances. Marvel Comics published several adaptations by Mary Jo Duffy and Gil Kane in the pages of &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; (vol. 1). These were collected in the one-shot &quot;Marvel Illustrated: The Jungle Book&quot; (2007). Bill Willingham&#x27;s comic book series, &quot;Fables&quot;, features &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;″s Mowgli, Bagheera, and Shere Khan.

&quot;Manga Classics: The Jungle Book&quot; was published by UDON Entertainment&#x27;s Manga Classics imprint in June 2017.

Many films have been based on one or another of Kipling&#x27;s stories, including &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; (1937), Chuck Jones&#x27;s made for-TV cartoons &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; (1975), &quot;The White Seal&quot; (1975), and &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot; (1976). Many films, too, have been made of the book as a whole, such as Zoltán Korda&#x27;s 1942 film, Disney&#x27;s 1967 animated film and its 2016 remake. Other adaptations include the Russian adaptation named &quot;Mowgli&quot;, published as &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot; in the US, an animation released between 1967 and 1971, and combined into a single 96-minute feature film in 1973, and the 1989 Italian-Japanese anime &quot;The Jungle Book: Adventures of Mowgli&quot;.
Stuart Paterson wrote a stage adaptation in 2004, first produced by the Birmingham Old Rep in 2004 and published in 2007 by Nick Hern Books.

In 2021 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation by Ayeesha Menon which resets the story as a &quot;gangland coming-of-age fable&quot; in modern India.

<doc id="200149" wikidata="Q1891939" url="?curid=200149" title="Sleaford">
<text>Sleaford is a market town and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. On the edge of the Fenlands, it is north-east of Grantham, west of Boston, and south of Lincoln. It is the largest settlement in North Kesteven with a population of 19,807 in 2021. Centred on the former parish of New Sleaford, the modern boundaries and urban area include Quarrington to the south-west, Holdingham to the north-west and Old Sleaford to the east. The town is bypassed by the A17 and the A15 roads. Sleaford railway station is on the Nottingham to Skegness (via Grantham) and Peterborough to Lincoln lines.

The first settlement formed in the Iron Age where a prehistoric track crossed the River Slea. It was likely home to a mint for the Corieltauvi in the 1st centuries BC and AD. Evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement has been found. Medieval records differentiate between Old and New Sleaford, the latter emerging by the 12th century around the present-day market place and St Denys&#x27; Church; Sleaford Castle was also built at that time for the Bishops of Lincoln, who owned the manor. Granted the right to hold a market in the mid-12th century, New Sleaford developed into a market town and became locally important in the wool trade, while Old Sleaford (based near the site of the prehistoric settlement) declined.

From the 16th century, the landowning Carre family kept tight control over the town – it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed by marriage from to the Hervey family (Earls and later Marquesses of Bristol) in 1688. The town&#x27;s common lands were enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Herveys. This coincided with canalisation of the Slea, which brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. These new transport links supported the development of light industries and expanded the town&#x27;s role in the trade in agricultural goods. Long a centre for justice and administration in north Kesteven, Sleaford became an urban district in 1894 and was also home to the former Kesteven County Council (1925–1974). After a period of stagnation, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries the sale of farmland around Sleaford led to the development of large housing estates, causing the population to rapidly expand and the urban area to engulf Quarrington and Holdingham.

Though its traditional market has declined in the 21st century (and its cattle and corn markets shut in the 20th century) and much of its heavier manufacturing has departed, Sleaford&#x27;s economy has diversified. The town remains an important administrative, service and commercial centre for the surrounding district. It houses supermarkets, shops and a large business park with offices and light manufacturing, and is home to the headquarters of North Kesteven District Council; three secondary schools (two of which are selective); four primary schools; three newspapers; police, fire and ambulance stations; several places of worship; many sports clubs; a leisure centre; and several medical and dental practices and care homes. Regeneration has transformed some earlier industrial areas, including through the construction of The Hub. The town is one of the largest employment centres in the district; the commonest employers in 2021 were the public sector, retail and, to a much lesser degree, manufacturing.

==Geography==
Sleaford is a civil parish and market town in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire. It is bounded by the civil parishes of Leasingham to the north; Ewerby and Evedon, and Kirkby la Thorpe to the east; Silk Willoughby to the south; and Wilsford, South Rauceby and North Rauceby to the west. These neighbouring parishes are rural, comprising villages separated from Sleaford&#x27;s urban area by fields, though Kirkby la Thorpe also includes the Milton Way housing estate on Sleaford&#x27;s eastern fringe.

=== Urban area ===
Sleaford&#x27;s urban area includes the town centre, focused on the marketplace (fronted by St Denys&#x27; Church), where Eastgate, Northgate, Southgate and Westgate meet. Though some parts have been redeveloped in the 20th century, including the Riverside Shopping Precinct and Flaxwell House, the area follows a medieval street layout and is home to many of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings; it is also the retail and commercial hub. Carre Street (running parallel to Southgate to the east), once home to industry and wharves, has been regenerated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

To the north-west of the centre, housing developments along Northgate (which becomes Lincoln Road north of the railway line), mostly built in the 20th and early 21st centuries, have brought the hamlet of Holdingham into Sleaford&#x27;s urban area, which extends as far north as the A17 and A15 junction at Holdingham Roundabout. To the north-east, the town&#x27;s built-up area has expanded along Eastgate, with 19th-century housing closer to the town centre giving way to modern business parks; the River Slea forms the southern boundary of these developments and, closer to the town, Lollycocks Field sits between one of the business parks, Eastgate and the Slea. South of the river, the town&#x27;s urban area extends eastwards along Boston Road, which runs from Southgate to the A17 at Kirkby la Thorpe. Except for Boston Road Recreation Ground, the road is straddled by housing west of the railway; developments near the centre are mostly 18th- and 19th-century, while those around Old Place, at the Hoplands and south of Boston Road are mostly planned 20th- or 21st-century residential estates.

The Victorian train station can be found near the southernmost end of Southgate; Station Road includes some converted 19th-century warehouses. Mareham Lane heads south out of the town, past the vast disused Bass Maltings complex. Also forking off from Southgate are Grantham Road and London Road, which fan out in a south-west direction. They link Sleaford with Quarrington village, which has a historic core that has been merged into the town&#x27;s urban area by modern housing developments. The earliest suburban housing at the base of Southgate appeared in the 19th century and was known as New Quarrington, while ribbon development along London and Grantham roads is mostly early-20th-century; much larger planned developments took place in the late 20th and 21st centuries at Quarrington Hill, Southfields and between the two roads. To the town centre&#x27;s west is Westgate, medieval in origin but heavily developed with dense terraced housing in the 19th century; to its north is Westholme, parkland which houses a school; to the road&#x27;s south is West Banks and its adjoining streets, between the River Slea and the Nine-Foot Drain, an area heavily built up in the 19th century. South of Westbanks are the remains of Sleaford Castle.

Outside of the town&#x27;s urban area, but included in the civil parish boundaries is Greylees, a settlement built in the early 21st century on the site of the former Rauceby Hospital.

===Topography and geology===
Sleaford occupies a position on the Lincoln Heath, a limestone plateau between the Lincoln Cliff to the west (a Limestone scarp running north–south through Lindsey and Kesteven), and the Fens to the east, a low-lying region of the East of England which has been drained to reveal nutrient-rich soils that form some of the most productive farmland in the country.

The town centre lies about above sea level and has formed around the River Slea, which runs west to north-east through it. A band of Jurassic Cornbrash limestone forms the bedrock under Holdingham (where the ground rises to above sea level in places), parts of central Sleaford, and most of the housing at Quarrington (where elevations exceed over at Quarrington Hill) and southern Greylees. The bedrock on the eastern parts of the town comprises Jurassic Kellaways sandstone and siltstone. To the west, the Slea follows a shallow valley underlain by Jurassic Blisworth clay and limestone and, at its lowest elevations at Quarrington Fen and Boiling Wells Farm, earlier Jurassic Rutland argillaceous rocks and Upper Lincolnshire limestone. Greylees and the northern fringe of the Quarrington Hill estate sit on the southern edge of this valley, on the Blisworth clays and limestone. Alluvium deposits are found along the Slea&#x27;s course, and sand and gravel of the Sleaford series are found to the east and south. Most of the soil is free-draining, lime-rich and loamy, though some of the eastern parts are on loamy soils with naturally high groundwater.

Two Local Nature Reserves sit within the civil parish boundaries: Lollycocks Field, providing mostly wildflower and wetlands habitats alongside Eastgate, and Mareham Pastures, consisting of wildflower meadows, new woodland, hedges and open grassland. There is also Sleaford Wood in the north of the town and Sleaford Moor to the north-east, near the A17 and A153&#x27;s Bone Mill Junction.

===Climate===
The British Isles experience a temperate, maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. Lincolnshire&#x27;s position on the east of the British Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and it is one of the driest counties in the UK. In Sleaford, the average daily high temperature peaks at in July and a peak average daily mean of occurs in July. The lowest daily mean temperature is in January; the average daily high for that month is and the daily low is (the latter also occurs in February). The East of England tends to be sheltered from strong winds relative to the north and west of the country. Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England than elsewhere; Sleaford suffered them in 2006 and 2012, both causing damage to property.

==History==
===Etymology===
The earliest records of the place-name Sleaford are found in a charter of 852 as &quot;Slioford&quot; and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as &quot;Sliowaford&quot;. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086), it is recorded as &quot;Eslaforde&quot; and in the early 13th century as &quot;Sliforde&quot;. In the 13th century &quot;Book of Fees&quot; it appears as &quot;Lafford&quot;. The name is formed from the Old English words and , together meaning &quot;ford over a muddy or slimy river&quot;.

===Early period===

Archaeological material from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age, where a track northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery evidence has been found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, probably used for minting and dated to 50 BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south-east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest of its kind in Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists to consider that the site in Old Sleaford was one of the largest Corieltauvian settlements in the period and possibly a tribal centre.

During the Roman occupation of Britain (AD 43–409), the settlement was &quot;extensive and of considerable importance&quot;. Its location beside the Fens may have made it economically and administratively important as a centre for stewards and owners of fenland estates. There are signs of a road connecting Old Sleaford to Heckington, where Roman tile kilns have been uncovered and may imply the presence of a market. When the first roads were built by the Romans, Sleaford was bypassed as &quot;less conveniently located&quot; and more &quot;geared to native needs&quot;. A smaller road, Mareham Lane, which the Romans renewed, ran through Old Sleaford, and south along the fen edge towards Bourne. Where it passed through Old Sleaford, excavations have shown a large Roman domestic residence, associated farm buildings and field systems, and several burials. Other Roman remains, including a burial, have been excavated.

===Middle Ages===

There is little evidence of continuous settlement between the late Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods but the Saxons did establish themselves eventually. South of the modern town, a 6th- to 7th-century cemetery has been uncovered with an estimated 600 burials, many showing signs of pagan rites. The now-ruined church at Old Sleaford has been discovered and excavations of the market place have uncovered Anglo-Saxon remains from the 8th–9th centuries, indicating some form of enclosure with domestic features.

The earliest documentary reference to Sleaford occurs in a 9th-century charter, when it was owned by Medehamstede Abbey in Peterborough, a Mercian royal foundation. There is little evidence of estate structure until the late Saxon period, but there may have been a market and court before the Norman Conquest, and it may have been an economic and jurisdictional centre for surrounding settlements. The Slea played a big part in the town&#x27;s economy: it never ran dry or froze, and by the 11th century it supported a dozen watermills. The mills and others in nearby Quarrington and the lost hamlet of Millsthorpe, formed the &quot;most important mill cluster in Lincolnshire&quot;.

In the later Middle Ages, the Romano-British settlement became known as Old Sleaford, while New Sleaford was a settlement centred on St Denys&#x27; Church and the market place. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 has two entries under &quot;Eslaforde&quot; (Sleaford) recording land held by Ramsey Abbey and the Bishop of Lincoln. The location of these manors is unclear. One theory endorsed by Maurice Beresford is that they focused on the settlement at Old Sleaford, due to evidence that New Sleaford was planted in the 12th century by the bishop to increase his income, a development associated with the construction of Sleaford Castle (1123–39). Beresford&#x27;s theory has been criticised by the historians Christine Mahany and David Roffe who have reinterpreted the &quot;Domesday&quot; material and argued that in 1086 the Bishop&#x27;s manor included the church and associated settlement which became &quot;New&quot; Sleaford.

A charter to hold a fair on the feast day of St Denis was granted by King Stephen to Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1136–1140. Between 1154 and 1165, Henry II granted the bishop of Lincoln the right to hold a market at Sleaford and Edward III confirmed this in 1329. In 1401, Henry IV granted the bishop fairs on the feast days of St Denis and St Peter&#x27;s Chains. A survey of burgage tenure from 1258 survives, analysis of which indicates that demesne farming centred on the hamlet of Holdingham. The town later had at least two guilds comparable to those found in developed towns. However, there was no formal charter outlining the town&#x27;s freedoms; tight control by the bishops meant the economy was mainly geared to serve them. It thus retained a strong tradition of demesne farming well into the 14th century. As the economic initiative passed more to burgesses and middlemen who formed ties with nearby towns such as Boston, evidence suggests that Sleaford developed a locally important role in the wool trade. In the Lay Subsidy of 1334, New Sleaford was the wealthiest settlement in the Flaxwell wapentake, with a value of £16 0s. 8d.1/4d. Meanwhile, Old Sleaford, an &quot;insignificant&quot; place since the end of the Roman period, declined and may have been deserted by the 16th century.

===Early modern period===

The manor of Old Sleaford was owned in the late 15th and early 16th centuries by the Hussey family. John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford was executed for treason for his part in the Lincolnshire Rising; the manor and his residence at Old Place reverted to the Crown and were later sold to Robert Carre, the son of George Carre or Carr, a wool merchant originally from Northumberland who had settled in Sleaford by 1522. Robert also bought the castle and manor of New Sleaford from Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. His eldest surviving son Robert founded Carre&#x27;s Grammar School in 1604, and his youngest son Edward was created a baronet; his son founded Sleaford Hospital in 1636. The last male descendant died in 1683 and the heiress, Isabella, married John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in whose family the estates remained until the 1970s. The Carres and Herveys had a strong influence: while extracting dues from their tenants, they enforced their monopoly on charging tolls on market and cattle traders and for driving animals through the town.

Industry was slow to take hold. By the second half of the 18th century, Cogglesford Mill was the only working corn mill in the town. An old mill at the junction of Westgate and Castle Causeway supplied hemp to the rope-making business of the Foster and Hill families. As the local historian Simon Pawley wrote, &quot;In many respects, things had changed little [by 1783] since the survey of 1692,&quot; with few of the buildings or infrastructure being improved. Major changes to agriculture and industry took place in the last decade of that century. Sleaford&#x27;s three medieval open fields (North, West and Sleaford Fields) were enclosed in 1794, with over 90 per cent of the of the open land being granted to Lord Bristol.

===Industrial development===
Canalisation of the River Slea began in the 1790s. Canals in England were constructed from the 1760s to make inland trade easier; Sleaford&#x27;s businessmen were keen to benefit from these. Sleaford Navigation opened in 1794. It eased the export of farm produce to the Midlands and the import of coal and oil. Mills along the Slea benefited and wharves were constructed around Carre Street. Between 1829 and 1836 the navigation&#x27;s toll rights increased in value 27 times over. The railways emerged in the 19th century as an alternative to canals and arrived at the town in 1857, when a line from Grantham to Sleaford opened. This made trading easier and improved communications, but led to the decline of the Navigation Company. Income from tolls decreased by 80 per cent between 1858 and 1868; it made its first loss in 1873 and was abandoned in 1878. The town&#x27;s rural location and transport links led in the late 19th century to the rise of two local seed merchants: Hubbard and Phillips, and Charles Sharpe; the former took over the Navigation Wharves, and the latter was trading in the US and Europe by the 1880s. The advent of steam power led Kirk and Parry to open a large steam-powered flour mill in 1857 and provided the basis of Ward and Dale&#x27;s factory, which made steam cultivators for farming. The railway, Sleaford&#x27;s rural location and its artesian wells, were key factors in the development of the Bass &amp; Co maltings complex at Mareham Lane (1892–1905).

New Sleaford&#x27;s population more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide lighting in the town. Sleaford&#x27;s Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. A workhouse was built by 1838, able to house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, the slums around Westgate were crowded, lacking in sanitation and ridden by disease; Northgate, as the entry point from the north along the turnpike, had also attracted notoriety for its taverns, lodging houses and brothels in the early 19th century: it was the &quot;plague spot of the town&quot;. The local administration failed to deal with these issues, prompting a heavily critical report on the town&#x27;s public health by the General Board of Health, which set up a Local Board of Health in 1850 to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed the Board to pump clean water into the town, though engineering problems and his reluctance to sell land to house a pumping station had delayed the introduction of sewers. In the meantime, despite Anglicans dominating official institutions, non-conformist chapels were flourishing in the poorest parts of the town, at Westgate from the early 19th century and at Northgate after 1848, where they sought to provide spiritual care and education. Temperance was so prominent in the town that an aerated water factory, Lee and Green, opened in c. 1883 and became one of Sleaford&#x27;s most important manufacturers.

===Twentieth century and beyond===

Although hardly damaged in the First and Second World Wars, Sleaford has close links with the Royal Air Force due to proximity to several RAF bases, including RAF Cranwell, RAF Digby and RAF Waddington. Lincolnshire&#x27;s topography – flat and open countryside – and its location in the east of the country made it ideal for the airfields being constructed in the First World War. Work began on Cranwell in late 1915; it was designated an RAF base in 1918 and the RAF College opened in 1920 as the world&#x27;s first air academy. The Cranwell branch railway linking Sleaford station with the RAF base opened in 1917 and closed in 1956. During the Second World War, Lincolnshire was &quot;the most significant location for bomber command&quot; and Rauceby Hospital, south-west of Sleaford, was requisitioned by the RAF as a specialist burns unit which the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe regularly visited.

Sleaford&#x27;s population remained static between the wars, but the Great Depression in the 1930s caused unemployment to rise. The Council housing put up along Drove Lane proved insufficient for the low-income families after the Westgate slums were cleared in the 1930s; Jubilee Grove opened in that decade to meet the demand. In the post-war period, there were housing developments at St Giles Avenue, the Hoplands, Russell Crescent, Jubilee Grove and Grantham Road. Parts of the town were redeveloped: in 1958, the Bristol Arms Arcade opened, the Corn Exchange was demolished in the 1960s and the Riverside Shopping Precinct opened in 1973, as did Flaxwell House, designed to house a department store, though later becoming the national headquarters for Interflora. Old industries departed; Ward and Dale closed down in 1939 and Lee and Green around the 1940s; Bass shut the maltings in 1959, and Hubbard and Phillips&#x27;s pea-sorting factory closed in 1972. New industrial estates and business parks were built off East Road in the late 20th century.

By 1979, the major landowner, Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol, was heavily in debt and sold most of his estates in Sleaford and Quarrington. The estate office closed in 1989. Much of the land went to property developers and subsequent decades brought new housing and a considerable rise in population. According to a council report, people were attracted to the town by &quot;the quality of life, low crime rates, relatively low house prices and good-quality education&quot;. From 1981 to 2011, Sleaford&#x27;s population rose from 8,000 to 18,000; the growth rate in 1991–2001 was the fastest of any town in the county. The infrastructure struggled to cope, especially with increased traffic congestion. Two bypasses opened and a one-way system was introduced, a process that Pawley argues accelerated the decline of the High Street. Between 1995 and 2001, the Single Regeneration Budget granted over £10 million to Sleaford to deliver 13 major regeneration programmes collectively known as &quot;Sleaford Pride&quot;, including improvements to the town centre, the conversation of the old Navigation stables, and the development of The Hub arts centre (opened 2002) on the site of a former Hubbard and Phillips seed warehouse.

==Economy==
The Sleaford built-up area is the urban centre of the North Kesteven district, and one of the district&#x27;s centres of employment. According to a local authority report, Sleaford is also &quot;the main retail, service and employment centre for people living in the town and in the surrounding villages&quot;. The town&#x27;s primary employment zones are Sleaford Enterprise Park, the adjoining business park at Woodbridge Road and along East Road, and the town centre (focused on Southgate, Northgate and the Market Place). Many of North Kesteven&#x27;s residents also commute out of the district to work, including to Lincoln, Grantham and Newark-on-Trent; one study found that, in 2011, 70% of workers living in the housing built at Quarrington since the 1980s worked outside of Sleaford: 24% of the total in other parts of North Kesteven, 13% in South Kesteven, 8% in Lincoln, and the remainder mostly in other districts of the East Midlands.
=== Retail and services ===
Sleaford is a retail and services hub for its own population and its rural hinterland. It has a long history of providing services for the wider district; despite the emergence of industries in the town in the 19th century, employment &quot;revolved around services, trades and commerce&quot; through the 20th century. In 2021, retail, accommodation and food services made up 21% of the town&#x27;s workforce. The town centre is home to many shops and services focused on Northgate and Southgate and the surrounding area; purpose-built central shopping centres include the covered Bristol Arcade (opened in 1958) and the Riverside Centre (opened in 1973). Supermarkets are found in the town centre, Northgate, Lincoln Road and Stump Cross Hill. Other retailers and wholesalers operate on East Road and the business parks. Sleaford&#x27;s cattle and poultry markets closed in the 1980s; although the weekly market (traditionally held in the Market Place) has reduced substantially in size, as of 2025 it continues held weekly on Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays, and a farmers&#x27; market is held on the first Saturday of each month.

In 2011, the district council found that Sleaford&#x27;s retail and service offer had not kept pace with its growing population, leading many shoppers to travel elsewhere to buy high-value goods, use services or engage in leisure activities: 85p in every pound spent on higher-value comparison goods were spent outside of the town. In 2015, another report estimated that 23% of shopping spend in Sleaford&#x27;s catchment area was spent in the town (accounting for £62m spending); although the town had 210 shops and a higher ratio of shops to residents than many other urban areas in the region, these were dominated by outlets selling convenience goods and services. The ratio of &quot;multiple&quot; brand shops compared to independent shops was 20% lower in Sleaford compared with regional benchmarks, which was thought to be a factor driving consumer spending out of the town; Lincoln was believed to be the key beneficiary of this outflow. The district council has developed strategies to reverse this trend, including proposals to create a new &quot;retail anchor&quot; at the disused Bass Maltings, develop more parking around the centre, remove parts of the one-way system, regenerate Southgate and turn Money&#x27;s Yard into an attraction to link with The Hub. The withdrawal of a major investor in 2015 has left the development of the Maltings on hold. The Riverside Shopping Centre was refurbished in 2017 and regeneration of parts of the town centre continue as of 2024. 

=== Public administration ===
The expansion of local government and the public sector in the late 19th and 20th centuries coupled with proximity to the Royal Air Force (RAF) base at Cranwell to swell the importance of the public sector in Sleaford&#x27;s economy; from the early 20th century, the town housed the headquarters of Kesteven County Council, East Kesteven Rural District Council and the town&#x27;s own Urban District Council, and by 1939 18% of the town&#x27;s employed population were in public administration and defence. In the 21st century, the public sector is the predominant form of employment in Sleaford civil parish; public administration, education and healthcare collectively accounted for 37% of the workforce in 2021. As of 2024, Sleaford is home to the headquarters of North Kesteven District Council, as well as four primary schools and three secondary schools, and is near the Royal Air Force bases at Cranwell, Digby and Waddington which are major employers in the district.

=== Industry and commerce ===
Sleaford&#x27;s position as a market town serving a rural district supported some local craft industries before the mid-19th century. The canalisation of the Slea and then the arrival of the railways in the 19th century meant that the town became important in the supply of agricultural produce inland and the import of industrial products into the wider district. Several large scale industries, some closely connected to agriculture, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including malting, seed sorting and agricultural implement making. Many heavier industries closed between the 1920s and 1960s; the local authority encouraged lighter manufacturing after the 1950s through the provision of land for an industrial east off East Road, which has since expanded. By 2021, manufacturing employed 10% of Sleaford&#x27;s workforce, construction employed 8.4%, and transport and distribution 6%; the professional, administrative, financial and real estate sectors accounted for a combined 10.6% of the workforce.

In the early 2020s, Sleaford includes one of the district council&#x27;s three &quot;strategic employment locations&quot;, Sleaford Enterprise Park, which is adjacent to other business parks at Woodbridge Road and East Road. In 2023, the district council opened the first units of an extension, Sleaford Moor Enterprise Park. Combined, in 2024 these estates housed at least 95 business, according to Google Maps; these included: 11 wholesalers, builders&#x27; merchants or plumbers&#x27; merchants; 11 vehicle repair shops or MOT centres; 11 furniture and furnishings shops; 7 manufacturers, including Sleaford Quality Foods (a food producer) and the ingredients&#x27; maker, J. L. Priestley and Co; five vehicle dealerships; four plant and equipment suppliers; four tyre shops; two gyms; a dance studio; and a bus company, Sleafordian Coaches.

==Demography==
=== Population change ===
In 1563 there were 145 households in New Sleaford (including 20 in Holdingham), plus 10 in Old Sleaford and 17 in Quarrington. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the diocese recorded that there were &quot;more than 250 families&quot; in the ecclesiastical parish of Sleaford, with a further 35 in the parish of Quarrington. One estimate puts the population of New Sleaford at 800 to 900 at this time. The first official census was conducted in 1801 and recorded a population of 1,596 in New Sleaford (including Holdingham); combined with Old Sleaford and Quarrington, this gave a population of 1,812 in the area covered by today&#x27;s Sleaford civil parish. Following the opening of Sleaford Navigation in 1794 and the flourishing of the town&#x27;s economy this produced (combined with the effects of inflated agricultural prices during the Napoleonic wars), Sleaford&#x27;s population rose steadily in the first half of the 19th century. It totalled 3,539 in New Sleaford and 4,160 across all the three parishes by 1851. The population grew much more slowly between the 1850s and the 1880s, before witnessing further growth that took the urban district&#x27;s population to 6,427 by 1911 (incorporating New Sleaford, Old Sleaford, Holdingham and Quarrington).

Slower rates were recorded for the urban district between then and the 1931 census, though the pace picked up again in the 1930s; by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 there were 7,835 residents. Sleaford&#x27;s population grew very slowly in the post-war years, reaching 7,975 by 1971, largely due to the fact that Lord Bristol remained owner of the vast majority of the undeveloped land around the town. However, as the 6th Marquess sold the land from the 1960s onwards and speculative housing blossomed around Sleaford, the civil parish&#x27;s population expanded rapidly; the population growth rate between 1991 and 2001 was the fastest of any town in Lincolnshire. Between 1981 and 2011, the population more than doubled, reaching 17,671; this had risen by a further 12% to 19,815 by the 2021 census. This accounts for 17% of North Kesteven&#x27;s population, making Sleaford the most populous civil parish in the district.

=== Ethnicity, nationality and religion ===
According to the 2021 census, Sleaford&#x27;s population was 96.3% White; 1.4% Asian or British Asian; 0.4% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British; 1.4% mixed or multi-ethnic; and 0.5% other ethnicities. The population is therefore less ethnically diverse than England as a whole, where 81.0% were White, 9.6% Asian or British Asian, 4.2% Black, African, Caribbean or Black British, 3.0 mixed and 2.2% other. Parish-level data about country of origin and religion have not yet been published for the 2021 census. The previous census, in 2011, recorded that 92.7% of Sleaford&#x27;s population were born in the United Kingdom (in England as a whole the figure 86.2%); 4.3% were born in European Union countries other than the UK and Ireland (England: 3.7%). 2.6% of the population was born outside the EU (England: 9.4%).

In 2011, 71.6% of Sleaford&#x27;s population said they were religious and 21.7% said they did not follow a religion (England: 68.1% and 24.7% respectively). However, compared to England&#x27;s population, Christians were a much higher proportion of the Sleaford&#x27;s population (70.3%), and all other groups were present at a lower proportion than the national rates; Muslims were the largest religious minority, accounting for 0.4% of the town&#x27;s residents compared with 5% nationally; all other groups were present in very low numbers.
=== Household composition, age, health and housing ===

Parish-level data about household composition, age and housing have not yet been published for the 2021 census. In the 2011 census, 48.4% of the population were male and 51.6% female. Of the population over 16, 50.3% were married, compared to 46.6% in England; 28.9% were single (a smaller proportion than in England where it is 34.6%), 10.5% divorced (England: 9%), 7.1% widowed (England: 6.9%), 3.1% separated and 0.1% in same-sex civil partnerships (England: 2.7% and 0.2% respectively). In 2011, there were 7,653 households in Sleaford civil parish. It had a roughly average proportion of one-person households (29.2%; England: 30.2%); most other households consisted of one family (65.4% of the total; England: 61.8%).

The 2011 census showed Sleaford&#x27;s population to be marginally older than the national population; the mean age was 40 and the median 41, compared with 39.3 and 39 for England. 24.3% of the population was under 20 (England: 24%), and 23.2% of Sleaford&#x27;s population was aged over 60 (England: 22%). 82.1% of the population were in good or very good health (England: 81.4%).

As of 2011, Sleaford has a higher proportion of people who own their homes with or without a mortgage (68.5%) than in England (63.3%), a slightly lower proportion of people who privately rent (15.8% compared with 16.8%) and a much smaller proportion of social renters (13.8% compared with 17.7%). The proportion of household spaces which are detached houses was higher than average (39.2%; England: 22.3%), while the proportion of terraced household spaces is lower (19.3%; England: 24.5%). The proportion of purpose-built flats is also lower (8.7%; England: 16.7%).

=== Workforce and deprivation ===

In 2021, 63.1% of Sleaford&#x27;s residents aged between 16 and 74 were economically active (England: 60.9%) and 60.6% were in employment (England: 57.4%). The rate of economically inactive people aged 16 to 74 was 36.9% (England: 39.1%). The 2021 census revealed that the most common industries residents worked in were: public administration, education and health (combined 37.2%; England: 30.3%), retail, hotels and accommodation (combined 21.0%; England: 19.9%), finance, real estate, professional or administrative services (combined 10.6%; England: 17.4%), and manufacturing (10.0%; England: 7.3%). No other sectors accounted for more than 10% of the population. In terms of occupational composition, in 2021 Sleaford&#x27;s workforce was broadly similar to the workforce in the whole of England. It has slightly lower proportions of people in professional, associate professional and technical roles (30.4%) and managerial occupations (11.1%). There are slightly higher proportions of people in caring, leisure and other service occupations (10.3%), process, plant and machine operatives (8.8%), and elementary occupations (11.4%).

The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (2019) show that North Kesteven contained the lowest level of deprivation of any district in Lincolnshire. The indices divided the Sleaford parish into 10 statistical areas (LSOAs). Of these 10 areas, five placed in the least-deprived 30% of LSOAs nationally (one in the least-deprived 10% nationally); these were concentrated in Quarrington and the western parts of the Holdingham ward. However, the eastern part of Holdingham ward and the parts of the Westholme and Castle wards clustered around the town centre fall within the most-deprived 40% of areas nationally (some having even higher levels of deprivation).

==Transport==

The A17 road from Newark-on-Trent to King&#x27;s Lynn bypasses Sleaford from Holdingham Roundabout to Kirkby la Thorpe. It ran through the town until the bypass opened in 1975. The Holdingham roundabout connects the A17 to the A15 road from Peterborough to Scawby. It also passed through Sleaford until 1993, when its bypass was completed. Three roads meet at Sleaford&#x27;s market place: Northgate (B1518), Southgate and Eastgate (B1517). A one-way system set up in 1994 creates a circuit around the town centre. The bus companies Stagecoach and Sleafordian Coaches operate public buses through and around the town on behalf of the county council, alongside the council&#x27;s demand-responsive, flexible CallConnect service.

The railways arrived in the 19th century. Early proposals to bring a line to Sleaford failed, but in 1852 plans were made to build the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway and its Act of Parliament passed in 1853. The line from Grantham opened in 1857; Boston was connected in 1859, Bourne in 1871 and Ruskington on Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway in 1882. The line to Bourne was closed in 1965. As of 2024, Sleaford is a stop on the Peterborough to Lincoln Line and the Poacher Line, from Grantham to Skegness. Grantham, roughly by road and two stops on the Poacher Line, is a major stop on the East Coast Main Line. Trains from Grantham to London King&#x27;s Cross take approximately 1 hour 15 minutes.

Plans to canalise the River Slea were drawn up in 1773, but faced opposition from landowners who feared it might affect the drainage of fens. Plans were approved in 1791 with the support of the 5th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven who owned estates and quarries that he hoped would benefit. An Act of Parliament passed in 1792, establishing the Sleaford Navigation, which opened two years later. After falling revenues due to competition from the railways, the navigation company closed in 1878. The river, although no longer navigable, passes under Carre Street and Southgate. The Nine Foot Drain, also unnavigable, meets the Slea just before Southgate.

==Governance==
===Local government===
==== History ====

From the medieval period, New Sleaford and Old Sleaford were ancient parishes; New Sleaford was in the Flaxwell wapentake and Old Sleaford in the Ashwardhurn one, both in the Kesteven parts of the Lincolnshire. New Sleaford contained the main built-up area, and its ancient parish boundaries also included the rural hamlet of Holdingham to the north-west.

Sleaford Poor Law Union, overseen by a Board of Guardians, was founded in 1836 covering Old and New Sleaford and surrounding parishes. The Board administered welfare to the poor and were granted powers relating to public health and sanitation. The Public Health Act 1848 allowed for local boards of health (LBH) to be established where local people petitioned for one; covering urban areas, these boards took over powers over public sanitation from the Guardians. The parish of New Sleaford, excluding the hamlet of Holdingham, was made a local board district (LBD) in 1850, governed by an elected LBH. Holdingham was subsequently made its own civil parish in 1866. The Public Health Act 1872 established urban sanitary districts (USD) to cover the areas in LBDs and made the LBH the urban sanitary authority. The New Sleaford USD was enlarged in 1877 to include Holdingham, Old Sleaford and Quarrington.

The Local Government Act 1894 converted the USD into New Sleaford Urban District, overseen by an urban district council (UDC). In 1900, it was renamed Sleaford Urban District. During a major reorganisation of local government, Sleaford Urban District was abolished on 1 April 1974, being absorbed into the new district of North Kesteven. A successor parish called Sleaford was created on 6 July 1973 covering the area of the urban district, which had the effect of abolishing the four parishes of Holdingham, New Sleaford, Old Sleaford and Quarrington. The new parish council declared its parish to be a town at its first meeting on 14 November 1973, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot; and letting the chair of the council take the title of mayor.

==== Today ====
There are three tiers of local government covering Sleaford, at parish, district and county level: Sleaford Town Council, North Kesteven District Council and Lincolnshire County Council, respectively. County councils have statutory responsibility for some public services, including education, transport, libraries, planning and social care. District councils manage social housing, planning applications, council tax, and waste and recycling. Town councils have powers to run some local amenities.

Since the 2023 local elections, the town council has been composed of 18 councillors from five wards: Sleaford Castle (3 seats), Sleaford Holdingham (2 seats), Sleaford Navigation (3 seats), Sleaford Quarrington (7 seats) and Sleaford Westholme (3 seats). There are seven representatives from five wards on the district council, as of 2023: Sleaford Castle (1 seat), Sleaford Holdingham (1 seat), Sleaford Navigation (1 seat), Sleaford Quarrington and Mareham (3 seats), and Sleaford Westholme (1 seat). Under the most recently devised boundaries, Sleaford has one seat on Lincolnshire County Council.Since 2015, the town council has had its headquarters at the Town Hall in Quayside House, off Carre Street, part of the modern Navigation Yard development. The district council is based at the Council Offices on Kesteven Street; the oldest part had been built as a row of houses called Lafford Terrace in the 1850s before being mostly being bought by the former Kesteven County Council (KCC) for offices in 1925; a large extension took place in 1960. After KCC&#x27;s abolition in 1974, the complex was transferred to the newly established North Kesteven District Council, serving as its offices and, after a major extension in 1991, becoming its sole office building and host to its council chamber.

===National politics===
Before 1832, Sleaford was in the Lincolnshire parliamentary constituency, which encompassed all of the county except for four boroughs. In the 1818 election, 49 of the 2,000 people living in New and Old Sleaford and Quarrington qualified to vote. In 1832, the Reform Act widened the franchise and divided Lincolnshire. Sleaford was in the South Lincolnshire constituency that elected two members to Parliament. Following the 1867 reforms, the South Lincolnshire constituency&#x27;s borders were redrawn, but Sleaford remained within it. The franchise was widened by the reforms so that roughly 15% (202) of males in Sleaford and Quarrington could vote in 1868. The constituency was abolished in 1885 and the Sleaford constituency formed. It merged with the Grantham seat in 1918. In 1997, Sleaford was reorganised into Sleaford and North Hykeham. The current constituency has been held by Conservative members since it was created; the incumbent is Caroline Johnson, who has held it since the 2016 by-election and was re-elected with 36% of the vote in 2024.

==Public services==

=== Utilities and communications ===
The Sleaford Gas Light Company was formed in 1838. The following year gas lighting was provided and a gasworks was constructed in Eastgate. In 1866, the company was incorporated; it lit the town through to the company&#x27;s nationalisation in 1948. Gas ceased to be made there in the 1960s. 

Following cholera outbreaks in the 1850s and 1870s, the Sleaford Water Act 1879 was passed to set up the Sleaford Water Company to provide clean water for the town; pumping machinery was installed and waterworks constructed in 1880. In 1948, the council took over the company and in 1962 its operation was handed to the Kesteven Water Board, which was absorbed by the Anglian Water Authority in 1973. Until the 1880s, Sleaford&#x27;s raw sewage was conveyed through &quot;an antiquated system of drains, open cesspits and inadequate sewers&quot;; the town&#x27;s effluent was discharged into the Slea, which was also the source of drinking water. The local board of health purchased land for a sewage farm on the eastern fringe of the parish in the early 1880s and converted Cogglesford Mill into a pump to convey wastewater to the farm. This system was in place from 1884. The farm was initially let to four tenants who were responsible for disposal but in 1903 the urban district council took over management. In 1954, a new treatment plant was built on East Road; it was expanded in the late 1970s and upgraded in 1994.

Kesteven County Council promoted a parliamentary bill to build an electricity generating station which passed in 1900. It was built in 1901 on Castle Causeway and remained there beyond nationalisation in 1948; by the 1970s it had been extended to include a new transformer and converted to a substation. Following nationalisation, the East Midlands Electricity Board provided electricity until privatisation in 1990. A &quot;virtually carbon neutral&quot; straw-burning power-station at Sleaford opened in 2013, powered by bales from farms within a radius. Most electricity generated is fed into the National Grid and the facility provides free heat to public buildings in the town.

Sleaford&#x27;s post office was based at Lindum House (23 Northgate) from 1897 to 1933, when it moved to Southgate. As of 2024, Sleaford Post Office still operates in Southgate. There is also Woodside Post Office on Lincoln Road. The town&#x27;s telephone exchange was also based at Lindum House from 1897 to 1967, when an automated exchange opened on Westgate. Sleaford Library has occupied its present building on the Market Place since 1987, having previously been based in the former fire station at Watergate since 1956. As of 2024, the library includes a local and family history section and microfiche machine.

=== Emergency services and healthcare ===
Policing is provided by the Lincolnshire Police, firefighting by the Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service, and ambulance services by the East Midlands Ambulance Service. The first police station was built at Kesteven Street in 1845 and reconstructed in 1912; the police moved into the former Sleaford Rural District Council offices at the Hoplands on Boston Road in 1998, and this remains Sleaford Police Station as of 2024. The fire and ambulance services share accommodation on Eastgate which opened in 2018. Sleaford&#x27;s first fire station was built in 1829 on Watergate and was completely rebuilt by the urban district council in 1900; the fire service moved to premises on Church Lane in 1953, which it occupied till 2018. The ambulance service had operated from Kesteven Street from 1960 until 2018.

The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides services at four hospitals: Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Grantham and District Hospital, Lincoln County Hospital and the County Hospital Louth. As of 2024, Sleaford has two GP surgeries: Sleaford Medical Group and Millview Medical Centre. The town also has three dental surgeries and four pharmacies. Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust runs Ash Villa at Greylees for the NHS Mental Health Service. There are also two care homes: Oakdene and Glenholme Holdingham Grange. Between 1902 and 1997, a mental institute, Rauceby Hospital, operated west of Quarrington, initially run by the county council and then the NHS from 1948; its patient enrolment peaked at 590 in 1958. The town had an NHS clinic at Laundon House, which opened as a maternity hospital in the 1930s, was taken over by the NHS in the 1940s and converted to a clinic in the post-war decades, before closing in 2016.

=== Justice ===
From the 14th century, justice was administered through the assizes (periodic courts which heard capital cases) or by the justices of the peace (later called magistrates), who tried more serious but non-capital crimes in the quarter sessions (with a jury) and more minor crimes in the petty sessions (without a jury). The petty and quarter sessions came to be known as the magistrates&#x27; courts. Each of the three parts of Lincolnshire had its own quarter sessions; in Kesteven, the sessions were split between northern and southern divisions; those for the north met at Sleaford from at least the 17th century and the court was known as the Sleaford Bench. The magistrates met at a building on the market place, which was replaced in 1830 by Sessions House. The system was overhauled in 1971, with the quarter sessions and assizes replaced with the Crown Court, which has been held in Lincoln ever since; Sessions House continued to host the petty sessions until 2008, when cases were transferred to Grantham; HM Courts Service formally closed Sleaford Magistrates&#x27; Court in 2010.

== Places of worship and religious organisations ==
=== Anglican ===
The Anglican ecclesiastical parish of Sleaford (formerly New Sleaford), encloses the town of Sleaford and hamlet of Holdingham, but does not include Quarrington. It falls within the Lafford Deanery, the Lincoln Archdeaconry and the Diocese of Lincoln. The parish church, St Denys&#x27;, fronts onto the market place; it might have been in existence by &quot;c&quot;. 1086. The vicarage was founded and endowed in 1274. As of 2024, services are held every Sunday and Wednesday.

In the Middle Ages, Old Sleaford had its own church, originally dedicated to All Saints and later to St Giles. It disappeared at the end of the medieval period. It was in the possession of Ramsey Abbey at the time of Domesday and later Haverholme Priory, and was eventually served by a vicar. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536–41), the king took over collection of the tithes, later leasing them to Thomas Horseman and then selling them to Robert Carre. In the 17th century, the rectory of Quarrington and the vicarage of Old Sleaford were combined to form the ecclesiastical parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford. As of 2024, the parish is served by St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Quarrington village; services are held on Sundays. It is in the deanery of Lafford and archdeaconry of Lincoln. In 1932 a church hall was built on Grantham Road and used as a community centre as of 2009.

The prebendary of New Sleaford or Lafford had a seat in the Lincoln Cathedral; it is not known when it was established, but it was confirmed by the Pope in 1146 and 1163, and was in the patronage of the bishop. The Prebendal Court of Sleaford had jurisdiction over New and Old Sleaford and Holdingham to grant administration and probate.

<text>Hsinchu (), officially Hsinchu City, is a city located in northwestern Taiwan. It is the most populous city in Taiwan that is not a special municipality, with estimated 450,655 inhabitants. Hsinchu is a coastal city bordering the Taiwan Strait to the west, Hsinchu County to the north and east, and Miaoli County to the south. Hsinchu is nicknamed the &quot;Windy City&quot; for its strong northeastern monsoon during the autumn and winter seasons.

The area was originally settled by the Austronesian Taiwanese indigenous peoples, with the settlement being named &quot;Tek-kham&quot; by the Hoklo immigrants. The city was founded by Han Chinese settlers in 1711, and renamed &quot;Hsinchu&quot; in 1878. During Japanese rule, the city was named &quot;Shinchiku&quot; and was the seat of Shinchiku Prefecture. The prefecture encompassed present-day Hsinchu City and County, as well as entire Taoyuan and Miaoli. After the ROC rule in 1945, the urban area of Hsinchu was organized as a provincial city.

In 1980, the Taiwanese government established the Hsinchu Science Park, an industrial centre for semiconductor manufacturing. The headquarters of TSMC, a semiconductor foundry, MediaTek and United Microelectronics Corporation, are all located in the park.

Besides its industry, Hsinchu is a cultural center of Taiwan. The Chenghuang Temple of Hsinchu, built in 1747, is a common prayer destination. The research institutions of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University are both located near the science park.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hsin-chu&quot; is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese name . The same name is rendered &quot;Xīnzhú&quot; in Hanyu Pinyin and &quot;Sinjhú&quot; in Tongyong Pinyin.

This name refers to the settlement&#x27;s original Hokkien name &quot;Tek-chhàm&quot; (), meaning &quot;bamboo barrier&quot;. The name may transcribe an aboriginal name meaning &quot;Seashore&quot;. The same name is variously recorded as Teukcham, Teuxham, Tekcham, and Teckcham; its Mandarin pronunciation appears as Chuchien.

Hsinchu is popularly nicknamed &quot;The Windy City&quot; for its windy climate and &quot;The Garden City of Culture and Technology&quot; by its tourism department.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The area around Hsinchu City was inhabited by the Taokas aborigines when the Spanish occupied northern Taiwan in the 17th century. Catholic missionaries reached the settlement of Tek-kham in 1626. The Spanish were expelled by the Dutch a few decades later.

===Qing Dynasty===
Under the Qing, a Chinese town was established at Tek-kham by and other Han settlers in 1711. Wang and his party of over 180 people were natives of Kinmen who first camped alongside what is now Dongqian Street in East District, Hsinchu.

As part of the reorganization of Taiwan by Shen Baozhen, the viceroy of Liangjiang, Zhuqian Subprefecture (i.e., Tek-kham) was raised to the level of a county and renamed Xinzhu (i.e., Sin-tek or Hsinchu) in 1878. When Taiwan was made a province in 1887, Hsinchu was made a part of Taipeh Prefecture.

===Japanese rule===

During the Japanese occupation following the First Sino-Japanese War, the cityknown at the time as Shinchikuwas among the province&#x27;s most populous. In 1904, its 16,371 residents ranked it in 7th place, behind Keelung and ahead of Changhua (&quot;Shoka&quot;). Shinchiku was raised to town status in 1920 and city status in 1930. At the same time, it became the seat of Shinchiku Prefecture. In 1941, its prefecture was expanded, annexing Xiangshan (&quot;Kōzan&quot;). Jiugang (&quot;Kyūminato&quot;) and Liujia (&quot;Rokka&quot;) merged to become Zhubei (&quot;Chikuhoku&quot;).

===Republic of China===
The Nationalist government of the Republic of China established the Hsinchu City Government in 1945 to oversee all of what had been Shinchiku Prefecture under the Japanese.

In 1946, the Take-Over Committee dissolved and replaced by the Hsinchu County Government, located in Taoyuan. As the administrative districts were readjusted, Hsinchu was granted provincial city status. It used the old prefecture office as its city hall at 120 Road. In February 1946, representative congresses were formed for seven district offices. On 15 April, the city congress was formed. Provincial representatives were elected from among the city legislators.

On 16 August 1950, the administrative districts on Taiwan were re-adjusted once more, demarcating 16 counties and 5 provincial cities.

In June 1982, under presidential order, the Xiangshan Township of Hsinchu County merged into Hsinchu City. A new municipal government was formally established on 1 July 1982, comprising 103 villages and 1,635 neighborhoods. These were organized into the East, North, and Xiangshan districts by 1November. By June 1983, the new government consisted of three bureaus (Civil Service, Public Works, and Education), four departments (Finance, Social Welfare, Compulsory Military Service, and Land Affairs), four offices (Secretary, Planning, Personnel, and Auditing), and 49 various sections. The Police Department, Tax Department, and Medicine and Hygiene Department were considered affiliate institutions.

From 1994 to 1999, as Taiwan made its transition from authoritarian rule to a representative democracy and the mostly &quot;pro forma&quot; provincial level of government began to be dissolved, regulations were established for the self-government of Hsinchu. A deputy mayor, consumer officer, and three consultants were added to the city government. In 2002, the city added a Bureau of Labor and transferred Compulsory Military Service to the Department of Civil Service.

A movement is underway from 2021 to have Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County to be upgraded to the nation&#x27;s seventh special municipality.

==Geography==
The city is bordered by Hsinchu County to the north and east, Miaoli County to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the west.

===Climate===
Hsinchu&#x27;s climate is humid subtropical (Koppen: Cfa). The city is located in a part of the island that has a rainy season that lasts from February to September, with the heaviest time coming late April through August during the southwest monsoon, and also experiences heavy &quot;plum rains&quot; in May and early June. The city succumbs to hot humid weather from June until September, while October to December are arguably the most pleasant times of year. Hsinchu is affected by easterly winds off of the East China Sea. Natural hazards such as typhoons and earthquakes are common in the region.

Colors indicate the common language status of Hakka within each division.

===Politics===
The city was historically pan-Blue but in recent years, the pan-Green coalition has started to rise in popularity. As a result, local factions have decreased in power, and political parties have greater importance in local elections.

Hsinchu City elected a Kuomintang legislator, Cheng Cheng-chien, as its representative in the Legislative Yuan during the 2020 Taiwan general election, flipping the seat from the Democratic Progressive Party. Cheng won reelection in the 2024 election.

In July 2024, then-Mayor Ann Kao was suspended from her duties and sentenced to prison for violating the Anti-Corruption Act and the Criminal Code. Deputy Mayor Andy Chiu subsequently assumed the duties of Mayor.

==Economy==
The Hsinchu Science Park has around 360 companies. The purpose of the park is to attract high-tech investment to Taiwan. Since its establishment in 1978, the government has invested over in software and hardware ventures. In 2001, it developed of land in the park and in southern Hsinchu.

The semiconductor and related electronic businesses have faced competition from South Korea and the United States. This has resulted in lower profits and an oversupply of some electronic products, such as memory and semiconductors.

In 2020, Hsinchu was classified as a &quot;Sufficiency&quot; level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

==Education==

Hsinchu City is one of the most focused educational centers in northern Taiwan. It has six universities in this concentrated area, and among these universities, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University are focused on by the government of Taiwan.

<doc id="200151" wikidata="Q869870" url="?curid=200151" title="Jenga">
<text>Jenga is a game of physical skill created by British board game designer and author Leslie Scott and marketed by Hasbro. The name comes from the Swahili word &quot;&quot; which means &#x27;to build or construct&#x27;.
Players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 blocks. Each block removed is then placed on top of the tower, creating a progressively more unstable structure. The game ends when the tower falls over.

==Rules==

&quot;Jenga&quot; is played with 54 wooden blocks. Each block is three times as long as it is wide, and one fifth as thick as its length – . Blocks have small, random variations from these dimensions so as to create imperfections in the stacking process and make the game more challenging. To begin the game, the blocks are stacked into a solid rectangular tower of 18 layers, with three blocks per layer. The blocks within each layer are oriented in the same direction, with their long sides touching, and are perpendicular to the ones in the layer immediately below. A plastic tray provided with the game can be used to assist in setup.

Starting with the one who built the tower, players take turns removing one block from any level below the highest completed one and placing it horizontally atop the tower, perpendicular to any blocks on which it is to rest. Each player may use only one hand to touch the tower or move a block at any given time, but may switch hands whenever desired. Once a level contains three blocks, it is complete and may not have any more blocks added to it. A block may be touched or nudged to determine whether it is loose enough to remove without disturbing the rest of the tower, but it must be returned to its original position if the player decides to move a different one. A turn ends when the next player in sequence touches the tower or when 10 seconds have elapsed since the placement of a block, whichever occurs first.
The game ends when any portion of the tower collapses, caused by either the removal of a block or its new placement. The last player to complete a turn before the collapse is the winner.

==Origins==
&quot;Jenga&quot; was created by Leslie Scott, the co-founder of Oxford Games Ltd, based on a game that evolved within her family in the early 1970s using children&#x27;s wooden building blocks the family purchased from a sawmill in Takoradi, Ghana. The name &quot;Jenga&quot; is derived from &quot;kujenga&quot;, a Swahili word which means &quot;to build&quot;. A British national, Scott was born in Tanganyika, now Tanzania, where she was raised speaking English and Swahili, before moving to live in Ghana, West Africa. Scott launched the game she named and trademarked as &quot;Jenga&quot; at the London Toy Fair in January 1983 and sold it through her own company, Leslie Scott Associates. The blocks of the first sets of &quot;Jenga&quot; were manufactured for Scott by the Camphill Village Trust in Botton, Yorkshire. The V&amp;A Museum of Childhood has exhibited one of the original sets of &quot;Jenga&quot; since 1982.

In 1984, Robert Grebler, an entrepreneur from California who was the brother of a close friend of Scott, contacted her and expressed interest in importing and distributing &quot;Jenga&quot; in Canada. In April 1985, Grebler acquired from Scott the exclusive rights to &quot;Jenga&quot; for the United States and Canada, and then in October of that year, Scott assigned the worldwide rights in &quot;Jenga&quot; to Grebler, which he in turn assigned to Pokonobe Associates. Convinced of &quot;Jenga&quot;&#x27;s potential, Grebler had invited two cousins to form Pokonobe Associates with him in 1985 to increase distribution of &quot;Jenga&quot;. Pokonobe then licensed Irwin Toy to sell &quot;Jenga&quot; in Canada and to be master licensee worldwide. Irwin Toy licensed &quot;Jenga&quot; to Schaper in the United States, and when that company was bought by Hasbro, &quot;Jenga&quot; was launched under the Milton Bradley banner in 1987. Eventually, Hasbro became licensee in most countries around the world.

By 2019, according to Pokonobe Associates, owners of the &quot;Jenga&quot; brand, over 80 million &quot;Jenga&quot; games, equivalent to more than 4.3 billion &quot;Jenga&quot; blocks, had been sold worldwide. On November 5, 2020, &quot;Jenga&quot; was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.

==Tallest tower==
The packaging copy of one edition of the &quot;Jenga&quot; game claims that Robert Grebler may have built the tallest &quot;Jenga&quot; tower ever at 40 levels. Grebler built the tower in 1985 while playing with an original &quot;Jenga&quot; set produced by Leslie Scott in the early 1980s.

==Official variants==
&quot;Throw &#x27;n Go Jenga&quot; is a variant originally marketed by Hasbro. It consists of blocks that are in various colors plus a six-sided die. It is marketed by Art&#x27;s Ideas.

&quot;Jenga Truth or Dare&quot; was a variation of &quot;Jenga&quot; also marketed by Hasbro. This version looked like regular &quot;Jenga&quot; except there were three colors of blocks instead of just the natural color of &quot;Jenga&quot;.

&quot;Jenga Xtreme&quot; used parallelogram-shaped blocks that could create some interesting leaning towers.

&quot;Casino Jenga: Las Vegas Edition&quot; employed roulette-style game play, featuring a felt game board, betting chips, and additional rules.

In addition, there have been a number of collector edition &quot;Jenga&quot; games, featuring the colors and logos of the Boston Red Sox, Las Vegas Raiders, New York Yankees, and John Deere, among others. &quot;Hello Kitty Jenga&quot;, &quot;Transformers Jenga&quot;, &quot;Tarzan Jenga&quot;, &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas Jenga&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jenga&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers Jenga&quot;, &quot;National Parks Jenga&quot;, &quot;Jenga Ocean&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead Jenga&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Jenga&quot;, &quot;Fortnite Jenga&quot;, &quot;Godzilla Jenga&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty Jenga&quot;, &quot;Onyx Jenga&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter Jenga&quot; are some of the licensed variations of &quot;Jenga&quot;.

&quot;Jenga XXL&quot; and &quot;Jenga Giant&quot; are licensed giant &quot;Jenga&quot; games manufactured and distributed by Art&#x27;s Ideas. There are &quot;Jenga Giant&quot; variations which can reach or higher in play, with very similar rules. &quot;Jenga XXL&quot; starts at over high and can reach or higher in play. Rules are the same as in classic &quot;Jenga&quot;, except that players may use two hands to move the eighteen-inch-long blocks.

&quot;Jenga Pass Challenge&quot; includes a handheld platform that the game is played on. Players remove a block while holding the platform, then pass the platform to the next player. This variant includes only half the number of blocks (27), which means the tower starts at 9 levels high instead of 18.

<doc id="200152" wikidata="Q225641" url="?curid=200152" title="Mombasa">
<text>Mombasa ( ; ) is a coastal city in southeastern Kenya along the Indian Ocean. It was the first capital of British East Africa, before Nairobi was elevated to capital status in 1907. It now serves as the capital of Mombasa County. The town is known as &quot;the white and blue city&quot; in Kenya. It is the country&#x27;s oldest ( 900 A.D.) and second-largest city after Nairobi, with a population of about 1,208,333 people according to the 2019 census.

Mombasa&#x27;s location on the Indian Ocean made it a historical trading centre, and it has been controlled by many countries because of its strategic location. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D. It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer al-Idrisi mentions it in 1151. It was a part of the Kilwa Sultanate from approximately the early 14th century until the dissolution of the sultanate in 1513 A.D. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific ogee arch. The city later came under the occupation and control of the Omani Empire in the late 17th century.

In the late pre-colonial period, it was the metropolis of a plantation society, which became dependent on slave labour based around the ivory trade. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports then were ivory, millet, sesamum and coconuts.

Today, Mombasa is a tourism-based town, home to one of the state houses, with an extra-large port and an international airport.

== History ==

=== Ancient and medieval ===
The founding of Mombasa is associated with two rulers: Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita. According to legend, Mwana Mkisi is the original ancestor of Mombasa&#x27;s oldest lineages within &quot;Thenashara Taifa&quot; (or Twelve Nations). Families associated with the Twelve Nations are still considered the original inhabitants of the city. Mwana Mkisi was a queen from the pre-Islamic era, who founded Kongowea, the original urban settlement on Mombasa Island.

Significantly, the names of both the queen and the city have linguistic and spiritual connections with Central Africa. &quot;Mkisi&quot; is considered the personification of &quot;ukisi&quot;, which means &quot;the holy&quot; in kiKongo. &quot;Kongowea&quot; can similarly be interpreted as the Swahili locative of &quot;kongo&quot;, which denotes the essence of civilizational order in central Africa. These legends can be read as an acknowledgement of the Bantu-speaking origins of the Swahili people.

Shehe Mvitaff superseded the dynasty of Mwana Mkisi and established the first permanent stone mosque on Mombasa Island. Mombasa&#x27;s oldest extant stone mosque, Mnara, was built c. 1300. Shehe Mvita is remembered as a Muslim of great learning and so is connected more directly with the present ideals of Swahili culture that people identify with Mombasa. The ancient history associated with Mwana Mkisi and Shehe Mvita and the founding of an urban settlement on Mombasa Island is still linked to present-day peoples living in Mombasa. The Thenashara Taifa (or Twelve Nations) Swahili lineages recount this ancient history today and are the keepers of local Swahili traditions.

Most of the early information on Mombasa comes from the writings of Portuguese chroniclers in the 16th century.

The famous Moroccan scholar and traveller Ibn Battuta (13041368/1369) visited the area during his travels to the Swahili Coast. He noted the city, although he stayed only one night. He wrote that the people of Mombasa were Shafi&#x27;i Muslims, religious people, trustworthy and righteous. Their mosques were made of wood, expertly built.

The exact founding date of the city is unknown, but it has a long history. Kenyan school history books place the founding of Mombasa as 900 A.D. It must have been already a prosperous trading town in the 12th century, as the Arab geographer al-Idrisi mentions it in 1151. The oldest stone mosque in Mombasa, Mnara, was built 1300. The Mandhry Mosque, built in 1570, has a minaret that contains a regionally specific ogee arch. This suggests that Swahili architecture was an indigenous African product rather than being adopted from non-African Muslims who brought stone architecture to the Swahili Coast.

During the pre-modern period, Mombasa was an important centre for the trade in spices, gold, and ivory. Its trade links reached as far as India and China. Oral historians today can still recount this period of local history. Indian history shows that there were trade links between Mombasa and Cholas of South India. Throughout the early modern period, Mombasa was a key node in the complex and far-reaching Indian Ocean trading networks. Its key exports were ivory, millet, sesamum and coconuts.

Ivory caravans remained a major source of economic prosperity. Mombasa became the major port city of pre-colonial Kenya in the Middle Ages and was used to trade with other African port cities, the Persian Empire, the Arabian Peninsula, India and China.

Sixteenth-century Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa wrote, 
&quot;[Mombasa] is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar.&quot;

===Portuguese domination===
Vasco da Gama was the first known European to visit Mombasa, receiving a chilly reception in 1498. Two years later, the town was sacked by the Portuguese. In 1502, the sultanate became independent from Kilwa Kisiwani and was renamed as Mvita (in Swahili) or Manbasa (Arabic).

The Portuguese had since had encounters with the city several times; first under Francisco de Almeida in 1505, later under Afonso de Albuquerque in 1522 to quell an attempted mutiny by the sultan&#x27;s nephew in Pemba and Zanzibar, and finally the destruction of the city under Nuno da Cunha again in 1528 after the Malindi sultan failed to pay tribute.

In 1585, a military expedition of the Ottoman Empire, led by Emir &#x27;Ali Bey, successfully captured Mombasa, and other coastal cities in Southeast Africa from the Portuguese. However, Malindi remained loyal to Portugal. The Zimba overcame the towns of Sena and Tete on the Zambezi, and in 1587 they took Kilwa, killing 3,000 people. At Mombasa, the Zimba slaughtered the Muslim inhabitants, but they were halted at Malindi by the Bantu-speaking Segeju and went home. This stimulated the Portuguese to take over Mombasa a third time in 1589, and four years later they built Fort Jesus to administer the region. Between Lake Malawi and the Zambezi mouth, Kalonga Mzura made an alliance with the Portuguese in 1608 and fielded 4,000 warriors to help defeat their rival Zimba, who were led by chief Lundi.

After the building of Fort Jesus, Mombasa was put by the Portuguese under the rule of members of the ruling family of Malindi. In 1631 Dom Jeronimo, the ruler of Mombasa, slaughtered the Portuguese garrison in the city and defeated the relief force sent by the Portuguese. In 1632 Dom Jeronimo left Mombasa and became a pirate. That year the Portuguese returned and established direct rule over Mombasa.

===Omani rule===
With the capture of Fort Jesus in 1698, the town came under the influence of the Imamate of Oman, subordinate to the Omani rulers on the island of Unguja, prompting regular local rebellions. Oman appointed three consecutive Governors (Wali in Arabic, Liwali in Swahili):
*12 December 1698 – December 1698: Imam Sa&#x27;if ibn Sultan
*December 1698 – 1728: Nasr ibn Abdallah al-Mazru&#x27;i
*1728–12 March 1728: Shaykh Rumba

Mombasa was briefly returned to Portuguese rule by captain-major Álvaro Caetano de Melo Castro (12 March 1728 – 21 September 1729), then four new Omani Liwali until 1746, when the last of them made it independent again (disputed by Oman), as the first of its recorded Sultans:
*1746–1755: &#x27;Ali ibn Uthman al-Mazru&#x27;i
*1755–1773: Masud ibn Nasr al-Mazru&#x27;i
*1773–1782: Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mazru&#x27;i
*1782–1811: Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Mazru&#x27;i (born 17–died 1814)
*1812–1823: &#x27;Abdallah ibn Ahmad al-Mazru&#x27;i (died 1823)
*1823–1826: Sulayman ibn &#x27;Ali al-Mazru&#x27;i

From 9 February 1824 to 25 July 1826, there was a British protectorate over Mombasa, represented by governors. Omani rule was restored in 1826; seven where appointed. On 24 June 1837, it was nominally annexed by Said bin Sultan of Muscat and Oman.

===British rule and independence===

On 25 May 1887 Mombasa was relinquished to the British East Africa Association, later the Imperial British East Africa Company. It came under British administration in 1895.
It soon became the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate and the sea terminal of the Uganda Railway, construction of which was started in 1896. Many workers were brought in from British India to build the railway, and the city&#x27;s fortunes revived. The Sultan of Zanzibar formally presented the town to the British in 1898.

Mombasa became the capital of the Kenya Colony Protectorate of Kenya, sometime between 1887 and around 1906. The capital was later moved because medical officers warned that the ground was swampy, and urged Sir James Hayes Sadler, then Commissioner of the East Africa Protectorate, to plead with London to move the town elsewhere to mitigate potential disease. Nairobi has since been Kenya&#x27;s capital to date.

The Mombasa tusks, one of the city&#x27;s best-known monuments, were originally constructed in 1952 by the British administration of the Kenya Colony, commemorating the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the city.

In 2018, as part of an effort to increase tourism, Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho issued a directive requiring that all buildings in the Old Town and the Central Business District be painted white with Egyptian blue trim and banned all signs from their walls or canopies. Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works County Executive Tawfiq Balala stated that the city wanted to be &quot;the most photographed in Africa&quot;.

== Geography ==

Being a coastal town, Mombasa is characterised by a flat topography. The town of Mombasa is centred on Mombasa Island, but extends to the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by two creeks, Port Reitz in the south and Tudor Creek in the north.

== Climate ==
Mombasa has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: &quot;As&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Asha&quot;). The amount of rainfall essentially depends on the season. The rainiest months are April and May, while rainfall is minimal between January and February.

Located near the equator, Mombasa has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging .

As a seaport, Mombasa is subject to detrimental consequences of a fluctuating climate. In October 2006, Mombasa experienced a large flood that affected 60,000 people.

Like the rest of Kenya, climate change is already creating challenges for the city: coastal erosion has become a problem for infrastructure in Mombasa. Due to rising sea levels, the coastline has been eroding at per year. This has increased the number of annual floods.

== Suburbs ==

Mombasa is located on Mombasa Island and sprawls to the surrounding mainlands. The island is separated from the mainland by two creeks: Tudor Creek and Kilindini Harbour. It is connected to the mainland to the north by the Nyali Bridge, to the south by the Likoni Ferry, and to the west by the Makupa Causeway, alongside which runs the Kenya-Uganda Railway. The port serves both Kenya and countries of the interior, linking them to the ocean. The city is served by Moi International Airport located in the northwest mainland suburb of Chaani.

=== Mombasa Island ===

=== North Coast ===

Nyali, also considered a prime and up-market residential area, it is on the mainland north of the island and is linked by the New Nyali Bridge. It has numerous beach front hotels in the area known as the &quot;North Coast&quot;. Nyali has two distinct sections – the upmarket Old Nyali and the upcoming New Nyali. For many residents, Nyali has now become a self-contained residential area, with two Nakumatts, a multiplex cinema, shopping malls, banks, schools and post offices. This often eliminates the need for residents to cross the bridge and to go into the congested Mombasa city centre. Nyali is home for the Nyali Cinemax complex, Mamba Village, the Nyali Golf Club, and some of the most prestigious academic institutions of the Coast Province.

Kongowea is a densely populated area with 15 villages, two sub-locations and an estimated population of 106,180 residents. Kongowea is a cosmopolitan settlement mainly inhabited by people from mainland who migrated into the city in search of employment, mainly in service and manufacturing sector. The area is adjacent to the rich suburb of Nyali which employs a portion of the village residents. They are mainly hired as cheap labour as watchmen, gardeners, masons for up coming houses and house help. The most well known villages inside Kongowea include Kisumu Ndogo, Shauri Yako and Mnazi Mmoja, despite being located in this prime area, many residents live under extreme conditions – poor sanitation, high crime rate and lack of basic essential amenities like schools, hospitals and tap water. Kongowea is also home to one of the largest open-air markets in the African Great Lakes.

Bamburi is an outlying township (fifteen minutes drive) along the Malindi road. It is home to Bamburi Cement factory, the largest cement plant in the East African region. Other notable features in the area are the Jomo Kenyatta public beach, commonly known as Pirates, and Haller Park, a nature trail and wildlife conservatory. Kiembeni Estate, also in the Bamburi area, hosts around 100,000 residents. The estate has its own supermarket, several retail shops, salons and boutiques, and a number of licensed drinking dens. The establishments include The Shilla Bar, Turkey Base, Stars Garden and Sensera pub. Kiembeni is arguably the largest estate in Mombasa, and growing even faster.

Other areas include, Shanzu, Mkomani, Bombolulu, Kisauni and, across the Mtwapa creek, the popular area of Mtwapa, which is already located in Kilifi county.

The North Coast has an entertainment industry which attracts locals and tourists.

=== South Coast ===

Likoni: is a lower income and lower-middle-class neighbourhood connected to Mombasa Island by ferry. It is south of Mombasa Island and is made up of mostly Swahili and non-Swahili Bantu tribes. The ferry was the target of the Likoni Riots of 1997. The Liwatoni Pedestrian Floating Bridge was built and designed to ease pressure on the Likoni ferry crossing by taking up most of the foot traffic, leaving the ferries to serve vehicular and cargo crossing between Mombasa Island and the South Coast.

Diani Beach: a beach resort area situated over the Likoni Ferry on the south coast of Mombasa. It is located some 36 km (22 miles) south of Mombasa city on the mainland coast and is a prime resort for many local and international tourists. Diani Beach has an airport at Ukunda town to cater for tourists who fly there directly from Nairobi Wilson or any other airports and airfields in the country.

=== Mombasa Mainland ===
Magongo: is an outlying township 20 minutes driving distance northwest of Mombasa Island, situated on the Nairobi Highway. This fringe community lacks any effective electricity, water or sewer systems, with a general lack of infrastructure. Poverty, lack of sanitation, and unemployment continue to be the greatest issues for the Mikindani Township, which have ensured low health and safety standards for its residents. Poor, lower class housing is widespread, ranging from simple stone, two-storey structures to mud and earth homes fitted with corrugated iron roofs. Much of the community works outside of the township, within Mombasa Island itself as there is a lack of employment and industry. There are a number of small health clinics, shops, and a few public primary schools: Nazarene primary is one school, which is known in particular as being staffed by a revolving volunteer teacher base from Western, and predominately English speaking nations. This small town serves as a link between the city and Moi International Airport. Magongo is also home to the Akamba Handicraft Cooperative.

Mikindani, a suburban area: This is an outlying township on the mainland along the Nairobi Highway. It is built in the heavy industrial sections of Changamwe and mainly accommodate the working class who either work in the industries, the town centre on the Island and the Port at Kilindini harbour.

Miritini: outlying township on the Mombasa Nairobi Highway which is first growing as a suburban area.

== Demography ==

Mombasa city has a population of 1,208,333 per the 2019 census.

Mombasa has a cosmopolitan population, with the Swahili people and Mijikenda predominant. Other communities include the Akamba and Taita Bantus as well as a significant population of Luo and Luhya. Gusii, Agikuyu, peoples from Western Kenya. The major religions practised in the city are Christianity and Islam. Over the centuries, many immigrants and traders have settled in Mombasa, particularly from the Middle East.

== Economy ==


Mombasa is an important economic centre in Kenya. In addition to the coffee trade, the food and chemical industries, there is a steel mill, an aluminum rolling mill, an oil refinery and a cement plant. The city is home to the most important seaport in East Africa, Kilindini Harbour, which is also used by the neighbouring countries Tanzania and Uganda for their imports and exports.

&quot;Kilindini&quot; is an old Swahili term meaning &quot;deep&quot;. The port is so-called because the channel is naturally very deep. Kilindini Harbour is an example of a natural geographic phenomenon called a ria, formed at the end of the last glacial period when the sea level rose and engulfed a river that was flowing from the mainland.

Mombasa is a centre of coastal tourism in Kenya. Mombasa Island itself is not a main attraction, although many people visit the Old Town and Fort Jesus. The Nyali, Bamburi, and Shanzu beaches are located north of the city. The Shelly, Tiwi, and Diani beaches are located south of Mombasa. Several luxury hotels exist on these beaches, while the less expensive hotels are located further away.

Mombasa&#x27;s northern shoreline is renowned for its vibrant 24-hour entertainment offers, including both family entertainment (water parks, cinemas, bowling, etc.), sports (watersports, mountain biking and gokarting), culinary offers (restaurants offering a wide range of specialties from Kenya, China, Japan, India, Italy, Germany and other countries) and nightlife (bars, pubs, clubs, discothèques, etc.).

Other local industries include an oil refinery with a capacity of a day, and a cement factory capable of producing over 1.1 million tons per year. The major intercontinental undersea telecom cables reach shore next to Mombasa, connecting the African Great Lakes to the rest of the world and supporting a fast-growing call centre business in the area. The estimated real GDP growth for Kenya in 2016 is 5.7-6.0%. This growth will be in response to the construction of a railway system from Nairobi to Mombasa which will aid in trade and transportation between Kenya&#x27;s two major cities.

Mombasa will become a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in which certain industries such as tea, garments, and footwear will be exempt from certain taxes to promote domestic growth. This is in response to the deficiencies in Export Processing Zones (EPZ).

The Kenyan Dock Worker&#x27;s Union is situated in Mombasa and has roughly 5,000 members.

President Kenyatta has made it a priority to deepen economic ties with Asia at the onset of his presidency. Japan has played a role in financially sponsoring the expansion of the Mombasa port in phase one and two of the expansion project.

At 44%, the rate of youth unemployment in Mombasa is more than double the national average of 21% (2016).

== Transport ==
=== Air ===
Moi International Airport is located in the city of Mombasa, and is the second largest airport in Kenya with daily flights to Nairobi and other Kenyan, European and Middle Eastern destinations. The airport also handles a large amount of air cargo through its freight terminal.


=== Rail ===
Mombasa has a modern railway station on the Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway that replaced the narrow-gauge Uganda Railway completed in 1901 under British colonial rule. Completed in 2017 and located at Miritini, the Mombasa Terminus station links Mombasa to Nairobi. The station, situated about 20 kilometres from the city centre, is accessible through the newly built (2018) highway, being the first phase of the Dongo Kundu bypass. Kenya Railways transports passengers and cargo through the Standard Gauge Railway between Nairobi to Mombasa.

=== Road ===
Driving in Mombasa is straightforward and the majority of the roads are tarmacked. The Mombasa–Nairobi Expressway connects Mombasa to the capital city Nairobi.

Within Mombasa, most local people use &quot;matatus&quot; (mini-buses) which are extremely common in Kenya, to move around the city and its suburbs. The &quot;tuk-tuk&quot;—a motor vehicle with three wheels—is widely used as transport around the city and its suburbs. No more than three passengers may be carried. A &quot;boda-boda&quot; is originally a bicycle taxi but have long since been replaced by motorcycles.

=== Sea ===

The port of Mombasa is the largest in East Africa, with 19 deep water berths with two additional berths nearing completion and two oil terminals. The port is connected by rail and road to the interior. At present there is little or no scheduled passenger service from the port, however, international cruise ships frequent the port. The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region. In connection with the Silk Road Initiative, China has started infrastructure development projects in Kenya and is building roads, railways and public buildings on credit.

==== Ferry ====

There is no bridge between Mombasa Island and the south coast, instead the route is served by ferries operated by the Kenya Ferry Service from Kilindini and Mtongwe to Likoni in the south coast of Mombasa. The last major accident occurred in 1994 when a ferry serving Mtongwe route sank killing more than 270 people.

As a result of the increase in more luxurious hotels along the south coast and a lack of a direct bridge linking with Mombasa island, visiting tourists have the option of flying directly from Nairobi into the South Coast airstrip at Ukunda.

The Dongo Kundu Bypass Highway is under construction (as at 20128). With a total of three bridges, it will finally connect the mainland to the south coast easing the burden on the ferry services. Mombasa Gate Bridge will connect the mainland to Likoni, this will eliminate the usage of the unsafe ferry which has claimed hundreds of lives.

== Education ==
The major university in the island is the Technical University of Mombasa.
The city has a campus of Kenyatta University.
Other major university campuses include University of Nairobi-Mombasa campus, Mount Kenya University-Mombasa campus, JKUAT-Mombasa, Shanzu Teachers Training College, Mombasa Technical College, Bandari college, Utalii college, and ICS college Mombasa.

Many Hindus visit Mombasa to pray at a number of naturally formed Lingam that have formed in the Nyali beach Gombeshwar Caves. According to local folklore, the cave-temple was found a long time ago when a group of local herders were puzzled after they noticed that one of their cows regularly released all of her milk at a specific yet random spot on the hills. They are then said to have approached some Hindu families living in the area to ask if they had any idea behind the strange behaviour by the cow. The group then teamed up, made their way to the spot and started digging. That is how they ended up stumbling into the cave where they found a &#x27;Shiva Lingam&#x27; – an abstract representation of the Hindu God Lord Shiva, whose vehicle is Nandi (mythology). Hindus worship Lord Shiva by offering milk to a Lingam.

Other places of worship within Mombasa include the Sikh Shree Guru Gobind Singh Sabha Temple and the Shree Parshva Vallabh Jain Temple.

<text>Umm Qasr (, also transliterated as &quot;Um-qasir&quot;, &quot;Um-qasser, Um Qasr. Kurdish: ئومقەسڕ, Ûmqêsir&quot;) is a port city in southern Iraq. It stands on the canalised Khawr az-Zubayr, part of the Khawr Abd Allah estuary which leads to the Persian Gulf. It is separated from the border of Kuwait by a small inlet. A bridge across the waterway linked the port with Kuwait prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

==History==

===Village to port===

Umm Qasr was originally a small fishing town, but was used as a military port on several occasions before advancing trades and jobs by building a deep-water port on the coast. It was said to have been the site of Alexander the Great&#x27;s landing in Mesopotamia in 325 BC. During the Second World War a temporary port was established there by the Allies to unload supplies to dispatch to the Soviet Union. It fell back into obscurity after the war, but the government of King Faisal II sought to establish a permanent port there in the 1950s.

After the Iraqi Revolution of 1958, a naval base was established at Umm Qasr. The port was subsequently founded in 1961 by the Iraqi ruler General Abdul-Karim Qassem. It was intended to serve as Iraq&#x27;s only &quot;deep water&quot; port, reducing the country&#x27;s dependence on the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway that marks the border with Iran. The port facilities were built by a consortium of companies from West Germany, Sweden and Lebanon, with a railway line connecting it to Basra and Baghdad. The port opened for business in July 1967.

===Iran–Iraq War===
During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) its importance increased as fighting restricted access to other ports further east. Umm Qasr was threatened after the Iranian invasion and occupation of the al-Faw Peninsula in 1986 but the port never fell.

===Gulf War===

Access to the port was part of the territorial dispute with Kuwait which led to the 1990 Persian Gulf War. Both countries contested ownership of the inlet leading to Umm Qasr as well as control of the nearby Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah. After the war, during which the port was bombed, control of the inlet was transferred to Kuwait and a large trench and sand berm was constructed along the border. The Iraqi government rejected the border changes and continued to claim Kuwaiti territory near the port. The Iraqi government shifted much commerce to Umm Qasr from Basra to punish the Basrawis economically for their support of the post-war rebellions against Saddam Hussein.

===U.S.-led invasion===

Umm Qasr was the target of one of the first major military operations in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, on March 21, 2003. The assault on the port was spearheaded by British Royal Marines, US Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and Polish GROM troops, but Iraqi forces put up unexpectedly strong resistance, requiring several days&#x27; fighting before the area was cleared of defenders. After the waterway was de-mined by Australian Clearance Diving Team Three, Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron FOURTEEN Detachment ONE and Naval Special Clearance Team ONE of the U.S. Navy and Royal Navy Fleet Diving Unit 3 and reopened, Umm Qasr played an important role in the shipment of humanitarian supplies to Iraqi civilians.

During a debate in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in late March 2003, British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon somewhat inadvisedly compared Umm Qasr to the southern English city of Southampton. The analogy was met with scepticism among the troops. A British soldier was widely quoted as retorting, &quot;There&#x27;s no beer, no prostitutes and people are shooting at us. It&#x27;s more like Portsmouth&quot;. In January 2006, the 100th British soldier died in Iraq. Corporal Gordon Pritchard, was killed in a bomb explosion in the town. An American Air Force enlistee, Derek Mohamed Adas, described his war-time experience at Camp Bucca and the poverty of the surrounding area in his interview with the Library of Congress&#x27; Veterans History Project in 2013.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

==Today==

===Town===
Population estimates are around 46,000 people living in Umm Qasr town at the outbreak of the 2003 war. Having grown from a tiny fishing village in 1958, the town is laid out in planned housing tracts, with workers living near the previously state-owned industries which employed them. Almost the entire population were relocated from other parts of Iraq to work in state-run industries. The port (and its workforce) were dramatically expanded following the first Gulf War, in part to remove vital functions from Basra, scene of a major anti-government uprising. A mapping project shortly thereafter stated &quot;In total, the town is composed of 82 streets; each street has 72 houses. Up to three to four families live in each house.&quot; It then described three main neighborhoods:
* &quot;North Indian Camp&quot; (&quot;Hindi Court&quot;) in the north, with 6,600 people and 37 streets
* &quot;South Indian Camp&quot; to the west of town, mostly to house port workers.
* &quot;Port/Customs Office&quot; with housing and offices for the Iraqi Ministry of Industry; housing for workers in the pipe, steel, and cement factories.

====Public services====
Prior to the 2003 war, Umm Qasr had 13 primary schools (four for boys, four for girls, and five coeducational), two intermediate schools for boys, and five secondary schools (two for boys, one night school for boys, and two for girls). There was a single hospital for the town.

Today, the population of Umm Qasr communities is around 55,000 people. There are shortages in the higher education services in the city, and most of the students are traveling to Basra&#x27;s one public university about 57 km, or to the Technical Institute in Al-Zubair region. However, the city has also had many of its people migrate to the European Union, Canada and Australia. The town has a multicultural community, and the borders with neighboring country Kuwait and sea borders has offered people more understanding of the port city&#x27;s lifestyle.

====Sports====
Football is the most popular sport among the youth in Umm Qasr. There are many local teams, but the greatest public support is for the Port Culp team in the mother port of Maqel in downtown Basrah. Some of the youth are involved in swimming in the gulf water; also, some people are focusing on the running sports. Female participation in sports is limited in the public schools.

====Rail line====
A branch of the main Iraqi Republic Railways line connects Umm Qasr to Basra from Shouaiba Junction (near Basra) via the port of Khawr az-Zubayr.

====Airport====
Umm Qasr has a civil aviation airport, with the ICAO Code of ORUQ.

===Buildings and structures===

<text>[[Prince]] Louis Rwagasore (; 10 January 1932 – 13 October 1961) was a Burundian prince and politician, who was the second prime minister of Burundi for two weeks, from 28 September 1961 until his assassination on 13 October.

Born to the Ganwa family of Burundian Mwami (king) Mwambutsa IV in Belgian-administered Ruanda-Urundi in 1932, Rwagasore was educated in Burundian Catholic schools before attending university in Belgium. After he returned to Burundi in the mid-1950s he founded a series of cooperatives to economically empower native Burundians and build up his base of political support. The Belgian administration took over the venture, and as a result of the affair his national profile increased and he became a leading figure of the anti-colonial movement.

He soon thereafter became involved with a nationalist political party, the Union for National Progress (UPRONA). He pushed for Burundian independence from Belgian control, national unity, and the institution of a constitutional monarchy. Rwagasore sought to bring UPRONA mass appeal across different regions, ethnicities, and castes, and under him the party maintained a leadership balanced between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis, though the latter were usually favoured for more important positions. The Belgian administration disliked UPRONA and initially attempted to stifle Rwagasore&#x27;s activities, placing him under house arrest in 1960 during municipal elections.

International pressure led the administration to back down, and the following year UPRONA won an overwhelming majority in the legislative elections. As a result, Rwagasore became prime minister of Burundi on 28 September 1961. Two weeks later, he was gunned down by a Greek national at the direction of leaders of a rival political party with the probable support of the Belgian Resident in Burundi. Rwagasore&#x27;s death derailed his attempts to build national ethnic cohesion and facilitated the growth of Hutu–Tutsi tensions in the country. It also fractured UPRONA, as his former lieutenants engaged in a power struggle to succeed him as the party&#x27;s leader. Within Burundi, Rwagasore enjoys nearly universal acclaim, and his assassination is commemorated annually with large ceremonies. He remains relatively unknown internationally in comparison to other leaders of independence movements in the African Great Lakes region.

== Early life ==

Prince Louis Rwagasore was born on 10 January 1932 in Gitega, Ruanda-Urundi, to Mwami (king) Urundi Mwambutsa IV and Thérèse Kanyonga. Ethnically, he was a member of the Bezi clan of the Ganwa, a group of people of aristocratic status often associated with the Tutsis. The frequency of matrimonial alliances among the Ganwa gave Rwagasore familial links to numerous chiefs in Urundi. Mwambutsa and Kanyonga after giving birth to Louis, birthed two daughters, Rosa Paula Iribagiza and Régine Kanyange, before divorcing in 1940. Mwambutsa remarried in 1946 and fathered a second son, Charles Ndizeye. Rwagasore began attending school at the age of seven, going to Catholic institutions in Bukeye, Kanyinya, and Gitega. In 1945 Rwagasore enrolled in the Groupe Scolaire d&#x27;Astrida. He studied there for six years, and in 1951, he went to Antwerp to study at the University Institute of Overseas Territories (). He was a poor student, but after one year at the institute he enrolled at the Catholic University of Leuven, where after three years of study he earned a degree in political economy. Rwagasore returned to Urundi in December 1956. In April 1957 he was hired by the Belgian administration to oversee studies of economic, agricultural, and administrative concerns. On 12 September 1959 he married a Hutu woman, Marie-Rose Ntamikevyo, in Usumbura. They had two daughters, both of whom died in infancy.

== Political career ==

=== CCB and leadership of UPRONA ===

Ruanda-Urundi Governor [[Jean-Paul Harroy]] (right),

In June 1957 Rwagasore founded a series of cooperatives, known as the Traders&#x27; Cooperatives of Burundi (, CCB), with the goal of empowering native Urundians to control their own commerce and thus building his personal support among Swahili traders of Usumbura. In its first public meeting, the CCB drew a crowd of 200 merchants, and it secured several favourable contracts with exporters. It facilitated the creation of links between rural farmers and urban traders, and, at the same time, Urundians began protesting fees and taxes levied by the Belgians. The colonial administration was irritated by the CCB, but reasoned that it could not take direct action against Rwagasore, with Governor of Ruanda-Urundi Jean-Paul Harroy writing to the Minister of Colonies that detaining or deporting the eldest son of the Mwami would be poorly received by peasants and lead to civil disorder.

Despite its early successes, the CCB ran into financial trouble, in part due to mismanagement. Rwagasore attributed the cooperatives&#x27; problems to Belgian sabotage, while the colonial administration accused Rwagasore of embezzling its money to fund a lavish lifestyle. To what extent either of these factors was true and how heavily they affected the project remains unclear. Rwagasore spent three months at the Expo 58 in Brussels seeking new investors and asked for help from President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, but these appeals were unsuccessful. He then requested credit for the cooperatives from the Supreme Land Council (), an advisory body presided over by the Mwami that had some competence over budgetary and administrative affairs in Urundi. Though the Belgian administration informed the council that it disapproved of the cooperative, Rwagasore convinced the body to support him. The Belgian administration formally vetoed the loan in June, and intervened to take over the CCB. In the ensuing struggle, Rwagasore&#x27;s national profile dramatically increased and he became a leading figure of the anti-colonial activists. The CCB was ultimately merged with an administration cooperative. As a result of the affair he forged connections with Tanganyikan nationalist Julius Nyerere, who provided him with advice and financial assistance.

Some time thereafter, Rwagasore became involved with a nascent political party, the Union for National Progress (, UPRONA), though sources differ on the circumstances of UPRONA&#x27;s founding and Rwagasore&#x27;s role in its early days. He took virtual control over the movement, though his familial connection to the Mwami disqualified him from holding any party offices and he officially served UPRONA only as an advisor. UPRONA was able to secure the early financial support of the Swahili population in Bujumbura and Lake Tanganyika coastline. The party initially was strongly identified with the interests of the Bezi lineage of Ganwa and support for traditional institutions, but this alignment fell apart after Rwagasore came into conflict with his father. Mwambutsa had been quietly supportive of his son&#x27;s attempts to build a political career in the late 1950s, but encouraged other Ganwa to compete with Rwagasore to ensure his own authority remained unchallenged. Mwambutsa cared little for UPRONA and his son was not among his close confidants. At the centre of their political differences was Rwagasore&#x27;s anti-colonial rhetoric, which frustrated Mwambutsa, as he felt it strained the monarchy&#x27;s relationship with the Belgians. In an attempt to distract Rwagasore from politics, the Belgian administration designated him head of the Butanyerera chiefdom (an area in Ngozi Province) in February 1959. He resigned from the post to focus on his political career.

Under Rwagasore, UPRONA pushed a program of modernisation, committing neither to a return to the feudal system nor a complete societal transformation. He used symbols of the monarchy to communicate his message and often emphasised his princely status at public appearances, but he stressed that UPRONA would support the monarchy &quot;only insofar as this regime and its dynasty favoured the genuine emancipation of the Murundi people&quot;. He believed that only a constitutional monarchy could maintain legitimacy and that the Mwami should cede most authority to a civilian government. While conscious of socioeconomic problems, he primarily focused on issues relating to Urundian independence, popular legitimacy of the monarchy, and national unity. He advocated a foreign policy of nonalignment in the ongoing Cold War. Rwagasore sought to transform UPRONA into a mass party with broad-base appeal across different regions, ethnicities, and castes.

Wary of the growing Hutu–Tutsi conflict in Ruanda, he sought to counteract tensions by bringing members of both groups into UPRONA&#x27;s leadership. Formal party positions at both the national and local levels were usually evenly divided between Hutus and Tutsis, though the latter tended to occupy the most important offices. The party enjoyed some cohesive success in Usumbura, but never truly cultivated a mass political base, especially outside the capital. UPRONA&#x27;s internal rules set devolved responsibilities to the central committee, but in practice the party operated at the whim of Rwagasore; it retained relatively weak organisational capability and was held together by his charismatic leadership. His populist tendencies and personal popularity led many of the original chiefs who had supported UPRONA, including founding member Léopold Biha, to leave the party and engage in their own political activities. Rumours that the Mwami would pass the throne on to his younger son, Charles, facilitated criticisms by UPRONA&#x27;s rivals that the party was simply a mechanism for Rwagasore to achieve power. In response, he issued a tract which said, &quot;[I]f I do not become Mwami, will that prevent me from fighting for you, from being a great leader for you?&quot;

Rwagasore favoured &quot;immediate independence&quot; from Belgian control. To protest colonial rule, he encouraged boycotts of European goods and refusal to pay taxes. The Belgian administration was wary of Rwagasore&#x27;s nationalism, which it perceived as extremist, and supported the creation of a rival party, the Christian Democratic Party (, PDC), a grouping seen as more moderate and which rejected immediate independence. Despite ideological differences, the rivalries between the two parties were primarily fueled by the intra-nobility conflicts, as the Bezi and Tare lineages backed UPRONA and PDC respectively. The two lineages had long struggled for control of the country. In 1959 Tare leader Chief Pierre Baranyanka questioned whether Mwambutsa&#x27;s marriage to Kanyonga was legitimate according to custom in an attempt to challenge Rwagasore&#x27;s place in the line to the throne. Even though UPRONA had distanced themselves from the Bezi, Rwagasore was still perceived as leader of the Bezi nobility by the time of the elections. As the PDC and UPRONA campaigned in early 1960, the antipathy between Rwagasore and Baranyanka grew; the former feared an assassination plot sponsored by the chief and began carrying a gun, while the latter wrote letters to the Mwami to condemn him for failing to control his son.

=== 1960 and 1961 elections ===

Rwagasore participated in the independence celebrations of the Republic of the Congo in June 1960. As civil order broke down and the Congo fell into crisis, he released a joint communique with rival politician Joseph Biroli on 15 July, appealing for calm and racial harmony, saying Urundi had &quot;the unique chance ... to create in the heart of Africa an island of peace, tranquility and prosperity.&quot; In anticipation of Urundi&#x27;s first municipal elections in November 1960, he issued circulars which called for people to &quot;shake off foreign domination and slavery&quot;. Shortly before the contests were held, the administration placed Rwagasore under house arrest on 27 October with the pretext that he was violating a previous agreement by Urundian political parties stipulating that persons within two degrees of familial relationship to the Mwami be barred from political activity. It further accused him of possessing &quot;seditious&quot; pamphlets.

In reality, the administration hoped the arrest would weaken UPRONA and generate a more preferable outcome in the elections. At the administration&#x27;s encouragement, the PDC also joined with several other parties to create an anti-UPRONA cartel known as the Common Front (, FC). Angered by the arrest of their leader, UPRONA declared a boycott of the elections. The PDC won a plurality of the offices in the contest, and in early 1961 the administration established a transitional government under Joseph Cimpaye with some PDC ministers but none from UPRONA. Rwagasore was released after the elections on 9 December 1960. Subsequent international scrutiny, particularly from the United Nations (UN), led the Belgians to withdraw themselves from national politics. The UN created a Commission for Ruanda-Urundi which liberalised the political sphere and restored Rwagasore&#x27;s political rights. Thereafter he was allowed to engage in politics unhindered by the Belgian administration.

In 1961, the Belgian administration officially renamed Ruanda-Urundi as Rwanda-Burundi. For the 1961 legislative elections, UPRONA concentrated its entire election campaign on Rwagasore, using his charisma to rally substantial support. Rwagasore traveled across the country to introduce his party&#x27;s candidates. Over the course of the elections, he was able to assemble a broad political coalition; even though most of it was pro-monarchical, he also voiced support for the leftist ideas of Patrice Lumumba from the neighboring Congo. This earned him the support of a small group of radical anti-monarchist Tutsi intellectuals. In the end, Rwagasore&#x27;s coalition included representatives of the Tutsi oligarchy, conservative Hutu évolués, radical youth groups, urban factions, and large sections of the rural population. In general, UPRONA presented itself as strongly pro-monarchy, with the slogan &quot;God, Fatherland, Mwami&quot; being prominently used. The PDC had assumed victory was certain due to its success during the November 1960 municipal elections. It began its election campaign far too late, and also used the alternate slogan &quot;God and Fatherland&quot; which seemed to many Burundians to be deliberately critical of the monarchy, costing it substantial grassroots backing.

Burundi held legislative elections on 18 September 1961. With approximately 80% voter turnout, UPRONA won 58 of 64 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and Rwagasore was declared . Two days later he delivered a speech over national radio aimed at reconciliation, saying that UPRONA&#x27;s &quot;electoral victory is not the one of the party. It is the triumph of order, that of discipline, of peace, of public tranquility ... the electoral campaign is over, the past must be forgotten&quot;. Belgian officials were generally unhappy with Rwagasore&#x27;s victory, though they conceded some appreciation for his address. Angered by their loss, PDC members in Mukenke, Kirundo Province rioted and attacked UPRONA members. Rwagasore appealed to the latter not to be provoked, and the colonial authorities quickly restored order. On 28 September the Legislative Assembly convened to decide on a new government. In a secret ballot, 51 deputies indicated their desire for Rwagasore to lead the new government. He assembled a 10-member government of national unity which secured the confidence of all but one of the deputies in the Legislative Assembly and was sworn in. Pierre Ngendandumwe became Vice Prime Minister, while Rwagasore&#x27;s brother-in-law, André Muhirwa, was made Minister of Interior.

Rwagasore&#x27;s government did not offer a programme to the Assembly. In his inaugural address, he promised that his government would look &quot;into the real problems of the nation, especially the economic problems, the problems of the land and of the social emancipation of the population, the problems of education and so many others, to which we will find our own solutions.&quot; His government was generally welcomed by Burundians, although some Hutu UPRONA members felt they were underrepresented. The government did not have any control over matters of defence, foreign affairs, or technical assistance—these competencies being reserved to the Belgian Resident—though Rwagasore proclaimed his wish to reduce the role of the colonial administration in Burundi to one of consultative aid. His government pledged to incorporate opposition party members into the administration and supported a political union with Rwanda and Tanganyika, though he later suggested that he wanted an economic union with Tanganyika but no association with the ethnically polarised Rwanda. He also promised to address Hutu interests. However, UPRONA&#x27;s victory caused considerable unrest among the nobility, with the Tare lineage perceiving Rwagasore&#x27;s success as a takeover by the Bezi. Existing hostilities between the nobility escalated as a result of the elections. As a measure of reconciliation, Rwagasore appointed a Tare as Director of Tourism. The Belgian Resident in Burundi, Roberto Régnier, later claimed that Rwagasore planned to make several FC figures ambassadors or grant them other positions, though in an interview with the press in October the prime minister remained vague about the place of an opposition in the new regime.

== Death ==

On 13 October 1961, Rwagasore was shot in the throat, fired from approximately away from a group of bushes while dining outdoors with friends and his cabinet members at the Hotel Tanganyika in Usumbura. He was pronounced dead at the scene. In the ensuing confusion, Rwagasore&#x27;s assassin jumped into a waiting car and escaped. After being inspected by a doctor, Rwagasore&#x27;s corpse was taken to Rhodain Hospital. A witness described the getaway car to the authorities, and an investigator was able to connect the vehicle to a group of people he had seen in the capital earlier that day. Within three days the police had arrested a Greek national, Ioannis Kageorgis—who had fired the shot—and three Burundian accomplices: Antoine Nahimana, Henri Ntakiyica, and Jean-Baptiste Ntakiyica. The latter three were all members of the PDC. The group quickly admitted responsibility for the murder and incriminated three other persons in their plot: Michel Iatrou, Jean-Baptiste Ntidendereza, and Joseph Biroli. The former was a Greek national who had given money to the PDC and was a business associate of Kageorgis. The latter two were high-ranking members of the PDC, with Ntidendereza having previously served as a minister in government. As sons of Chief Pierre Baranyanka, they were also distant cousins of Rwagasore.

=== Investigation ===
The investigators concluded that Ntidendereza and Biroli planned the assassination. Iatrou denied this, while Ntidendereza initially implicated himself in the conspiracy, saying that FC leaders viewed Rwagasore as an existential threat to multi-party democracy and that the prime minister had planned assassination attempts against himself and his father, before later recanting his testimony. The investigators also uncovered three previous assassination plots against Rwagasore in September which had been cancelled. On 2 April 1962 a Burundian tribunal composed of Belgian judges sentenced Kageorgis, Nahimana, and Ntidendereza to death for their role in the murder. Two others accused of minor roles in the affair, Pascal Bigirindavyi (a Burundian) and Liverios Archianotis (a Greek), were given prison sentences. On 7 May the Court of Appeal affirmed Kageorgis&#x27; sentence but commuted the other death sentences to 20 years of penal servitude. On 30 June, one day before Burundi&#x27;s independence, Kageorgis was executed. Following independence Burundi established a Supreme Court with retroactive competence, and on 27 October it ruled the previous trials to have violated the right to judgement by a jury established by the new constitution and ordered a retrial. On 27 November the lower court found Ntidendereza, Biroli, Nahimana, Iatrou, and Ntakiyica guilty and sentenced them to death. The defendants&#x27; final appeal to the Supreme Court was denied, as were the attempts of the Belgian government to convince the Mwami to offer clemency, and on 15 January 1963 all five were publicly hanged.

=== Responsibility ===

There was immediate concern in Burundi following the killing that the Belgian administration shared responsibility for Rwagasore&#x27;s murder. When Governor Harroy went to the hospital to pay respects to the corpse of the late prime minister, Rwagasore&#x27;s mother confronted him in a hallway and slapped him. Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak sent several telegrams to officials in Usumbura inquiring about the role of &quot;Europeans&quot; in the events. Spaak was also fearful of a UN inquiry and ordered Harroy to send him a detailed report on the murder which he could present so as to assuage international concerns. The UN General Assembly ultimately passed a resolution calling for an investigation and dispatched a Commission for Ruanda-Urundi delegation to Burundi to draft a report. The commission noted complaints from UPRONA leaders which accused the administration of being complicit in the murder, with additional accusations of culpability lodged against Brioli&#x27;s and Ntidendereza&#x27;s father, Chief Baranyanka. The body also received complaints that the PDC leaders were given favourable treatment in prison. The commission&#x27;s report was ultimately dismissive of such concerns and affirmed the findings of the original criminal investigation.

Generally, little academic attention has been paid to the details of the murder. Political scientist René Lemarchand wrote, &quot;That the assassin, [Ioannis] Kageorgis, was a mere tool ... that the crime was the result of a political conspiracy organised by Biroli and Ntidendereza, and that the ultimate aim of this conspiracy was to create disturbances throughout the realm that would then be exploited by the PDC to its own advantages—these are well-established facts. However, the PDC leaders might have not resorted to such drastic action unless they had been actively encouraged to go ahead with their plans by certain Belgian functionaries.&quot; Harroy wrote in his 1987 memoirs pertaining to concerns of Belgian support for the assassination that, &quot;To deny this seems unreasonable.&quot; Belgian journalist Guy Poppe wrote a book on Rwagasore&#x27;s assassination in 2012, but conceded that its publication was rushed and that he was not &quot;well placed enough&quot; to make concrete claims on the extent of Belgian involvement. Historian Ludo De Witte concluded that the &quot;Residency at Gitega was an accomplice&quot; and that &quot;Belgian responsibility must be attributed to ... Régnier and some of his collaborators.

Noting civil disorder fomented by opposition members in the aftermath of the September 1961 elections with the alleged support of Belgian administrators, De Witte argued that Rwagasore&#x27;s assassination fit into a larger scheme to provoke a civil war which would allow the Belgian administration to intervene and install a regime of its choosing, as in Rwanda. In regards to the concrete motives of Biroli and Ntidendereza, political scientist Helmut Strizek and researcher Günther Philipp argued that Rwagasore&#x27;s assassination was probably inspired by the Bezi-Tare rivalry. The PDC&#x27;s European secretary, Sabine Belva, testified during the appellate trial that Régnier hosted a meeting shortly after the September elections and had asked &quot;whether the elimination of Rwagasore had been considered, as a means of solving the political problem.&quot; Belva stated that she reported this to Ntidendereza. In court, Régnier denied making such remarks. The Belgian judges determined in their verdict that these comments were only &quot;jokes which were expressed lightly&quot; and thus not worthy of serious investigation. Biroli&#x27;s and Ntidendereza&#x27;s lawyers also insisted on the responsibility of Belgian officials, though this was rejected by the presiding judge. Some lower-ranking officials in the Belgian Residency were dissuaded from testifying during the proceedings by the Belgian Foreign Ministry, which threatened to have them dismissed from their posts. A separate investigation conducted by the Brussels Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office after the initial Burundian proceedings ended—as Kageorgis had requested a pardon from the Belgian King on the grounds that others played a greater role in the murder—obtained the depositions of several Belgian civil servants. Hubert Léonard, an official in the Residency, testified that on 21 September 1961 Régnier had stated in a meeting, &quot;Rwagasore must be killed!&quot;

Confronted with this, Régnier admitted to the Brussels Office that he had said such. The evidence gathered by the Brussels Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office was not made public, though portions of it were shared with the Burundian courts once they reopened their investigation following independence. Spaak threatened to suspend bilateral aid to Burundi for renewing the inquiry, causing consternation to the Burundian government, though this never occurred. De Witte surmised, &quot;Burundi wanted the skin of those who murdered Rwagasore, at the risk of upsetting Brussels, but Spaak resigned himself to it and did not question Belgium&#x27;s &#x27;development aid&#x27; ... In return, Bujumbura kept the Brussels Public Prosecutor&#x27;s report under wraps and avoided accusing the Belgians.&quot; In 1972, the Burundian government issued a report in an attempt to deflect responsibility for the massacres of the Ikiza. The document included an accusation that Régnier had organised Rwagasore&#x27;s murder. The matter of the assassination was thereafter ignored by the government for many years, though in 2001 some Burundian parliamentarians called on the Belgian government to open an official investigation into the killing. On 14 October 2018 the Burundian government officially accused Belgium of being the &quot;true backer of the assassination of Rwagasore&quot; and declared that it would set up a &quot;technical commission&quot; to investigate the killing, though no progress on this has since been made.

=== Political effects ===

Muhirwa succeeded Rwagasore as Prime Minister of Burundi. Citing the distraction of &quot;recent events&quot;, Muhirwa declined to offer a government programme and the Legislative Assembly sat in session aimlessly for the next few months. The establishment of the role of opposition figures in the assassination plot and their subsequent execution led to the immediate demise of a formal parliamentary opposition in Burundi. Rwagasore&#x27;s death derailed his attempts to build national inter-ethnic cohesion and facilitated the growth of Hutu–Tutsi tensions; the latter came to eclipse the internal Ganwa rivalries in national politics. Subsequent governments remained ethnically diverse but unstable. The assassination also fractured UPRONA, as Rwagasore&#x27;s former lieutenants struggled to succeed him as the party&#x27;s leader; figures of Ganwa aristocracy eventually succeeded in claiming control of the organisation. UPRONA subsequently used Rwagasore&#x27;s image to promote itself while disregarding his vision for the party, ultimately becoming a vehicle for exclusionary, Tutsi-elitist, single-party rule. There is a belief among some Burundians that Rwagasore&#x27;s murder created a political void with long-term implications for the country and contributed to its later instability.

== Legacy ==

=== Burial and official commemoration ===

Rwagasore was buried on 18 October 1961 at the plot of Vugizo in Bujumbura. Burundi was granted independence in 1962, and in his official speech marking the event, Prime Minister Muhirwa paid extensive tribute to Rwagasore and credited him for pushing the country towards sovereignty. From 1962 to 1963 a monument was constructed at Rwagasore&#x27;s burial site, featuring a mausoleum and three arches with a black cross. Prince Louis Rwagasore Stadium was also constructed to honour him. The government funded these projects by releasing a series of postage stamps bearing his image in February 1963. That year the government declared 13 October a public holiday and renamed a hospital and avenue in Bujumbura in commemoration. His image was also used to adorn public buildings, while the first printings of the Burundian franc included banknotes with his visage. Two more postage series featuring Rwagasore were later released; one in 1966 pairing his image with that of assassinated United States President John F. Kennedy, and another in 1972 celebrating the 10th anniversary of Burundian independence. Numerous schools and roads in Burundi have since been named for him, as was the sole aircraft of the country&#x27;s first state airline, and the Legislative Assembly created the Order of Prince Louis as a national order of merit.

In 1966 Captain Michel Micombero launched a military coup, overthrowing the monarchy and transforming Burundi into a republic with himself as its president. UPRONA subsequently became the only legal political party. Micombero referred to himself as the &quot;successor&quot; and sometimes &quot;little brother&quot; of Rwagasore. Throughout his tenure the late prime minister was frequently honoured in public ceremonies, and his portrait remained prevalent in public places. In 1976, Micombero was overthrown and replaced by Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. Bagaza tried to present himself as a moderniser, and Rwagasore&#x27;s reputation thus competed with him. As a result, he deemphasised mention of Rwagasore and suspended celebration of the 13 October holiday. In 1987 Bagaza was overthrown by Major Pierre Buyoya. Following ethnic violence in 1988, Buyoya declared a policy of national unity, and used Rwagasore as a symbol of this. Under Buyoya&#x27;s tenure, more portraits of Rwagasore were hung in public places, the mausoleum was renovated and a UPRONA-sponsored Rwagasore Institute was created to promote national reconciliation.

In the 1990s, Burundi underwent a democratic transition which included the reestablishment of multi-party politics. The end of UPRONA&#x27;s monopoly on power led to a decline in public celebration of Rwagasore. One of the key nascent opposition parties, Front for Democracy in Burundi (, FRODEBU), made reference to Rwagasore in its official publication but avoided all associations of him with UPRONA. FRODEBU won the parliamentary and presidential elections in 1993. The new president, Melchior Ndadaye, did not attend any official commemorations for Rwagasore in October. Ndadaye was assassinated in a coup attempt later that month, plunging Burundi into a crisis which evolved into a civil war. During this time Rwagasore was usually invoked only by politicians in self-serving fashion or by newspapers calling for reconciliation.

In the late 1990s, the belligerents in the civil war partook in peace talks. The resulting Arusha Accords praised the &quot;charismatic leadership of Prince Louis Rwagasore and his companions&quot; who had kept Burundi from &quot;plunging into a political confrontation based on ethnic considerations&quot;. The implementation of the accords and further negotiation eventually resulted in the election of Pierre Nkurunziza as president in 2005. During his tenure, he attended annual celebrations of Rwagasore in October and frequently mentioned him in his speeches. His government also repaired several monuments to the late premier and erected a new one jointly honoring him and Ndadaye at a roundabout in Bujumbura. In 2019 he renamed Rwagasore Stadium, but stated that the planned parliament building to be built in Gitega would bear Rwagasore&#x27;s name.

=== Popular reputation ===

After his death, historian Aidan Russell wrote that Rwagasore&#x27;s reputation was quickly transformed into that of a &quot;hero and martyr&quot; and that he was the subject of a &quot;competitive hagiography&quot;. Within Burundi, his reputation enjoys nearly-universal acclaim, with his speeches often quoted in political discussions and his surviving political opponents and their descendants offering praise of him. His assassination is commemorated annually with large ceremonies.

Historian Christine Deslaurier wrote that &quot;it is the martyrological dimensions of his anti-colonialism that have established a consensus around his mythical figure, more than his political and social thought.&quot; De Witte wrote that Rwagasore has &quot;functioned as a two-dimensional icon&quot;. Rwagasore&#x27;s widespread popularity in Burundi stands in contrast to the divided feelings toward most other domestic historical figures. He remains relatively unknown internationally, with his career overshadowed by those of Nyerere and Lumumba and his assassination eclipsed by the Congo Crisis and the contemporary ethnic violence in Rwanda.

<text>A stream gauge, streamgage or stream gauging station is a location used by hydrologists or environmental scientists to monitor and test terrestrial bodies of water. Hydrometric measurements of water level surface elevation (&quot;stage&quot;) and/or volumetric discharge (flow) are generally taken and observations of biota and water quality may also be made. The locations of gauging stations are often found on topographical maps. Some gauging stations are highly automated and may include telemetry capability transmitted to a central data logging facility.

==Measurement equipment==
Automated direct measurement of stream discharge is difficult at present. Mathematically, measuring stream discharge is estimating the volumetric flow rate, which is in general a flux integral and thus requires many cross-sectional velocity measurements. In place of the direct measurement of stream discharge, one or more surrogate measurements can be used as proxy variables to produce discharge values. In the majority of cases, a stage (the elevation of the water surface) measurement is used as the surrogate. Low gradient (or shallow-sloped) streams are highly influenced by variable downstream channel conditions. For these streams, a second stream gauge would be installed, and the slope of the water surface would be calculated between the gauges. This value would be used along with the stage measurement to more accurately determine the streamflow discharge. Improvements in the accuracy of velocity sensors have also allowed the use of water velocity as a reliable surrogate for streamflow discharge at sites with a stable cross-sectional area. These sensors are permanently mounted in the stream and measure velocity at a particular location in the stream.

In those instances where only a stage measurement is used as the surrogate, a rating curve must be constructed. A rating curve is the functional relation between stage and discharge. It is determined by making repeated discrete measurements of streamflow discharge using a velocimeter and some means to measure the channel geometry to determine the cross-sectional area of the channel. The technicians and hydrologists responsible for determining the rating curve visit the site routinely, with special trips to measure the hydrologic extremes (floods and droughts), and make a discharge measurement by following an explicit set of instructions or standard operating procedures (SOPs).
 
Once the rating curve is established, it can be used in conjunction with stage measurements to determine the volumetric streamflow discharge. This record then serves as an assessment of the volume of water that passes by the stream gauge and is useful for many tasks associated with hydrology.

In those instances where a velocity measurement is additionally used as a surrogate, an index velocity determination is conducted. This analysis uses a velocity sensor, often either magnetic or acoustic, to measure the velocity of the flow at a particular location in the stream cross section. Once again, discrete measurements of streamflow discharge are made by the technician or hydrologist at a variety of stages. For each discrete determination of streamflow discharge, the mean velocity of the cross section is determined by dividing streamflow discharge by the cross-sectional area. A rating curve, similar to that used for stage-discharge determinations, is constructed using the mean velocity and the index velocity from the permanently mounted meter. An additional rating curve is constructed that relates stage of the stream to cross-sectional area. Using these two ratings, the automatically collected stage produces an estimate of the cross-sectional area, and the automatically collected index velocity produces an estimate of the mean velocity of the cross section. The streamflow discharge is computed as the product of the estimate of the cross section area and the estimate of the mean velocity of the streamflow.

A variety of hydraulic structures / primary device are used to improve the reliability of using water level as a surrogate for flow (improving the accuracy of the rating table), including:
* Weirs
**V-notch,
** broad-crested,
** sharp-crested and
** combination weirs
* Flumes
**Parshall flume

Other equipment commonly used at permanent stream gauge include:
* Cableways - for suspending a hydrographer and current meter over a river to make high flow measurement
* Stilling well - to provide a calm water level that can be measured by a sensor

Water level gauges:
* Staff (head) gauges - for a visual indication of water depth
* Water pressure measuring device (Bubbler) - to measure water level via pressure (typically done directly in-stream without a stilling well)
* Stage encoder - a potentiometer with a wheel and pulley system connected to a float in a stilling well to provide an electronic reading of the water level
* Simple ultrasonic devices - to measure water level in a stilling well or directly in a canal.
* Electromagnetic gauges

Discharge measurements of a stream or canal without an established stream gauge can be made using a current meter or Acoustic Doppler current profiler. One informal methods that is not acceptable for any official or scientific purpose, but can be useful is the float method, in which a floating object such as a piece of wood or orange peel is observed floating down the stream.

==National stream gauge networks==
===United Kingdom===
The first routine measurements of river flow in England began on the Thames and Lea in the 1880s, and in Scotland on the River Garry in 1913. The national gauging station network was established in its current form by the early 1970s and consists of approximately 1500 flow measurement stations supplemented by a variable number of temporary monitoring sites. The Environment Agency is responsible for collection and analysis of hydrometric data in England, Natural Resources Wales in Wales, whilst responsibility for Scotland and Northern Ireland rests with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Rivers Agency respectively.

===United States===
In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the principal federal agency tasked with maintaining records of natural resources. Within the USGS, the Water Resources Division carries the responsibility for monitoring water resources.

To establish a stream gauge, USGS personnel first choose a site on a stream where the geometry is relatively stable and there is a suitable location to make discrete direct measurements of streamflow using specialized equipment. Many times this will be at a bridge or other stream crossing. Technicians then install equipment that measures the stage (the elevation of the water surface) or, more rarely, the velocity of the flow. Additional equipment is installed to record and transmit these readings (via the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) to the Water Science Center office where the records are kept. The USGS has a Water Science Center office in every state within the United States. Current streamflow data from USGS streamgages may be viewed in map form at: .

===Zimbabwe===

In Zimbabwe, the national stream gauge network is the responsibility of the Zimbabwe National Water Authority. This is an extensive network covering all major rivers and catchments in the country. However, a review of existing gauges raised serious concerns about the reliability of the data of a minority of stations, due in part to ongoing funding problems.

=== Bangladesh ===
The largest stream gauge network in Bangladesh is maintained by Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). At few other locations, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority maintains a few gauges to provide advisories for navigational purposes.

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, in some measuring places (profiles) are defined three levels which define three degrees of flood-emergency activity. The degree I is a situation of alertness, the degree II is a situation of readiness, the degree III is a situation of danger.

=== Canada ===
Canadian streams and rivers are monitored by the Water Survey of Canada, a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada. As of 2021, it operates or collects data from more than 2800 gauges across Canada. This data is used by provincial and territory governments to inform flood predictions and water management.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka stream and rivers are monitored by  Hydrology and Disaster Management Division a branch of Irrigation Department. It operates nearly 40 gauging station around the island.
