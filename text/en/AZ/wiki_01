<text>USS &quot;George Washington&quot; (CVN-73) is a United States Navy nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the sixth carrier in the and the fourth US Navy ship with that name, after George Washington, Founding Father, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States. The contract for &quot;George Washington&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding on 27 December 1982. Her keel was laid on 25 August 1986, she was christened on 21 July 1990 by First Lady Barbara Bush, and the vessel was commissioned at Naval Station Norfolk on 4 July 1992.

In 2008, USS &quot;George Washington&quot; became the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier to be forward-deployed at naval base Yokosuka, Japan.

The carrier underwent her four-year Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) beginning in August 2017. After refueling was completed additional repairs were found to be needed and the overhaul was extended. The ship was returned to service in May 2023.

==Description==
&quot;George Washington&quot; (commonly known as &quot;GW&quot;) is long, wide and high. The super carrier can accommodate approximately 90 aircraft and has a flight deck in size, using four elevators that are each to move planes between the flight deck and the hangar bay. With a combat load, &quot;GW&quot; displaces almost and can accommodate 6,250 crewmembers. Her four distilling units can make 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500,000 L) of potable water a day; the food service divisions serve 18,000 meals per day. There are over 2,500 compartments on board requiring 2,520 refrigeration tons (8.6 MW) of air conditioning capacity (enough to cool over 2,000 homes). The warship uses two Mark II stockless anchors that weigh 30 tons each, with each link of the anchor chain weighing . It is currently equipped with two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS mounts and two Sea Sparrow SAM launchers. One CIWS and one Sea Sparrow mount were removed to make way for two RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launchers, installed during the 2005 Drydocking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA).

===Propulsion===
The ship can reach speeds of over and is powered by two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors and has four 5-bladed propellers of each. This means that &quot;George Washington&quot; can travel more than before needing refueling.

==History==
===2001–2006===
&quot;George Washington&quot; was deployed to protect New York City after the September 11 attacks.

On 20 February 2004, on a sixth deployment, &quot;George Washington&quot; entered the Gulf of Aden, and a week later, was conducting operations in the Persian Gulf.

On 28 January 2005, she entered the shipyard for Drydocking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA). Many of the ship&#x27;s systems were upgraded and maintenance was done to the hull. Her four jet blast deflectors were removed and upgraded to handle the increased heat generated by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. One defensive Phalanx CIWS mount and one Sea Sparrow launcher were replaced by two Rolling Airframe Missile launchers. During the 11 months she was drydocked, the crew contributed 20,000 hours of volunteer community service to the city of Newport News, Virginia. The work was completed on schedule, and &quot;George Washington&quot; returned to her home port of Norfolk on 17 December 2005.

On 1 December 2005, the United States Navy announced that &quot;George Washington&quot; would replace as the forward-deployed carrier at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan, becoming the first nuclear-powered surface warship permanently stationed outside the continental U.S. In an attempt to explain the carrier&#x27;s mission to the Japanese public, the U.S. Navy printed a manga about life aboard GW, titled &quot;CVN-73&quot;.

&quot;George Washington&quot; and CVW-17 left Norfolk on 4 April for a scheduled two-month deployment to operate as part of SOUTHCOM&#x27;s &quot;Partnership of the Americas&quot;. This deployment included counter-drug operations in the Caribbean Sea, crew exchanges and exercises with Latin American and South American navies, and port visits for the carrier and strike group, which consisted of the cruiser , the destroyer , and the frigate . The first of these port visits took place from 14 to 17 April in St. Maarten, and Antigua from 15 to 18 May. She returned to Norfolk on 24 May.

===2008 fire and 2009===

On 7 April 2008, &quot;George Washington&quot;, with CVW-17 and Carrier Strike Group 8 embarked, departed Norfolk en route to Yokosuka, Japan to replace &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, taking a route around South America as she is too large for the Panama Canal; she took part there in the Gringo-Gaucho maneuvers with Argentine Naval Aviation. After the planned turnover with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; at NS Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, CVW-17 and Carrier Strike Group Eight were to return to their home ports in the U.S. to be replaced by Carrier Air Wing 5, based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, and Carrier Strike Group Five based at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan.

During the South American transit, the &quot;George Washington&quot; Battle Group participated in U.S. Southern Command exercises Partnership of the Americas and Unitas, a joint military exercise between the United States, Brazilian and Argentine navies. On 22 April 2008, &quot;George Washington&quot; arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for her first port visit to that country. The ship traversed the Strait of Magellan on 9–10 May.

On 22 May 2008, while the ship was off the Pacific Coast of South America, a fire broke out and injured 37 sailors, with no fatalities, in an incident described by the Navy as &quot;serious&quot;. According to a statement from Naval Air Forces&#x27; public affairs office, the fire broke out in the ship&#x27;s air-conditioning and refrigeration space and an auxiliary boiler room. The fire spread via a cableway and ventilation ducting and caused extreme temperatures in some parts of the ship. It took over twelve hours for the crew to contain and extinguish the fire, one of the largest non-combat fires aboard a U.S. Naval vessel since the devastating fire on board in 1967.

On 27 May, &quot;George Washington&quot; stopped at NAS North Island in San Diego, California for repairs. On 20 June the Navy announced that the damage from the fire was more serious than previously thought, and that repairs would take at least until August and would cost $70 million. As a consequence, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was retained in Hawaii during June and July to replace &quot;George Washington&quot; in the RIMPAC 2008 exercises, with the planned turnover to take place in San Diego instead of Hawaii.

A Navy investigation found that the &quot;entirely preventable&quot; fire had been caused by unauthorized smoking in a room where of flammable refrigerant compressor oil was improperly stored. The room was near the aft auxiliary boiler. The ship&#x27;s damage control team took nearly eight hours to discover the source of the smoke and flames. By that time, the fire had spread to eight decks and 80 compartments, and destroyed miles of electrical and fiber-optic cables. The damage control department had been found deficient in three inspections between June 2007 and April 2008. Although the carrier&#x27;s commanding officer started a program to remedy the team&#x27;s training and performance in the month before the fire, the report found those efforts to have been insufficient. Admiral Robert F. Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, noted in his investigation, &quot;It is apparent from this extensive study that there were numerous processes and procedures related to fire prevention and readiness and training that were not properly functioning. The extent of damage could have been reduced had numerous longstanding firefighting and firefighting management deficiencies been corrected.&quot; Willard added that &quot;Many crew members ... displayed courage and resolve in fighting the fires.&quot;

On 30 July 2008, Willard announced that Captain David C. Dykhoff had been relieved of his duties as Commanding Officer citing &quot;a loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards.&quot; Executive Officer Captain David M. Dober was also relieved for &quot;substandard performance.&quot; Six other sailors were disciplined with non-judicial punishment. Four sailors were found guilty of violating a lawful order and hiding hazardous materials in direct violation of safety regulations. The Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet refused to name the enlisted sailors disciplined. Two non-commissioned officers were found guilty of negligence and dereliction of duty for not properly supervising the workspace. The Navy and Marine Corps Medal was awarded to Senior Chief Petty Officer Keith Hendrickson for leading a team that rescued four shipmates trapped by the fire deep in the interior of the ship.
On 21 August, under new skipper Captain J.R. Haley and executive officer Captain Karl O. Thomas, &quot;George Washington&quot; departed NAS North Island for Japan, with Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW 5) embarked. The carrier arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 25 September 2008, where she was met by several hundred local supporters and protesters.


In June 2009, the Navy revealed that 15 of the carrier&#x27;s sailors were being expelled from the service for use of illegal designer drugs. On 2 July 2009, &quot;George Washington&quot;, accompanied by , anchored on the Gage Roads of Perth. Her crew visited Fremantle and Perth. Local brothels recruited extra staff to cope with the increase in business. Crew members volunteered to complete community projects including cleaning, maintenance, and painting at organizations including PMH, a Salvation Army rehabilitation center, Perth Zoo and Cohunu Koala Park. In mid-July the ship took part in Exercise Talisman Saber off the coast of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory.

From 2 to 6 August 2009, &quot;George Washington&quot; made a port call in Singapore where sailors were granted rest and recreation leave and participated in community relations projects such as painting and landscaping at a local community center, children&#x27;s center, special education school and an association for the disabled.

The ship made a 4-day goodwill visit to Manila Bay, Philippines, anchoring off historic Corregidor Island from 11 to 15 August 2009.

In August 2009, &quot;George Washington&quot; participated in the Indonesian Fleet Review, during &quot;Sail Bunaken 2009&quot;, in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The parade of warships and tall ships from 40 nations included five from the &quot;George Washington&quot; Carrier Strike Group, including &quot;George Washington&quot;, &quot;Cowpens&quot;, , , and . Carrier Airwing Five, currently embarked on &quot;George Washington&quot;, also participated with a multi-aircraft fly-by of the viewing station during the parade. The &quot;George Washington&quot; Carrier Strike Group returned to Japan 3 September for a maintenance upkeep period prior to her second fall patrol.

On 29 October &quot;George Washington&quot; docked at Hong Kong to resupply and stayed for four to five days.

===2010–2016===

On 11 May 2010, &quot;George Washington&quot; completed maintenance and refit and departed Yokosuka for trials. On 21 July 2010, she arrived at Busan, South Korea for a port visit and then participated in exercise &quot;Invincible Spirit&quot; in the Sea of Japan with the USAF, Republic of Korea Air Force and Republic of Korea Navy from 25 to 28 July 2010. &quot;Invincible Spirit&quot; was staged to improve combined operations capability and as a show of deterrence following the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; sinking. The exercise was conducted in the Sea of Japan to placate China&#x27;s objections to military exercises being conducted in the Yellow Sea. Due in part to those objections a second exercise, in the Yellow Sea on the west coast of North Korea, was planned. On 8 August 2010, &quot;George Washington&quot; stopped off the coast of Da Nang City in the South China Sea to celebrate the 15th anniversary of normalization of Vietnam-US diplomatic relations, the first Vietnam visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier since the Vietnam War. In November 2010, the &quot;George Washington&quot; carrier group departed for planned exercises with the Republic of Korea Navy, partially in response to the shelling of Yeonpyeong and increased tension with North Korea.

&quot;George Washington&quot; was one of several ships participating in disaster relief after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. While docked for maintenance in Yokosuka she detected radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, and was ordered to leave port before schedule, with a smaller-than-normal crew, to avoid the radioactive plume. The smaller crew was unable to continue to provide aid. While at sea, the carrier made two visits to United States Fleet Activities Sasebo to exchange crew members and take on maintenance equipment. The ship returned to her berth at Yokosuka on 20 April 2011.

A 2011 proposal by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn (OK-R) called for the decommissioning of &quot;George Washington&quot; in 2016, before beginning her refueling and complex overhaul but after the carrier &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; enters service.

After redeploying on another training cruise, a 25 September 2011 video from the carrier uploaded to YouTube became a viral hit. In the video, two flight deck crewmen are almost hit by a landing F/A-18, which is waved-off shortly before landing on the deck where the crewmen are walking. On 22 November 2011, &quot;George Washington&quot; returned to Japan to conclude her 2011 patrol, with four port visits including Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong and two major exercises while cruising more than 50,000 nautical miles across the western Pacific Ocean. During deployment, the aircraft carrier participated in joint training exercises with other service branches and regional partners, visited three Asia-Pacific nations (South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia) to practice interoperability, and conducted dual-carrier operations with .


On 8 February 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the scheduled mid-life complex overhaul for the carrier would be postponed pending the resolution of the upcoming budget sequestration. The budget shortfall would affect &quot;Lincoln&quot;″s refueling of her nuclear propulsion plant, the next scheduled mid-life complex overhaul involving &quot;George Washington&quot; forward-based in United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, and the de-fueling of the recently deactivated nuclear-powered . &quot;George Washington&quot; and her support vessels visited Brisbane, Australia in July.

The ship moored on 4 October 2013 in Busan, South Korea, for a regularly-scheduled liberty port visit. In November 2013, she visited Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. On 11 November 2013 &quot;George Washington&quot; and her carrier strike group were deployed for a humanitarian mission in the Philippines, Operation Damayan, after destructive Typhoon Haiyan. The carrier group arrived on 14 November, delivered relief supplies, and deployed aircraft for search and rescue missions. On 6 December 2013, &quot;George Washington&quot; returned to her forward-deployed port of Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan.

In January 2014, it was announced that &quot;George Washington&quot; would be replaced by at Yokosuka when the ship&#x27;s Refuelling and Complex Overhaul is due.

As part of the Navy&#x27;s FY 2015 budget, Pentagon officials hinted at the possibility of taking &quot;George Washington&quot; out of service due to budget reductions. The ship is due for her mid-life refueling and overhaul in 2016, which will take three years and cost over $3 billion. The decision to replace &quot;George Washington&quot; with the newer &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; in her area of operations near Japan means decommissioning the ship would not affect American carrier presence in the region. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office had found that the elimination of a carrier and an air wing would save about $7 billion from 2012 through 2021, the time at which &quot;George Washington&quot; would be expected to return to service. is the oldest ship in the class and would be expected to be decommissioned early instead of &quot;George Washington&quot;. However, &quot;Nimitz&quot; has undergone a mid-life refuelling and is not due for decommission until the mid-2020s, whereas &quot;George Washington&quot; has yet to undergo this procedure, providing an opportunity to remove the ship from service before the planned expenditure.

In February 2014, under pressure from Congress, the Obama administration was reported to have decided to request additional funds from Congress for the refueling. However, if sequestration is not repealed by 2016, the Pentagon may not be able to find funding to keep &quot;George Washington&quot; operating and it may have to be retired.

In the draft of the Navy&#x27;s unfunded priorities list for FY 2015, a $796 million line item was included for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of &quot;George Washington&quot;. Before it was approved by the Pentagon and sent to Congress, it was vetted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and signed by Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, after which the line item was removed. In a 31 March 2014 letter to Congress, Admiral Greenert said that the decision to remove the RCOH line item from the unfunded priorities list was made to align with budget decisions over the next several years. The list was for the FY 2015, so a decision to refuel or inactivate the carrier has to be made during FY 2016 budget planning with the fiscal outlook at that time and the possibility of sequestration funding levels. The removal of the line item removes funding for advanced procurement of materials for the overhaul; another line item had funding to remove the fuel from the ship, but not to overhaul or refuel it.

By July 2014, the Navy had decided it would find the $7 billion in funds needed to keep &quot;George Washington&quot; in service. This was followed by three congressional marks to fund the Refueling and Complex Overhaul if the Navy would not provide funding in the FY 2015 budget. , the Navy was still awaiting the fate of sequestration and the moving of funds to refueling the ship puts pressure on other programs. The Navy&#x27;s FY 2016 budget funds nuclear refueling and overhaul of &quot;George Washington&quot;.

&quot;George Washington&quot; departed Japan in May 2015 to participate in Exercise Talisman Saber 2015 with Australia and New Zealand. She arrived at Naval Air Station North Island on 10 August. In San Diego, &quot;George Washington&quot; conducted a 10-day turn over period with &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; before leaving the Southern California operating area for Naval Station Norfolk, where the ship is expected to begin mid-life RCOH at Newport News Shipbuilding, Huntington Ingalls Industries in fall 2016.

&quot;George Washington&quot; deployed in October 2016 to Haiti to provide support after Hurricane Matthew, along with and .

=== 2017–2023 overhaul ===

On 4 August 2017, &quot;George Washington&quot; entered the Dry Dock #11 at the HII Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, for a four-year Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH). The contract for the RCOH was worth $2.8 billion and work was expected to be completed by August 2021. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work was planned to finish in early 2023. This target date was confirmed in August 2022. Sea trials and re-delivery to the Navy were completed in May 2023.

In October 2024, the Navy reported that welders at the Newport News Shipyard purposely circumvented proper procedures, resulting in substandard welds on the ship. The Navy said the faulty welds did not impact the safety of the vessel.

====2021–2022 suicides====
On 11 April 2022, Captain Brent Gaut informed sailors on the &quot;George Washington&quot; over intercom that two sailors had died on 9 and 10 April, and that those deaths were the eighth and ninth suicides the ship had experienced in nine months. Shortly thereafter, a tenth suicide occurred on 15 April, described by Gaut to the crew as a member of the ship&#x27;s security team, who had a self-inflicted wound. Currently, of these reported suicides, the Navy has acknowledged seven deaths, with only five noted as suicides. Initially, the Navy&#x27;s response from Russell L. Smith, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, was that things could be worse, &quot;at least you&#x27;re not in a foxhole&quot;, and that the Navy was effectively unable to remedy the situation. However, the issue gained wider media attention during the next two weeks, and by 29 April 2022, Captain Gaut announced that the ship will move 260 sailors &quot;to an offsite barracks-type living arrangement on Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth&quot;, specifically, a Navy Gateway Inn and Suites, starting the following Monday, and the number will expand at about 50 additional beds per week. According to the commanding officer, the ship currently has 422 sailors living on board. The move has been confirmed by the Navy and will continue &quot;until all Sailors who wish to move off-ship have done so.&quot; Interviews with the crew and the crew&#x27;s family have described the issue as &quot;living at a construction site&quot; as the &quot;George Washington&quot; has been docked at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia since 2017, and many sailors trained for shipboard duties are relegated to maintenance or cleaning, while suffering lack of sleep. Several have claimed to sleep in their cars in preference to the ship.

The Navy has opened an investigation into the command climate and culture on board the &quot;George Washington&quot; in response to the suicides.

=== Planned 2025 deployment ===
It was announced on 3 March 2023 that following the completion of her overhaul, &quot;George Washington&quot; is expected to be forward-deployed to Japan. She will be replacing , which by that point will have been forward-deployed there for ten years. In 2019, federal law was enacted that limited the forward-deployment of naval vessels to ten years. She departed NS Norfolk on April 25, 2024, and participated in
U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command/U.S. 4th Fleet&#x27;s Southern Seas 2024 deployment en route to NAS North Island. There, the crews of &quot;George Washington&quot; and &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; swapped ships. &quot;George Washington&quot; proceeded to Japan from there, arriving in her new homeport of Yokosuka, Japan on November 22, 2024.

<doc id="198842" wikidata="Q1006733" url="?curid=198842" title="Grassland">
<text>A grassland is an area where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae). However, sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) can also be found along with variable proportions of legumes, such as clover, and other herbs. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica and are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. Furthermore, grasslands are one of the largest biomes on Earth and dominate the landscape worldwide. There are different types of grasslands: natural grasslands, semi-natural grasslands, and agricultural grasslands. They cover 31–69% of the Earth&#x27;s land area.

== Definitions ==

Included among the variety of definitions for grasslands are:
* &quot;...any plant community, including harvested forages, in which grasses and/or legumes make up the dominant vegetation.&quot;
* &quot;...terrestrial ecosystems dominated by herbaceous and shrub vegetation, and maintained by fire, grazing, drought and/or freezing temperatures.&quot; (Pilot Assessment of Global Ecosystems, 2000)
* &quot;A region with sufficient average annual precipitation (25-75 cm) to support grass...&quot; (Stiling, 1999)

Semi-natural grasslands are a very common subcategory of the grasslands biome. These can be defined as:
* Grassland existing as a result of human activity (mowing or livestock grazing), where environmental conditions and the species pool are maintained by natural processes.

They can also be described as the following:
* &quot;Semi-natural grasslands are one of the world&#x27;s most biodiverse habitats on a small spatial scales.&quot;
* &quot;Semi-natural grasslands belong to the most species rich ecosystems in the world.&quot;
* &quot;...have been formed over the course of centuries through extensive grazing and mowing.&quot;
* &quot;...without the use of pesticides or fertilisers in modern times.&quot;

There are many different types of semi-natural grasslands, e.g. hay meadows.

== Evolutionary history ==
The graminoids are among the most versatile life forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous period, and coprolites of fossilized dinosaur feces have been found containing phytoliths of a variety of grasses that include grasses that are related to modern rice and bamboo.

The appearance of mountains in the western United States during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, a period of some 25 million years, created a continental climate favourable to the evolution of grasslands.

Around 5 million years ago during the Late Miocene in the New World and the Pliocene in the Old World, the first true grasslands occurred. Existing forest biomes declined, and grasslands became much more widespread. It is known that grasslands have existed in Europe throughout the Pleistocene (the last 1.8 million years). Following the Pleistocene ice ages (with their glacials and interglacials), grasslands expanded in the hotter, drier climates, and began to become the dominant land feature worldwide. Since the grasslands have existed for over 1.8 million years, there is high variability. For example steppe-tundra dominated in Northern and Central Europe whereas a higher amount of xerothermic grasslands occurred in the Mediterranean area. Within temperate Europe, the range of types is quite wide and also became unique due to the exchange of species and genetic material between different biomes.

The semi-natural grasslands first appeared when humans started farming. So for the use of agriculture, forests got cleared in Europe. Ancient meadows and pastures were the parts that were suitable for cultivation. The semi-natural grasslands were formed from these areas. However, there&#x27;s also evidence for the local persistence of natural grasslands in Europe, originally maintained by wild herbivores, throughout the pre-Neolithic Holocene. The removal of the plants by the grazing animals and later the mowing farmers led to co-existence of other plant species around. In the following, the biodiversity of the plants evolve. Also, the species that already lived there adapted to the new conditions.

Most of the grassland areas have been turned to arable fields and disappeared again. The grasslands permanently became arable cropping fields due to the steady decrease in organic matter. Nowadays, semi-natural grasslands are rather located in areas that are unsuitable for agricultural farming.
== Ecology ==

=== Biodiversity ===
Grasslands dominated by unsown wild-plant communities (&quot;unimproved grasslands&quot;) can be called either natural or &quot;semi-natural&quot; habitat. Although their plant communities are natural, their maintenance depends upon anthropogenic activities such as grazing and cutting regimes. The semi-natural grasslands contain many species of wild plants, including grasses, sedges, rushes, and herbs; 25 plant-species per 100 square centimeters can be found. A European record that was found on a meadow in Estonia described 76 species of plants in one square meter. Chalk downlands in England can support over 40 species per square meter.
In many parts of the world, few examples have escaped agricultural improvement (fertilizing, weed killing, plowing, or re-seeding). For example, original North American prairie grasslands or lowland wildflower meadows in the UK are now rare and their associated wild flora equally threatened. Associated with the wild-plant diversity of the &quot;unimproved&quot; grasslands is usually a rich invertebrate fauna; there are also many species of birds that are grassland &quot;specialists&quot;, such as the snipe and the little bustard. Owing to semi-natural grasslands being referred to as one of the most-species rich ecosystems in the world and essential habitat for many specialists, also including pollinators, there are many approaches to conservation activities lately.

Agriculturally improved grasslands, which dominate modern intensive agricultural landscapes, are usually poor in wild plant species due to the original diversity of plants having been destroyed by cultivation and by the use of fertilizers.

Almost 90% of the European semi-natural grasslands do not exist anymore due to political and economic reasons. This loss took place during the 20th century. The ones in Western and Central Europe have almost disappeared completely. There are a few left in Northern Europe.

Unfortunately, a large amount of red-listed species are specialists of semi-natural grasslands and are affected by the landscape change due to agriculture of the last century.

The original wild-plant communities having been replaced by sown monocultures of cultivated varieties of grasses and clovers, such as perennial ryegrass and white clover. In many parts of the world, &quot;unimproved&quot; grasslands are one of the most threatened types of habitat, and a target for acquisition by wildlife conservation groups or for special grants to landowners who are encouraged to manage them appropriately.

=== Vegetation ===
Grassland vegetation can vary considerably depending on the grassland type and on how strong it is affected by human impact. Dominant trees for the semi-natural grassland are &quot;Quercus robur&quot;, &quot;Betula pendula&quot;, &quot;Corylus avellana&quot;, &quot;Crataegus&quot; and many kinds of herbs.

In chalk grassland, the plants can vary from very tall to very short. Quite tall grasses can be found in North American tallgrass prairie, South American grasslands, and African savanna. Woody plants, shrubs or trees may occur on some grasslands—forming savannas, scrubby grassland or semi-wooded grassland, such as the African savannas or the Iberian deheza.

As flowering plants and trees, grasses grow in great concentrations in climates where annual rainfall ranges between . The root systems of perennial grasses and forbs form complex mats that hold the soil in place.

=== Fauna ===
Grasslands support the greatest aggregations of large animals on Earth, including jaguars, African wild dogs, pronghorn, black-footed ferret, plains bison, mountain plover, African elephant, Sunda tiger, black rhino, white rhino, savanna elephant, greater one-horned rhino, Indian elephant and swift fox. Grazing animals, herd animals, and predators in grasslands, like lions and cheetahs live in the grasslands of the African savanna. Mites, insect larvae, nematodes, and earthworms inhabit deep soil, which can reach underground in undisturbed grasslands on the richest soils of the world. These invertebrates, along with symbiotic fungi, extend the root systems, break apart hard soil, enrich it with urea and other natural fertilizers, trap minerals and water and promote growth. Some types of fungi make the plants more resistant to insect and microbial attacks.

Grassland in all its form supports a vast variety of mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects. Typical large mammals include the blue wildebeest, American bison, giant anteater, and Przewalski&#x27;s horse.

The plants and animals that live in grasslands are connected through an unlimited web of interactions. But the removal of key species—such as buffalo and prairie dogs within the American West—and introduction of invasive species, like cane toads in northern Australia, have disrupted the balance in these ecosystems and damaged a number of other species. Grasslands are home to a number of the foremost magnificent animals on the planet—elephants, bison, lions—and hunters have found them to be enticing prey. But when hunting is not controlled or is conducted illegally, species can become extinct.

== Ecosystem services ==
Grasslands provide a range of marketed and non-marketed ecosystem services that are fundamental to the livelihoods of an estimated one billion people globally.

=== Carbon sequestration ===
Grasslands hold about twenty percent of global soil carbon stocks. Herbaceous (non-wooded) vegetation dominates grasslands and carbon is stored in the roots and soil underground. Above-ground biomass carbon is relatively short-lived due to grazing, fire, and senescence. Grassland species have an extensive fibrous root system, with grasses often accounting for 60-80% of the biomass carbon in this ecosystem. This underground biomass can extend several meters below the surface and store abundant carbon into the soil, resulting in deep, fertile soils with high organic matter content. For this reason, soil carbon accounts for about 81% of the total ecosystem carbon in grasslands. The close link between soil carbon and underground biomass leads to similar responses of these carbon pools to fluctuations in annual precipitation and temperature on a broad spatial scale. Because plant productivity is limited by grassland precipitation, carbon stocks are highest in regions where precipitation is heaviest, such as the high grass prairie in the humid temperate region of the United States. Similarly, as annual temperatures rise, grassland carbon stocks decrease due to increased evapotranspiration.

Grasslands have suffered large losses of organic carbon due to soil disturbances, vegetation degradation, fires, erosion, nutrient deficiencies, and water shortages. The type, frequency and intensity of the disturbance can play a key role in the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance of grasslands. Bedrock, irrigation practices, soil acidification, liming, and pasture management can all have potential impacts on grassland organic carbon stocks. Good grassland management can reverse historical soil carbon losses. The relationship of improved biodiversity with carbon storage is subject of research.

There is a lack of agreement on the amount of carbon that can be stored in grassland ecosystem. This is partly caused by different methodologies applied to measure soil organic carbon and limited respective datasets. Further, carbon accumulation in soils changes significantly over time and point in time measurements produce an insufficient evidence base.

=== Other ecosystem services ===
* promotion of genetic diversity
* weather amelioration
* provision of wildlife habitat

== Degradation ==
Grasslands are among the most threatened ecosystems. Global losses from grassland degradation are estimated to be over $7 billion per year. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the most significant threat to grasslands is human land use, especially agriculture and mining. The vulnerability of grasslands stems from a range of factors, such as misclassification, poor protection and cultivation. 

=== Causes ===

==== Land use intensification ====
Grasslands have an extensive history of human activity and disturbance. To feed a growing human population, most of the world&#x27;s grasslands are converted from natural landscapes to fields of corn, wheat or other crops. Grasslands that have remained largely intact thus far, such as the East African savannas, are in danger of being lost to agriculture. Grasslands are very sensitive to disturbances, such as people hunting and killing key species, or plowing the land to make more space for farms.

Grassland vegetation is often a plagioclimax; it remains dominant in a particular area usually due to grazing, cutting, or natural or man-made fires, all discouraging colonization by and survival of tree and shrub seedlings. Some of the world&#x27;s largest expanses of grassland are found in the African savanna, and these are maintained by wild herbivores as well as by nomadic pastoralists and their cattle, sheep or goats. Grasslands have an impact on climate change by slower decomposition rates of litter compared to forest environments.

Grasslands may occur naturally or as a result of human activity. Hunting cultures around the world often set regular fires to maintain and extend grasslands and prevent fire-intolerant trees and shrubs from taking hold. The tallgrass prairies in the U.S. Midwest may have been extended eastward into Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio by human agency. Much grassland in northwest Europe developed after the Neolithic Period when people gradually cleared the forest to create areas for raising their livestock.

==== Climate change ====
Grasslands often occur in areas with annual precipitation is between and and average mean annual temperatures ranges from −5 and 20 °C. However, some grasslands occur in colder (−20 °C) and hotter (30 °C) climatic conditions. Grassland can exist in habitats that are frequently disturbed by grazing or fire, as such disturbance prevents the encroachment of woody species. Species richness is particularly high in grasslands of low soil fertility such as serpentine barrens and calcareous grasslands, where woody encroachment is prevented as low nutrient levels in the soil may inhibit the growth of forest and shrub species. Another common predicament often experienced by the ill-fated grassland creatures is the constant burning of plants, fueled by oxygen and many expired photosynthesizing organisms, with the lack of rain pushing this problem to further heights. When not limited by other factors, increasing CO2 concentration in the air increases plant growth, similarly as water use efficiency, which is very important in drier regions. However, the advantages of elevated CO2 are limited by factors including water availability and available nutrients, particularly nitrogen. Thus effects of elevated CO2 on plant growth will vary with local climate patterns, species adaptations to water limitations, and nitrogen availability. Studies indicate that nutrient depletion may happen faster in drier regions, and with factors like plant community composition and grazing. Nitrogen deposition from air pollutants and increased mineralization from higher temperatures can increase plant productivity, but increases are often among a discount in biodiversity as faster-growing plants outcompete others. A study of a California grassland found that global change may speed reductions in diversity and forb species are most prone to this process.

==== Afforestation or introduction of invasive species ====
Misguided afforestation efforts, for example as part of the global effort to increase carbon sequestration, can harm grasslands and their core ecosystem services. Forest centric restoration efforts can create the risk of misreading and misclassifying of landscapes. A map created by the World Resources Institute in collaboration with the IUCN identifies 2 billion hectares for potential forest restoration. It is criticised for including 900 million hectares of grasslands. It is expected that non-native grasses will continue to outperform native species under warmer and drier conditions that occur in many grasslands due to climate change.

==== Management ====
The type of land management used in grasslands can also lead to grassland loss or degradation. Many grasslands and other open ecosystems depend on disturbances such as wildfires, controlled burns or grazing to persist, although this subject is still controversial. A study in Brazilian Subtropical Highland Grasslands found that grasslands without traditional land management—which uses fire every two years and extensive cattle grazing—can disappear within 30 years. This study showed that grasslands inside protected areas, in which fire is not allowed and cattle grazing is banned, grasslands were quickly replaced by shrubs (shrub encroachment).

=== Types of degradation ===

==== Land cover change ====
Land cover has always changed during the years. The following relates to the changes between 1960 and 2015. There has been a decrease in semi-natural grasslands and an increase in areas with arable land, forest and land used for infrastructure and buildings. The line style and relative thickness of the lines indicates the percentage of the total area that changed. Changes less than 1% and land-cover classes with all changes less than 1% (i.e. semi-natural wetlands and water) are not included.

In 1960 most of the land, 49.7%, was covered with forest and there was also more semi-natural grassland (18.8%) than arable land (15.8%). In 2015 this has changed drastically. The forest cover has increased (50.8%) and arable land has also increased (20.4%), but the semi-natural grassland cover has decreased. Although it still covers a large area of the earth (10.6%).

A quarter of semi-natural grassland was lost through intensification, i.e. it was converted into arable or pasture land and forests. It is more likely that intensification will occur in flat semi-natural grasslands, especially if the soil is fertile. On the other hand, grasslands, where the land is drought-prone or less productive, are more likely to persist as semi-natural grasslands than grasslands with fertile soil and low gradient of the terrain. Furthermore, the accessibility of the land is also important, as it is then easier to fertilize, for example. For instance, if it is located near a road. With the development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to cultivate land with a steeper gradient, to the detriment of grasslands. The management of grasslands is also changing permanently. There is increased use of mineral fertilizers, furthermore borders and field edges are removed to enlarge fields and leveling the terrain to facilitate the use of agricultural machinery.

The professional study of dry grasslands falls under the category of rangeland management, which focuses on ecosystem services associated with the grass-dominated arid and semi-arid rangelands of the world. Rangelands account for an estimated 70% of the earth&#x27;s landmass; thus, many cultures including those of the United States are indebted to the economics that the world&#x27;s grasslands have to offer, from producing grazing animals, tourism, ecosystems services such as clean water and air, and energy extraction.
Vast areas of grassland are affected by woody encroachment, which is the expansion of woody plants at the expense of the herbaceous layer. Woody encroachment is caused by a combination of human impact (e.g. fire exclusion, overstocking and resulting overgrazing) and environmental factors (i.e. increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere). It can have severe negative consequences on key ecosystem services, like land productivity and groundwater recharge.

== Conservation and restoration ==
Despite growing recognition of the importance of grasslands, understanding of restoration options remains limited. Cost of grassland restoration is highly variable and respective data is scarce. Successful grassland restoration has several dimensions, including recognition in policy, standardisation of indicators of degradation, scientific innovation, knowledge transfer and data sharing.

Restoration methods and measures include the following:
* prescribed fires
* appropriate management of livestock and wild herbivores: in light of land use intensification caused by global food demand, grassland land use practices may need to be adjusted to better support key ecosystem services.
* tree cutting
* shrub removal
* invasive species control
* reintroduction of native grasses and forbs via seeding or transplant: a main challenge for grassland restoration is how to overcome seed limitation.

For the period 2021–2030 the United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed the UN Decade on Restoration, involving a joint resolution by over 70 countries. It is led by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization.

=== General grasslands types ===

==== Tropical and subtropical ====
These grasslands can be classified as the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome. The rainfall level for that grassland type is between 90 and 150 centimeters per year. Grasses and scattered trees are common for that ecoregion, as well as large mammals, such as wildebeest (&quot;Connochaetes taurinus&quot;) and zebra (&quot;Equus zebra&quot;). Notable tropical and subtropical grasslands include the Llanos grasslands of South America.
==== Temperate ====
Mid-latitude grasslands, including the prairie and Pacific grasslands of North America, the Pampas of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, calcareous downland, and the steppes of Europe. They are classified with temperate savannas and shrublands as the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. Temperate grasslands are the home to many large herbivores, such as bison, gazelles, zebras, rhinoceroses, and wild horses. Carnivores like lions, wolves, cheetahs and leopards are also found in temperate grasslands. Other animals of this region include deer, prairie dogs, mice, jack rabbits, skunks, coyotes, snakes, foxes, owls, badgers, blackbirds, grasshoppers, meadowlarks, sparrows, quails, hawks and hyenas.

==== Flooded ====
Grasslands that are flooded seasonally or year-round, like the Everglades of Florida, the Pantanal of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay or the Esteros del Ibera in Argentina, are classified with flooded savannas as the flooded grasslands and savannas biome and occur mostly in the tropics and subtropics. The species that live in these grasslands are well adapted to the hydrologic regimes and soil conditions. The Everglades—the world&#x27;s largest rain-fed flooded grassland—is rich in 11,000 species of seed-bearing plants, 25 species of orchids, 300 bird species, and 150 fish species.

Water-meadows are grasslands that are deliberately flooded for short periods.

==== Montane ====
High-altitude grasslands located on high mountain ranges around the world, like the Páramo of the Andes Mountains. They are part of the montane grasslands and shrublands biome and can be tropical, subtropical, and temperate. The plants and animals, that can be found in the tropical montane, are able to adapt to cool, wet conditions as well as intense sunlight.

==== Tundra grasslands ====
Similar to montane grasslands, polar Arctic tundra can have grasses, but high soil moisture means that few tundras are grass-dominated today. However, during the Pleistocene glacial periods (commonly referred to as ice ages), a grassland known as steppe-tundra or mammoth steppe occupied large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. These areas were very cold and arid and featured sub-surface permafrost (hence tundra) but were nevertheless productive grassland ecosystems supporting a wide variety of fauna. As the temperature increased and the climate became wetter at the beginning of the Holocene much of the mammoth steppe transitioned to forest, while the drier parts in central Eurasia remained as a grassland, becoming the modern Eurasian steppe.

==== Desert and xeric ====
Also called desert grasslands, they are composed of sparse grassland ecoregions located in the deserts and xeric shrublands biome. Temperature extremes and low amounts of rainfall characterise these kinds of grasslands. Therefore, plants and animals are well adapted to minimize water loss.

<text>A savanna or savannah is a mixed woodland-grassland (i.e. grassy woodland) biome and ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. Four savanna forms exist; &quot;savanna woodland&quot; where trees and shrubs form a light canopy, &quot;tree savanna&quot; with scattered trees and shrubs, &quot;shrub savanna&quot; with distributed shrubs, and &quot;grass savanna&quot; where trees and shrubs are mostly nonexistent.

Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density. It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees. However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests. The South American savanna types &quot;cerrado sensu stricto&quot; and &quot;cerrado dense&quot; typically have densities of trees similar to or higher than that found in South American tropical forests, with savanna ranging from 800 to 3300 trees per hectare (trees/ha) and adjacent forests with 800–2000 trees/ha. Similarly Guinean savanna has 129 trees/ha, compared to 103 for riparian forest, while Eastern Australian sclerophyll forests have average tree densities of approximately 100 per hectare, comparable to savannas in the same region.

Savannas are also characterised by seasonal water availability, with the majority of rainfall confined to one season. They are associated with several types of biomes, and are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland, though mostly a transition between desert to forest. Savanna covers approximately 20% of the Earth&#x27;s land area. Unlike the prairies in North America and steppes in Eurasia, which feature cold winters, savannas are mostly located in areas having warm to hot climates, such as in Africa, Australia, South America, and India.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Spanish &quot;sabana&quot;, which is itself a loanword from Taíno, which means &quot;treeless grassland&quot; in the West Indies. The letter &quot;b&quot; in Spanish, when positioned in the middle of a word, is pronounced almost like an English &quot;v;&quot; hence the change of grapheme when transcribed into English.

The word originally entered English as the &quot;Zauana&quot; in a description of the &quot;ilands of the kinges of Spayne&quot; from 1555. This was equivalent in the orthography of the times to &quot;zavana&quot; (see history of V). Peter Martyr reported it as the local name for the plain around Comagre, the court of the cacique Carlos in present-day Panama. The accounts are inexact, but this is usually placed in present-day Madugandí or at points on the nearby Guna Yala coast opposite Ustupo or on Point Mosquitos. These areas are now either given over to modern cropland or jungle.

==Distribution==

Many grassy landscapes and mixed communities of trees, shrubs, and grasses were described as savanna before the middle of the 19th century, when the concept of a tropical savanna climate became established. The Köppen climate classification system was strongly influenced by effects of temperature and precipitation upon tree growth, and oversimplified assumptions resulted in a tropical savanna classification concept which considered it as a &quot;climatic climax&quot; formation. The common usage to describe vegetation now conflicts with a simplified yet widespread climatic concept. The divergence has sometimes caused areas such as extensive savannas north and south of the Congo and Amazon Rivers to be excluded from mapped savanna categories.

In different parts of North America, the word &quot;savanna&quot; has been used interchangeably with &quot;barrens&quot;, &quot;prairie&quot;, &quot;glade&quot;, &quot;grassland&quot; and &quot;oak opening&quot;. Different authors have defined the lower limits of savanna tree coverage as 5–10% and upper limits range as 25–80% of an area. Two factors common to all savanna environments are rainfall variations from year to year, and dry season wildfires. In the Americas, e.g. in Belize, Central America, savanna vegetation is similar from Mexico to South America and to the Caribbean. The distinction between woodland and savanna is vague and therefore the two can be combined into a single biome as both woodlands and savannas feature open-canopied trees with crowns not usually interlinking (mostly forming 25-60% cover).

Over many large tropical areas, the dominant biome (forest, savanna or grassland) can not be predicted only by the climate, as historical events plays also a key role, for example, fire activity. In some areas, indeed, it is possible for there to be multiple stable biomes. The annual rainfall ranges from to per year, with the precipitation being more common in six or eight months of the year, followed by a period of drought. Savannas may at times be classified as forests.

In climatic geomorphology it has been noted that many savannas occur in areas of pediplains and inselbergs. It has been posited that river incision is not prominent but that rivers in savanna landscapes erode more by lateral migration. Flooding and associated sheet wash have been proposed as dominant erosion processes in savanna plains.

==Ecology==
The savannas of tropical America comprise broadleaved trees such as Curatella, Byrsonima, and Bowdichia, with grasses such as Leersia and Paspalum. Bean relative Prosopis is common in the Argentinian savannas. In the East African savannas, Acacia, Combretum, baobabs, Borassus, and Euphorbia are a common vegetation genera. Drier savannas there feature spiny shrubs and grasses, such as Andropogon, Hyparrhenia, and Themeda. Wetter savannas include Brachystegia trees and Pennisetum purpureum, and elephant grass type. West African savanna trees include Anogeissus, Combretum, and Strychnos. Indian savannas are mostly cleared, but the reserved ones feature Acacia, Mimosa, and Zizyphus over a grass cover comprising Sehima and Dichanthium. The Australian savanna is abundant with sclerophyllous evergreen vegetation, which include the eucalyptus, as well as Acacia, Bauhinia, Pandanus with grasses such as Heteropogon and kangaroo grass (Themeda).

Animals in the African savanna generally include the giraffe, elephant, buffalo, zebra, gnu, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and antelope, where they rely on grass and/or tree foliage to survive. In the Australian savanna, mammals in the family Macropodidae predominate, such as kangaroos and wallabies, though cattle, horses, camels, donkeys and the Asian water buffalo, among others, have been introduced by humans.

==Threats==
It is estimated that less than three percent of savanna ecosystems can be classified as highly intact. Reasons for savanna degradation are manifold, as outlined below.

===Changes in fire management===

Savannas are subject to regular wildfires and the ecosystem appears to be the result of human use of fire. For example, Native Americans created the Pre-Columbian woodlands of North America by periodically burning where fire-resistant plants were the dominant species. Fire-stick farming appears to have been responsible for the widespread occurrence of savanna in tropical Australia and New Guinea, and savannas in India are a result of human fire use. The maquis shrub savannas of the Mediterranean region were likewise created and maintained by anthropogenic fire.

Intentional controlled burns typically create fires confined to the herbaceous layer that do little long term damage to mature trees. This prevents more catastrophic wildfires that could do much more damage. However, these fires either kill or suppress tree seedlings, thus preventing the establishment of a continuous tree canopy which would prevent further grass growth. Prior to European settlement aboriginal land use practices, including fire, influenced vegetation and may have maintained and modified savanna flora. It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape. Aboriginal burning certainly created a habitat mosaic that probably increased biodiversity and changed the structure of woodlands and geographic range of numerous woodland species. It has been suggested by many authors that with the removal or alteration of traditional burning regimes many savannas are being replaced by forest and shrub thickets with little herbaceous layer.

The consumption of herbage by introduced grazers in savanna woodlands has led to a reduction in the amount of fuel available for burning and resulted in fewer and cooler fires. The introduction of exotic pasture legumes has also led to a reduction in the need to burn to produce a flush of green growth because legumes retain high nutrient levels throughout the year, and because fires can have a negative impact on legume populations which causes a reluctance to burn.

===Grazing and browsing animals===
The closed forest types such as broadleaf forests and rainforests are usually not grazed owing to the closed structure precluding grass growth, and hence offering little opportunity for grazing. In contrast the open structure of savannas allows the growth of a herbaceous layer and is commonly used for grazing domestic livestock. As a result, much of the world&#x27;s savannas have undergone change as a result of grazing by sheep, goats and cattle, ranging from changes in pasture composition to woody plant encroachment.
The removal of grass by grazing affects the woody plant component of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for water in the topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity and the frequency of fires which may control woody plant species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable woody species. There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds of weed species such as prickly acacia (&quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;) and stylo (&quot;Stylosanthes&quot; species). Alterations in savanna species composition brought about by grazing can alter ecosystem function, and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.

Introduced grazing animals can also affect soil condition through physical compaction and break-up of the soil caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective plant cover. Such effects are most likely to occur on land subjected to repeated and heavy grazing. The effects of overstocking are often worst on soils of low fertility and in low rainfall areas below 500 mm, as most soil nutrients in these areas tend to be concentrated in the surface so any movement of soils can lead to severe degradation. Alteration in soil structure and nutrient levels affects the establishment, growth and survival of plant species and in turn can lead to a change in woodland structure and composition. That being said, impact of grazing animals can be reduced. Looking at Elephant impact on Savannas, the overall impact is reduced in the presence of rainfall and fences.

===Tree clearing===
Large areas of Australian and South American savannas have been cleared of trees, and this clearing continues today. For example, land clearing and fracking threaten the Northern Territory, Australia savanna, and 480,000 ha of savanna were being cleared annually in Queensland in the 2000s, primarily to improve pasture production. Substantial savanna areas have been cleared of woody vegetation and much of the area that remains today is vegetation that has been disturbed by either clearing or thinning at some point in the past.

Clearing is carried out by the grazing industry in an attempt to increase the quality and quantity of feed available for stock and to improve the management of livestock. The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available. Since stock carrying capacity is strongly correlated with herbage yield, there can be major financial benefits from the removal of trees, such as assisting with grazing management: regions of dense tree and shrub cover harbors predators, leading to increased stock losses, for example, while woody plant cover hinders mustering in both sheep and cattle areas.

A number of techniques have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas. Early pastoralists used felling and girdling, the removal of a ring of bark and sapwood, as a means of clearing land. In the 1950s arboricides suitable for stem injection were developed. War-surplus heavy machinery was made available, and these were used for either pushing timber, or for pulling using a chain and ball strung between two machines. These two new methods of timber control, along with the introduction and widespread adoption of several new pasture grasses and legumes promoted a resurgence in tree clearing. The 1980s also saw the release of soil-applied arboricides, notably tebuthiuron, that could be utilised without cutting and injecting each individual tree.

In many ways &quot;artificial&quot; clearing, particularly pulling, mimics the effects of fire and, in savannas adapted to regeneration after fire as most Queensland savannas are, there is a similar response to that after fire. Tree clearing in many savanna communities, although causing a dramatic reduction in basal area and canopy cover, often leaves a high percentage of woody plants alive either as seedlings too small to be affected or as plants capable of re-sprouting from lignotubers and broken stumps. A population of woody plants equal to half or more of the original number often remains following pulling of eucalypt communities, even if all the trees over 5 metres are uprooted completely.

===Exotic plant species===

A number of exotic plants species have been introduced to savannas around the world. Amongst the woody plant species are serious environmental weeds such as Prickly Acacia (&quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;), Rubbervine (&quot;Cryptostegia grandiflora&quot;), Mesquite (&quot;Prosopis&quot; spp.), Lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot; and &quot;L. montevidensis&quot;) and Prickly Pear (&quot;Opuntia&quot; spp.). A range of herbaceous species have also been introduced to these woodlands, either deliberately or accidentally including Rhodes grass and other &quot;Chloris&quot; species, Buffel grass (&quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;), Giant rat&#x27;s tail grass (&quot;Sporobolus pyramidalis&quot;) parthenium (&quot;Parthenium hysterophorus&quot;) and stylos (&quot;Stylosanthes&quot; spp.) and other legumes. These introductions have the potential to significantly alter the structure and composition of savannas worldwide, and have already done so in many areas through a number of processes including altering the fire regime, increasing grazing pressure, competing with native vegetation and occupying previously vacant ecological niches. Other plant species include: white sage, spotted cactus, cotton seed, rosemary.

===Climate change===
Human induced climate change resulting from the greenhouse effect may result in an alteration of the structure and function of savannas. Some authors have suggested that savannas and grasslands may become even more susceptible to woody plant encroachment as a result of greenhouse induced climate change. However, a recent case described a savanna increasing its range at the expense of forest in response to climate variation, and potential exists for similar rapid, dramatic shifts in vegetation distribution as a result of global climate change, particularly at ecotones such as savannas so often represent.

== Savanna ecoregions ==

A savanna can simply be distinguished by the open savanna, where grass prevails and trees are rare; and the wooded savanna, where the trees are densest, bordering an open woodland or forest. Specific savanna ecoregions of several different types include:
* Tropical savannas are classified with tropical and subtropical grasslands and shrublands as the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. The savannas of Africa, including the Serengeti, famous for its wildlife, are typical of this type. The Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) is also included in this category, known for its exotic and varied flora. Other examples include the Kimberley tropical savanna, Central Zambezian miombo woodlands, Guinean forest–savanna mosaic, Cape York Peninsula tropical savanna, Somali Acacia–Commiphora bushlands and thickets, Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands and the Victoria Basin forest–savanna mosaic. 
* Subtropical and temperate savannas are mid-latitude savannas with wetter summers and drier winters. They are classified with temperate savannas and shrublands as the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome, that for example cover much of the plains of southeastern Australia, northern India, Southern Africa, southeastern Argentina and Uruguay. Examples of subtropical and temperate savannas include the Southeast Australia temperate savanna, Argentine Espinal, Pampas, Cumberland Plain Woodland, Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna, New England Peppermint Grassy Woodland and the Uruguayan savanna.
* Mediterranean savannas are mid-latitude savannas in Mediterranean climate regions, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers, part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. The oak tree savannas of California, part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, fall into this category, including the Temperate Grassland of South Australia, which features eucalyptuses. Parts of the Middle East steppe and the Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests may also feature savanna-like landscapes.
* Flooded savannas are savannas that are flooded seasonally or year-round. They are classified with flooded savannas as the flooded grasslands and savannas biome, which occurs mostly in the tropics and subtropics. Examples include the Everglades, Mesopotamian Marshes, Pantanal, Nile Delta flooded savanna, Lake Chad flooded savanna, Zambezian flooded grasslands, and the Sudd. 
* Montane savannas are mid- to high-altitude savannas, located in a few spots around the world&#x27;s high mountain regions, part of the montane grasslands and shrublands biome. The Bogotá savanna, located at an average altitude of on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Eastern Ranges of the Andes, is an example of a montane savanna. The savannas of the Angolan Scarp savanna and woodlands ecoregion are a lower altitude example, up to . Other examples include the Al Hajar montane woodlands and the southern part of the Eastern Anatolian montane steppe.

<text>&quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; is a 32-page Disney comics adventure/mystery/horror story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. It was first published by Dell Publishing in &quot;Four Color&quot; #189 (June 1948). Characters include Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck, and his three nephews. The story is about a treasure hunt led by Uncle Scrooge through an old castle in Scotland. 

This is the first of Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s comic book treasure hunts, and the cover is Barks&#x27; first. The story has been reprinted many times.

==Plot==
Scrooge McDuck, in his second appearance, recruits his nephews to search for a family treasure back in Dismal Downs, the old castle of Clan McDuck, built in the middle of a swamp in Scotland. The treasure once belonged to Sir Quackly McDuck, but both the treasure and its owner disappeared during the siege of 1057. The Clan has been searching for the treasure for centuries but Scrooge, the last McDuck, believes he can locate it thanks to an X-ray machine that can examine through the castle&#x27;s walls. 

Finding the treasure proves to be the easy part of the mission, but they have to face a mysterious ghost who steals the treasure from them and repeatedly tries to dispose of any pursuers. They can&#x27;t see it but they can see its shadow, that of a skeleton. During this, Scottie, the caretaker of the castle, seems to have been murdered by Sir Quackly, while Scrooge, Donald, and the Nephews find themselves trapped in a locked battlement. The Nephews escape by swinging across into the surrounding moat, but can&#x27;t get in. However, remembering the tale of Sir Swamphole McDuck who sealed the dungeons (due to the high cost of running a dungeon), they locate a secret passageway into the castle&#x27;s dungeons through his fake grave site (his skeleton was inside his armor).

Scrooge and Donald remain on the battlement, until Scrooge reveals he has a gun which can shoot the lock and unlock the door. Scrooge, embarrassed, tells Donald to give him &quot;a good, swift kick!&quot;. While in the dungeon, the Nephews find the treasure box, but are nearly attacked by the ghost and discover another way out of the dungeon; the pillar upon which Sir Swamphole&#x27;s armor is resting is actually a door. Scrooge, Donald, and the nephews find an invisibility spray before giving chase to the ghost, now covered in mud and no longer invisible, through the swamp. The nephews and Donald tackle him to the ground and retrieve the treasure box. The ghost is revealed to be a thief who was impersonating Scottie (who had died of old age years before) using a special spray-like formula that made him invisible, but didn&#x27;t prevent his skeleton from casting a shadow. Donald then takes all the nephews&#x27; credit, claiming they hadn&#x27;t known the invisibility spray even existed. Enraged, the nephews then trick Donald into thinking the spray is a mosquito repellent, where they then make him completely invisible save for his tail and legs.

==Production==
Uncle Scrooge had been introduced in &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot;, published in December 1947; this story was the character&#x27;s return. Asked in a 1962 interview if Barks had received favorable comments about Scrooge, Barks said, &quot;Not a word, but I kind of liked old Scrooge and he filled a gap. We needed somebody to help Donald out.&quot; Wanting to use Scrooge again, Barks wrote this story to explain where the character came from.

<doc id="198846" wikidata="Q1159363" url="?curid=198846" title="Lost in the Andes!">
<text>&quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot; is a Donald Duck story written by Carl Barks and published in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #223 in April 1949. Donald and his nephews go to South America to find the mythical chickens that lay square eggs (actually, they are cubic eggs).

==Plot==
The story features Donald and his three nephews as members of a museum-sponsored expedition searching for the source of a number of square &quot;artifacts&quot; held in the Duckburg museum, recently revealed to be square eggs when Donald drops one and it cracks open. There is a rising interest, both scientific and financial, to find the source of these eggs and the chicken that laid them. However, the only thing known about them is that they came from Peru and were found somewhere in the Andes.

During their journey to South America, Donald&#x27;s nephews use some of the old square eggs from the museum to make an omelette. This causes the members of the expedition to come down with food poisoning. By the time their boat reaches Peru, the only ones that have recovered enough to continue the expedition are the youngest in the group and the lowest in hierarchy — Donald and his nephews.

Their search for the square eggs in the Andes seems hopeless, as the local population sees them either as insane or as suckers to be fooled into buying artificial eggs. Finally, they meet a very old man who tells them of how his father once came into possession of square stones similar to their own. The father had found them on the body of an American explorer who had emerged from a neighboring valley, which is covered in perpetual mist. The explorer, who had wandered the valley to the point of exhaustion, died soon afterward. The old man&#x27;s father later sold some of the &quot;stones&quot; in a local village and these ended up as the square eggs at the museum.

The Ducks follow the dead man&#x27;s path into the mists and after days of effort they find a populated valley in the mountains, hidden by the mists. The inhabitants are entirely cubical with square heads and noses. They speak with an old American Southern accent taught to them by their previous visitor, the dead man, Professor Rhutt Betlah (a wordplay on Rhett Butler) from Birmingham, Alabama, who had discovered their valley during the late 19th century.

During their stay in the valley, which the professor has named &quot;Plain Awful&quot;, Huey, Dewey, and Louie blow some bubble gum bubbles, which is against the law in Plain Awful: It&#x27;s forbidden to produce any round objects in the valley. The only way to get out of the valley and avoid capital punishment is for Huey, Dewey, and Louie to produce square bubbles. They manage to do that by teaching the square chickens to chew gum and blow bubbles. The nephews hid the chickens under their shirts and pretend they made the bubbles themselves.

The Ducks convince the very hospitable locals to let them go. The latter are sad to see them go, because they were a source of information from the outside world to their small and isolated civilization. They give the Ducks a compass that the professor had left in Plain Awful, having been placed in a museum as a piece of art and, in return, they teach them square dancing. When they leave the valley, in one of Barks&#x27; scarce moralizing moments, Donald remarks that the people in Plain Awful &quot;had so little of anything, yet they were the happiest people we&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

Bringing two square chickens and eggs with them, the Ducks again struggle to escape from the mists. Finally, when they do manage it, they are nearly exhausted. The two chickens are still alive, but they had to eat the eggs. It&#x27;s only when they return to Duckburg, that they realize the entire expedition was a failure: both of the chickens are male and naturally can&#x27;t reproduce. The story ends with Donald now giving an angry response to whoever mentions eggs and chicken to his face.

==Analysis==
Barks had heard jokes about square eggs and chickens since his childhood and decided to use them as an idea for a story. The plot combines themes and story elements that Barks often used in his stories. A mythical creature or legendary artifact that leads to an expedition, the long search for information, often seeming futile, an isolated civilization hidden from the outside world thanks to its natural environment, the Ducks bringing new ideas with them but sometimes faced as threats, and the characters ending up defeated or empty-handed are all such themes.

The story has been considered as representative of Barks&#x27; work in general and successful in its own right and has often been declared as one of his best. References to this story are often in the works of Barks&#x27; &quot;successors&quot; and fans of his work in general. In a 1962 interview, Barks agreed that &quot;my best story, technically, is probably the square egg one.&quot;

In &quot;Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: The Myth of Modernity&quot;, Thomas Andrae writes, &quot;Barks&#x27; portrait of the Inca culture is ambivalent. Although he finds them superior to capitalist modernity, Barks rejects a romantic primitivism that elevates preindustrial cultures to the status of utopias. Plain Awful, as its name suggests, is radically flawed. It is conformist and shackled by custom... Barks&#x27; story implies that primitive societies have a spirit of community and generosity but are so conformist and custom-bound that they lack tolerance and freedom of expression.&quot;

==Impact==
In Norway, the story gained a lot of attention when first published in the Norwegian language in 1963. The translator chose an archaic and slightly garbled version of Nynorsk for the mountain-dwellers, and this was widely seen as an insult. In later editions, the language was altered (the most recent editions however restore the Nynorsk dialogue, as the translation has come to be regarded as a classic in its own right). Thus, through the Norwegian language struggle, this story got quite a lot of attention in Norwegian media. It was later proclaimed as the best Donald Duck comic of all time by the Norwegian readers.

A scene from the Disney animated feature &quot;Dumbo&quot;, where Dumbo blows square bubbles of alcohol-tinted water, might have inspired the part of the story where Donald&#x27;s nephews blow square bubbles of chewing gum.

Don Rosa wrote and drew a sequel, &quot;Return to Plain Awful&quot;, where Donald and his nephews return to the secluded civilization, this time bringing Scrooge McDuck with them. The Plain Awful&#x27;s square egg is also featured in Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Buckaroo of the Badlands&quot;, part three of his famous &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;.

The story&#x27;s legacy, coupled with Barks&#x27; own love for it, made it launch the first &quot;The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library&quot; volume.

<text>&quot;Old California&quot; is a 28-page Disney comics story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. The story stars Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. It was first published in &quot;Four Color&quot; #328 (May 1951) with a cover by Carl Buettner, a four-page Grandma Duck story drawn and lettered by Bob Moore, and several one-page gag stories by Moore.

==Plot==
Donald Duck and his three nephews are on a holiday in California, heading to Los Angeles. They take a small narrow road that seems deserted and discuss California&#x27;s history as they travel. Donald Duck opines that the turning point in California&#x27;s history was the California Gold Rush. As he speaks passionately on this topic, Donald Duck is momentarily distracted from his driving. The car crashes in a rock besides the road.

When Donald Duck and his three nephews regain consciousness, they find they are visitors of a local tribe of Native Americans. The tribe kindly offer to help the foursome recover. The exhausted Ducks are offered a drink, and they fall asleep. When they wake again, they find themselves in Alta California, 1848. They quickly manage to befriend a local Spanish-speaking family of Californios, owners of a cattle ranch, together with the ranch workers. As visitors, Donald Duck and his nephews observe the family&#x27;s life and moreover, they attempt to help with the family problems. They visit San Francisco and acquire land cheaply, but soon are swindled out of them by American settlers. Afterwards, the Ducks become involved in the Gold Rush and as goldminers partner with a friend from the ranch. The Ducks do the digging, while their partner&#x27;s fists and guns make sure that nobody swindles them out of their gold.

After their friend departs, the Ducks start to experience an odd fading of their environment. It seems to them that all their acquaintances from this era are now only distant memories. It&#x27;s at this point that the Duck family truly regain consciousness to discover the truth. They were in a coma in a hospital bed for weeks. The drink they had accepted had kept them sleeping for this long. The Ducks all have the same memory of their apparent experiences in time travel. Despite this, the Ducks believe themselves fully recovered, take possession of their car (which has been completely repaired) and continue on their way as if nothing had happened. However, the Ducks do make a stop first at an abandoned old house where they had stayed as visitors in 1848. They admit that they don&#x27;t know if it was all a dream or if they really experienced the events they recall from 1848, but nevertheless they choose to keep the memory of Old California.

==Production==
The plot was inspired by the 1884 novel &quot;Ramona&quot; by Helen Hunt Jackson.

In a 1962 interview, Barks said, &quot;The one [story] I always liked best was &quot;In Old California&quot;. I created an atmosphere and then kept that atmosphere through the whole story. Composing these stories is like writing music. You&#x27;ve got to have the beat and keep the whole thing going.&quot;

<doc id="198852" wikidata="Q1052965" url="?curid=198852" title="A Christmas for Shacktown">
<text>&quot;A Christmas for Shacktown&quot; is a 32-page Disney comics story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. The story was first published in &quot;Four Color&quot; #367 (January 1952), and tells of Donald Duck&#x27;s attempts to raise money for a Christmas party for the poor children of Shacktown.

==Plot==
The story begins with Donald&#x27;s nephews passing through Shacktown, the most impoverished area of Duckburg. They progressively get more depressed as they see the living conditions there, children of their age dressed in rags and having tired expressions, hunger and sickness evident in many of them. They feel responsible for it and want to help those poor children find some happiness. The Ducks have the idea of organizing a Christmas celebration.

They ask for the help of Daisy Duck, president of a local ladies&#x27; society, and their friends in the Junior Woodchucks. Soon, however, it becomes evident that raising enough money is harder than it sounds. With all their efforts, they are still fifty dollars short.

Donald Duck has the idea to ask his Uncle Scrooge for the money. Scrooge refuses his nephew&#x27;s request for a donation, but nevertheless offers to match Donald&#x27;s own twenty-five dollars, if he can manage to raise that much.

Donald soon learns that asking for charity during the holidays, when every family struggles with its own increased expenses, is extremely difficult. He tries to trick his Uncle into making the donation, but he is unable to do so. Only when he swallows his pride and asks for his cousin Gladstone Gander&#x27;s help does he finally succeed in raising his twenty-five dollars.

When he arrives at his uncle&#x27;s money bin, an apparently shocked Scrooge tells him it is too late. Enraged, Donald opens the vault door and discovers that inside, the overloaded floor had collapsed, and the money has been lost in the caverns below Duckburg. Now Donald still is twenty-five dollars short and has to take care of a shocked and depressed uncle.

Dewey, Huey and Louie remember that they once explored Shacktown district and learned about a cavern that might lead to the lost money. In the cavern, the ducks find a beaver hole that leads to the money, but it can&#x27;t be expanded as the vibration would collapse the bottom of the cavern, making it impossible to retrieve the money. The boys bring a toy train to retrieve the money and Scrooge promises that they can keep the first load of money, no matter how much it is. They manage to get a hefty pile of bills and Scrooge faints, and using the bills, the residents of Shacktown receive a grand Christmas party. Scrooge, however, resides in the cavern and complains how he must wait for 272 years for the toy train to bring out all the money from the bottom.

==Reception==
R. Fiore writes, &quot;While Carl Barks was no rebel, his one great dissent with his society was in the matter of Christmas. That holiday, which all of mass entertainment thinks of as Payday, was to Barks just another day when men are wicked in their hearts. &quot;A Christmas for Shacktown&quot; was perhaps his most significant concession to the season that he viewed with distaste as a festival of greed, materialism, and false sentiment.&quot;

Thomas Andrae notes, &quot;This story foregrounds the power of a dime, and prefigures Scrooge&#x27;s lucky coin [the Number One Dime] — but with a crucial difference. When Donald gives Scrooge a dime as a joke, the miser deposits it in his cache. But the coin serves as a punishment for the skinflint&#x27;s selfishness; it causes his bin to cave in and Scrooge loses his entire fortune. Only the toy train, the gift that he failed to offer, can save his loot, but it will take almost 273 years for the locomotive to retrieve it... Rather than the symbol of Scrooge&#x27;s thrift it would become, the dime is an emblem of his mean-spiritedness and a vehicle of punishment for his lack of empathy — bad luck rather than good luck. This is an index of how much Barks would transform the skinflint&#x27;s mythos in the later Uncle Scrooge adventures.&quot;

<doc id="198854" wikidata="Q1761697" url="?curid=198854" title="The Golden Helmet">
<text>&quot;The Golden Helmet&quot; is a 32-page Disney comics adventure story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. The story was first published in &quot;Four Color&quot; #408 (July 1952) with a cover by Barks. In the story, Donald Duck and his nephews hunt for a Viking helmet that gives the possessor legal claim to North America.

==Plot==
Donald is working as a guard at the Duckburg Museum, but finds his duties unsatisfying. The relics of the glorious past in the halls of the museum are all but forgotten, as the crowds are more interested in the butterfly, lace, and tatting collections. Donald laments his luck for being stuck there, while he thirsts for an adventure like the Vikings.

Donald&#x27;s wish is soon answered when he becomes involved in a relic hunt of great importance. According to an old Viking saga and a map discovered in the museum, Olaf the Blue, a Viking explorer, had reached the coast of North America in the early 10th century and had claimed this land as his property — a claim that was indeed valid according to an international treaty drafted in 792 during the reign of Charlemagne. Accompanied by an attorney named Sharky, Azure Blue, a man who claims to be Olaf&#x27;s distant descendant, sets out to find the evidence that his ancestor left behind as proof of his claim — a Golden Helmet, whose possessor will be the owner of North America.

The museum&#x27;s director enlists Donald and his nephews in a rival attempt to find the helmet first. Its location is estimated to be somewhere on the coast of Labrador, Canada. During their search, both rival expeditions lose all modern equipment, and by the time they find the helmet they must try to reach Labrador&#x27;s coast traveling like the Vikings did. This is the least of their problems as the helmet changes hands between Azure Blue, the museum&#x27;s director, Donald, and Lawyer Sharky.

The helmet, an object of power, has the same effect on each of its successive owners: A cold glitter in their eyes betrays awakening greed and ambitions, as they become more ruthless, each of them in turn revealing the dreams of a would-be tyrant. Donald goes so far as to suggest charging for oxygen, with people wearing meters on their chests to keep track of how much they breathe. The idealistic museum director isn&#x27;t interested in personal wealth, but changing North American culture and education to his own ideals, to the &quot;benefit&quot; of society.

Finally, Donald&#x27;s nephews manage to throw the helmet into the sea and end the madness, but not before Louie gets the same glitter in his eyes. Back at the museum after the adventure, Donald is again working as a guard, after all he decides to get acquainted with contemporary times and interest himself of the current exhibits that appeal to the masses.

==Writing==
In a 1972 interview, Barks recalled, &quot;The work date on the story, November of 1951, indicates that it was done at a time when my fortunes were at a very low ebb. I had just given everything I owned to my alcoholic wife in exchange for my freedom. Broke and in debt and facing years of stiff alimony at the age of 50 I chose to keep working, and I can recall one day when all the bad news struck me and I should have been heading for a bar, and instead I sat there like a zombie with a pad of paper and jotted down gags and plots and situations that seemed to pour into me from somewhere. &#x27;The Golden Helmet&#x27; must have been one of those situations.&quot; He also said that the story idea itself was inspired by the coastal scenes in Hal Foster&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;.

==Analysis==
Usually considered as one of Barks&#x27; strongest stories, its strength lies in its characterization, as each of the characters exhibits the darkest sides of his personality. The &quot;heroes&quot; prove to be no better than the &quot;villains&quot; when the opportunity arises and the only solution seems to be the loss of the helmet. The helmet has a similar effect on those who possess it to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s One Ring or Der Ring des Nibelungen, where the reason also lies in one&#x27;s mind rather than any magical curse. Barks&#x27; successors have added a number of sequels. It seems to have inspired a further exploration of the Ducks&#x27; motivation and the darker sides of their psyches in subsequent stories.

Rich Kreiner writes, &quot;&#x27;The Golden Helmet&#x27; is a veritable symphony of the themes and elements that fired Carl Barks&#x27; imagination throughout his career. As a rip-roaring adventure, it&#x27;s a quest for an object of great value and power involving a race over treacherous territory to an exotic, unforgiving locale.&quot; Kreiner also praises &quot;the dynamic rhythm sustained throughout the epic. Each scene is fully fleshed out, every break neatly timed. Tension never slackens as the discrete parts of the lively tale are kept in smooth working order. It is high praise to say a comic book story has no throwaway panels, but this yarn illustrates that concept. Every picture tells a story.&quot;

== Relevance to Danish culture ==
In January 2006, the Danish Ministry of Culture published a canon of works significant to Danish culture. This story — the only item in the children&#x27;s category of the canon not of Danish origin — was included on the list of children&#x27;s culture items, alongside LEGO building blocks.

==Sequels==
In 1989, two Danish teenagers, Jesper Lund Madsen and Theis Christiansen won a competition in the Danish &quot;Anders And&quot; (Donald Duck) magazine, with a comic produced completely by themselves, &quot;På gensyn med den gyldne hjelm&quot; (The Golden Helmet Revisited). The comic was produced as a bonus magazine for the October 16, 1989 issue of the magazine. Madsen later went on to work professionally for the magazine.

In 1995, Don Rosa wrote a sequel to &quot;The Golden Helmet&quot;, called &quot;The Lost Charts of Columbus&quot;.

Azure Blue also appears in a cameo in Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;Return to Plain Awful&quot;, as one of several villainous characters trying to follow Scrooge McDuck to the Andes to search for square eggs.

Another sequel was written and drawn in 2002 by Massimo De Vita, called &quot;Topolino e l&#x27;imperatore d&#x27;America&quot; (Mickey Mouse and the Emperor of America). This is notable for being one of the rare Italian Duck/Mouse crossovers as well as one of the few cases of De Vita drawing Duck universe characters after 1996. It was also not published on Topolino but in a specifically Barks-themed release, which was also released in Germany.

==References==
The name Olaf the Blue is a reference to Eric the Red, who founded the first Norse settlement in Greenland, and whose son Leif Erikson is the first known European to have traveled to North America (excluding Greenland).

<text>Lego Mindstorms (sometimes stylized as LEGO MINDSTORMS) is a discontinued line of educational kits for building programmable robots based on Lego bricks. It was introduced on 1 September 1998 and discontinued on 31 December 2022.

Mindstorms kits allow users to build creations that interact with the physical world. All Mindstorms kits consist of a selection of Lego Elements, a &quot;Smart Brick&quot; (internally known as a programmable brick or &quot;pbrick&quot;), which serves as the &quot;brain&quot; for a Mindstorms machine. Each set also includes a few attachments for the smart brick (such as motors and sensors) and programming software. Unlike conventional Lego sets, Mindstorms kits do not have a main model to build. Sample builds are included with each version of Mindstorms, but the kit is open-ended with the intent of the user creating and programming their own designs.

In addition to at-home use, Mindstorms products are popularly used in schools and in robotics competitions such as the FIRST Lego League. Versions of Mindstorms kits specifically intended for use in educational settings are sold by Lego Education.

Children are the intended audience of Lego Mindstorms, but a significant number of Mindstorms hobbyists are adults. The latter have developed many alternative programming languages and operating systems for the smart brick, allowing for more complex functions.

While originally conceptualized and launched as a tool to support educational constructivism, Mindstorms has become the first home robotics kit available to a wide audience. It has developed a community of adult hobbyists and hackers as well as students and general Lego enthusiasts following the product&#x27;s launch in 1998. In October 2022, the Lego Group announced that it would discontinue the Lego Mindstorms line while continuing to support the Scratch-based SPIKE controller.

==Lego Mindstorms and Robotics Invention System (1998)==
The Robotics Invention System (RIS) was the flagship product of the first generation of the Lego Mindstorms line. It is a commercialization of technology produced by the MIT Media Lab in collaboration with the LEGO group. The RIS featured the programmable Robotic Command eXplorer (RCX) microcontroller, as well as 9V Lego-compatible motors and sensors and a selection of Lego parts. The original RIS was launched fall of 1998. It was replaced by a second version, RIS 1.5, in the summer of 1999; and a third version, RIS 2.0, in 2001.

===Development of Mindstorms Brand===

The Lego Mindstorms product line was the first project of &quot;Home Education&quot;, a division of Lego Education established by employee Tormod Askildsen in 1995. Askildsen, who had previously spent ten years working for Lego Education, had grown frustrated working with teaching professionals and wanted to create an improved educational experience that was delivered directly towards children. Home Education decided to incorporate technology into their products based on market research that concluded that children found learning that involved technology interesting. Lego Mindstorms started development in April 1996. The concept for the set was based on technology created in partnership with the MIT Media Lab. MIT Media Lab had been experimenting with combining Lego and programming since the early 1980s, and Lego had previously commercialized some of this technology as classroom products in the Lego Dacta line. The programmable brick (or pbrick) was a refinement of these early concepts, which had limited range because they had to be tethered to a computer to run.

Lego had been interested in mass-producing the pbrick since its creation in the 1980s, but at the time it was considered unfeasible due to the lack of computers in schools and households and the relative expense of electrical components. in the early 1990s Technology began to become more of a child&#x27;s life, and the toy market accordingly began shifting more towards computerized toys. Many of Lego&#x27;s attempts at producing electronic toys had languished at the point that Lego began developing MIT&#x27;s programmable brick into a consumer product. MIT continued developing the pbrick concept, creating a &quot;Red Brick&quot; version between 1994 and 1996 that improved the previous version. 
By the mid-1990s personal computers were relatively common in households and the components required to produce the pbrick went down in price, making mass production feasible. Development on what would later be known as the Robotics Invention System started in 1996 as the flagship product of the newly created home-learning division of Lego Education (Lego Dacta). The product line&#x27;s name &quot;Mindstorms&quot; was intended to express the user experience of the product, it is named after Papert&#x27;s book Mindstorms, as the user experience was similar to the educational constructivism concepts described in his book.

The project&#x27;s at-first low profile allowed the Mindstorms team the freedom to develop the product using operating procedures then-unorthodox to the Lego Group. Unlike traditional Lego sets, the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System did not come with step-by-step instructions. The kit also did not have a main model, nor was the play driven by storytelling. To bridge the gap between this new play experience and pre-existing Lego ones, the Mindstorms team created a lot of opportunities for users to engage with each other, such as the creation of Mindstorms.com, Mindstorms Discovery Centers, and the FIRST Lego League. The creation of these experiences was done through partnerships with external groups that the Mindstorms team interacted with as equal partners, something that was uncommon for the Lego group at the time. To ease tensions between Mindstorms and more conventional products, the project team was given autonomy from Lego&#x27;s product development process and instead reported directly to the company&#x27;s senior management.

===Development of RCX Brick===
The Lego Mindstorms team used the insights that MIT researchers discovered from testing the 3rd Generation Logo Brick (&quot;Red Brick&quot;) in schools as the basis for the development of the mass-produced programmable brick. The physical programmable brick was re-engineered from the ground up, as the experimental programmable bricks were not designed for robustness or cost-effective manufacturing. The programming language of the product was developed with help from members of the MIT Media lab. Lego decided to use a visual programming language for Mindstorms, inspired by the LOGOBlocks language previously used with programmable brick experiments, in order to make the product accessible to children who might be unfamiliar with programming. While the technology that Mindstorms was based on was aimed towards &quot;all children&quot;, the chosen target demographic of Lego Mindstorms was intentionally narrow, in order to garner positive press by outselling expectations. The decision was made to aim the product towards 10 to 14-year-old boys, partly because it was Lego&#x27;s main target demographic, and partly based on market research (not substantiated by the findings of the MIT Media Lab) which concluded that this demographic would be most attracted to computerized toys. This choice of target demographic directly informed the color of the RCX brick (which was made yellow and black to resemble construction equipment) and the sample uses for the Mindstorms kit (such as making autonomous robots).

===Launch===
Promotion of the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System began 6 months before the product was planned to launch. The product was first soft launched with the opening of the Mindstorms Discovery Center at the Museum of Science and Industry, where children could interact with the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System to complete set tasks, getting them familiar with the product. The Mindstorms product was launched concurrently with the Cybermaster, another Lego product spun off from the MIT programmable brick technology that was more in line with the traditional product philosophies of the Lego group.

The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System (RIS) was released September 1998 at a retail price of $199. Instead of being sold at toy stores, the product was sold at electronics stores like BestBuy and CompUSA, due to the relatively high cost of the set.
The entire production run (of between 60,000 and 100,000 units) sold out within 3 months.

The second edition of the RIS, Robotics Invention System 1.5, was released in the summer of 1999, with a third edition, RIS 2.0, launched in 2001.

===Fanbase and &quot;Right-to-Hack&quot;===
Despite being aimed towards children, the Robotics Invention System quickly found an audience with adults and hackers of all ages; Lego company surveys conducted a few months after launch determined that seventy percent of Lego Mindstorms Hobbyists were adults. Shortly following the product&#x27;s launch, adult hobbyists began sharing reverse-engineered versions of the RCX brick&#x27;s Microcode and Firmware on the internet, leading to the development of alternative programming languages for the RCX such as &quot;Not Quite C&quot; (NQC) and alternative operating systems for the brick like lejOS. The Lego Group briefly considered sending cease-and-desist letters to websites sharing the RCX&#x27;s proprietary code. However, The Mindstorms team successfully argued that the embrace of the product by the hacking community proved that the product was worth developing. In order to foster this burgeoning community, an official forum was established on the Lego website and a &quot;right to hack&quot; clause was added to end user license agreement of the Lego Mindstorms software. An official software developers kit for the RCX would later be released on the Mindstorms website. A number of products focusing on the RIS were released by adult hobbyists, including how-to books, and unofficial sensors and hardware. A convention for Lego Mindstorms hobbyists, named Mindfest, started in 1999.

Despite strong sales, the Mindstorms development team was neglected by upper management. As a cost-cutting measure, the Mindstorms office was shut down in 2001, and team members were laid-off or assigned to other projects. The Lego Group continued to produce the Robotics Invention System 2.0, selling around 40,000 units per year without advertising until the set was discontinued in 2006.

==RCX==
The RCX is based on the 8-bit Renesas H8/300 microcontroller, including 32 KB of ROM for low-level IO functions, along with 32 KB of RAM to store high-level firmware and user programs. The RCX is programmed by uploading a program using a dedicated infrared interface. After the user uploads a program, the RCX can run it on its own without the need for computer access. Programs may make use of three sensor input ports and three 9 V output ports, in addition to the IR interface, enabling RCX bricks to communicate with one another. A built-in LCD can display information including the battery level, the status of the input/output ports, and the program currently running.

Version 1.0 RCX bricks feature a power adapter jack in addition to batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power adapter jack was removed. Power adapter-equipped RCX bricks were popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling Lego model trains. In the latter context, the RCX might be programmed with Digital Command Control (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.

The IR interface on the RCX is able to communicate with Spybots, Scout Bricks, Lego Trains, and the NXT (using a third-party infrared link sensor). The RCX 1.0 IR receiver carrier frequency is 38.5 kHz, while the RCX 2.0 IR carrier frequency is 76 kHz. Both versions can transmit on either frequency. The RCX communicates with a computer using a Serial or USB IR tower. As the RCX is discontinued, support for the interface is limited on more recent operating systems than Windows XP.

All RCX versions have a unique number printed on them, which could be registered on the now-defunct Lego Mindstorms RCX website. This was necessary to obtain technical support. The first RCX produced is marked &quot;000001,&quot; and was on display at the Mindstorms 10th Anniversary event.

The Lego RCX was available in new sets from 1998 (Lego Set 9719: Robotics Invention System 1.0) through 2003 (Lego Set 9786: Robo Technology Set, with USB cable). The original RCX 1.0 worked with existing Lego power supply products from the Lego Train theme, Lego Product 70931: Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Power Adaptor for 120v 60 Hz - US version (Years: 1991 thru 2004), Lego Product 70938: Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Power Adaptor for 230v 50 Hz - European version (Years: 1991-1996). Both of these products converted wall power to 12VAC , through a coaxial power connector (also called a &quot;barrel connector&quot;), 5.5 mm outside, 2.1 mm inside. These were sometimes sold alone and sometimes available as part of other sets such as Lego Set 4563: Load N&#x27; Haul Railroad (Year: 1991) and Lego Set 10132: Motorized Hogwarts Express (Year: 2004).

==Robotics Discovery Set and Droid, Dark Side Developer Kit==
The Robotics Discovery Set was a more affordable and simpler package than the Robotics Invention Set. Instead of being based on the RCX, it had its own programmable brick called the Scout. An even simpler version of the Scout would be featured in two Star-Wars-themed Mindstorms sets.

===Scout===
Lego also released a blue computer called the &quot;Scout&quot;, which has 2 sensor ports, 2 motor ports (plus one extra if linked with a Micro Scout using a fiber-optic cable), and a built-in light sensor, but no PC interface. It comes with the Robotics Discovery Set. The Scout can be programmed from a collection of built-in program combinations. In order to program the Scout, a user must enable &quot;power mode&quot; on it. The Scout can store one program.

The Scout is based on a Toshiba microcontroller with 32 KB of ROM and 1 KB of RAM, where about 400 bytes are available for user programs. Due to the extremely limited amount of RAM, many predefined subroutines were provided in ROM. The Scout only supports passive external sensors, which means that only touch, temperature and other unpowered sensors can be used. The analog-to-digital converters used in the Scout only have a resolution of 8 bits, in contrast to the 10-bit converters of the RCX.

There was a plan for Lego to create a booster set that allows programming the Scout from a computer with software such as RCX code. However, due to the complexity of this project, it was abandoned.

The RCX can control the Scout brick using the &quot;Send IR Message&quot; program block. The RCX does all of the controlling, and therefore can be programmed with the PC, while the Scout accepts commands. The Scout brick must have all of its options set to &quot;off&quot; during this process.

===Micro Scout===
The Micro Scout was added as an entry-level to Lego robotics. It is a very limited Pbrick with a single built-in light sensor and a single built-in motor. It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from Toshiba.

The unit was sold as part of the Droid Developer Kit (featuring R2-D2) and later the Dark Side Developer Kit (featuring an AT-AT Imperial Walker).

==Lego Mindstorms NXT (2006)==


Lego Mindstorms NXT was a programmable robotics kit released by Lego in August 2006, replacing the first-generation Lego Mindstorms kit.
The kit consists of 577 pieces, including: 3 servo motors, 4 sensors (ultrasonic, sound, touch, and light), 7 connection cables, a USB interface cable, and the NXT Intelligent Brick. It lets the robot autonomously perform different operations. The kit also includes NXT-G, a graphical programming environment that enables the creation and downloading of programs to the NXT. The software also has instructions for 4 robots: Alpha-Rex (a humanoid), Tri-Bot (a car), Robo-Arm T-56 (a robotic arm), and Spike (a scorpion)

== Development ==
The Development of Lego Mindstorms NXT began in 2004. At the time, The Lego group was in the middle of a financial crisis. As part of the turn-around effort, the product line developed for release in 2006 would feature relatively few products that were guaranteed to be profitable. A revival of The Mindstorms Robotics Invention System was chosen as of these products, as Lego Mindstorms had a strong fan following and kits continued to sell well without advertising.

Fans were extensively involved in the development and promotion of Mindstorms NXT. The development team collaborated with four hobbyists considered experts in Lego Mindstorms fan community. These fans were collectively known as the Mindstorms Users Panel (MUP). They were shipped early prototypes of the Mindstorms kit and communicated to Mindstorms team members on a private internet forum. MUP gave extensive feedback on the hardware and design of the NXT kit. Features of NXT directly based on requests of the MUP include the use 32-bit processor, more powerful motors, and Bluetooth compatibility.

== Launch ==
Promotion of Lego Mindstorms NXT was largely word-of-mouth based, because the company was in the middle of a financial crisis and did not have enough money for a large marketing campaign. Mindstorms NXT was unveiled in January 2006 at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show. At the show, Lego requested applications for a beta-testing phase, where 100 users, known as Mindstoms Community Partners (MCP)s would receive NXT kits at a discounted price months before launch. The intention of the MCP program was to build support for the product prior to launch, and receive feedback on the near-final kit. Fans involved in the MCP program provided a significant amount of PR for the set upon launch, such as alternate models, finished book drafts, and web content like blog posts. News outlets like Wired and CNN also provided free publicity for Mindstorms NXT by reporting on the inclusion of fans in its development process. The launch of Mindstorms NXT, measured in airtime hours, web content and magazine pages; generated more public interest than the entire company had previously accumulated in its entire lifetime.

Lego Mindstorms NXT (Product no. 8527) was released August 1 of 2006. $30 million worth of kits were sold in the first year.

==Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0==

The Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 was launched on 5 August 2009. It contains 619 pieces and five sensors; two touch sensors, and one sound, light, and ultrasonic distance sensor. The NXT 2.0 uses Floating Point operations whereas earlier versions use Integer operation. The kit costs around US$280.

==Lego Mindstorms EV3==
EV3, the third generation Mindstorms product, is a further development of the NXT. The system was released on 1 September 2013. There are three versions of the Lego Mindstorms EV3:

* LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 31313

This set contains 601 pieces and includes 3 servo motors (2 large and 1 medium), 3 sensors (touch sensor, infrared sensor and colour sensor), the EV3 programmable brick and a remote control (the Infrared Beacon, which is only on Home/Retail mode).

* LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set 45544

This version contains 541 pieces and always includes 3 servo motors (2 large and 1 medium), 4 sensors (2 touch sensors, ultrasonic sensor, colour sensor and gyro sensor) and the EV3 programmable brick.

* LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Expansion Set 45560

This set instead contains 853 Lego Technic elements

The EV3 can be controlled by smart-devices. It can boot an alternative operating system from a microSD card, which makes it possible to run ev3dev, a Debian-based operating system.

==Lego Education Spike Prime==

Spike Prime was announced in April 2019. While not being part of the Mindstorms product line, the basic set includes three motors (1 large 2 medium) and sensors for distance, force and color a controller brick based on an STM32F413 microcontroller and 520+ Lego Technic elements. Majority of these motors and sensors, including the hub, would serve as the electric components for the then-upcoming Robot Inventor set.

==Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor==
Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor was announced in June 2020 and released later in autumn. It is the last commercially available Mindstorms set before the discontinuation of the theme announced in October 2022. It has four medium motors from Spike Prime, two sensors (distance sensor and color/light sensor) also from Spike Prime, a Spike Prime hub with a six-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, and support for controllers and phone control. It also has 902+ Lego Technic elements. This set was discontinued in 2022 with Lego promising app support through 2024.

==Programming languages==



== Use in education ==

Mindstorms kits are also sold and used as an educational tool, originally through a partnership between Lego and the MIT Media Laboratory. The educational version of the products is called &quot;Mindstorms for Schools&quot; or &quot;Mindstorms Education&quot;, and later versions come with the ROBOLAB GUI-based programming software, developed at Tufts University using the National Instruments LabVIEW as an engine.

==Use in Competition==
Due to its user friendliness towards children, Lego Mindstorms has been used as a platform for several child-oriented robotics competitions, most prominently the FIRST Lego League (FLL), but also World Robot Olympiad or Robocup Junior

FIRST Lego League Challenge (founded as FIRST Lego League) is a robotics competition that uses Lego Mindstorms products. It was founded in 1998 concurrent with the launch of LEGO Mindstorms and continues to exist to this day. It is a collaboration between FIRST and The Lego Group to involve a lower age bracket than the FIRST Robotics Competition. FLL teams consist of children between the ages of 9 and 14, and an adult coach.

<doc id="198857" wikidata="Q907801" url="?curid=198857" title="Back to the Klondike">
<text>&quot;Back to the Klondike&quot; is a Disney comic book story created by Carl Barks, created in September 1952 and first published in March 1953 in &quot;Four Color&quot; #456. Scrooge McDuck returns to Klondike where he has made his fortune, bringing Donald and the three nephews along, to find back the gold he has left there. 

This story is a turning point in Barks&#x27; depiction of Scrooge: the first to show that the character has a softer side, and his miserly gruffness is partly a mask that he uses to guard against loneliness and loss.

==Plot==

At the beginning of the story, Scrooge McDuck seems to be suffering from memory lapses to the point he cannot even recognize Donald. Donald drags him to a doctor and Scrooge is given some pills supposed to help recover his memory. As his memory returns, Scrooge suddenly starts planning to return to the Klondike, Yukon, the place of his youth where he earned his wealth. He tells Donald and his nephews, who accompany him, he has left a cargo of gold buried near his old hut. Scrooge also begins to make references to &quot;Glittering Goldie&quot;, a person of his past. 

As Scrooge seems to relive his past, but feeling his age, they arrive in Dawson, where Scrooge explains how he and Goldie met. Scrooge tells his nephews how Goldie stole his gold from him in the past, and how he kidnapped her and forced Goldie to work for him at his mining claim, up until the point where we see -in a flashback scène- Goldie shouting at Scrooge while crying for her ruined dress. 

The journey continues till they reach his old lodge and to their surprise it&#x27;s occupied. Also, the current occupant forcibly resists any of their attempts to approach. Finally the nephews manage to surprise and disarm the old lady behind the attack, Goldie herself. As Scrooge and Goldie meet again, both a rivalry and an attraction to each other seem to resurface. But Scrooge demands an old debt that Goldie cannot pay. She gives her last jewelry to Scrooge and just leaves, apparently quitting. But Scrooge calls her back and challenges her to a contest. A contest of who can find gold first. 

Goldie succeeds in finding Scrooge&#x27;s old cache that is now worth a fortune. After more than fifty years she succeeded. Scrooge leaves seemingly defeated and pretending that because he hadn&#x27;t taken his pills, he had forgotten where the gold was. But behind his back, Donald reveals to his nephews that Scrooge had indeed taken the pills and practically offered this gold to Goldie. In the end, his nephews realize that Scrooge is more emotional than he would like to appear.

==Writing==
Barks wrote the story after his second divorce, when he was traveling and living out of motels. In a Seattle bookshop, he found a copy of &quot;Klondike &#x27;98&quot; by Ethel Anderson Becker, a book of photographs of the Klondike gold rush. He later wrote, &quot;Reading this is how I got off on this wild beat of having Scrooge have the big fight in the saloon, kidnap this gal, and take her out to the hills and make her work out her debt.&quot;

==Publication history==
In its first printing, the story was cut from 32 to 27 pages, since the editors did not believe the bar fight and abduction scenes were appropriate for a Disney comic. Barks later recalled, &quot;I think they figured I should have had sense enough to know you couldn&#x27;t get involved in fights in a barroom. It was quite a while afterwards before I found out why they cut it. I got a letter from the office, or was told on my next visit to the office, that I had violated a lot of their taboos and should have had sense enough to know it wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; Another of Western&#x27;s concerns was that Scrooge kidnapped Goldie and made her work on his claim for a month, and that sequence was also cut from the published story.

Later, all cut art, except for a half page, was recovered and the story was published in its entirety in 1981 with the missing half page reconstructed by Barks.

==Analysis==
Barks had an interest in Klondike and scenes of this story were inspired by old Klondike tales, but this story can be seen as most important for its contribution to the development of Scrooge&#x27;s personality, and way of thought. Scrooge&#x27;s participation in the Klondike Gold Rush had been mentioned before, but this is the first time the Klondike becomes an essential part of Scrooge&#x27;s past. In later stories by both Barks and his &quot;successors&quot;, references to Scrooge&#x27;s past in the Klondike appear even more often than those to his native Scotland. 

The story presents the first appearance of Goldie O&#x27;Gilt (&quot;Glittering Goldie&quot;). Her love/hate relationship with Scrooge is considered by some people, mainly Don Rosa fans, a great part of the two characters&#x27; appeal. The story is, according to these fans, the first focusing on Scrooge&#x27;s love life, and the last focusing on it by Barks. 

Another theme introduced in this story is that Scrooge makes conscious effort to hide or deny his own feelings and emotions because he doesn&#x27;t want to appear vulnerable. This has become an essential part of the character&#x27;s way of thinking and acting in subsequent stories. Often mentioned as one of Barks&#x27; strongest stories, it largely defines Scrooge&#x27;s character, and the themes introduced here are now considered part of a tradition.

==&quot;DuckTales&quot; version==

This was later adapted into an episode of the first season of &quot;DuckTales&quot;, with some alterations. Donald was removed; Webby and Mrs. Beakley were added; Scrooge suffers no memory lapses, as in the comic. He returns to Klondike because he suddenly remembers Goldie after seeing Beakly and Webby making Valentine&#x27;s Day cards. Two villains are added that were not in Barks&#x27; story. Scrooge and Goldie are open about their romantic interest in one another, not only privately, but in front of Scrooge&#x27;s nephews. The episode also introduces the Red Agony Creek which was never mentioned in Barks story (or by any other author - such as Rosa), making this land unique to the television series.

<doc id="198858" wikidata="Q1323475" url="?curid=198858" title="Tralla La">
<text>&quot;Tralla La&quot; is a Scrooge McDuck comic book story by Carl Barks. The story was first published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #6 (June, 1954). In the story, Scrooge searches for a utopia in which money plays no role.

==Plot==
&quot;Tralla La&quot; begins with Uncle Scrooge having a hard day at his office, and it doesn&#x27;t get better when he attempts to walk along the street to relax; everyone he meets wants some of his money. The stress of this way of life gets to him and he suffers a nervous breakdown. Though he improves, he can&#x27;t stand to see or hear about money, as he now associates it with all the troubles that got him to this point. In order to heal, he searches for a place where money has no influence. Tralla La may be such a place, where a peaceful society without a monetary system is rumored to exist.

Scrooge and his nephews, who are there to support his healing, finally locate the mythical place in a deep valley high in the Himalayas and arrive by parachute. There, they get acquainted with a more peaceful existence than to which they were accustomed.

However, as Scrooge seems to be healing, he doesn&#x27;t realize he brought his troubles with him. He brought bottles of his medication along. The bottle caps he discards are considered rare treasures in Tralla La and become the basis of a new monetary system. The inhabitants of Tralla La become obsessed with these new treasures. To solve the issue, Scrooge has planes drop one billion bottle caps, but this becomes too many, and the inhabitants become angry, as their fields are now covered with caps. The Ducks must flee, as they apparently cannot find peace even in an Earthly paradise.

==Production==
In a 1981 interview, Barks said, &quot;The nerve medicine [in &quot;Tralla La&quot;] was a running gag to help pull parts of the story together. I had learned about running gags before I ever worked at Disney. It was a kind of thread or connecting link in stories, such as Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, and in the movies: Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy had running gags. I liked those movies more than romantic ones or shoot-&#x27;em-up westerns. The running gags were a necessary part of the stories, like a period at the end of a sentence.&quot;

==Analysis==
A number of previous stories by Barks presented Scrooge&#x27;s way of life as rather stressful, but this is the first story where this seems to be getting on his nerves. This is certainly not the last, but subsequent stories rarely focus on it.

Scrooge&#x27;s effort this time is not to gain treasure, but find some peace and regain his health. However, as so often presented in Barks tales, in trying to escape his problems he only manages to carry them with him. Tralla La&#x27;s (based on Shangri-La) inhabitants prove to share the human characteristic of greed, while Barks is allowed some bitter commentary on human nature and the impact of &quot;inventing&quot; money.

The theme of never finding peace no matter how hard the characters try is a running theme in Barks&#x27; tales, but here it takes center place. It is considered among Barks&#x27; most memorable because of its view of humanity, paradise, and the vulnerability of his characters.

This story features the first appearance of that inexhaustible font of knowledge, &quot;The Junior Woodchucks&#x27; Guidebook&quot;.

The story was later adapted into an episode of &quot;DuckTales&quot;.

Don Rosa wrote a sequel to the story, &quot;Return To Xanadu&quot;, in which Tralla La is revealed to be the valley of Xanadu. &quot;Return to Xanadu&quot; was first published in the United States in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #261-262 (October–November 1991) and reprinted in #357 (September, 2006).

<doc id="198865" wikidata="Q6081296" url="?curid=198865" title="Power to the people (slogan)">
<text>&quot;Power to the people&quot; is a cultural expression and political slogan that has been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Uses==

===In politics===
During the 1960s in the United States, young people began speaking and writing this phrase as a form of rebellion against what they perceived as oppression by the older generation, especially The Establishment. The Black Panthers used the slogan &quot;All Power to the People&quot; to protest the rich, ruling class domination of society. Pro-democracy students used it to protest American involvement in the Vietnam War.

In his 1974 book &quot;Computer Lib&quot;, Ted Nelson connected computer use with political freedom with the rallying cry &quot;Computer power to the people! Down with the cybercrud.&quot; In the mid-1980s the People Power movement arose in the Philippines to oust Ferdinand Marcos. In the late 20th century and early 21st century the phrase has been used with regard to energy policy.

The Pakistan Peoples Party has as its creed, &quot;Islam is our faith; democracy is our politics; socialism is our economy; all power to the people.&quot;

During the Anti-Apartheid struggle in South Africa, the terms Amandla and Matla were used frequently during speeches and rallies, this was followed by the crowd responding with Awethu or Kee A Rona. These terms respectively mean &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;To the people&quot;. These terms are still frequently used in ANC meetings and conferences as well as among student activist groups such as SASCO and the ANC Youth League.

Margaret Thatcher criticised the use of the slogan by the left in a 1986 speech: &quot;Socialists cry &#x27;Power to the people&#x27;, and raise the clenched fist as they say it. We all know what they really mean - power over people, power to the State.&quot;

It is also the name of the left-wing to far-left Italian coalition Potere al Popolo.

===In film===
In the 2016 film &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, the phrase &quot;Power to the people&quot; (with the response &quot;Stick it to the man!&quot;) is used at a pivotal point near the climax of the film.

===In television===
The 1970s television series &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; had the title character use the slogan in the title sequence.

===In music===
&quot;Power to the people&quot; is the title of a 1971 song by John Lennon and a lyric by James Brown: &quot;Power to the people, people power!&quot; &quot;Power to the people, &#x27;cause the people want peace&quot; is also chanted on the Public Enemy album &quot;New Whirl Odor&quot;. Rage Against the Machine quoted the slogan in their song &quot;Year of tha Boomerang&quot;. The Jamaican reggae band Rootz Underground wrote a song entitled &quot;Power to the People&quot; in which they quote this slogan in both English and South African versions.

Saxophonist Joe Henderson released his album &quot;Power to the People&quot; in 1969.

One of the more politically extreme singer-songwriters is Quino, the lead singer of the reggae band Big Mountain who also wrote a song entitled &quot;Power to the People&quot; and then had a tattoo of &quot;Power to the People&quot; along with the fist placed on his chest.

The glam metal rock band Poison released a single titled Power to the People as a single on May 23, 2000. The song served as the lead single and title track for their fifth studio album Power to the People that was released on June 13, 2000, via the band&#x27;s independent label, Cyanide Music. It marked the return of the band&#x27;s original lineup, together for the first time since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Swallow This Live&quot; with the return of C.C. DeVille who replaced Blues Saraceno.

The electronic house music artist Basement Jaxx released a song titled &quot;Power to the People&quot; on their album &quot;Junto&quot; in 2014.

===In advertising===
* &quot;Power to the People&quot; was spoken by an actress in a Progressive Auto Insurance advertisement in heavy television rotation during 2009.
* &quot;Power to the People&quot; was used as a theme in advertising by Ever Ready batteries.
* &quot;Power to the People&quot; is used by TecKnow Smart Living Ecosystems (Westport,CT) to promote services allowing users to live &quot;off-grid&quot; and utilize renewable energy from the Sun.
* &quot;Power to the People&quot; is used in a Red Bull commercial featuring parrots that has been circulating 2023

==Variations of the slogan==
A popular variation of the slogan is &quot;Power to the Poor People!&quot; Amongst others, the South African social movement the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign uses the slogan to express the need for poor people to control their own movements rather than have wealthy donors or NGOs control or speak for them. The divide between South Africa&#x27;s independent social movements and many leftist and vanguard organisations in South Africa has become a point of contention.

The South African slogan &quot;Amandla Ngawethu&quot; or &quot;Amandla Awethu&quot; is also a popular variation of the Power to the People. It means &quot;The power is ours&quot; but is used in a similar way as &quot;Power to the People&quot;. It is often used in a call and response format, with the speaker shouting &quot;Amandla&quot; and the crowd replying &quot;Awethu&quot;.

Another variation of the slogan was &quot;Power to the People at Home,&quot; used for advertising purposes by Village Roadshow&#x27;s home video division, Roadshow Entertainment in the mid-1990s.

The slogan of video game retailer GameStop, &quot;Power to the Players&quot;, is a variation of the &quot;Power to the People&quot; slogan.

<text>USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; (SS-197), a , was the second submarine of the United States Navy named for the seawolf.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Seawolf&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 September 1938 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 15 August 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Syria Florence Kalbfus, wife of Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus, and commissioned on 1 December 1939, Lieutenant Frederick B. Warder in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
After fitting out, &quot;Seawolf&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 12 April 1940 for her shakedown cruise, which lasted until 21 June and took her as far south as the Panama Canal Zone. &quot;Seawolf&quot; was next assigned to the Pacific Fleet, home ported at San Diego. In Autumn 1940, she proceeded to Manila Bay and operated from the Cavite Navy Yard.

===World War II===
====First through fourth war patrols====
When war with Japan began, the submarine readied for sea and was on her first war patrol from 8–26 December 1941.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; hunted Japanese shipping off San Bernardino Strait. On 14 December, she fired a spread of torpedoes at &quot;Sanyo Maru&quot; in Port San Vicente. One torpedo hit, but did not explode. She promptly underwent her first depth charge attack but suffered no damage.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; departed Manila on 31 December 1941 for Australia and arrived at Darwin on 9 January 1942. She loaded 30–40 tons of .50 cal (12.7 mm) antiaircraft ammunition for use by American forces on Corregidor and sailed for Manila Bay on 16 January. The submarine sighted seven Japanese freighters accompanied by four destroyers and a cruiser on 21 January, but had no opportunity to fire any of the eight torpedoes that she had aboard. The ammunition was unloaded on 28–29 January at Corregidor. 

&quot;Seawolf&quot; then left Corregidor with sixteen torpedoes, submarine spare parts, and 25 passengers, that included a British intellignence officer, 12 Army pilots, 11 Navy pilots, and a yeoman.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; sailed out of Surabaya on 15 February and began patrolling in the Java Sea-Lombok Strait area. On 19 February, she fired four torpedoes at two Japanese freighter-transports in the Badung Strait. Damage to one was not ascertained, but the other was reported last seen down by the stern and listing to starboard. (However, &quot;Sagami Maru&quot; had been damaged by USAAF air attack, not by &quot;Seawolf&quot;″s torpedo.)

A week later, she fired her stern tubes at a freighter and watched one hit forward of the bridge before going deep to evade depth charges from an escorting destroyer at which she had also fired. In March, &quot;Seawolf&quot; was hunting between Java and Christmas Island. On 1 April, she stealthily approached the anchorage at Christmas Island where the Japanese invasion force lay at anchor. &quot;Seawolf&quot; fired a spread at . Though &quot;Seawolf&quot; was credited with a sinking at the time, only one torpedo hit, causing significant damage to the ship, although not harming any of the crew. &quot;Naka&quot; was forced to return to Japan for repairs and was out of the war for almost a year. Unaware she had hit her target, &quot;Seawolf&quot; then underwent 7 hours of depth charge attacks. On 1 April, she attacked two cruisers. A violent explosion was heard, but no flames were seen. &quot;Seawolf&quot; ended her patrol on 7 April at Fremantle and received the Navy Unit Commendation.

====Fifth through tenth war patrols====
On her fifth patrol, from 12 May until 2 July (a total of 51 days at sea), &quot;Seawolf&quot; patrolled the Philippine Islands area. She attacked freighters on 20 May, 23 May, 12 June, 13 June, 15 June, and 28 June. On 13 June, she fired at two ships and her crew heard four explosions, but no sinkings were confirmed. &quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Fremantle for three weeks before beginning her sixth war patrol.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; prowled the Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea from 25 July – 15 September. She attacked a tanker on 3 August, sank &quot;Hachigen Maru&quot; on 14 August and &quot;Showa Maru&quot; eleven days later. She returned to Fremantle to refit and then hunted in the Davao Gulf area from 7 October–1 December. &quot;Seawolf&quot; sank &quot;Gifu Maru&quot; on 2 November, &quot;Sagami Maru&quot; the next day, and &quot;Keiko Maru&quot; on 8 November. She ended her patrol at Pearl Harbor, where Lieutenant Commander Royce L. Gross relieved Commander Warder. She then proceeded to the West Coast of the United States.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 10 December 1942 and underwent an overhaul that lasted until 24 February 1943. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 March, and on 3 April stood out for another patrol near the Bonin Islands. On 15 April, she torpedoed &quot;Kaihei Maru&quot;, sank an old destroyer now known as &quot;Patrol Boat Number 39&quot; on 23 April; and sank two 75-ton sampans with her gun. She ended this patrol early, on 3 May, because she had expended all torpedoes on enemy shipping.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for refitting and departed that island on 17 May and headed for the East China Sea. She ran into several large convoys as she prowled from Formosa to Nagasaki. The submarine tracked a convoy of 11 ships and fired a spread of torpedoes at a large freighter on 6 June. One torpedo hit the target but proved to be a dud, and another passed under the freighter and hit an escort. Two weeks later, she fired a spread at four ships. One was hit in the stern and sank in approximately nine minutes. This was &quot;Shojin Maru&quot; loaded with troops. &quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Midway Island on 8 July and, four days later, steamed into Pearl Harbor.

Her next patrol was from 14 August–15 September. This patrol, in the East China Sea, was also ended prematurely due to firing all torpedoes. She sank 12,996 tons of enemy shipping, excluding two 75-ton sampans sunk by shellfire. &quot;Seawolf&quot; made contact with a six-ship convoy on her third day in the patrol area. She attacked day and night for three days before finally surfacing to sink &quot;Fusei Maru&quot; with her deck gun.

====Eleventh through fourteenth war patrols====
On &quot;Seawolf&quot;″s 11th patrol, in the South China Sea from 5 October–27 November, she sank &quot;Wuhu Maru&quot;, &quot;Kaifuku Maru&quot;, and damaged a 10,000-ton cargo ship. The submarine refitted at Pearl Harbor, and on 22 December 1943, headed for the East China Sea on what was to be her most lucrative patrol. She attacked a seven-ship convoy on the night of 10–11 January 1944 and sank three ships totaling 19,710 tons.

On 14 January, &quot;Seawolf&quot; fired her last four torpedoes at two merchant ships in a convoy, damaging one and sinking &quot;Yamatsuru Maru&quot;. She continued tracking the convoy while radioing its position to . &quot;Whale&quot; arrived on 16 January and promptly attacked, damaging one ship and sinking &quot;Denmark Maru&quot;. The next morning, &quot;Whale&quot; damaged another before action was broken off.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 January and sailed for San Francisco two days later. After undergoing a major overhaul at Hunters Point, the submarine headed west on 16 May, with Lieutenant Commander Richard Barr Lynch in command. When she reached Pearl Harbor, she was assigned the task of photographing Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, in preparation for the forthcoming attack on that stronghold. She carried out this mission despite constant enemy air patrols from 4 June–7 July.

The submarine headed to Majuro for voyage repairs and was rerouted to Darwin. There, she received orders sending her on a special mission to Tawitawi, in the Sulu Archipelago. The submarine approached to within of the beach, offloaded supplies and men, picked up a Captain Frank Young, an Allied Intelligence Bureau coast watcher, and took him to Brisbane. The operation order also called for &quot;Seawolf&quot; to land a party and their supplies on northern Palawan Island.

====Fifteenth war patrol and loss====
&quot;Seawolf&quot; stood out of Brisbane on 21 September to begin her 15th war patrol under the command of Lieutenant Commander Albert Marion Bontier. She reached Manus Island on 29 September, refueled, and sailed the same day carrying stores and Army personnel to the east coast of Samar.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; and exchanged radar recognition signals at 0756 on 3 October in the Morotai area. Shortly thereafter, a 7th Fleet task group was attacked by . The destroyer escort was torpedoed and sunk, and began to search for the enemy.

Since there were four friendly submarines in the vicinity of this attack, they were directed to give their positions and the other three did, but &quot;Seawolf&quot; was not heard from. On 4 October, &quot;Seawolf&quot; again was directed to report her position, and again she failed to do so. One of two planes from the escort carrier sighted a submarine submerging and dropped two bombs on it even though it was in a safety zone for American submarines. The site was marked by dye. &quot;Rowell&quot;″s commanding officer knew he was in a safety lane, but, having failed to get word &quot;Seawolf&quot; was behind schedule, believed there was no U.S. submarine nearby and chose to attack. &quot;Rowell&quot; established sonar contact on the submarine, which then sent a series of dashes and dots which &quot;Rowell&quot; stated bore no resemblance to the existing recognition signals. Believing this an attempt to jam her sonar, &quot;Rowell&quot; attacked with Hedgehog. The second attack was followed by underwater explosions, and debris rose to the surface.

On 28 December 1944, &quot;Seawolf&quot; was declared overdue from patrol and presumed lost. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 January 1945.

Post-war examination of Japanese records shows no attack listed that could account for the loss of &quot;Seawolf&quot;. While it is possible &quot;Seawolf&quot; was lost to an operational casualty or as a result of an unrecorded enemy attack, it is more likely she was sunk by friendly fire. 83 officers and men as well as 17 Army passengers were lost. She was the thirty-fourth U.S. submarine lost in the Pacific War, the second to friendly fire. One of the Army passengers was Captain Howell S. Kopp, an Alamo Scout. Kopp was en route to an undisclosed location in the Philippines to conduct a clandestine mission in support of the upcoming Allied landing on Leyte.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; ranked fourteenth in confirmed tonnage sunk (71,609 tons), the most for a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine. She tied for seventh with the submarines and in confirmed ships sunk, according to the postwar accounting of the Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC).

==Commemoration==
The contributions and sacrifices of &quot;Seawolf&quot; and her crew are officially commemorated in Seawolf Park, located on Pelican Island, just north of Galveston, Texas.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Seawolf&quot; is one of several submarines (along with the era&#x27;s USS &quot;Tang&quot;, &quot;Bowfin&quot;, &quot;Growler&quot;, and &quot;Spadefish&quot;) whose war patrols can be re-enacted in the 1985 MicroProse computer game &quot;Silent Service&quot; and the game&#x27;s various ports, including Konami&#x27;s 1989 release for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

<text>USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; (SSN-575) was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seawolf, the second nuclear submarine, and the only US submarine built with a liquid metal cooled (sodium), beryllium-moderated nuclear reactor, the S2G. Her overall design (known as SCB 64A) was a variant of , but with numerous detail changes, such as a conning tower, stepped sail, and the BQR-4 passive sonar mounted in the top portion of the bow instead of further below. This sonar arrangement resulted in an unusual bow shape above the water for a U.S. submarine. Originally laid down in 1953, her distinctive reactor was later replaced with a standard pressurized water reactor, the replacement process lasting from 12 December 1958 to 30 September 1960.

== Comparison to &quot;Nautilus&quot; ==

&quot;Seawolf&quot; was the same basic &quot;double hull&quot; twin-screw submarine design as her predecessor , but her propulsion system was more technologically advanced. The Submarine Intermediate Reactor (SIR) nuclear plant was designed by General Electric&#x27;s Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory and prototyped in West Milton, New York. The prototype plant was eventually designated S1G and &quot;Seawolf&quot;″s plant as S2G.

The Atomic Energy Commission historians&#x27; account of the sodium-cooled reactor experience was:
 The S2G reactor was replaced with a pressurized water reactor similar to &quot;Nautilus&quot; and designated S2Wa, the replacement process lasting from 12 December 1958 to 30 September 1960.

Although fully armed, &quot;Seawolf&quot;, like the first nuclear submarine, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, was primarily an experimental vessel. &quot;Seawolf&quot; was originally thought of publicly as a hunter-killer submarine, but in fact was intended to be a one-off test platform for the SIR (aka S2G) LMFR reactor and future sonar platforms. Her future uses, after the reactor plant was replaced with a light water system, included covert operations in foreign waters, for which she was converted January 1971 – June 1973.

== Initial construction ==
&quot;Seawolf&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down 7 September 1953, by the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 21 July 1955 sponsored by Mary Elizabeth (Thomas) Cole, wife of New York Congressman W. Sterling Cole, and commissioned on 30 March 1957.
Like all of the original nuclear subs, the project manager at Electric Boat was the general manager of the company, Bill Jones. During the parallel construction of the first nuclear submarines, the Navy, the Atomic Energy Commission, its independent labs, and the shipyard all worked together to learn together.

For the yard, the Power Plant Project manager was a separate function on these original nuclear subs. Dennis B. Boykin III would lead EB&#x27;s power plant installation, and return to the project two years later for the reactor conversion. His counterpart at the Office of Naval Reactors, Gardner Brown, did the same.

Lieutenant James Earl &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carter, the only US President to qualify in submarines, was to be her Engineering Officer, but had resigned his commission upon the death of his father in 1953.

== 1957–1959 ==
&quot;Seawolf&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 2 April for her shakedown cruise off Bermuda and returned on 8 May. Between 16 May and 5 August, she made two voyages to Key West and participated in intensive training exercises. On 3 September, she steamed across the North Atlantic to participate in NATO exercises. The submarine surfaced off Newport, Rhode Island, on 25 September after cruising nonstop. The next day, President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower embarked and was taken for a short cruise onboard her.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; cruised to the Caribbean Sea for an exercise in November. In December, she began an availability period that lasted until 6 February 1958. She then participated in exercises along the east coast until early August.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; submerged on 7 August and did not surface again until 6 October. During this period, she logged over . She received the Navy Unit Commendation for demonstrating the ability of the nuclear-powered submarine to remain independent of the atmosphere for the period of a normal war patrol.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 12 December 1958, for conversion of her power plant from a S2G sodium-cooled LMFR to a S2Wa PWR. She was out of commission until 30 September 1960. The Office of Naval Reactors had determined that the unique superheated steam powerplant was too difficult to maintain, since the superheaters were rarely operational. Constructed of rolled steel (vs forged steel), the superheaters were usually unable to allow the plant to operate at full capacity.

On 18 April 1959, the Navy disposed of the radioactive S2G plant by sealing it in a high stainless steel containment vessel, towing it out to sea on a barge, and then sinking the barge at a point about due east of Maryland in of water. Twenty-one years later, the Navy was unable to relocate the container, but said that the radioactive materials inside should decay before the containment vessel deteriorated.

== 1960–1966 ==

&quot;Seawolf&quot; began a three-week period of independent operations on 25 October, and returned to fleet operations in November and December. On 9 January 1961, &quot;Seawolf&quot; sailed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to participate in local operations. On 25 January, she was ordered to locate and track the Portuguese passenger liner &quot;Santa Maria&quot; which had been seized by pirates two days earlier. The submarine made contact with the liner off the coast of Brazil on 1 February. After &quot;Santa Maria&quot; surrendered in Recife, the submarine returned to San Juan and continued east coast operations.

On 7 July, &quot;Seawolf&quot; began a two-month oceanographic voyage which took her to Portsmouth, England, before returning the vessel to New London on 19 September 1961.

In 1963, &quot;Seawolf&quot; participated in the search for the lost submarine and in various local and fleet operations until April 1964. On 28 April, &quot;Seawolf&quot; stood out of New London en route to the Mediterranean Sea and a -month deployment with the Sixth Fleet. During the period, she operated with aircraft carrier , guided missile cruiser , and guided missile destroyer as a part of the world&#x27;s first nuclear task force. More local East Coast exercises followed until 5 May 1965. On that date, the submarine entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for refueling and an extensive overhaul bringing her up to the SUBSAFE standard put in place after the loss of &quot;Thresher&quot;. This overhaul lasted until September 1966.

== 1967–1973 ==

&quot;Seawolf&quot; sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 24 August 1967 for New London, Connecticut, which was again her home port. The following month, she sailed to the Caribbean Sea for refresher training and weapons trials. She had to have a propeller replaced at Charleston, South Carolina, in early October and then conducted sea trials in the Bahama Islands for the remainder of the month. The end of the year 1967 found her back at her home port.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; was operating from that port when she grounded off the coast of Maine on 30 January 1968, badly crushing her stern. She was towed back to New London, Connecticut, for repairs and did not put to sea again until 20 March 1969, when she began sea trials. The submarine was in the Caribbean Sea during June and July conducting underwater sound and weapons systems tests. &quot;Seawolf&quot; was deployed with the Sixth Fleet from 29 September to 21 December 1969.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; operated along the East Coast until 9 November 1970 when her home port was changed to Vallejo, California, and she sailed for the West Coast. The submarine transited the Panama Canal on 17 November and changed operational control to Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. In the Pacific, Seawolf would serve as a &quot;spy submarine&quot;, trailing other submarines, retrieving test weapons from the seabed, and tapping Soviet submarine communications cables.

Upon arrival at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, she entered drydock on 8 January 1971 for overhaul and conversion to a special project platform. The sense of the euphemistic &#x27;special project platform&#x27; can be gleaned from photos of the ships from before and after the renovation. The hull extension forward of the sail held intelligence gathering equipment that supported covert operations, including an &quot;aquarium&quot; for launching variable depth sonar and retrieval equipment. For precise maneuvering, she gained jet thrusters. A saturation diver lockout was installed inside the hull, and a new gondola underneath the hull held retractable &quot;skegs&quot; (short for &quot;sea keeping legs&quot;) for bottom station keeping. The ship remained there until 21 June 1973, when she moved up the coast to Bangor, Washington. She would remain a special projects boat until
decommissioning.

&quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to Mare Island on 4 September 1973. But despite the frequent rebuilds, age was beginning to wear on the craft. Records describe frequent fires and reactor scrams, life-support oxygenation failures, and crewmembers on speed to maintain stamina.

== 1974–1978 ==

In 1974, &quot;Seawolf&quot; completed post-conversion testing and evaluation period and conducted her first Pacific Fleet deployment, operating independently for a period of three months. For its performance of duty, she was awarded a second Navy Unit Commendation. In 1975, &quot;Seawolf&quot; came under the exclusive direction of Submarine Development Group One, and for outstanding performance in 1974–1975, was awarded a Battle Efficiency &quot;E.&quot;

In 1976, &quot;Seawolf&quot; received her second consecutive Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; and the Engineering &quot;E&quot; for Excellence. During her second Pacific Fleet deployment, she conducted independent submerged operations for three months and demonstrated superior endurance by remaining submerged for 89 consecutive days, a U.S. Navy record. She received her third Navy Unit Commendation.

In 1977, &quot;Seawolf&quot; received her third Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; and her second Engineering &quot;E&quot; for Excellence. During her third Pacific Fleet deployment, she conducted 79 consecutive days of independent submerged operations and received her fourth Navy Unit Commendation and the Navy Expeditionary Medal. In 1978, &quot;Seawolf&quot; conducted her fourth Pacific Fleet deployment.

== 1980–1987 ==
In February 1980, a turbine generator failed during sea trials, sending the ship back to drydock for a year.

In August 1981, &quot;Seawolf&quot; deployed on her fifth Pacific Fleet deployment. By that point, the struggles to maintain the aged boat had stressed crew morale close to breaking. Between missions, crewmembers had participated in makeshift target practice on mudflats near the base, or indulged in recreational marijuana contrary to naval regulations (and possibly as a scheme to make themselves ineligible for duty). Nevertheless, the boat proceeded to tap a submarine communications cable in the Sea of Okhotsk, where she found herself trapped by an extreme storm. Although most submarines are isolated from surface weather by boundary layer effects, the typhoon was sufficiently strong to shake &quot;Seawolf&quot; so that her skegs dug into the seabed, and clog the reactor heat exchanger with sand. In freeing herself, the ship ripped away from the underbelly gondola, leaving interior parts free to bang against the hull. Without classic submarine silence, the submarine was easily detected by a Soviet fishing trawler, but managed to outlast the ship into international waters. &quot;Seawolf&quot; returned to homeport in October 1981, and received the Navy Expeditionary Medal.

In 1983, &quot;Seawolf&quot; conducted her sixth Pacific Fleet deployment of 76 days and returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in May 1983. She was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal, another Battle Efficiency &quot;E,&quot; another Engineering &quot;E,&quot; a Supply &quot;E,&quot; and a Damage Control &quot;DC.&quot; In 1984, &quot;Seawolf&quot; conducted a 93-day deployment to the Western Pacific, returned in July, and continued her high operating tempo with numerous local operations. She was awarded her third consecutive Supply &quot;E,&quot; a Communications &quot;C,&quot; and the Deck Seamanship Award.

In April 1986, &quot;Seawolf&quot; conducted her last Western Pacific deployment and returned to Mare Island in June 1986 to prepare for decommissioning. Decommissioned 30 March 1987, &quot;Seawolf&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the following 10 July. The former submarine began the Navy&#x27;s Ship-Submarine Recycling Program on 1 October 1996 and completed it on 30 September 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; (SSN-21) is a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine and the lead ship of her class. She is the fourth submarine of the United States Navy named for the seawolf.

==Construction==
The contract to build &quot;Seawolf&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics on 9 January 1989 and her keel was laid down on 25 October 1989. She was launched on 24 June 1995, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Dalton, and commissioned on 19 July 1997. The 7-year 9-month time period from keel laying to commissioning is the longest for a submarine in the U.S. Navy.

Adding support personnel as well as ship&#x27;s crew, there are 140 personnel assigned or attached to &quot;Seawolf&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Seawolf&quot; is featured in a 1998 episode of the documentary &quot;Super Structures of the World: Seawolf&quot;. The program followed her construction and sea trials.

On 22 July 2007, &quot;Seawolf&quot; transferred from her previous homeport of Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, to Naval Base Kitsap, Washington.
In 2015, &quot;Seawolf&quot; was deployed to the Arctic region for six months.

In July 2020 &quot;Seawolf&quot; deployed into the Arctic area of responsibility. She conducted special operations and pulled into multiple European ports. Port calls included HMNB Clyde in Faslane Scotland, and Gibraltar, and briefly in Tromsø, Norway. &quot;Seawolf&quot;″s deployment was the first US Navy deployment during the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>The Indian Removal Act of 1830 was signed into law on May 28, 1830, by United States President Andrew Jackson. The law, as described by Congress, provided &quot;for an exchange of lands with the Indians residing in any of the states or territories, and for their removal east of the river Mississippi&quot;. During the presidency of Jackson (1829–1837) and his successor Martin Van Buren (1837–1841), more than 60,000 Native Americans from at least 18 tribes were forced to move west of the Mississippi River where they were allocated new lands. The southern tribes were resettled mostly in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). The northern tribes were resettled initially in Kansas. With a few exceptions, the United States east of the Mississippi and south of the Great Lakes was emptied of its Native American population. The movement westward of indigenous tribes was characterized by a large number of deaths occasioned by the hardships of the journey.

The U.S. Congress approved the Act by a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. The Indian Removal Act was supported by President Jackson and the Democratic Party, southern and white settlers, and several state governments, especially that of Georgia. Indigenous tribes and the Whig Party opposed the bill, as did other groups within white American society (e.g., some Christian missionaries and clergy). Legal efforts to allow Indian tribes to remain on their land in the eastern U.S. failed. Most famously, the Cherokee (excluding the Treaty Party) challenged their relocation, but were unsuccessful in the courts; they were forcibly removed by the United States government in a march to the west that later became known as the Trail of Tears. Since the 21st century, scholars have cited the act and subsequent removals as an early example of state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing or genocide or settler colonialism; some view it as all three.

==Background==
===History of European cultural assimilation in the New World ===

Many European colonists saw Native Americans as savages. However, euro-native relations varied, particularly between the French and British colonies. New France, which was established in the Great Lakes region, generally pursued a cooperative relationship with the Native tribes, with the existence of certain traditions such as marriage à la façon du pays, a marriage between tradesmen (&quot;coureur des bois&quot;) and Native women. This tradition was seen as a fundamental social and political institution that helped maintain relations and bond the two cultures. Many of the missionaries were also known to teach the tribes how to use iron tools, build European-style homes, and improve farming techniques; teachings the Wyandot, who maintained a century long friendship with French Canadians, would spread on to other tribes as they relocated to the Maumee Valley. Throughout the 17th and 18th century during the Beaver and French and Indian Wars, the greatest number of and most powerful tribes tended to side with the French, though other tribes such as the Iroquois supported the British for various strategic reasons. For strategic economic and military purposes, the French also had a practice of building forts and trading posts within Native villages, such as that of Fort Miami in Indiana within the Miami village of Kekionga. However, the belief in European cultural and racial superiority was generally widespread among high ranking colonial officials and clergymen in this period.

During and after the colonial history of the United States, many white settlers felt their civilization to be superior to that of the Indians as a result of being Christians. The settlers also believed their notions of private property to be a superior system of land tenure. Colonial and frontier encroachers inflicted a practice of cultural assimilation, meaning that tribes such as the Cherokee were forced to adopt aspects of white civilization. This acculturation was originally proposed by George Washington and was well underway among the Cherokee and the Choctaw by the beginning of the 19th century. Native peoples were encouraged to adopt European customs. First, they were forced to convert to Christianity and abandon traditional religious practices. They were also required to learn to speak and read English, although there was interest in creating a writing and printing system for a few Native languages, especially Cherokee, exemplified by Sequoyah&#x27;s Cherokee syllabary. The Native Americans also had to adopt settler values, such as monogamous marriage and abandon non-marital sex. Finally, they had to accept the concept of individual ownership of land and other property (including, in some instances, African people as slaves). Many Cherokee people adopted all, or some, of these practices, including Cherokee chief John Ross, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot, as represented by the newspaper he edited, The Cherokee Phoenix.

===Perceived failure of the policy===
Despite the adoption of white cultural values by many natives and tribes, the United States government began a systematic effort to remove Native peoples from the Southeast. The Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee-Creek, Seminole, and original Cherokee nations had been established as autonomous nations in the southeastern United States.

Andrew Jackson sought to renew a policy of political and military action for the removal of Natives from these lands and worked toward enacting a law for &quot;Indian removal&quot;. In his 1829 State of the Union address, Jackson called for Indian removal.

The Indian Removal Act was put in place to annex Native land and then transfer that ownership to Southern states, especially Georgia. The Act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the federal government concerning the possibility of such an act. Ethan Davis states that &quot;the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state&#x27;s borders by purchase &#x27;as soon as the such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms&#x27;&quot;. As time passed, Southern states began to speed up the expulsions by claiming that the deal between Georgia and the federal government was invalid and that Southern states could pass laws extinguishing Indian title themselves. In response, the federal government passed the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi River into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.

In the 1823 case of &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;, the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision stating that Indians could occupy and control lands within the United States but could not hold title to those lands. Jackson viewed the union as a federation of highly esteemed states, as was common before the American Civil War. He opposed Washington&#x27;s policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were sovereign foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed he could only accommodate the desire for Native self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement on Federal lands west of the Mississippi River.

==Support and opposition==
The Removal Act was strongly supported in the South, especially in Georgia, which was the largest state in 1802 and was involved in a jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokee. President Jackson hoped that removal would resolve the Georgia crisis. Besides the Five Civilized Tribes, additional people affected included the Wyandot, the Kickapoo, the Potowatomi, the Shawnee, and the Lenape.

The Indian Removal Act was controversial. Many Americans during this time favored its passage, but there was also significant opposition. Many Christian missionaries protested against it, most notably missionary organizer Jeremiah Evarts. In Congress, New Jersey Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen, Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, and Tennessee Congressman Davy Crockett spoke out against the legislation. The Removal Act passed only after a bitter debate in Congress. Clay extensively campaigned against it on the National Republican Party ticket in the 1832 United States presidential election.

Jackson viewed the demise of Native nations as inevitable, pointing to the steady expansion of European-based lifestyles and the decimation of Native nations in the U.S.&#x27;s northeast region. He called his Northern critics hypocrites, given the North&#x27;s history regarding Native nations within their claimed territory. Jackson stated that &quot;progress requires moving forward.&quot;

Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country and philanthropy has long been busily employed in devising means to avert it, but its progress never has for a moment been arrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth... But true philanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one generation to make room for another... In the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes… Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers. What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization, and religion?

According to historian H. W. Brands, Jackson sincerely believed that his population transfer was a &quot;wise and humane policy&quot; that would save the Native Americans from &quot;utter annihilation&quot;. Jackson portrayed the removal as a paternalistic act of mercy.

According to Robert M. Keeton, proponents of the bill used biblical narratives to justify the forced resettlement of Native Americans.

==Vote==
On April 24, 1830, the Senate passed the Indian Removal Act by a vote of 28 to 19. On May 26, 1830, the House of Representatives passed the Act by a vote of 101 to 97. On May 28, 1830, the Indian Removal Act was signed into law by President Andrew Jackson.

Historian Garry Wills has speculated that without the additional slave state votes in the House of Representatives due to the Three-Fifths Compromise, &quot;slavery would have been excluded from Missouri ... Jackson&#x27;s Indian removal policy would have failed ... the Wilmot Proviso would have banned slavery in territories won from Mexico ... the Kansas-Nebraska bill would have failed.&quot;

==Implementation==

The Removal Act paved the way for the forced expulsion of tens of thousands of American Indians from their land into the West in an event widely known as the &quot;Trail of Tears,&quot; a forced resettlement of the Indian population. This forced resettlement has been characterized as a genocide. The first removal treaty signed was the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek on September 27, 1830, in which Choctaws in Mississippi ceded land east of the river in exchange for payment and land in the West. The Treaty of New Echota was signed in 1835 and resulted in the removal of the Cherokee on the Trail of Tears.

The Seminoles and other tribes did not leave peacefully, as they resisted the removal along with fugitive slaves. The Second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842 and resulted in the government allowing them to remain in south Florida swampland. Only a small number remained, and around 3,000 were removed in the war.

==Historical legacy==
In the 21st century, scholars have cited the act and subsequent removals as an early example of state sanctioned ethnic cleansing or genocide or settler colonialism or as all three Forms of these. Historian Richard White wrote that because of &quot;claimed parallels between ethnic cleansing and Indian removal, any examination of Indian removal will inevitably involve discussions of ethnic cleansing.&quot; Other scholarship has focused on the historical comparisons between the United States concept of manifest destiny and Nazi Germany&#x27;s concept of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and how American removal policy served as a model for racial policy during &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;.

An alternative view posits that the Indian Removal Act, despite the deaths and forced relocation, benefitted the removed peoples by saving their societies from a worse fate that likely awaited them were they to remain in their home territories to face a mass influx of settlers that the federal government was unable to prevent. As Robert V. Remini stated:Jackson genuinely believed that what he had accomplished rescued these people from inevitable annihilation. And although that statement sounds monstrous, and although no one in the modern world wishes to accept or believe it, that is exactly what he did. He saved the Five Civilized Nations from probable extinction. Similarly, historian Francis Paul Prucha argued that removal was the best of the four options that presented themselves, the other three being genocide, assimilation into white culture, and protection of tribal lands against settler encroachment, the last of which Prucha, like Remini, saw as unachievable.

<text>Information economy is an economy with an increased emphasis on informational activities and information industry, where information is valued as a capital good. The term was coined by Marc Porat, a graduate student at Stanford University, who would later co-found General Magic.

Manuel Castells states that information economy is not mutually exclusive with manufacturing economy. He finds that some countries such as Germany and Japan exhibit the informatization of manufacturing processes. In a typical conceptualization, however, information economy is considered a &quot;stage&quot; or &quot;phase&quot; of an economy, coming after stages of hunting, agriculture, and manufacturing. This conceptualization can be widely observed regarding information society, a closely related but wider concept.

There are numerous characterizations of the transformations some economies have undergone. Service economy, high-tech economy, late-capitalism, post-Fordism, and global economy are among the most frequently used terms, having some overlaps and contradictions among themselves. Closer terms to information economy would include knowledge economy.

==Knowledge workers==

In &quot;The Effective Executive&quot; by Peter Drucker, Drucker describes the manual worker (page 2) who works with his hands and produces &quot;stuff&quot;. The knowledge worker (page 3) works with his head and produces ideas, knowledge, and information.

<text>Hugh Harman (August 31, 1903 – November 25, 1982) was an American animator. He was known for creating the Warner Bros. Cartoons and MGM Cartoons studios and his collaboration with Rudolf Ising during the Golden Age of American animation. 
==Career==
He began his work with Walt Disney in 1922, working on Disney&#x27;s early Laugh-O-Gram Cartoons. When that company went bankrupt, Harman and partner Rudolf Ising tried to start a new series based on the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, but were unable to obtain funding. Disney called them back when he began work for Charles Mintz, producing the Alice Comedies live-action/animation hybrid shorts and the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons. 

After a dispute over money, Mintz forced out Disney in 1928 and lured most of his animators, Harman and Ising included, to join him. After Carl Laemmle replaced Mintz with a young Walter Lantz in early 1929, Harman and Ising, alongside a number of former Oswald animators put together a pilot short, &quot;Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid&quot;, featuring a character Harman created in 1928 as sound films were becoming popular. The short gained them a contract with Warner Brothers studios to produce animated cartoons with Leon Schlesinger as manager. Harman and Ising started the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons in 1930 and 1931, respectively (Harman would direct the Looney Tune shorts), and produced them until 1933. Following a number of clashes with Schlesinger over budgets, they decided to leave WB and look for another distributor. Harman and Ising took Bosko with them, having previously copyrighted him to avoid facing the same situation Disney had with Oswald. In the meantime, Harman-Ising Pictures outsourced a number of Cubby Bear cartoons for The Van Beuren Corporation.

===MGM Cartoons and later career===
In early 1934, Harman and Ising were hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which launched the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; series in color (incidentally replacing fellow 1920s-era Disney veteran Ub Iwerks), in which Harman redeveloped Bosko into a realistic African-American kid. After yet another money-related quarrel, Harman and Ising were fired by MGM in 1937, being replaced by an in-house cartoon studio headed by Fred Quimby. That same year, Disney borrowed the Harman-Ising Ink and Paint unit for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and the studio also outsourced a number of cartoons for the Silly Symphonies series, although Disney ultimately only accepted &quot;Merbabies&quot;, the other shorts being released by MGM in early 1938, which after a rocky start with the in-house studio, decided to take Harman and Ising back some time later as production supervisors.

After leaving Metro in 1941, Harman founded a new studio with Disney veteran Mel Shaw. In 1943, the duo signed a deal with Orson Welles to adapt &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, in which Welles would play the role of the aviator while a random child actor would portray the prince. A few months later, Welles fell ill with hepatitis, nearly dying while recovering in Florida. After this, the deal fell through and the film was scrapped.

From 1945 to 1947, Harman&#x27;s production company would produce various cartoons for the army and for educational films. After a two year hiatus, Harman returned to the animation industry with &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot;, a collaboration between his company and Coronet Films. He also wrote the Woody Woodpecker short Convict Concerto. Harman&#x27;s final film (albeit incomplete and entirely shipped to Coronet, completed by Gordon A. Sheehan) was Tom Thumb in King Arthur&#x27;s Court. Harman worked on the film extensively with Mel Shaw, but ultimately gave production to Coronet because he couldn&#x27;t complete it.

==Later life==
After Harman-Ising Studios closed in 1960, Harman fell in a state of abject poverty. He lived in a ramshackle house, no longer being able to afford a car, although he often disguised his precarious state by frequently having breakfast at a Beverly Hills restaurant. He had to constantly borrow money from Ising, as well as colleagues Friz Freleng and Roy O. Disney in the 1970s to keep afloat. He also received a monthly allowance from his brother Fred, until Fred&#x27;s death in January 1982. After that point, Harman was moved into a house on Chatsworth, the rent being paid by his friends, among them animator Mark Kausler and historian Jim Korkis, who had both met Harman through Bob Clampett in 1973. 

On November 25, 1982, Harman died after a long illness in his home. He was survived by his son Michael. Harman was married twice, both times ending in divorce. His second wife was a Greek woman named Katia who married him in 1980 but left him soon after gaining her citizenship.

<text>Midi-Pyrénées (; or ; ) is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it has been part of the new region of Occitania. It was the largest region of Metropolitan France by area, larger than the Netherlands or Denmark.

Midi-Pyrénées has no historical or geographical unity. It is one of the regions of France created in the late 20th century to serve as a hinterland and zone of influence for its capital, Toulouse, one of a handful of so-called &quot;balancing metropolises&quot; (&quot;métropoles d&#x27;équilibre&quot;). Another example of this is the region of Rhône-Alpes which was created as the region for Lyon.

== Geographical composition ==


Historically, Midi-Pyrénées is made up of several former French provinces:

* 24.2% of the Midi-Pyrénées territory formed part of Gascony: western half of Haute-Garonne department, southwest of Tarn-et-Garonne, Gers in its entirety, extreme north of Hautes-Pyrénées. Gascony here includes the province of Comminges, which historically was a Pyrenean province, but later expanded all the way north to Muret in the southern suburbs of Toulouse, then was fragmented, and became an eastern fringe of Gascony. Gascony also extends over the Aquitaine region.
* 23.4% of Midi-Pyrénées was part of Languedoc: the eastern half of Haute-Garonne, southeast of Tarn-et-Garonne, Tarn in its entirety, northwest and northeast of Ariège. Languedoc includes the sub-province of Albigeois (Tarn department), which is sometimes considered as a province separate from Languedoc. Languedoc also extends over the Languedoc-Roussillon region.
* 19.9% of Midi-Pyrénées was formerly Rouergue: Aveyron department in its entirety, and extreme east of Tarn-et-Garonne. The former province of Rouergue lay entirely within the modern Midi-Pyrénées.
* 15.4% of Midi-Pyrénées was Quercy: department of Lot in its entirety, and northern half of Tarn-et-Garonne. The province of Quercy was entirely contained inside Midi-Pyrénées.
* 16.6% of Midi-Pyrénées was a collection of small Pyrenean provinces, from east to west: the County of Foix (eastern half of Ariège), Couserans (western half of Ariège), Nébouzan (extreme south of Haute-Garonne and extreme east of Hautes-Pyrénées), Quatre-Vallées (i.e. &quot;Four Valleys&quot;) (east of Hautes-Pyrénées), and Bigorre (west and center of Hautes-Pyrénées). All these provinces are entirely contained inside Midi-Pyrénées.
* 0.5% of Midi-Pyrénées is Agenais: extreme west of Tarn-et-Garonne. Agenais extends essentially over the Aquitaine region.

The historical makeup of Midi-Pyrénées is even more complex, as the provinces listed here are further subdivided into &quot;pays&quot;–used interchangeably in French for &quot;country&quot;, &quot;area&quot;, &quot;land&quot;, etc.–each with its own particular identity, such as Armagnac, Astarac, or Lomagne inside the Gascogne part of Midi-Pyrénées, Lauragais or Volvestre inside the Languedoc part of Midi-Pyrénées, Bonezan inside County of Foix, Lavedan inside Bigorre, and so on.

The Pyrenean provinces of Couserans, Nébouzan, Quatre-Vallées, and Bigorre (but not the County of Foix) are sometimes considered to be part of Gascony. These provinces were all formed from the old Roman province of Novempopulana, later known as &quot;Vasconia&quot; (because of the Basque influence), and later as Gascony, from which they seceded over time. Furthermore, after the 16th century these Pyrenean provinces were made part of the military region of Gascony, and later in the 18th century they were ruled from Auch by the intendant of Auch, as with the rest of Gascony. If these Pyrenean provinces are included inside Gascony, then 35.4% of Midi-Pyrénées is Gascony, outweighing Languedoc and its 23.4%.

This point is still a matter of debate. The Pyrenean provinces developed strong peculiarities over time, protected by their isolated valleys, and they looked quite distinct from the rest of Gascony. What&#x27;s more, Bigorre, Quatre-Vallées, Nébouzan, and even Comminges kept their provincial states until the French Revolution, while Gascony had no provincial states. These Pyrenean provinces sent their representatives to the Estates-General of 1789 in Versailles at the beginning of the Revolution, whereas the various other parts of Gascony sent their own representatives.

In demographic terms, given the overwhelming demographic weight of Toulouse (located in the historical Languedoc), the majority of the inhabitants of Midi-Pyrénées live in the Languedoc part of Midi-Pyrénées. As a matter of fact, the historical flag of Languedoc, the Occitan cross, was adopted as the official flag of the Midi-Pyrénées region by the regional council. This historic flag design is itself derived from the coat of arms of the old county of Toulouse.

=== Elements of unity ===
In the Middle Ages, most of what is now Midi-Pyrénées was ruled at some time or another by the Count of Toulouse (except for Hautes-Pyrénées and the west of Gers), either directly or through vassals (such as in the case of Foix). After the French conquest in the 13th century, the county of Toulouse was dismantled, and eventually Languedoc was born as a remnant of the old county, but quite smaller than it. Nonetheless, until the French Revolution the &quot;Parlement&quot; (supreme court of justice) of Toulouse extended its jurisdiction over not just Languedoc, but also all the other territories that are now Midi-Pyrénées. Thus, towns like Tarbes (Bigorre), Auch (Gascony), or Rodez (Rouergue) were already under the jurisdiction of Toulouse before the Revolution, although only for judicial and legal matters.

==== Demographics ====
In terms of population Midi-Pyrénées is again a region of sharp contrasts. While the metropolitan area of Toulouse at the center of the region is a densely populated area, in some places reaching 3,500 inhabitants per km2 (9,000 inhabitants per sq. mile), the rest of the region is sparsely populated, with densities ranging from 12 to 60 inh. per km2 (31 to 155 inh. per sq. mile), which are among the lowest densities in western Europe. 

The territory now comprising Midi-Pyrénées was divided in two by its traditional dialects of Occitan, Languedocian and Gascon, with Toulouse lying by the limit between the two, on the Languedocian side. Gascon (in its several local variants: Bearnese, Aranese) was traditionally spoken in the west and southwest of the region: Gascony, Bigorre, Quatre Vallées, Nébouzan, Comminges, Couserans. While other variants of Occitan (but primarily Languedocian) was spoken in the east and northeast of the region: Languedoc, Rouergue, Quercy, and Comté de Foix.

Today, French is dominant throughout the region; Midi-Pyrénées is unlike Catalonia or northern Wales, where the regional languages are still very much part of everyday life in urban areas at least. Occitan was used on a daily basis in the Garonne and Tarn valleys until the beginning of the 20th century. More distant and isolated regions resisted longer, and as late as in the 1970s it was still possible to hear Occitan in the farmer markets of Gascony or Rouergue. Nonetheless, even there, changes in the last 30 years of the 20th century were dramatic, despite regional efforts to revive the language by teaching it in schools (calandretas). Today, Languedocian Occitan is essentially only spoken by the older people in the distant areas of Quercy, Rouergue, and the County of Foix, and Gascon is only spoken by older people in distant areas of Gascony and the Pyrenees valleys. The regional channel France 3 broadcasts programs in Occitan (but not its Gascon dialect) a few hours per week. Speakers of Gascon complain of the hegemony of Languedocian Occitan and its cultural center of Toulouse, and some followers of a self-proclaimed linguist, Lafitte, even reject the classification of Gascon as a dialect of Occitan.

Today, although the daily use of regional languages of Midi-Pyrénées is greatly diminished, they have left a strong imprint on the French language used in the region. French in Midi-Pyrénées is spoken with a distinct southwestern pronunciation (with many variants from Rouergue, to Toulouse, to Bigorre). Moreover, people in Midi-Pyrénées use some words and expressions of Occitan origin which differ from those of standard French; these may not be easily understood outside southwest France.

The population in the metropolitan area of Toulouse is significantly younger and with a higher level of education than in the rest of Midi-Pyrénées. Outside Toulouse, Midi-Pyrénées is an aging region, which combines with a loss of population, as can be also seen in Limousin or other declining areas of France. Incomes are also rather high in the Toulouse metropolitan area, among the highest in France outside the metropolitan area of Paris, Lyon and Marseille whereas outside Toulouse incomes in Midi-Pyrénées are rather low, among the lowest in France.

The metropolitan area of Toulouse (1,000,000 inhabitants) far outweighs the second largest metropolitan area of Midi-Pyrénées, Tarbes, with only 110,000 inhabitants.

For all these reasons, Midi-Pyrénées is often dubbed &quot;Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenean desert&quot;, in reference to the famous phrase &quot;Paris and the French desert&quot; coined by the French geographer Jean-François Gravier in 1947, when it was felt that the ever-expanding urban area of Paris, so much larger than any other city in France, would soon attract all the French population and economy, turning the rest of the country into a desert. Residents elsewhere in Midi-Pyrénées at times complain of the overwhelming weight of Toulouse inside the region, and they resent the fact that so much is done for Toulouse by the regional council, turning the Midi-Pyrénées region into a &quot;Region of Toulouse&quot;. Indeed, the city of Toulouse adopted the Occitan flag as its official flag, thus Toulouse and Midi-Pyrénées currently share the same flag. Despite the controversy, most researchers agree that far from distracting resources and workers from the rest of the region, Toulouse is actually acting as a locomotive for the whole region. Without Toulouse, Midi-Pyrénées would probably be declining much more than it has in the recent decades, both demographically and culturally as well as economically.

==== Identity ====
Despite all these differences, it is wrong to assume that Midi-Pyrénées exists only on paper. Since the region was created in the 1970s, a certain sense of a &quot;Midi-Pyrenean&quot; identity has emerged. Inhabitants of the region share common cultural or social features, some of them not just particular to Midi-Pyrénées, but common to the whole of southwest France, such as an interest in Rugby union: the south-west of France is even called &quot;The Land of the Oval Ball&quot; (). There are images that come spontaneously to the mind of Midi-Pyrénées people when thinking about their region, such as the Airbus planes leaving their factories in Toulouse, the snowy peaks of the Pyrenees, or a game of rugby. These three images were used for some time by the regional council in video clips to promote the distinct identity of the region. The regional council has also played a key role in developing a network of motorways/freeways to bring all the different areas of Midi-Pyrénées together. As of 2005, there are seven motorways/freeways that radiate from Toulouse and link all the most distant corners of the region with its capital city (with two of these seven motorways/freeways only partly built and scheduled to be completed by 2010-2015). A network of Regional Express Trains was also set up by the regional council to ensure frequent train connections between the different parts of the region.

Perhaps more importantly, the dynamism of Toulouse, as well as the fact that many young people from Midi-Pyrénées move to Toulouse after high-school, means that the inhabitants of Midi-Pyrénées identify more and more with the regional capital, which acts as a strong bond between people and areas otherwise quite diverse. When traveling away from southern France, someone from Midi-Pyrénées will in most cases introduce oneself as coming &quot;from Toulouse&quot;. Unlike other régions of France, in Midi-Pyrénées there exists no other regional city that can rival Toulouse, so all turn toward Toulouse, which is seen as the cultural, economical, and political center.

An interesting phenomenon is that Midi-Pyrénées is one of the very few areas in France where young people, when thinking about &quot;making it&quot; in life, still prefer in their majority to move to their regional capital rather than to Paris with the Rhône-Alpes region around Lyon and maybe also the Bouches-du-Rhône around Marseille. In most other regions of France, such as Champagne-Ardenne, Centre, or even Burgundy, some of which exist more on paper than in reality, young people always prefer to move to Paris rather than to their regional capital. The phrase &quot;monter à Paris&quot; (literally &quot;to ascend to Paris&quot;) was even coined to describe this phenomenon of young people leaving their regions to move to Paris. Here, Midi-Pyrénées stands clearly apart, with Toulouse being largely favored by young people over Paris, which is another proof of the strong identity that has developed around the regional capital.
== Economy of Midi-Pyrénées ==
Midi-Pyrénées is the largest region of France. It occupies a strategic position between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. In 2006 its total GDP was $87.915 billion for a population of 2,755,000. It had a GDP per capita of $32,519 a year with an unemployment of 8.9%, the GDP per employment equal to $80,103 a year. The economy of Midi-Pyrénées can be divided into three sectors.

&quot;Primary sector&quot;: Because of its size &quot;Midi-Pyrénées&quot; has the largest number of farms of all France with 60,000 farms in active use. It has also the largest amount of land readily usable with 2.6 million hectares. This is however being reduced by both the increasing population and the CAP. The departments of the Gers, Aveyron, Lot and Tarn-et-Garonne have the most significant agricultural activity of the region. Wine production has suffered in recent years from declining demand, reducing prices and over-production. There are 19 &quot;AOC&quot; wines in the region. A policy of merging producers into wider groups has been initiated.

&quot;Secondary sector&quot;: The second largest part of the industrial production of the region is the food industry. 4.6bn Euros are generated each year from agriculture. It is however evolving as it received the fourth largest amount of foreign investment of France and is the region of France that created the largest number of enterprises in 2005 with 14,398 new enterprises. Excluding the construction and civil engineering field the secondary sector uses 15% of the regional resources. Several multinational companies are headquartered or have major offices in the region such as: Airbus, EADS, Alcatel, Siemens, Bosch and Pierre Fabre. The aerospace industry is an important source of income for the region and employs 57,000 people. Moreover, more than 3,000 suppliers form part of the engineering, electronic, telecommunication and computing infrastructure for this industry. However, there is a large restructuring plan ongoing and about 10,000 new jobs are expected to be lost outright and partners will be regrouped into larger entities.

&quot;Tertiary sector&quot;: The region has been behind the other French regions for a long time on services. However this has changed a lot in the recent years and there are many important consulting and telemarketing companies based in the area or with important offices, such as Orange, IBM and CapGemini. It is Toulouse, the largest city and capital, that currently concentrates the largest amount of employment however with the progressive extensions of transportation this has been grown considerably in recent years. In late 2006 a large plan was initiated to replace older train, the circulation of regional train has kept on increasing and has now reach the amount of ten million journeys each year. With 80,000 students and 15,000 scientists divided into 400 laboratories the region ranks in France&#x27;s top three for scientific research. Technology transfers to small-business-enterprises is therefore substantial. Tourism is an important source of incomes for the region, partly due to a sunny climate and the presence of the Pyrénées. It is well known for its gastronomy and quality of life. Aside of casual tourism the small town of Lourdes, because of religious pilgrimage, is France&#x27;s second largest tourist destination after Paris and has more hotels than any other city but Paris.

== Merger with Languedoc-Roussillon ==

The administrative division of France is currently in debate. Many think that the communes are too small and should be merged, that the departments are outdated and should disappear, and that the regions are too small and too numerous (22 in metropolitan France) and should be merged. Regarding Midi-Pyrénées, there are two thoughts:

* There are those who stress the Aquitainian nature of Midi-Pyrénées, often referring to Midi-Pyrénées as being mostly made up of Gascony, minimizing the importance of Languedoc in the region. The Midi-Pyrénées and Aquitaine regions share a common destiny it is explained, linked by the Garonne River, and were artificially separated. It is thus proposed to merge the two regions into a large region of southwest France. There have even been talks about building a single international airport of southwest France that would be located half-way between Toulouse and Bordeaux (capital of the Aquitaine region), which are 240 km. (150 miles) from each other. Without entering the debate over whether such a distant airport would make any sense at all, it is quite clear that merging both regions would create strong rivalries between Toulouse and Bordeaux, which are economic competitors, and the almost impossible task of choosing which of the two cities should become the capital of the new region.
* On the other hand, there are those who stress the past of Toulouse, referring to the former County of Toulouse which extended to the Mediterranean Coast, and who would like to merge Midi-Pyrénées with Languedoc-Roussillon in order to create a large Languedoc region. This indeed would reunify the old province of Languedoc, which was split between Midi-Pyrénées and Languedoc-Roussillon, and it would also make sense historically speaking, creating a region roughly corresponding to the old county of Toulouse. There also seems to be less economic competition between Toulouse and the cities of Languedoc-Roussillon. However, political leaders of Montpellier (capital of Languedoc-Roussillon) may disagree with the merger, opposed to losing their status of regional capital in favor of Toulouse, and loath to have Toulouse dominate the Mediterranean coast after it has dominated Midi-Pyrénées for more than 30 years already. Also, people in Roussillon, with their distinct Catalan culture, might object to being incorporated into a very large Languedoc region where their identity could become diluted.

On 1 January 2016, the region was merged with Languedoc-Roussillon to form the new region of Occitanie. The new name was taken up on 28 September 2016, with the capital remaining at Toulouse. Thus the debate ended in the second argument being accepted by the National Assembly and the Senate.

<text>Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur (literally: &#x27;Provence-Alps-Azure Coast&#x27; or &#x27;Provence-Alps-French Riviera&#x27; ; commonly shortened to PACA), also known as Région Sud (&#x27;Southern Region&#x27;), is one of the eighteen administrative regions of France, located at the far southeastern point of the mainland. The main prefecture and largest city is Marseille, France&#x27;s third largest city after Paris and Lyon and the 2nd largest urban area when combined with Aix-en-Provence with slightly less than one million residents.

== History ==
The region is roughly coterminous with the former French province of Provence, with the addition of the following adjacent areas: the former papal territory of Avignon, known as Comtat Venaissin; the former Sardinian-Piedmontese County of Nice annexed in 1860, whose coastline is known in English as the French Riviera and in French as the &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot;; and the southeastern part of the former French province of Dauphiné, in the French Alps. Previously known by the acronym PACA, the region adopted the name &quot;Région Sud&quot; as a commercial name or nickname in December 2017. 
== Geography ==
It encompasses six &quot;départements&quot; in Southeastern France: Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes, Bouches-du-Rhône, Hautes-Alpes, Var and Vaucluse. It is bounded to the east by the France–Italy border, to the south by the Mediterranean Sea and by the Principality of Monaco, to the north by Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and to the west by Occitanie, with the Rhône marking its westernmost border. According to the 2015 census, 5,007,977 people live in the region.

== Symbols ==
The region logotype displays the coat of arms created in the 1990s and which combines the coats of arms of the old provinces making up Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. The region&#x27;s economy is the third largest in France, just behind Île-de-France and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Its GDP in 2015 was €168.2 billion (US$190.5 billion) while its per capita GDP was €30,863 (US$34,950).

==Demographics==

===Population===
As of 2020, the population of the region was 5,098,666; Marseille and its metropolitan area is the most populous in the region with a city population of 870,321, an urban population of 1,618,479 and a metropolitan population of 1,879,601. Marseille is the second largest city in France after Paris, and has the third largest metropolitan population, behind those of Paris and Lyon respectively.

Nice is host to the second-largest population concentration in the region, with a city population of 344,875 and an urban population of 1,005,230, making it the fifth-most populous city in France.

=== Languages ===
The absolute majority of the population speaks French but many regional and foreign languages are present in the region.

The 1999 Census, which included a complementary survey asking for the mother tongue of the respondents, gave results on the most spoken mother tongues in Provence after French:

* Provençal 5.2%
* Italian 4.4%
* Arabic 3.0%
* Spanish 2.8%
* Corsican 1.1%

===Immigration===
According to a 2009 study, nearly 40% of all newborns in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur in 2007 had at least one parent of an immigrant background, mostly Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Maghrebi. This is the second-highest rate after Île-de-France (Greater Paris), where the figure was around 56%. Since the 1960s, the region has been a major immigration centre from France and into France, mostly due to Northern French and to Mediterranean immigration from countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.

===Departments===
Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur is divided into 6 departments. These are Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes-Maritimes, Bouches-du-Rhône, Var and Vaucluse.

==Major cities==

The largest cities in the region are Marseille (regional prefecture), Nice, Toulon and Aix-en-Provence, each with a population exceeding 100,000 inhabitants at the 1999 census. After Marseille, Nice is the second most populous city in the region, with a city proper population of about 350,000 and an urban population exceeding 1 million.

Marseille has an urban area of 2 million inhabitants and is the largest and capital city of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region. It is also the second-most populated city in France, just behind Paris, and the city with the third-largest metropolitan population in France, behind Paris and Lyon, respectively.

Along with Nice and Marseille, the region is also made internationally popular with Cannes, a city that, despite its comparatively small size (population of 73,603 in 2012), hosts the annual Cannes Film Festival, which has highly popularized the region. In addition, Arles has become renowned as the city where Vincent van Gogh lived and painted 300 paintings.

Toulon is a large military harbour on the Mediterranean coast and is home to a French naval base. It is the capital of the Var department in the region. Also, Aix-en-Provence has long been a university town and, to this day, remains the most important educational centre in the region.

Below is a list of the most populated cities in the region along with their population (city proper) according to the most recent census:

* Aix-en-Provence – 142,743
* Antibes (includes Juan-les-Pins) – 76,994

==Geography==

This region has a total area of . It has a wide variety of landscapes, from the Alps mountains to plains, lakes such as the Gignoux Lake, and coastal areas like Nice and Marseille, which form the majority of the land area. The region has a Mediterranean coastline on the south, on which the majority of its population lives. It borders Italy (Liguria and Piedmont) to the east, Monaco (Fontvieille, La Colle, La Rousse, Larvotto, Les Moneghetti, Les Révoires, Saint Michel) in the south-east, and the French regions of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes to the north and Occitanie to the west. The Rhône, Durance, Var and Arc rivers run through the region. The borders were unaffected by the 2016 French regional reforms.

This region is famous for the Côte d&#x27;Azur (French Riviera), which spans the coastal cities of Nice, Saint-Laurent-du-Var, Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, Cannes, Mandelieu-la-Napoule, Fréjus, Saint-Raphaël, Sainte-Maxime and Saint-Tropez; and on the Rhône river, the city of Avignon which is surrounded by medieval stone walls.

==Regional government and politics==

The Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur is the legislative body (&quot;assemblée délibérante&quot;) of the region. The President of the Regional Council has been Renaud Muselier formerly of The Republicans (LR) since 2017.

===Political tendencies===
In recent years, The Republicans have gained strong support in the region. Following the 2015 regional election, the party took control of the regional executive, which had been previously controlled by the Socialist Party (PS). Christian Estrosi succeeded Michel Vauzelle as President of the Regional Council. The 2015 election was also a show of force for the National Front (FN), led by Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, which garnered over 45% of the vote in the second round. The Socialist Party lost all representation at the regional level.

The French Communist Party (PCF) historically had several strongholds in the region from the 1920s onward, including Aubagne, Draguignan, La Ciotat, Beausoleil, Martigues, Gardanne, Arles as well as some suburbs of Marseille, although not enough to win regional elections; the party usually received about 10% of the vote. In the 2002 presidential election, this declined to 4%. In 2007, it dropped below 2%.

Nowadays the main competition in regional politics is between the right-wing The Republicans and the far-right National Rally (formerly National Front). In the second round of the 2021 regional election, The Republicans received 57.3% of the vote against the National Rally&#x27;s 42.7% with a list led by Thierry Mariani. The Socialist Party, present in the first round on a joint list led by Europe Ecology – The Greens, failed again to win any seats.

The 2022 presidential election marked the first time a far-right candidate won a majority of the vote in the second round in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. Marine Le Pen won a majority of the vote in three of the six departments (55.1% in Var, 52% in Vaucluse and 51.5% in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence); her respective scores in the remaining three (49.9% in Alpes-Maritimes, 47.9% in Bouches-du-Rhône and 44.9% in Hautes-Alpes) were superior to her national total (41.5%).

===Presidential election results===
In the second round of the last four presidential elections, Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur voted as follows, with the winner of the election indicated in italics:

==Economy==


The regional income per capita is close to the French national average. Income inequality however is higher than in other regions: it is ranked the 2nd region most marked by inequalities after Île-de-France. The region is ranked fifth by GDP (as of 2016). Between 2007 and 2011, the region registered an average annual growth rate of 1.6% of GDP (Eurostat), close to the national average annual growth rate of 1.5%. Representing 7.2% of the national GDP over the period, the region is an important economic powerhouse.

In 2013, the region was responsible for 7.4% of national employment, with an employment rate of 60.9%. The region&#x27;s employment success has a main characteristic: a higher concentration of elderly people than in the rest of France (respectively 27.1% and 24.1% in 2013).

With more than 80% of regional employment in the service sector in 2016, the regional economy is mostly oriented towards service activities, above the national average of 75.8%. The sector grew between 2000 and 2010 (3.1% on annual average versus 2.1% in France). The region concentrates more on commercial activities than financial ones than the rest of France does; principally because of tourism. 34% of the labour force is employed in retail and trade, against 32% at the national level. Moreover, the sector strongly contributes to growth of added value (81.5% vs. 77.3% at the national level). The industrial sector (existing mainly through the Marseille-Fos Port), including construction, consists of 17.1% of regional employment (vs. 20.6% in the rest of France), and contributes to 9.3% of gross added value, 3.2 points below the French level.

Employment in the agricultural sector is lower than the national level (2.4% against 3.1%). However, it grew at a rate of 4.1% annually on average between 2000 and 2008, while the rest of the country saw its agricultural employment decline by 2.4%. According to the INSEE, the region is characterised by a strong presence of SMEs of less than 500 employees, which represent 91.2% of local businesses (higher than the national average of 90.9%). Retail activities and tourism explain these figures.

The region&#x27;s economy is dependent on tourism like most coastal places but also a majority of its economy is dependent on coastal activities. PACA is the 3rd richest French region and ranks 19th on the European scale. Its prosperity is mainly thanks to its attractiveness in terms of tourism; it is indeed one of the world&#x27;s favourite tourist destinations, welcoming about 34 million tourists every year. The service sector predominates and provides many good jobs. In 2009, the region was admittedly affected by the global economic crisis, albeit to a small extent. It is (after the Paris area) the 2nd French region with regards to business startups.

If tourism is the driving force of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, the region is also a leader when it comes to innovative sectors, such as high technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. Education, for its part, is well developed with the region&#x27;s various universities, international schools, preparatory classes for specialist university courses, and engineering and business schools. All these institutions of higher learning help contribute to the human capital needed by the region to meet current technological challenges.

The region has a total GDP (2018) of €166.4 billion (US$188.7 bn), the sixth highest in France. It has a per capita GDP of €30,864 (US$34,994), slightly higher than the French average. According to a recent survey, a person living in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur has an average annual income of about €37,489 (US$45,755).

The region has been part of the Alps–Mediterranean Euroregion since 10 July 2007.

== Culture ==

The region is one of the most visited of France, and has therefore many well-known museums, mostly in Marseille: the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations, the Musée Cantini, the Musée Grobet-Labadié, the Marseille History Museum, the Musée des beaux-arts de Marseille, the Musée de la Faïence de Marseille and the Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle de Marseille are some of the tourist spots of the city. However, other museums are internationally recognised, like the Musée Matisse, the Musée d&#x27;art moderne et d&#x27;art contemporain, the Musée Marc Chagall, the Musée international d&#x27;Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice, the Musée National du Sport and the Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle de Nice.

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===

Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur has two of the busiest airports in France: Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport (ranking third nationally after Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport) and Marseille Provence Airport (ranking fifth nationally after Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport). Nice saw 14,485,423 people travelling through its airport in 2019, while 10,151,743 used Marseille to fly. As of 2019, the third-busiest airport in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur is Toulon–Hyères Airport (507,199 passengers), ranking 27th nationally.

=== Motorways ===

==== National services ====
Despite the importance of the region in the national economy and demography, the national services on conventional network are not very high due to the fact of the saturations of the tracks with high speed and regional trains.

* Services operated by SNCF Intercités:
** Bordeaux-Saint-Jean to Toulouse, Montpellier, Marseille-Saint-Charles and Nice
** Paris-Austerlitz to Marseille-Blancarde and Nice (night train)
** Paris-Austerlitz to Gap and Briançon (night train)
* Services operated by Thello Eurocity:
** Marseille-Saint-Charles to Nice, Monaco, Ventimiglia, Genoa and Milano Centrale (Italy)

==== Regional services ====
All regional train services are operated under the ZOU! brand used for interurban train and bus services funded by the region. All such services are part of the TER Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur network and operated by SNCF on behalf of the region, except for services on the line between Nice and Digne-les-Bains, which are operated by Chemins de fer de Provence, a company owned by the region. In 2021 the region became the first in mainland France to open up TER services to competition, and after a tender process awarded a contract to Transdev to operate TER services on the Marseille-Nice line. Transdev is scheduled to commence operations in place of SNCF from June 2025.

The Regional Council of Provence-Alpes Côte d&#x27;Azur is the transport authority and defines the services in all region. An attractive fare permits to transport more than 100,000 passengers every day in 750 trains. Trains are leaving every 15, 20, 30, 60 or 120 minutes on each line.

The regional services operate on one set of tracks throughout the regions, which has led to delays and cancellations along the line. In 2016, during the second Council of the Year at the Region Hall in Marseille, in front of politicians and the new President of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur Christian Estrosi, the SNCF CEO, Guillaume Pepy, has announced the impossibility of the company to respond to the demand. The Marseille-Saint-Charles Station, the Marseille&#x27;s main railway station cannot support more than 23 trains an hour and the tracks are too old and not enough to accept an average of the capacity. The project of new high-speed line called LGV PACA in 2030 could permit to increase trains on tracks with a new crossing of Marseille with a tunnel. Two new stations will be created in the territory of the city and a new line between Cannes and Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport.

====Urban rail====
The Métro de Marseille — opened in 1977 — is the region&#x27;s sole subway system and consists of two lines, with a third planned.

Marseilles also has a modern tramway (3 lines), as does Aubagne (1 line), Avignon (1 line) and Nice (3 lines). Each of those cities rebuilt their tram networks after they were shut down in the mid-20th century — the exception being Line 68 in Marseilles, which continued service until 2004 before being rebuilt and reopened as part of the current system in 2007.

Tram networks operated in Aix-en-Provence, La Ciotat and Toulon in the early- and mid-20th century also but have not been revived.

==Environment==
The mining company Alteo processes bauxite to produce aluminium, resulting in various waste materials such as &quot;boues rouges&quot; (red mud) and arsenic. The dumping of this waste in the marine reserve of Calanques National Park for six years was authorised by the French Government in 2015, and has been a continuing source of disagreement and legal procedures between environmental protection, government, and industrial lobbies. Company representatives have dismissed environmental concerns as exaggerated and uninformed.


The region also includes another national park, Port-Cros National Park near Toulon.

==Education==
Major universities of the region include the Aix-Marseille University, the University of Toulon, the University of Avignon and the Côte d&#x27;Azur University. Other towns have higher education classes but no universities.

<text>Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising were an American animation team and company known for founding the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation studios. In 1929, the studio was founded under the name Harman-Ising Productions, producing &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; for Leon Schlesinger from 1930 to 1933. From 1934 to 1938, Harman-Ising produced the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; series, with William Hanna as their employee.

== Early history ==
Harman and Ising first worked in animation in 1922 at Laugh-O-Gram Studio, Walt Disney&#x27;s studio in Kansas City. When Disney moved operations to California, Harman was back at United Film Ad Service and Ising had a photofinishing business. Their plans went nowhere, however, and the men soon came back to Disney on June 22, 1925, to work on his &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; and &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; films. Ising was fired from Disney in March 1927, when Disney signed the contract to distribute Oswald films to Universal Pictures. It was during this time that Harman and Ising developed a style of cartoon drawing that would later be closely associated with, and credited to, Disney.

When producer Charles Mintz ended his association with Disney, the majority of Disney&#x27;s animators, including Harman and Ising, went to work for Mintz, whose brother-in-law, George Winkler, set up a new animation studio to make the &quot;Oswald&quot; cartoons. The Oswald cartoons which Harman and Ising produced in 1928 and 1929 already show their distinctive style, which would later characterize their work on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon series for Warner Bros. Late in 1929, Universal Pictures who owned the rights to Oswald, started its own animation studio headed by Walter Lantz, replacing Mintz and forcing Harman and Ising out of work.

== Warner Bros. and Van Beuren ==

Harman and Ising had long aspired to start their own studio, and had created and copyrighted the cartoon character Bosko in 1928. After losing their jobs at the Winkler studio, Harman and Ising founded Harman-Ising Productions, with most of the Disney and Winkler animators as staff. The studio produced a short Bosko demonstration film called &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot;. The cartoon featured Bosko at odds with his animator – portrayed in live-action by Ising. Impressed, Leon Schlesinger, who worked at Warner Bros., hired Harman and Ising. Schlesinger wanted the Bosko character to star in a new series of cartoons he dubbed &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; (the title being a parody of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;). In 1930, the pair&#x27;s first theatrical Bosko short, &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;, was a success. In 1931, Harman took over direction of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; starring the character, while Ising took a sister series called &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; that consisted of one-shot stories and characters.

The two animators broke off ties with Schlesinger later in 1933 over budget disputes with the producer who had vetoed their demands for bigger budgets, and went to Van Beuren Studios, which was making cartoons for RKO Radio Pictures. There, they were offered a contract to produce the Cubby Bear cartoon series. Harman and Ising produced two released cartoons for this series, but were in the midst of making a third cartoon when a contractual dispute arose. The pair left Van Beuren, but kept the completed cartoon and finally released it in the 1940s.

== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ==
In 1934, Harman and Ising signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to start a new series of shorts, &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot;. Harman and Ising, having maintained the rights to Bosko, occasionally featured the character in the new series. The two maintained the same division of work they had used at Warner Bros.: Harman worked on Bosko shorts, and Ising directed one-shots. In 1935, Harman redesigned Bosko into an identifiable African-American boy, ultimately leading to the character being discontinued. They also tried unsuccessfully to create new cartoon stars for their new distributors. Their cartoons, though technically superior to those they had made for Schlesinger at Warner&#x27;s, were still music-driven shorts with little to no plot. When the new &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; series ran significantly over-budget in 1937, MGM fired Harman and Ising and established its own in-house studio, which was founded and headed by Fred Quimby.

Harman and Ising still found work at the time as animation freelancers. Harman and Ising lent their former ink-and-painters to Walt Disney while &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was behind schedule. Disney afterward commissioned Harman and Ising to produce a Silly Symphony cartoon (&quot;Merbabies&quot;), in return. Disney later reneged on a deal he had made for two other Harman-Ising cartoons to be produced for the studio, as RKO Radio Pictures, Disney&#x27;s distributor, did not want to release another studio&#x27;s cartoons. Harman and Ising sold the cartoons to MGM, and Quimby later agreed to hire the animators back to the studio. Ising created the character Barney Bear for MGM at this time, basing the sleepy-eyed character partially on himself. 

In 1939, Harman created &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;, a downbeat morality tale about two squirrels discovering the evils of humanity, which was nominated for an Oscar. The following year, Ising produced William Hanna and Joseph Barbera&#x27;s first cartoon, &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, a cartoon featuring characters later known as Tom and Jerry, but according to Barbera, Ising never came into the room, but got credited. Despite the popularity of &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Ising&#x27;s &quot;The Milky Way&quot; was more successful and became the first non-Disney film to win the Academy Award. Despite the success of these and other cartoons, MGM&#x27;s production under Harman and Ising remained low.

In 1941, Harman left MGM and formed a new studio with Disney veteran Mel Shaw, while Ising was still at MGM. In 1942, Ising also quit MGM, in his case to join the United States Army Air Forces animation unit.

== Later career and legacy ==
By 1951, Harman and Ising were back together and making industrial and commercial films such as the 1951 film &quot;Good Wrinkles&quot; made for the California prune industry. Harman also freelanced to write the 1954 Woody Woodpecker Cartune &quot;Convict Concerto&quot; for his former colleague Walter Lantz. 

In 1960, Harman-Ising produced a pilot episode for a made for TV cartoon series titled &quot;The Adventures of Sir Gee Whiz on the Other Side of the Moon&quot;. The unsold pilot for the never produced series was profiled on episode 6 of &quot;Cartoon Dump.&quot; Rudy Ising was the voice of Sir Gee Whiz. After Gee-Whiz, both Harman and Ising retired from their careers in animation.

Although Harman and Ising contributed to much of what would later be known as the Disney style, they have been dismissed as mere copycats. In reality, Harman and Ising never attempted to imitate Disney; they were attempting to make refined polished cartoons whose quality would shine in comparison to the work of others. Their repeated attempts to make quality cartoons and their refusal to be bound by budgets led to numerous disputes with their producers. Because of this, they were unable to create any enduring characters. Instead, they created studios that would later produce such characters.

Ising and Harman were portrayed in the feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot; by David Henrie and Hunter Gomez.

<text>Kander and Ebb were a highly successful American songwriting team consisting of composer John Kander (born March 18, 1927) and lyricist Fred Ebb (April 8, 1928 – September 11, 2004). Known primarily for their stage musicals, which include &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, Kander and Ebb also scored several movies, including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Their most famous song is the theme song of that movie. Recorded by many artists, &quot;New York, New York&quot; became a signature song for Frank Sinatra. The team also became associated with two actresses, Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera, for whom they wrote a considerable amount of material for the stage, concerts and television.

==History==
John Kander and Fred Ebb were introduced by their mutual music publisher Tommy Valando in 1962. Kander and Ebb met at Ebb&#x27;s apartment and decided to test their compatibility as writing partners with a &quot;mock title song&quot; for a musical comedy already running on Broadway, a Hal Prince production called &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine.&quot; As James Leve remarks in his book &quot;Kander and Ebb&quot; (2009), &quot;The turning point in Kander and Ebb&#x27;s collaboration occurred when Kander suggested that they try a ballad. The result, &#x27;My Coloring Book,&#x27; became an instant hit.&quot; Sandy Stewart performed the song, and it was nominated for a 1962 Grammy Award. Barbra Streisand and Dusty Springfield later covered &quot;My Coloring Book&quot;. This song established what was to become Kander and Ebb&#x27;s iconic musical style, deceptively sophisticated harmonic progression with lyrics and melodies that are accessible to audiences. As Leve writes, &quot;what best defines their voice is the contradictory nature of their collaboration: the composer and lyricist have strikingly different artistic temperaments, the former demonstrably sentimental, the latter campy and cynical.&quot;

Kander and Ebb collaborated on an unproduced musical called &quot;Golden Gate&quot;, which producer-director Harold Prince called &quot;...basically a test to see if the collaboration was any good.&quot; They wrote &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot;, their first musical to be produced on Broadway, in 1965, in which Liza Minnelli made her Broadway debut. Another early collaboration was the industrial musical &quot;General Electric presents Go Fly a Kite&quot; written with Walter Marks for General Electric&#x27;s 5th Electric Executives Conference in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1966.

Kander&#x27;s and Ebb&#x27;s greatest acclaim came from the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966) and the 1972 film version. The musical, directed by frequent collaborator Harold Prince, was a major success, with a Broadway run of over 1,100 performances. It won a Tony Award as the season&#x27;s best musical, and its original cast recording won a Grammy Award. The film, directed by Bob Fosse, won eight Academy Awards. The musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (1975) after an excellent initial run of 936 performances was revived on Broadway in 1996 to become an even greater hit. It has become the longest-running revival in Broadway history, and the 2002 film version was also a great success, including an Oscar nomination for the collaboration. Other Broadway successes included &quot;Woman Of The Year&quot; (1981), &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1992), and, posthumously for Ebb, &quot;Curtains&quot; (2006), their final musical.

Minnelli became strongly associated with Kander and Ebb, with Ebb producing Minnelli&#x27;s Emmy-winning television special &quot;Liza with a Z&quot;. They appreciated the actress&#x27;s excellent musicianship and found her congenial to work with. Kander said, &quot;One of the nice things about writing for Liza is that you don&#x27;t have to write for Liza. She can do anything. You know that whatever you do write, she&#x27;s going to deliver it exactly the way you intended it. It&#x27;s really the same with Chita Rivera, the other woman in our lives.&quot;

Kander&#x27;s and Ebb&#x27;s fascination with the collaborative process began with their work on &quot;Cabaret&quot;, where a long experimental period permitted actors such as Joel Grey to contribute ideas toward the creation of their characters. The creative team often met at Harold Prince&#x27;s home to discuss ideas. These sessions are discussed in the Kander and Ebb biography, &quot;Colored Lights&quot;, as “what if” sessions.

In 1998, Kander and Ebb were recognized for their contributions to theatre and music with Kennedy Center Honors.

In 1994, they were granted honorary doctorate degrees from Niagara University, in Lewiston, New York.

&quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot; played on Broadway for a short time in 2010. The book was written by David Thompson and choreographed and directed by Susan Stroman.

Susan Stroman and David Thompson would collaborate again, as director/choreographer and book writer respectively, for Kander &amp; Ebb&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot;, musical which uses songs from Scorsese&#x27;s movie but weaves them into a new story set during the same time period. The show ran April 26 – July 30, 2023.

<text>John Harold Kander (born March 18, 1927) is an American composer, known largely for his work in the musical theater. As part of the songwriting team Kander and Ebb (with lyricist Fred Ebb), Kander wrote the scores for 15 musicals, including &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966) and &quot;Chicago&quot; (1975), both of which were later adapted into acclaimed films. He and Ebb also wrote the standard &quot;New York, New York&quot; (also known as &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot;). The team also received numerous nominations, which include five additional Tony Awards, two Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

==Early life==
John Kander, the second son of Harold and Bernice (Aaron) Kander, was born on March 18, 1927, in Kansas City, Missouri. He has stated that he grew up in a loving, middle-class Jewish family and maintained a lifelong close relationship with his older brother, Edward, who became a sales manager at a brokerage house in the city. Kander attributes his early interest in music (starting at age four) to the family&#x27;s love of singing around the piano. His first composition was a Christmas carol, written during second-grade mathematics class; his teacher&#x27;s encouragement led to the school choir singing it for a holiday assembly. His 2nd grade teacher discreetly asked his parents permission to use the song since, ironically, he is Jewish. He attended his first opera performances at the age of nine, when the San Carlo Opera came to Kansas City with their productions of &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly.&quot; According to Kander, &quot;My mother took me and we sat in the first row. There were these giants on the stage, and my feet were dangling over my seat. It was overwhelming for me, even though I could see the strings that held the beards on the Egyptian soldiers... My interest in telling a story through music in many ways derived from early experiences like those.&quot;

Kander attended Westport High School before transferring to the Pembroke Country-Day School. During World War II, Kander joined the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps. After completing his training in California and sailing between San Francisco and Asia, Kander left the Corps on May 3, 1946. However, due to rule changes governing national service, Kander was forced to enlist in the Army Reserves in September of the same year, after having already completed one semester at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. During the Korean War, Kander was ordered back into active duty, but he was forced to remain in New York City for six months of observation after a medical physical revealed scars on his lungs. He was officially discharged on July 3, 1957.

Kander graduated with a degree in music at Oberlin College in 1951 and went on to graduate studies at Columbia University, where he was a protégé of Douglas Moore and studied composition with Jack Beeson and Otto Luening. He earned his master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in 1953.

==Career==
Following his studies, Kander began conducting at summer theaters before serving as a rehearsal pianist for the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; by Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins in New York. While working, Kander met the choreographer, Jerome Robbins, who suggested that Kander compose the dance music for the show in 1959. After that experience, he wrote dance arrangements for &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; in 1960.

Kander&#x27;s first produced musical was &quot;A Family Affair&quot; in 1962, written with James and William Goldman. The same year, Kander met Fred Ebb through their mutual publisher, Tommy Volando. The first song Kander and Ebb wrote together, &quot;My Coloring Book&quot;, was made popular by a recording from Sandy Stewart and their second song, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Much&quot;, was made famous by Barbra Streisand, and Kander and Ebb became a permanent team.

In 1965, Kander and Ebb wrote music for their first show on Broadway, &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot;, produced by Hal Prince, directed by George Abbott, and with book by George Abbott and Robert Russell, in which Liza Minnelli made her Broadway debut.

Kander and Ebb have since been associated with writing material for both Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera (including the musicals &quot;Zorba&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;The Rink&quot;, and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;) and have produced special material for their appearances live and on television, such as &quot;Liza with a Z&quot;.

The Broadway musicals &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; have been made into films. The film version of &quot;Chicago&quot; won several 2002 Academy Awards, including for best picture, film editing, costume design, art direction and sound. In his musicological and biographical study of the collaboration of Kander and Ebb, James Leve discusses the full history of &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; in chapters titled &quot;The Divinely Decadent Lives of &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;: Broadway to Hollywood&quot;. As Leve notes, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which is a musical adaptation of Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;The Berlin Stories&quot;, was an &quot;ideal vehicle for Kander and Ebb&#x27;s brittle and self-referential brand of musical theater.&quot; This insight also holds true for &quot;Chicago.&quot;

Kander, along with Ebb, also wrote songs for Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, and it was set to premiere in London, but the rights were pulled by Wilder&#x27;s nephew. He also says that Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones, the writers of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, wrote a musical of Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; and it took them thirteen years to write, only to have the rights pulled as well by the nephew.

Kander&#x27;s first musical without Ebb in many years, &quot;The Landing&quot;, with book and lyrics by Greg Pierce, premiered off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre on October 23, 2013. The musical, which was a series of three &quot;mini-musicals&quot;, was directed by Walter Bobbie and starred David Hyde Pierce and Julia Murney. Kander&#x27;s musical &quot;Kid Victory&quot;, with book and lyrics by Greg Pierce, had its world premiere February 28, 2015 at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia. &quot;Kid Victory&quot; premiered off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre on February 1, 2017 in previews, and opened officially on February 22, 2017. Direction is by Liesl Tommy with choreography by Christopher Windom. The cast features Jeffry Denman and Karen Ziemba.

Kander (music) and David Thompson (lyrics) wrote the dance play &quot;The Beast in the Jungle&quot; which opened off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre. The play is directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman, and features 
Tony Yazbeck and Irina Dvorovenko. Kander collaborated with Lin-Manuel Miranda for Miranda&#x27;s Hamildrop series: “Cheering for Me Now” (lyrics Miranda and music Kander) is an uplifting track about New York&#x27;s ratification of the constitution.

James Leve discusses Kander&#x27;s prolific career and his late musical style in the essay &quot;John Kander: the First Ninety-Two Years&quot;.

==Personal life ==
In 2010, Kander married dancer and choreographer Albert Stephenson, his partner since 1977, in Toronto. Kander&#x27;s grand-nephew Jason Kander was formerly the Missouri Secretary of State.

<text>Fred Ebb (April 8, 1928 – September 11, 2004) was an American musical theatre lyricist who had many successful collaborations with composer John Kander. The Kander and Ebb team frequently wrote for such performers as Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera.

==Background==

He worked during the early 1950s bronzing baby shoes, as a trucker&#x27;s assistant, and was also employed in a department store credit office and at a hosiery company. He graduated from New York University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature, and also earned his master&#x27;s degree in English from Columbia University.

One of his early collaborators was Philip Springer, and a song they wrote together (&quot;I Never Loved Him Anyhow&quot;) was recorded by Carmen McRae in 1956. Another song Ebb wrote with Springer was &quot;Heartbroken&quot; (1953), which was recorded by Judy Garland, the mother of his future protégée, Liza Minnelli. Other Springer-Ebb tunes include &quot;Nevertheless I Never Lost the Blues&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget&quot;, which he wrote with Norman Leyden, was recorded by singer Eddy Arnold in 1954.

On his first theatrical writing job, he co-wrote the lyrics for the musical revue &quot;Baker&#x27;s Dozen&quot; in 1951. He wrote songs with Norman Martin for the Off-Broadway revue &quot;Put It in Writing&quot; (1962). He also worked with composer Paul Klein from the early 1950s onward, contributing songs to the cabaret revue &quot;Isn&#x27;t America Fun&quot; (1959) and the Broadway revue &quot;From A to Z&quot; (1960), directed by Christopher Hewett.

Fred Ebb was the voice of the &quot;Little Blue Man&quot;, on Betty Johnson&#x27;s novelty song from 1958, repeating the words: &quot;I Rov You... to Bits&quot;.

With Klein, Ebb wrote his first book musical, &quot;Morning Sun&quot;. Originally, Bob Fosse was attached as director. Fosse eventually withdrew from the project, and the show ran for 6 performances Off-Broadway in October 1963.

== Kander and Ebb ==

Music publisher Tommy Valando introduced Ebb to Kander in 1962. After a few songs such as &quot;My Coloring Book&quot;, Kander and Ebb wrote a stage musical, &quot;Golden Gate&quot;, that was never produced. However, the quality of the score convinced producer Harold Prince to hire them for their first professional production, the George Abbott-directed musical &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot; (1965), based on Lester Atwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Love is Just Around the Corner&quot;. Although it won star Liza Minnelli a Tony Award, the show closed after only 87 performances.

Their second collaboration, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, was considerably more successful, running for 1,165-performances. Directed by Prince and based on the John Van Druten play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (which, in turn, was based on the writing of Christopher Isherwood), the musical starred Jill Haworth as Sally Bowles, Bert Convy as Clifford Bradshaw, Lotte Lenya as Fräulein Schneider and Joel Grey as the emcee. The original Broadway production opened on November 20, 1966 and won eight of the 11 Tony Awards for which it was nominated, including Best Musical and Best Score. Adapted into a film by Bob Fosse, it won eight Academy Awards, though not Best Picture. It was revived three times, first in 1987 with Grey reprising his role and again in 1998 in a long-running revival, originally starring Alan Cumming as the emcee and Natasha Richardson as Sally Bowles. The third revival began in 2014 and also starred Alan Cumming this time alongside Michelle Williams.

Their next few works were less successful: &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1968), directed by Gower Champion and starring Robert Goulet, ran for less than a year. &quot;Zorba&quot; (1968), directed by Prince, also ran less than a year, though it was more successful in its 1983 revival; and &quot;70, Girls, 70&quot; (1971), which was originally intended as an off-Broadway production, closed after 35 performances.

In 1972, he wrote the television special, &quot;Liza with a Z&quot; for Liza Minnelli. In 1974, Kander, Ebb and Fosse contributed to a concert for Liza Minnelli on Broadway. In 1973 Ebb wrote the television special that marked Frank Sinatra&#x27;s comeback from retirement, &quot;Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra&quot; (also known as &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;). The show featured Sinatra and guest star Gene Kelly in duet on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Do That Anymore&quot;, written by Ebb for his abandoned musical with Kander and Dale Wasserman, &quot;Wait for Me, World!&quot;. In 1975, the team wrote the score to &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Funny Girl&quot;.

&quot;Chicago&quot; (1975) had mixed reviews but ran for more than two years on Broadway. Starring Chita Rivera, Jerry Orbach and Gwen Verdon in her last Broadway role, it suffered from a cynical attitude, which contrasted with the record-breaking popularity of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Though rumors of a film production directed again by Fosse were heard, the show was revived in 1996 as part of the &quot;Encores!&quot; staged concert series. A hit, the minimalist production transferred to Broadway, starring Ann Reinking (Roxie) and Bebe Neuwirth (Velma). The revival holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second longest-running show in Broadway history, behind only &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, having played its 7,486th performance on November 23, 2014, surpassing &quot;Cats&quot;.

Ebb wrote the book for Shirley MacLaine’s Broadway solo revue in 1976. The following year, Kander and Ebb worked with Minnelli and Martin Scorsese twice: first, in the film &quot;New York, New York&quot;, which had them write what is their best-known song, the title track; and, again in &quot;The Act&quot; (1977) a musical about a fictional nightclub act. It ran for under ten months. After contributing a song to Phyllis Newman’s one-woman musical, &quot;The Madwoman of Central Park West&quot; (1979), the team wrote &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1981), which starred Lauren Bacall and won the team their second Tony Award for Best Score.

&quot;The Rink&quot; (1984) teamed Kander and Ebb again with Minnelli and Rivera. The cast also included Jason Alexander and Rob Marshall. Following the closure of the show after six months, Kander and Ebb would not produce new material, save for a song in &quot;Hay Fever&quot; in 1985, for nine years.

In 1991, the revue &quot;And The World Goes &#x27;Round&quot; opened Off-Broadway, featuring Karen Ziemba, Susan Stroman and Scott Ellis. The team&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; opened in 1993, starring Chita Rivera. Reunited with director Harold Prince, the show ran for more than two years and won them their third and last Tony Award for best score.

The team&#x27;s last original work to reach Broadway during Ebb&#x27;s life opened in 1997. &quot;Steel Pier&quot; brought together Ziemba, Ellis and Stroman and though the show was nominated for 11 Tonys, it won none and closed after two months. It also featured Kristin Chenoweth. In 1997, Ebb reworked lyrics to Richard Rodgers&#x27; melody for the television production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Two decades earlier, Ebb refused the opportunity to write the musical &quot;Rex&quot; with Rodgers.

The team had two works produced outside New York. &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, an adaptation of the Thornton Wilder play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, was performed at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia in 1999 and was revamped for a 2007 staging by the Westport Country Playhouse under the title &quot;All About Us&quot;.

&quot;The Visit&quot;, starring Chita Rivera and John McMartin, was presented by the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, as well as the Signature Theatre in Arlington (with George Hearn replacing McMartin).

The story of the long collaboration between Fred Ebb and John Kander is told in James Leve&#x27;s &quot;Kander and Ebb&quot; (2009). Through in-depth primary research and interviews with writers, producers, and various musical theater collaborators, Leve introduces the writing process of Kander and Ebb and explores the many revisions and stagings of their shows as each work moved from tryouts to Broadway.

==Death and legacy==
Ebb died from a heart attack on September 11, 2004, at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 76.

At the time of his death, Ebb was working on a new musical with Kander, &quot;Curtains: A Backstage Murder Mystery Musical Comedy&quot;. The project had already lost its book writer, Peter Stone, who died in 2003. The show&#x27;s orchestrator, Michael Gibson, also died (in 2005) while the project was underway. Coincidentally, the show is about a series of deaths during the production of a Broadway musical.

Kander continued working on the project with a new librettist Rupert Holmes, writing new lyrics when necessary. The musical had its world premiere at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in July 2006, and ran on Broadway at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre from March 2007 through June 2008.

At its 2007 ceremony, the Drama Desk honored Kander and the late Ebb with a special award for &quot;42 years of excellence in advancing the art of the musical theater.&quot;

In 2010 &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot;, a musical with lyrics by Ebb, music by Kander, and book by David Thompson premiered, first Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, and then on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre.

Ebb and Kander both were inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1991.

Ebb is interred in a mausoleum with Edwin “Eddie” Aldridge (1929–1997) and Martin Cohen (1926–1995) on the banks of Sylvan Water at Green-Wood Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark in Brooklyn, New York. In addition to the names and dates of each man, the phrase, &quot;Together Forever&quot; is chiseled on the front of the mausoleum. On June 14, 2014, Ebb was featured in the first gay-themed tour of Green-Wood Cemetery.

==Fred Ebb Award==
The Fred Ebb Foundation, established in 2005 by instruction of Ebb&#x27;s will, presents an annual award to an up-and-coming musical theatre writer (or team). The award has been presented for 14 consecutive years, and awards a total of $60,000 to the winners each year.

<doc id="198948" wikidata="Q3780824" url="?curid=198948" title="Coding region">
<text>The coding region of a gene, also known as the coding DNA sequence (CDS), is the portion of a gene&#x27;s DNA or RNA that codes for a protein. Studying the length, composition, regulation, splicing, structures, and functions of coding regions compared to non-coding regions over different species and time periods can provide a significant amount of important information regarding gene organization and evolution of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This can further assist in mapping the human genome and developing gene therapy.

== Definition ==
Although this term is also sometimes used interchangeably with exon, it is not the exact same thing: the exon is composed of the coding region as well as the 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; untranslated regions of the RNA, and so therefore, an exon would be partially made up of coding regions. The 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; untranslated regions of the RNA, which do not code for protein, are termed non-coding regions and are not discussed on this page.

There is often confusion between coding regions and exomes and there is a clear distinction between these terms. While the exome refers to all exons within a genome, the coding region refers to a singular section of the DNA or RNA which specifically codes for a certain kind of protein.  

== History ==
In 1978, Walter Gilbert published &quot;Why Genes in Pieces&quot; which first began to explore the idea that the gene is a mosaic—that each full nucleic acid strand is not coded continuously but is interrupted by &quot;silent&quot; non-coding regions. This was the first indication that there needed to be a distinction between the parts of the genome that code for protein, now called coding regions, and those that do not.

== Composition ==

The evidence suggests that there is a general interdependence between base composition patterns and coding region availability. The coding region is thought to contain a higher GC-content than non-coding regions. There is further research that discovered that the longer the coding strand, the higher the GC-content. Short coding strands are comparatively still GC-poor, similar to the low GC-content of the base composition translational stop codons like TAG, TAA, and TGA.

GC-rich areas are also where the ratio point mutation type is altered slightly: there are more transitions, which are changes from purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine, compared to transversions, which are changes from purine to pyrimidine or pyrimidine to purine. The transitions are less likely to change the encoded amino acid and remain a silent mutation (especially if they occur in the third nucleotide of a codon) which is usually beneficial to the organism during translation and protein formation.

This indicates that essential coding regions (gene-rich) are higher in GC-content and more stable and resistant to mutation compared to accessory and non-essential regions (gene-poor). However, it is still unclear whether this came about through neutral and random mutation or through a pattern of selection. There is also debate on whether the methods used, such as gene windows, to ascertain the relationship between GC-content and coding region are accurate and unbiased.

== Structure and function ==
In DNA, the coding region is flanked by the promoter sequence on the 5&#x27; end of the template strand and the termination sequence on the 3&#x27; end. During transcription, the RNA Polymerase (RNAP) binds to the promoter sequence and moves along the template strand to the coding region. RNAP then adds RNA nucleotides complementary to the coding region in order to form the mRNA, substituting uracil in place of thymine. This continues until the RNAP reaches the termination sequence.

After transcription and maturation, the mature mRNA formed encompasses multiple parts important for its eventual translation into protein. The coding region in an mRNA is flanked by the 5&#x27; untranslated region (5&#x27;-UTR) and 3&#x27; untranslated region (3&#x27;-UTR), the 5&#x27; cap, and Poly-A tail. During translation, the ribosome facilitates the attachment of the tRNAs to the coding region, 3 nucleotides at a time (codons). The tRNAs transfer their associated amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain, eventually forming the protein defined in the initial DNA coding region. 
== Regulation ==
The coding region can be modified in order to regulate gene expression.

Alkylation is one form of regulation of the coding region. The gene that would have been transcribed can be silenced by targeting a specific sequence. The bases in this sequence would be blocked using alkyl groups, which create the silencing effect.

While the regulation of gene expression manages the abundance of RNA or protein made in a cell, the regulation of these mechanisms can be controlled by a regulatory sequence found before the open reading frame begins in a strand of DNA. The regulatory sequence will then determine the location and time that expression will occur for a protein coding region.

RNA splicing ultimately determines what part of the sequence becomes translated and expressed, and this process involves cutting out introns and putting together exons. Where the RNA spliceosome cuts, however, is guided by the recognition of splice sites, in particular the 5&#x27; splicing site, which is one of the substrates for the first step in splicing. The coding regions are within the exons, which become covalently joined together to form the mature messenger RNA.

== Mutations ==
Mutations in the coding region can have very diverse effects on the phenotype of the organism. While some mutations in this region of DNA/RNA can result in advantageous changes, others can be harmful and sometimes even lethal to an organism&#x27;s survival. In contrast, changes in the non-coding region may not always result in detectable changes in phenotype.

=== Mutation types ===

There are various forms of mutations that can occur in coding regions. One form is silent mutations, in which a change in nucleotides does not result in any change in amino acid after transcription and translation. There also exist nonsense mutations, where base alterations in the coding region code for a premature stop codon, producing a shorter final protein. Point mutations, or single base pair changes in the coding region, that code for different amino acids during translation, are called missense mutations. Other types of mutations include frameshift mutations such as insertions or deletions.

=== Formation ===
Some forms of mutations are hereditary (germline mutations), or passed on from a parent to its offspring. Such mutated coding regions are present in all cells within the organism. Other forms of mutations are acquired (somatic mutations) during an organism&#x27;s lifetime, and may not be constant cell-to-cell. These changes can be caused by mutagens, carcinogens, or other environmental agents (ex. UV). Acquired mutations can also be a result of copy-errors during DNA replication and are not passed down to offspring. Changes in the coding region can also be de novo (new); such changes are thought to occur shortly after fertilization, resulting in a mutation present in the offspring&#x27;s DNA while being absent in both the sperm and egg cells.

=== Prevention ===
There exist multiple transcription and translation mechanisms to prevent lethality due to deleterious mutations in the coding region. Such measures include proofreading by some DNA Polymerases during replication, mismatch repair following replication, and the &#x27;Wobble Hypothesis&#x27; which describes the degeneracy of the third base within an mRNA codon.

== Constrained coding regions (CCRs) ==
While it is well known that the genome of one individual can have extensive differences when compared to the genome of another, recent research has found that some coding regions are highly constrained, or resistant to mutation, between individuals of the same species. This is similar to the concept of interspecies constraint in conserved sequences. Researchers termed these highly constrained sequences constrained coding regions (CCRs), and have also discovered that such regions may be involved in high purifying selection. On average, there is approximately 1 protein-altering mutation every 7 coding bases, but some CCRs can have over 100 bases in sequence with no observed protein-altering mutations, some without even synonymous mutations. These patterns of constraint between genomes may provide clues to the sources of rare developmental diseases or potentially even embryonic lethality. Clinically validated variants and de novo mutations in CCRs have been previously linked to disorders such as infantile epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay and severe heart disease.

== Coding sequence detection ==

While identification of open reading frames within a DNA sequence is straightforward, identifying coding sequences is not, because the cell translates only a subset of all open reading frames to proteins. Currently CDS prediction uses sampling and sequencing of mRNA from cells, although there is still the problem of determining which parts of a given mRNA are actually translated to protein. CDS prediction is a subset of gene prediction, the latter also including prediction of DNA sequences that code not only for protein but also for other functional elements such as RNA genes and regulatory sequences.

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, gene overlapping occurs relatively often in both DNA and RNA viruses as an evolutionary advantage to reduce genome size while retaining the ability to produce various proteins from the available coding regions. For both DNA and RNA, pairwise alignments can detect overlapping coding regions, including short open reading frames in viruses, but would require a known coding strand to compare the potential overlapping coding strand with. An alternative method using single genome sequences would not require multiple genome sequences to execute comparisons but would require at least 50 nucleotides overlapping in order to be sensitive.

<text>The CpG sites or CG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction. CpG sites occur with high frequency in genomic regions called CpG islands. 

Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines. Enzymes that add a methyl group are called DNA methyltransferases. In mammals, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated. Methylating the cytosine within a gene can change its expression, a mechanism that is part of a larger field of science studying gene regulation that is called epigenetics. Methylated cytosines often mutate to thymines.

In humans, about 70% of promoters located near the transcription start site of a gene (proximal promoters) contain a CpG island.

== CpG characteristics ==
=== Definition ===
&quot;CpG&quot; is shorthand for &quot;5&#x27;—C—phosphate—G—3&#x27; &quot;, that is, cytosine and guanine separated by only one phosphate group; phosphate links any two nucleosides together in DNA. The &quot;CpG&quot; notation is used to distinguish this single-stranded linear sequence from the &quot;CG&quot; base-pairing of cytosine and guanine for double-stranded sequences. The CpG notation is therefore to be interpreted as the cytosine being 5 prime to the guanine base. &quot;CpG&quot; should not be confused with &quot;GpC&quot;, the latter meaning that a guanine is followed by a cytosine in the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction of a single-stranded sequence.

=== Under-representation caused by high mutation rate ===
CpG dinucleotides have long been observed to occur with a much lower frequency in the sequence of vertebrate genomes than would be expected due to random chance. For example, in the human genome, which has a 42% GC content, a pair of nucleotides consisting of cytosine followed by guanine would be expected to occur formula_1 of the time. The frequency of CpG dinucleotides in human genomes is less than one-fifth of the expected frequency. 

This underrepresentation is a consequence of the high mutation rate of methylated CpG sites: the spontaneously occurring deamination of a methylated cytosine results in a thymine, and the resulting G:T mismatched bases are often improperly resolved to A:T; whereas the deamination of unmethylated cytosine results in a uracil, which as a foreign base is quickly replaced by a cytosine by the base excision repair mechanism. The C to T transition rate at methylated CpG sites is ~10 fold higher than at unmethylated sites.

=== Genomic distribution ===
CpG dinucleotides frequently occur in CpG islands (see definition of CpG islands, below). There are 28,890 CpG islands in the human genome, (50,267 if one includes CpG islands in repeat sequences). This is in agreement with the 28,519 CpG islands found by Venter et al. since the Venter et al. genome sequence did not include the interiors of highly similar repetitive elements and the extremely dense repeat regions near the centromeres. Since CpG islands contain multiple CpG dinucleotide sequences, there appear to be more than 20 million CpG dinucleotides in the human genome.

== CpG islands ==
CpG islands (or CG islands) are regions with a high frequency of CpG sites. Though objective definitions for CpG islands are limited, the usual formal definition is a region with at least 200 bp, a GC percentage greater than 50%, and an observed-to-expected CpG ratio greater than 60%. The &quot;observed-to-expected CpG ratio&quot; can be derived where the observed is calculated as: formula_2 and the expected as formula_3 or formula_4.

Many genes in mammalian genomes have CpG islands associated with the start of the gene (promoter regions). Because of this, the presence of a CpG island is used to help in the prediction and annotation of genes.

In mammalian genomes, CpG islands are typically 300–3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately 40% of promoters of mammalian genes. Over 60% of human genes and almost all house-keeping genes have their promoters embedded in CpG islands. Given the frequency of GC two-nucleotide sequences, the number of CpG dinucleotides is much lower than would be expected. 

A 2002 study revised the rules of CpG island prediction to exclude other GC-rich genomic sequences such as Alu repeats. Based on an extensive search on the complete sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22, DNA regions greater than 500 bp were found more likely to be the &quot;true&quot; CpG islands associated with the 5&#x27; regions of genes if they had a GC content greater than 55%, and an observed-to-expected CpG ratio of 65%.

CpG islands are characterized by CpG dinucleotide content of at least 60% of that which would be statistically expected (~4–6%), whereas the rest of the genome has much lower CpG frequency (~1%), a phenomenon called CG suppression. Unlike CpG sites in the coding region of a gene, in most instances the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated if the genes are expressed. This observation led to the speculation that methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression. Methylation, along with histone modification, is central to imprinting. Most of the methylation differences between tissues, or between normal and cancer samples, occur a short distance from the CpG islands (at &quot;CpG island shores&quot;) rather than in the islands themselves.

CpG islands typically occur at or near the transcription start site of genes, particularly housekeeping genes, in vertebrates. A C (cytosine) base followed immediately by a G (guanine) base (a CpG) is rare in vertebrate DNA because the cytosines in such an arrangement tend to be methylated. This methylation helps distinguish the newly synthesized DNA strand from the parent strand, which aids in the final stages of DNA proofreading after duplication. However, over time methylated cytosines tend to turn into thymines because of spontaneous deamination. There is a special enzyme in humans (Thymine-DNA glycosylase, or TDG) that specifically replaces T&#x27;s from T/G mismatches. However, due to the rarity of CpGs, it is theorised to be insufficiently effective in preventing a possibly rapid mutation of the dinucleotides. The existence of CpG islands is usually explained by the existence of selective forces for relatively high CpG content, or low levels of methylation in that genomic area, perhaps having to do with the regulation of gene expression. A 2011 study showed that most CpG islands are a result of non-selective forces.

== Methylation, silencing, cancer, and aging ==

=== CpG islands in promoters ===

In humans, about 70% of promoters located near the transcription start site of a gene (proximal promoters) contain a CpG island.

Distal promoter elements also frequently contain CpG islands. An example is the DNA repair gene &quot;ERCC1&quot;, where the CpG island-containing element is located about 5,400 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site of the &quot;ERCC1&quot; gene. CpG islands also occur frequently in promoters for functional noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs.

=== Methylation of CpG islands stably silences genes ===

In humans, DNA methylation occurs at the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring of the cytosine residues within CpG sites to form 5-methylcytosines. The presence of multiple methylated CpG sites in CpG islands of promoters causes stable silencing of genes. Silencing of a gene may be initiated by other mechanisms, but this is often followed by methylation of CpG sites in the promoter CpG island to cause the stable silencing of the gene.

=== Promoter CpG hyper/hypo-methylation in cancer ===

In cancers, loss of expression of genes occurs about 10 times more frequently by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands than by mutations. For example, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. In contrast, in one study of colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, 1,734 CpG islands were heavily methylated in tumors whereas these CpG islands were not methylated in the adjacent mucosa. Half of the CpG islands were in promoters of annotated protein coding genes, suggesting that about 867 genes in a colon tumor have lost expression due to CpG island methylation. A separate study found an average of 1,549 differentially methylated regions (hypermethylated or hypomethylated) in the genomes of six colon cancers (compared to adjacent mucosa), of which 629 were in known promoter regions of genes. A third study found more than 2,000 genes differentially methylated between colon cancers and adjacent mucosa. Using gene set enrichment analysis, 569 out of 938 gene sets were hypermethylated and 369 were hypomethylated in cancers. Hypomethylation of CpG islands in promoters results in overexpression of the genes or gene sets affected.

One 2012 study listed 147 specific genes with colon cancer-associated hypermethylated promoters, along with the frequency with which these hypermethylations were found in colon cancers. At least 10 of those genes had hypermethylated promoters in nearly 100% of colon cancers. They also indicated 11 microRNAs whose promoters were hypermethylated in colon cancers at frequencies between 50% and 100% of cancers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair with sequences in messenger RNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. On average, each microRNA represses several hundred target genes. Thus microRNAs with hypermethylated promoters may be allowing over-expression of hundreds to thousands of genes in a cancer.

The information above shows that, in cancers, promoter CpG hyper/hypo-methylation of genes and of microRNAs causes loss of expression (or sometimes increased expression) of far more genes than does mutation.

=== DNA repair genes with hyper/hypo-methylated promoters in cancers ===

DNA repair genes are frequently repressed in cancers due to hypermethylation of CpG islands within their promoters. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas at least 15 DNA repair genes have frequently hypermethylated promoters; these genes are &quot;XRCC1, MLH3, PMS1, RAD51B, XRCC3, RAD54B, BRCA1, SHFM1, GEN1, FANCE, FAAP20, SPRTN, SETMAR, HUS1,&quot; and &quot;PER1&quot;. About seventeen types of cancer are frequently deficient in one or more DNA repair genes due to hypermethylation of their promoters. As an example, promoter hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene &quot;MGMT&quot; occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers. Promoter hypermethylation of &quot;LIG4&quot; occurs in 82% of colorectal cancers. Promoter hypermethylation of &quot;NEIL1&quot; occurs in 62% of head and neck cancers and in 42% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Promoter hypermethylation of &quot;ATM&quot; occurs in 47% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Promoter hypermethylation of &quot;MLH1&quot; occurs in 48% of non-small-cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinomas. Promoter hypermethylation of &quot;FANCB&quot; occurs in 46% of head and neck cancers.

On the other hand, the promoters of two genes, &quot;PARP1&quot; and &quot;FEN1&quot;, were hypomethylated and these genes were over-expressed in numerous cancers. &quot;PARP1&quot; and &quot;FEN1&quot; are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joining. If this pathway is over-expressed the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer. PARP1 is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma, FEN1 is over-expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreatic, and lung.

DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If accurate DNA repair is deficient, DNA damages tend to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms). Thus, CpG island hyper/hypo-methylation in the promoters of DNA repair genes are likely central to progression to cancer.

=== Methylation of CpG sites with age ===

Since age has a strong effect on DNA methylation levels on tens of thousands of CpG sites, one can define a highly accurate biological clock (referred to as epigenetic clock or DNA methylation age) in humans and chimpanzees.

=== Unmethylated sites ===
Unmethylated CpG dinucleotide sites can be detected by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells in humans. This is used to detect intracellular viral infection.

== Role of CpG sites in memory ==

In mammals, DNA methyltransferases (which add methyl groups to DNA bases) exhibit a sequence preference for cytosines within CpG sites. In the mouse brain, 4.2% of all cytosines are methylated, primarily in the context of CpG sites, forming 5mCpG. Most hypermethylated 5mCpG sites increase the repression of associated genes.

As reviewed by Duke et al., neuron DNA methylation (repressing expression of particular genes) is altered by neuronal activity. Neuron DNA methylation is required for synaptic plasticity; is modified by experiences; and active DNA methylation and demethylation is required for memory formation and maintenance.

In 2016 Halder et al. using mice, and in 2017 Duke et al. using rats, subjected the rodents to contextual fear conditioning, causing an especially strong long-term memory to form. At 24 hours after the conditioning, in the hippocampus brain region of rats, the expression of 1,048 genes was down-regulated (usually associated with 5mCpG in gene promoters) and the expression of 564 genes was up-regulated (often associated with hypomethylation of CpG sites in gene promoters). At 24 hours after training, 9.2% of the genes in the rat genome of hippocampus neurons were differentially methylated. However while the hippocampus is essential for learning new information it does not store information itself. In the mouse experiments of Halder, 1,206 differentially methylated genes were seen in the hippocampus one hour after contextual fear conditioning but these altered methylations were reversed and not seen after four weeks. In contrast with the absence of long-term CpG methylation changes in the hippocampus, substantial differential CpG methylation could be detected in cortical neurons during memory maintenance. There were 1,223 differentially methylated genes in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice four weeks after contextual fear conditioning.

=== Demethylation at CpG sites requires ROS activity ===

In adult somatic cells DNA methylation typically occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides (CpG sites), forming 5-methylcytosine-pG, or 5mCpG. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may attack guanine at the dinucleotide site, forming 8-hydroxy-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide site. The base excision repair enzyme OGG1 targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision. OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1 and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG. This initiates demethylation of 5mC.

As reviewed in 2018, in brain neurons, 5mC is oxidized by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases (TET1, TET2, TET3) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In successive steps TET enzymes further hydroxylate 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and excises the glycosidic bond resulting in an apyrimidinic site (AP site). In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (AID/APOBEC) deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5mC can be converted to thymine (Thy). 5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), Nei-Like DNA Glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 (MBD4). AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield cytosine (Cyt).

Two reviews summarize the large body of evidence for the critical and essential role of ROS in memory formation. The DNA demethylation of thousands of CpG sites during memory formation depends on initiation by ROS. In 2016, Zhou et al., showed that ROS have a central role in DNA demethylation.

TET1 is a key enzyme involved in demethylating 5mCpG. However, TET1 is only able to act on 5mCpG if an ROS has first acted on the guanine to form 8-hydroxy-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide (see first figure in this section). After formation of 5mCp-8-OHdG, the base excision repair enzyme OGG1 binds to the 8-OHdG lesion without immediate excision. Adherence of OGG1 to the 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits TET1, allowing TET1 to oxidize the 5mC adjacent to 8-OHdG, as shown in the first figure in this section. This initiates the demethylation pathway shown in the second figure in this section.

Altered protein expression in neurons, controlled by ROS-dependent demethylation of CpG sites in gene promoters within neuron DNA, is central to memory formation.

== CpG loss ==
CpG depletion has been observed in the process of DNA methylation of Transposable Elements (TEs) where TEs are not only responsible in the genome expansion but also CpG loss in a host DNA. TEs can be known as &quot;methylation centers&quot; whereby the methylation process, the TEs spreads into the flanking DNA once in the host DNA. This spreading might subsequently result in CpG loss over evolutionary time. Older evolutionary times show a higher CpG loss in the flanking DNA, compared to the younger evolutionary times. Therefore, the DNA methylation can lead eventually to the noticeably loss of CpG sites in neighboring DNA. 

=== Genome size and CpG ratio are negatively correlated ===

There is generally an inverse correlation between genome size and number of CpG islands, as larger genomes typically have a greater number of transposable elements. Selective pressure against TE&#x27;s is substantially reduced if expression is suppressed via methylation, further TE&#x27;s can act as &quot;methylation centres&quot; facilitating methylation of flanking DNA. Since methylation reduces selective pressure on nucleotide sequence long term methylation of CpG sites increases accumulation of spontaneous cytosine to thymine transitions, thereby resulting in a loss of Cp sites. 

==== Alu elements as promoters of CpG loss ====
Alu elements are known as the most abundant type of transposable elements. Some studies have used Alu elements as a way to study the factors responsible for genome expansion. Alu elements are CpG-rich in a longer amount of sequence, unlike LINEs and ERVs. Alus can work as a methylation center, and the insertion into a host DNA can produce DNA methylation and provoke a spreading into the Flanking DNA area. This spreading is why there is considerable CpG loss and genome expansion. However, this is a result that is analyzed over time because older Alu elements show more CpG loss in sites of neighboring DNA compared to younger ones.

It was known for carrying Western reports on Iraq&#x27;s conflict with the United States and was said to be the most influential newspaper in the country and alongside the television channel Youth TV (Al-Shabab), which aired reports by other Arab channels not usually heard on Iraq&#x27;s state-run media, it was one of two media administered by Uday Hussein independent from Iraqi authorities.

==History and profile==
&quot;Babel&quot; was launched during the Gulf War in 1991. It was one of the newspapers owned by Uday Hussein. He was also the founder of the paper which was published both in Arabic and English.

The newspaper later criticized the government on the Faith Campaign program, arguing that the campaign would undermine Iraq&#x27;s religiously pluralistic society, and encourage sectarian division, thereby undermining Iraq. The paper argued that Saddam&#x27;s attempt to gain the support of Islamic fundamentalists was ultimately doomed to fail, as such groups would accept nothing less than strict Islamic law. The paper also published letters critical of the government and security services&#x27; tolerance for Iraq&#x27;s growing Salafist movements. At another point, &quot;Babil&quot; however joined in railing against the Shi&#x27;ites, even referring to them as &quot;rafidah&quot;, a hateful epithet normally used by ultraconservative Salafis only.

In July 2002 the newspaper published an article by &quot;Abu Hatim&quot; (an alias used by Uday) which claimed that the American administration was planning to strike Iraq and exert political control in the Middle East. It stated the plans &quot;will extend to include everything&quot;, &quot;starting from making Jordan an alternative homeland for the Palestinians, &quot;dividing Saudi Arabia into at least three parts and obliterating Bahrain&#x27;s identity by returning it as part of Persia.

The paper was banned by the then-Iraqi government for one month in November 2002 for unexplained causes.

<text>CSS &quot;Patrick Henry was a ship built in [[New York City]] in 1859 by the renowned [[William Henry Webb|William H. Webb]] for the Old Dominion Steam Ship Line as the civilian steamer Yorktown&quot;, a brigantine-rigged side-wheel steamer. She carried passengers and freight between Richmond, Virginia, and New York City. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was anchored in the James River when Virginia seceded from the Union on 17 April 1861 and was seized by the Virginia Navy and later turned over to the Confederate Navy on 8 June 1861.

Commander John Randolph Tucker, who commanded the ship, directed that &quot;Yorktown&quot; be converted into a gunboat and renamed &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; in honor of Patrick Henry, the revolutionary patriot and Founding Father. She also served as the first flagship of the James River Squadron.

==Career==
Still commonly referred to as &quot;Yorktown&quot;, she was assigned to a position near Mulberry Island in the James River to protect the right flank of the Confederate Army of the Peninsula.

On 13 September 1861 and again on 2 December, Commander Tucker took &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; down the river to a point about above Newport News, Virginia, and opened fire on the Federal squadron at long range hoping to draw out some of the gunboats. The gambit was refused, but Tucker inflicted some minor damage.

During the Battle of Hampton Roads on 8 March 1862 in which CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; destroyed the Federal warships USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; and USS &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; attempted to take the latter&#x27;s surrender but was fired upon by shore batteries, and took a shell in her steam chest that killed four men. Towed out of action long enough to make repairs, she soon resumed her former position.

During the historic 9 March 1862 action between &quot;Virginia&quot; and USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; fired long range at &quot;Monitor&quot;. The Confederate Congress later accorded special thanks to all officers and men for their gallant conduct during the two-day battle.

&quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was also present during some of &quot;Virginia&quot;″s other actions. In a daring night operation on 5 May 1862, she helped remove Confederate property from the Norfolk Navy Yard before it was abandoned to the Federals.

After the surrender of Norfolk, Virginia, on 10 May 1862, the James River Squadron, including &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, retired up the river to Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, where pursuing Federal ships were repulsed on 15 May.

&quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was designated an academy ship in May 1862 and underwent appropriate alterations. In October 1863, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; housed the floating Confederate States Naval Academy at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, where instruction for 52 midshipmen began under the superintendency of Lieutenant William Harwar Parker. Numbers later increased to sixty, with thirteen teachers in attendance. Sometimes she took part in action with the midshipmen on board.

When Richmond was evacuated on 3 April 1865, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was burned to prevent capture. Her midshipmen were charged with the delivery of a treasury of some CS$500,000 to the new government seat of Danville, Virginia. When they were disbanded each were given $40 in gold to help them reach their homes.

==Commanders==

<text>Soyuz 11 () was the only crewed mission to board the world&#x27;s first space station, Salyut 1. The crew, Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev, arrived at the space station on 7 June 1971, and departed on 29 June 1971. The mission ended in disaster when the crew capsule depressurised during preparations for re-entry, killing the three-person crew. The three crew members of Soyuz 11 are the only humans to have died in space.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Original crew ===
=== Crew notes ===
The original prime crew for Soyuz 11 consisted of Alexei Leonov, Valery Kubasov, and Pyotr Kolodin. A medical X-ray examination four days before launch suggested that Kubasov might have tuberculosis, and according to the mission rules, the prime crew was replaced with the backup crew. For Dobrovolsky and Patsayev, this was to be their first space mission. After the failure of Salyut 2 to orbit, Kubasov and Leonov were reassigned to Soyuz 19 for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975.

== Mission ==
===Parameters ===
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.6°
* Period: 88.3 minutes
===Flight===
The Soyuz 7K-OKS spacecraft was launched on 6 June 1971, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the central Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, and used the callsign &quot;Yantar&quot; (Amber). Several months earlier, the first mission to the Salyut, Soyuz 10, had failed to successfully dock with the station. During the first day of the flight, maneuvers were made to effect a rendezvous with the uncrewed Salyut (1971-032A). When Soyuz 11 was from Salyut, automatic devices took over, and in 24 minutes closed the gap between the two ships to and reduced the relative speed difference to . Control of the ships went from automatic back to manual at . Docking took 3 hours 19 minutes to complete and involved making the connection mechanically rigid, engaging various electrical and hydraulic links, and establishing air-tight seals before locks could be opened. When the pressure was equalized between the ships, the locks were opened and all three members of the crew passed into Salyut 1. Soyuz 11 successfully docked with Salyut 1 on 7 June 1971 and the cosmonauts remained on board for 22 days, setting space endurance records that would hold until the American Skylab 2 mission in May and June 1973.

Upon first entering the station, the crew encountered a smoky and burnt atmosphere, and after replacing part of the ventilation system, spent the next day back in their Soyuz until the air cleared. Their stay in Salyut was productive, including live television broadcasts. A fire broke out on day 11 of their stay, causing mission planners to consider abandoning the station. The planned highlight of the mission was to have been the observation of an N1 rocket launch, but the launch was postponed. The crew also found that using the exercise treadmill, as they were required to twice a day, caused the whole station to vibrate. &quot;Pravda&quot; released news of the mission and regular updates while it was in progress.

=== Re-entry and death===
On 29 June 1971, the three cosmonauts loaded scientific specimens, films, tapes, and other gear into Soyuz 11, then transferred manual control back from Salyut 1 to Soyuz 11 and returned to their ferry craft, with undocking occurring at 18:28 GMT. Soyuz 11 flew co-orbit for a while before it retro-fired at 22:35 GMT in preparation for re-entry. Before re-entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, both the work compartment and the service module were jettisoned. This occurred at about 22:47 GMT. Radio communications abruptly ended when the work compartment separated, well before the normal ionospheric blackout. 

Almost 25 minutes later, Soyuz 11&#x27;s automatic systems landed the craft at 23:16:52 GMT, southwest of Karazhal in Kazakhstan, after an abnormally silent return to Earth. The total flight duration of the crew had been 570.22 hours and involved 383 orbits—18 prior to docking, 362 docked, and three after undocking. When the recovery team opened the capsule of the Soyuz 11, they found all three men dead.

Kerim Kerimov, chair of the State Commission, recalled: &quot;Outwardly, there was no damage whatsoever. They knocked on the side, but there was no response from within. On opening the hatch, they found all three men in their couches, motionless, with dark-blue patches on their faces and trails of blood from their noses and ears. They removed them from the descent module. Dobrovolsky was still warm. The doctors gave artificial respiration. Based on their reports, the cause of death was suffocation&quot;.

=== Cause of death ===
It quickly became apparent that the cosmonauts had asphyxiated. The fault was traced to a breathing ventilation valve, located between the orbital module and the descent module, that had been jolted open as the descent module separated from the service module, 12 minutes and 3 seconds after retrofire. The two modules were held together by explosive bolts designed to fire sequentially; in fact, they had fired simultaneously. The explosive force of the simultaneous bolt firing caused the internal mechanism of the pressure equalisation valve to loosen a seal that was usually discarded later and which normally allowed for automatic adjustment of the cabin pressure. The valve opened at an altitude of , and the resultant loss of pressure was fatal in less than a minute. The valve was located beneath the seats and was impossible to find and block before the air was lost. Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15 minutes 35 seconds after retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Patsayev&#x27;s body was found positioned near the valve, and he may have been attempting to close or block the valve at the time he lost consciousness. An extensive investigation was conducted to study all components and systems of Soyuz 11 that could have caused the accident, although doctors quickly concluded that the cosmonauts had died of asphyxiation.

The autopsies at Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital found that the cause of death for the cosmonauts was haemorrhaging of the blood vessels in their brains, with lesser amounts of bleeding under their skin, in their inner ears, and in their nasal cavities, all of which occurred as exposure to a vacuum environment caused the oxygen and nitrogen in their bloodstreams to bubble and rupture vessels. Their blood was also found to contain heavy concentrations of lactic acid; lactic acid buildup (in tissues and blood) is a sign of inadequate mitochondrial oxygenation, which may be due to hypoxemia (low blood oxygen), poor blood flow (e.g., decompression) or a combination of both. Although they could have remained conscious for almost 40 seconds after decompression began, less than 20 seconds would have passed before the effects of oxygen starvation made it impossible for them to function.

== Aftermath ==
Alexei Leonov, who would have originally commanded Soyuz 11, had advised the cosmonauts before the flight that they should manually close the valves between the orbital and descent modules, as he did not trust them to shut automatically, a procedure he thought up during extensive time in the Soyuz simulator. However, it appears that the crew did not do this. After the flight, Leonov went back and tried closing one of the valves himself, and found that it took nearly a minute to do so, too long in an emergency situation with the spacecraft&#x27;s atmosphere escaping fast.

The Soviet state media attempted to downplay the tragic end of the mission, and instead emphasized its accomplishments during the crew&#x27;s stay aboard Salyut 1. Since they did not publicly announce the exact cause of the cosmonauts&#x27; deaths for almost two years afterwards, United States space planners were extremely worried about the upcoming Skylab program, as they could not be certain whether prolonged time in a micro-g environment had turned out to be fatal. However, NASA doctor Charles Berry maintained a firm conviction that the cosmonauts could not have died from spending too many weeks in weightlessness. Until the Soviets finally disclosed what had really happened, Berry theorized that the crew had died from inhaling toxic substances.

A film that was later declassified showed support crews attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the cosmonauts. Until autopsy, they were not known to have died because of a capsule depressurisation. The ground crew had lost audio contact with the crew before re-entry began, and had already begun preparations for contingencies in case the crew had been lost.

The cosmonauts were given a large state funeral and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square, Moscow, near the remains of Yuri Gagarin. They were also each posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal.

The United States sent Tom Stafford, then NASA&#x27;s Chief Astronaut, to represent President Richard Nixon at the funeral, where the Soviets asked him to be one of the pallbearers. It came at the beginning of a period of more cordial relations between the two nations that would lead to the joint Apollo–Soyuz mission. President Nixon also issued an official statement following the accident:

The Soyuz spacecraft was extensively redesigned after this incident to carry only two cosmonauts. The extra room meant that the crew could wear Sokol space suits during launch and landing. The Sokol was a lightweight pressure suit intended for emergency use; updated versions of the suit remain in use.

== Memorials ==
The Soyuz 11 landed south-west of Karazhal, Karagandy, Kazakhstan, and about north-east of Baikonur. A memorial monument in the form of a three-sided metallic column, with the engraved image of the face of each crew member set into a stylized triangle on each of the three sides, was placed at the site. The memorial is in open, flat country, far from any populated area, within a small, circular fence.

In 2012, the memorial was found to have been vandalized beyond repair, with only the base of the metallic column remaining and any roads leading to it overgrown.

In 2013, Russian space agency Roscosmos restored the site with a redesigned monument, reflecting the three-sided form of the original, but this time constructed from brick. Also placed at the site was a sign explaining the history of the location and the fate of the original monument.

Craters on the Moon were named after the three cosmonauts: Dobrovolʹskiy, Volkov, and Patsaev. The names of the three cosmonauts are included on the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; commemorative plaque placed on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission in August 1971. To honour the loss of the Soyuz 11 crew, a group of hills on Pluto is also named Soyuz Colles.

In the city of Penza, Russia, near the school gymnasium No. 39, in honour of the dead cosmonauts, a memorial stele was made with quotes from the poem by the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko &quot;Between our Motherland and you is a two-way eternal connection&quot; ().

In addition to the Soviet postage stamp depicted above, a series of postage stamps of the Emirate of Ajman and Bulgaria was issued in memory of the cosmonauts in 1971. Equatorial Guinea also released a series of stamps depicting the entire Soyuz 11 mission.

<doc id="198964" wikidata="Q2573675" url="?curid=198964" title="Lockheed EC-130">
<text>The Lockheed Martin EC-130 series comprises several slightly different versions of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules that have been and continue to be operated by the U.S. Air Force and, until the 1990s, the U.S. Navy.

The EC-130E Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center (ABCCC) was based on a basic C-130E platform and provided tactical airborne command post capabilities to air commanders and ground commanders in low air threat environments. The EC-130E ABCCC aircraft were retired in 2002 and the mission was &#x27;migrated&#x27; to the E-8 JSTARS and E-3 AWACS fleets.

The EC-130E Commando Solo was an earlier version of a U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard psychological operations (PSYOPS) aircraft and this aircraft also employed a C-130E airframe, but was modified by using the mission electronic equipment from the retired EC-121S Coronet Solo aircraft. This airframe served during the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), Operation Uphold Democracy, the second Gulf War (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and in Operation Enduring Freedom. The EC-130E was eventually replaced by the EC-130J Commando Solo and retired in 2006.

Based on a C-130H airframe, the [[Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call|EC-130H Compass Call]] is an airborne communications jamming platform operated by the Air Combat Command&#x27;s (ACC) 55th Electronic Combat Group (55 ECG) at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. The EC-130 Compass Call aircraft attempts to disrupt enemy command and control communications and limits adversary coordination essential for enemy force management. The Compass Call system employs offensive counterinformation and electronic attack capabilities in support of U.S. and Coalition tactical air, surface, and special operations forces. The EC-130H was used extensively in the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom, disrupting Iraqi communications at both the strategic and tactical levels. It has also been used in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State.

The EC-130J Commando Solo is a modified C-130J Super Hercules used to conduct psychological operations (PSYOP) and civil affairs broadcast missions in the standard AM, FM, HF, TV and military communications bands. Missions are flown at the maximum altitudes possible to provide optimum propagation patterns. The EC-130J flies during either day or night scenarios with equal success, and is air-refuelable. A typical mission consists of a single-ship orbit which is offset from the desired target audience. The targets may be either military or civilian personnel. The Commando Solo is operated exclusively by the Air National Guard, specifically the 193rd Special Operations Wing (193 SOW), a unit of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard operationally gained by the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The 193 SOW is based at the Harrisburg Air National Guard Base (former Olmstead AFB) at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s EC-130Q Hercules TACAMO (&quot;Take Charge And Move Out&quot;) aircraft was a land-based naval aviation platform that served as a SIOP strategic communications link aircraft for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarine force and as a backup communications link for the USAF manned strategic bomber and intercontinental ballistic missile forces. To ensure survivability, TACAMO operated as a solo platform, well away from and not interacting with other major naval forces such as sea-based aircraft carrier strike groups and their carrier air wings or land-based maritime patrol aircraft. Operated by Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron THREE (VQ-3) and Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron FOUR (VQ-4), the EC-130Q was replaced by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s current TACAMO platform, the Boeing 707-based E-6 Mercury.

in December 2020 (Fiscal Year 2021), the US Navy announced that it awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin for the purchase the C-130J-30 Hercules as testbed for the TACAMO mission The aircraft selection represents a return to the C-130 platform by the Navy, which for years used the EC-130Q (an older variant despite the higher letter) for the TACAMO mission from 1963 until 1993.

In October 2024, the US Navy announced that the new C-130J-30-based TACAMO mission aircraft will be designated E-130J. It will replace the currently operational E-6 Mercury in the near future.

==Design and development==

The EC-130E Commando Solo entered service in 1978 as the EC-130E Coronet Solo with the Tactical Air Command (TAC). In 1983 the Coronet Solo&#x27;s mission was transferred to the Military Airlift Command (MAC) and redesignated the EC-130E Volant Solo. With the formation of Air Force Special Operations Command, the mission was transferred to AFSOC and redesignated Commando Solo. Operations were consolidated under a single-AFSOC gained unit, the 193d Special Operations Wing (193 SOW) of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. In the early 1990s the aircraft were upgraded and designated Commando Solo II. The EC-130E variants were replaced with new EC-130J Commando Solo III aircraft built by Lockheed Martin beginning in 2003.

Highly specialized modifications have been made to the latest version of the EC-130J (Commando Solo III). Included in these mods are enhanced navigation systems, self-protection equipment, and the capability of broadcasting color television on a multitude of worldwide standards throughout the TV VHF/UHF ranges.

Secondary missions include command and control communications countermeasures (C3CM) and limited intelligence gathering. The three variants are EC-130 ABCCC, EC-130E Commando Solo, and the EC-130J Commando Solo. The version currently in service is the EC-130J, as the last EC-130E was retired from service in 2006.

The USAF plans to begin replacing the 15 EC-130H Compass Call aircraft in 2020 with a commercial airframe transplanted with the Compass Call&#x27;s electronic gear. In September 2017, the Air Force announced that L3 Technologies will serve as the lead systems integrator for a future Compass Call aircraft based on the Gulfstream G550 business jet. The new Compass Call platform was designated as EA-37B by Air Combat Command on November 14, 2023.

==Operational history==
Entering service with the Tactical Air Command (TAC), the EC-130E Commando Solo was originally modified by using the mission electronic equipment from the EC-121S Coronet Solo. Soon after the then-193rd Special Operations Group received its EC-130s, the unit participated in the rescue of US citizens in Operation Urgent Fury, acting as an airborne radio station informing those people on Grenada of the US military action. In 1989, the EC-130 Commando Solo was instrumental in the success of coordinated psychological operations in Operation Just Cause, again broadcasting continuously throughout the initial phases of the operation to help end the Manuel Noriega regime. In 1990, the EC-130E joined the newly formed Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and has since been designated Commando Solo, with no change in mission.

More recently, in 1994, the EC-130E Commando Solo was used to broadcast radio and television messages to the citizens and leaders of Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. The EC-130s deployed early in the operation, highlighting the importance of PSYOP in avoiding military and civilian casualties. President Aristide was featured on the broadcasts which contributed significantly to the orderly transition from military rule to democracy.

The aircraft was also deployed during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, broadcasting a recording from Raymond Joseph (Haiti&#x27;s ambassador to the United States) warning residents not to attempt to flee to the United States by sea. The aircraft also broadcast announcements of where earthquake victims can go for food and aid, news from Voice of America, and instructions on hygiene procedures to prevent disease.

On the second day of Operation Odyssey Dawn, an EC-130J warned Libyan shipping &quot;Libyan ships or vessels do not leave port, the Gaddafi regime forces are violating a United Nations resolution ordering the end to the hostilities in your country. If you attempt to leave port, you will be attacked and destroyed immediately. For your own safety do not leave port.&quot; The unencrypted message in Arabic, French and English was recorded by a ham radio operator in the Netherlands.

The EC-130 has been flown in operations against the Islamic State in Iraq to jam their communications.

<text>In cooperative game theory, the Shapley value is a method (solution concept) for fairly distributing the total gains or costs among a group of players who have collaborated. For example, in a team project where each member contributed differently, the Shapley value provides a way to determine how much credit or blame each member deserves. It was named in honor of Lloyd Shapley, who introduced it in 1951 and won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for it in 2012. 

The Shapley value determines each player&#x27;s contribution by considering how much the overall outcome changes when they join each possible combination of other players, and then averaging those changes. In essence, it calculates each player&#x27;s average marginal contribution across all possible coalitions. It is the only solution that satisfies four fundamental properties: efficiency, symmetry, additivity, and the dummy player (or null player) property, which are widely accepted as defining a fair distribution.

This method is used in many fields, from dividing profits in business partnerships to understanding feature importance in machine learning.
== Formal definition ==

Formally, a coalitional game is defined as:
There is a set &quot;N&quot; (of &quot;n&quot; players) and a function formula_1 that maps subsets of players to the real numbers: formula_2, with formula_3, where formula_4 denotes the empty set. The function formula_1 is called a characteristic function.

The function formula_6 has the following meaning: if &quot;S&quot; is a coalition of players, then formula_6(&quot;S&quot;), called the worth of coalition &quot;S&quot;, describes the total expected sum of payoffs the members of formula_8 can obtain by cooperation.

The Shapley value is one way to distribute the total gains to the players, assuming that they all collaborate. It is a &quot;fair&quot; distribution in the sense that it is the only distribution with certain desirable properties listed below. According to the Shapley value, the amount that player &quot;i&quot; is given in a coalitional game formula_9 is

:formula_10

Each value formula_11 represents the value of player formula_12 to player formula_13. This matrix satisfies

: formula_14

i.e. the value of player formula_12 to the whole game is the sum of their value to all individual players.

In terms of the synergy formula_16 defined above, this reads

: formula_17

where the sum goes over all subsets formula_8 of formula_19 that contain formula_12 and formula_13.

This can be interpreted as sum over all subsets that contain players formula_12 and formula_13, where for each subset formula_8 you 
* take the synergy formula_25 of that subset
* divide it by the number of players in the subset formula_26. Interpret that as the surplus value player formula_12 gains from this coalition
* further divide this by formula_26 to get the part of player formula_12&#x27;s value that&#x27;s attributed to player formula_13

In other words, the synergy value of each coalition is evenly divided among all formula_31 pairs formula_32 of players in that coalition, where formula_12 generates surplus for formula_13.

== Shapley value regression==
Shapley value regression is a statistical method used to measure the contribution of individual predictors in a regression model. In this context, the &quot;players&quot; are the individual predictors or variables in the model, and the &quot;gain&quot; is the total explained variance or predictive power of the model. This method ensures a fair distribution of the total gain among the predictors, attributing each predictor a value representing its contribution to the model&#x27;s performance. Lipovetsky (2006) discussed the use of Shapley value in regression analysis, providing a comprehensive overview of its theoretical underpinnings and practical applications.

Shapley value contributions are recognized for their balance of stability and discriminating power, which make them suitable for accurately measuring the importance of service attributes in market research. Several studies have applied Shapley value regression to key drivers analysis in marketing research. Pokryshevskaya and Antipov (2012) utilized this method to analyze online customers&#x27; repeat purchase intentions, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding consumer behavior. Similarly, Antipov and Pokryshevskaya (2014) applied Shapley value regression to explain differences in recommendation rates for hotels in South Cyprus, highlighting its utility in the hospitality industry. Further validation of the benefits of Shapley value in key-driver analysis is provided by Vriens, Vidden, and Bosch (2021), who underscored its advantages in applied marketing analytics.

== In machine learning ==
The Shapley value provides a principled way to explain the predictions of nonlinear models common in the field of machine learning. By interpreting a model trained on a set of features as a value function on a coalition of players, Shapley values provide a natural way to compute which features contribute to a prediction or contribute to the uncertainty of a prediction. This unifies several other methods including Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), DeepLIFT, and Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation. 

Distributional values are an extension of the Shapley value and related value operators designed to preserve the probabilistic output of predictive models in machine learning, including neural network classifiers and large language models.

The statistical understanding of Shapley values remains an ongoing research question. A smooth version, called Shapley curves, achieves the minimax rate and is shown to be asymptotically Gaussian in a nonparametric setting. Confidence intervals for finite samples can be obtained via the wild bootstrap.

<doc id="198967" wikidata="Q863952" url="?curid=198967" title="GBU-43/B MOAB">
<text>The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB, , colloquially explained as &quot;mother of all bombs&quot;) is a large-yield bomb, developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr. of the Air Force Research Laboratory. It was first tested in 2003. At the time of development, it was said to be the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the American arsenal. The bomb is designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants. The bomb&#x27;s name and nickname were inspired by Iraqi president Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invocation of the &quot;mother of all battles&quot; (&quot;Umm al-Ma&#x27;arik&quot;) during the 1991 Gulf War.

The MOAB was first deployed in combat in the 13 April 2017 airstrike against an Islamic State – Khorasan Province tunnel complex in Achin District, Afghanistan.

==Design and development==
The basic principle resembles that of the BLU-82 &quot;Daisy Cutter&quot;, which was used to clear heavily wooded areas in the Vietnam War. Decades later, the BLU-82 was used in Afghanistan in November 2001 against the Taliban. Its success as a weapon of intimidation led to the decision to develop the MOAB. Pentagon officials suggested MOAB might be used as an anti-personnel weapon, as part of the &quot;shock and awe&quot; strategy integral to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

GBU-43s are delivered from C-130 cargo aircraft, inside which they are carried on cradles resting on airdrop platforms. The bombs are dropped by deploying drogue parachutes, which also extract the cradle and platform from the aircraft. Shortly after launch the drogues are released and the bomb falls without the use of a retarding parachute. GPS satellite-guidance is used to guide bombs to their targets.

The MOAB is not a penetrator weapon and is primarily an air burst bomb intended for soft to medium surface targets covering extended areas and targets in a contained environment such as a deep canyon or within a cave system. High altitude carpet-bombing with much smaller bombs delivered via heavy bombers such as the B-52, B-2, or the B-1 is also highly effective at covering large areas.

The MOAB is designed to be used against a specific target, and cannot by itself replicate the effects of a typical heavy bomber mission. During the Vietnam War&#x27;s Operation Arc Light program, for example, the United States Air Force sent B-52s on well over 10,000 bombing raids, each usually carried out by two groups of three aircraft. A typical mission dropped 168 tons of ordnance, dropping the bombs over an area with an explosive force equivalent to 10 to 17 MOABs.

MOAB was first tested with the explosive tritonal on 11 March 2003, on Range 70 located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. It was tested again on 21 November 2003.

Since 2003, 15 MOABs have been manufactured at the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in McAlester, Oklahoma.

The Air Force has said the MOAB has a unit price of $170,000, but this is a historical unit cost made in the mid-2000s and various factors of the bomb&#x27;s atypical development process have made exact cost estimation difficult. The Air Force Research Lab generated the value based on already existing parts such as bomb casing and metals, and since the bomb was built in-house, they did not pay for outside research or have standard procurement costs associated with it. MOAB was a &quot;crash project&quot; developed for use against an adversary with uncertain tactics on unfamiliar terrain, and so was an effort to meet an urgent need rather than a formal program. Should more bombs be ordered to be built, manufacturing would likely be started over with higher costs due to a lack of old parts, price inflation, and new design and testing.

==Operational use==

On 13 April 2017, a MOAB was dropped on an Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISKP) cave complex in Achin District, Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. It was the first operational use of the bomb. Two days later, an Afghan army spokesman said that the strike killed 94 ISKP militants, including four commanders, with no signs of civilian casualties. However, an Afghan parliamentarian from Nangarhar province, Esmatullah Shinwari, said locals told him the explosion killed a teacher and his young son. Former US military official Marc Garlasco, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said that the US had not previously used the MOAB because of worries that it would inadvertently hurt or kill civilians.

==Similar weapons==
During World War II, Royal Air Force Bomber Command used the Grand Slam, officially known as the &quot;Bomb, Medium Capacity, 22,000 lb&quot; 42 times. At total weight, these earthquake bombs were larger and heavier than the MOAB. However, half their weight was due to the cast high tensile steel casing necessary for penetrating the ground – up to – before exploding. The MOAB, in contrast, has a light aluminum casing surrounding of explosive Composition H-6 material.

The United States Air Force&#x27;s T-12 Cloudmaker demolition bomb (similar in design to the Grand Slam), developed after World War II, carried a heavier explosive charge than the MOAB, but was never used in combat.

In 2007, the Russian military announced that they had tested a thermobaric weapon nicknamed the &quot;Father of All Bombs&quot; (&quot;FOAB&quot;). The weapon is claimed to be four times as powerful as the MOAB, but its specifications are disputed.

The MOAB is the most powerful conventional bomb ever used in combat as measured by the weight of its explosive material. The explosive yield is comparable to that of the smallest tactical nuclear weapons, such as the Cold War-era American M-388 projectile fired by the portable Davy Crockett recoilless gun. The M-388, a W54 nuclear warhead variant, weighed less than .

<doc id="198969" wikidata="Q16259135" url="?curid=198969" title="United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office">
<text>All officers of the eight uniformed services of the United States swear or affirm an oath of office upon commissioning. It differs from that of the oath of enlistment that enlisted members recite when they enter the service. It is required by statute, the oath being prescribed by Section 3331, Title 5, United States Code. It is traditional for officers to recite the oath upon promotion but as long as the officer&#x27;s service is continuous this is not required.

==Text of the oath==
The oath applies while in &quot;the office on which I am about to enter.&quot;

Officers of the National Guard of the various states, however, take an additional oath:

Commissioned officers O-1 (second lieutenant or ensign) through O-10 (general or admiral) and W-2 through W-5 (chief warrant officers) are commissioned under the authority of the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate; warrant officers (W-1) receive a warrant under the authority of their respective service secretary (e.g., the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Navy); National Guard officers are additionally committed to the authority of the governor of their state. They may be activated in the service of their state in time of local or state emergency in addition to federal activation. Reserve officers may only be activated by the President of the United States.

===Air Force===
Officers of the United States Air Force take the following oath:
==History==
The first oaths of office were given to those serving under the Continental Army, beginning in 1775. A candidate had to not only name the 13 states, but also swear to keep them &quot;free, independent and sovereign states and declare no allegiance to George the third, king of Great Britain&quot; as well as &quot;defend the United States against King George, his heirs and successors, and his and their abettors, assistants and adherents&quot;.

It was first updated in September 1776, after the Declaration of Independence, to swear to be &quot;true to the United States of America, and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies opposers whatsoever; and to observe and obey the orders of the Continental Congress and the orders of the Generals and officers set over me by them&quot;.

This was changed in 1789 to place allegiance to the Constitution of the United States at the beginning of the oath. It remained relatively unchanged until the 1860s. At this point, the reference to &quot;them&quot; was replaced with &quot;it&quot; to reflect the realities of the divided nation during the American Civil War, as well as the shifting attitude of viewing the United States as one entity rather than a collection of smaller ones. The conflict also resulted in adding the phrase &quot;...all enemies, Foreign &quot;and domestic&quot;,&quot; in reference to Confederate sympathizers, as well as &quot;without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion&quot; in reference to members who were secretly supporting the South. In 1868, the officer oath was simplified to:

The enlisted oath underwent further revision and, as of 1862, read:

<text>A thing, also known as a folkmoot, assembly, tribal council, and by other names, was a governing assembly in early Germanic society, made up of the free people of the community presided over by a lawspeaker. Things took place regularly, usually at prominent places accessible by travel. They provided legislative functions, as well as social events and trade opportunities. In modern usage, the meaning of this word in English and other languages has shifted to mean not just an assemblage of some sort but simply an object of any kind. Thingstead () or &quot;thingstow&quot; () is the English term for the location where a thing was held.

==Etymology==

The word appears in Old Norse, Old English, and modern Icelandic as , in Middle English (as in modern English), Old Saxon, Old Dutch, and Old Frisian as (the difference between &quot;þing&quot; and &quot;thing&quot; is purely orthographical), in German as , in Dutch and Afrikaans as , and in modern Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Faroese, Gutnish, and Norn as . The place where a thing was held was called a &quot;thingstead&quot; or &quot;thingstow&quot;. An alternative Proto-Germanic form of the word &#x27;thing&#x27; was &quot;*þingsō&quot;, whence Gothic &#x27;time&#x27;. All of these terms derive from *&quot;þingą&quot; meaning &quot;appointed time,&quot; possibly originating in Proto-Indo-European *&quot;ten-&quot;, &quot;stretch,&quot; as in a &quot;stretch of time for an assembly&quot;.

In English, the term is attested from 685 to 686 in the older meaning &quot;assembly&quot;; later, it referred to a being, entity or matter (sometime before 899), and then also an act, deed, or event (from about 1000). The original sense of &quot;meeting, assembly&quot; did not survive the shift to Middle English. The meaning of personal possessions, commonly in the plural, first appears in Middle English around 1300, and eventually led to the modern sense of &quot;object&quot;. This semantic development from &quot;assembly&quot; to &quot;object&quot; is mirrored in the evolution of the Latin (&quot;judicial lawsuit&quot;, &quot;case&quot;) to modern French , Spanish/Italian/Catalan , and Portuguese (all meaning &quot;object&quot; or &quot;thing&quot;) and the cognate to English &quot;sake&quot; (purpose), in Norwegian and Swedish, in Danish, in Dutch, in Afrikaans, and in German, which in languages like Old Norse meant &quot;accusation, lawsuit,&quot; but today also carries the sense &quot;thing, object&quot;.

Today the term lives on in the English term &quot;hustings&quot; and in the names of national legislatures and political and judicial institutions of some Nordic countries (e.g. the Icelandic parliament, the Alþing) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald). In modern German and Dutch, the day Tuesday is named after the thing, namely &quot; and &#x27;.&#x27;

==Early attestations==

The first detailed description of a thing was made by Tacitus in 98 CE. Tacitus suggested that the things were annual delegate-based meetings that served legal and military functions.

The oldest written reference to a thing is on a stone pillar found along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall at Housesteads Roman Fort in Northumberland in the United Kingdom. It is dated 43–410 CE and reads:
The pillar was raised by a Frisian auxiliary unit of the Roman army deployed at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The name Tuihanti refers to the current region Twente, which is in the east of the Netherlands. However, these Tuihanti tribesmen have been interpreted by different historians as Frisians. Deo Mars Thincsus means &#x27;god Mars of the Thing&#x27;. &quot;Mars of the Thing&quot; may be interpreted in analogy with the week-day name (the Germanic Tuesday corresponding to Latin &#x27;the day of Mars&#x27;; cf. ) as &quot;Tīwaz&quot; of the Thing. The god Tīwaz (Old English , Old Norse ) was likely important in early Germanic times and has numerous places in England and Denmark named after him. The possible theonyms Beda and Fimmilena in the same inscription relate to the &quot;bodthing&quot; and &quot;fimelthing&quot;, two specific types of assemblies were recorded in Old Frisian codices from around 1100 onward. Perhaps the distinction was that the fixed thing was protected by the god Thincsus, the extraordinary thing by Beda, and the informative or non-decision-making thing by Fimmilena.

The Anglo-Saxon &quot;folkmoot&quot; (;; ) was analogous, the forerunner to the witenagemōt &quot;royal council&quot; and a precursor of the modern Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==Use in Germanic society==

In the Viking Age, things were the public assemblies of the free men of a country, province, or a hundred (, ). They functioned as parliaments and courts at different levels of society—local, regional, and supra-regional. Their purpose was to solve disputes and make political decisions, and thingsteads were often places for public religious rites. According to Norway&#x27;s Law of the Gulating, only free men of full age could participate in the assembly. According to written sources, women were present at some things despite being left out of decision-making bodies, such as the Icelandic Althing.

For prechristian Norse clans, the members of a clan were obliged to avenge injuries against their dead and mutilated relatives. As a result, feuding is often seen as the most common form of conflict resolution used in Viking society. However, things are in a more general sense, balancing structures used to reduce tribal feuds and avoid social disorder in North Germanic cultures. They played an essential role in Viking society as forums for conflict resolution, marriage alliances, power display, honor, and inheritance settlements.

In Sweden, assemblies were held at natural and man-made mounds, often burial mounds. Specifically in Scandinavia, unusually large runestones and inscriptions suggesting a local family&#x27;s attempt to claim supremacy are standard features of thingsteads. It is common for assembly sites close to communication routes, such as navigable water routes and clear land routes.

The thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains and kings, and judged according to the law, which was memorized and recited by the lawspeaker (judge). The thing&#x27;s negotiations were presided over by the lawspeaker and the chieftain or the king. More and more scholarly discussions centre around the things being forerunners to democratic institutions as we know them today. The Icelandic Althing is considered to be the oldest surviving parliament in the world, the Norwegian Gulating also dating back to 900–1300. While the things were not democratic assemblies in the modern sense of an elected body, they were built around ideas of neutrality and representation, effectively representing the interests of larger numbers of people. In Norway, the thing was a space where free men and elected officials met and discussed matters of collective interest, such as taxation. Though some scholars say that the things were dominated by the most influential members of the community, the heads of clans and wealthy families, other scholars describe how every free man could put forward his case for deliberation and share his opinions. History professor Torgrim Titlestad describes how Norway, with the thing sites, displayed an advanced political system over a thousand years ago, one that was characterized by high participation and democratic ideologies. These things also served as courts of law, and if one of the smaller things could not reach agreement, the matter at hand would be brought to one of the bigger things, which encompassed larger areas. The legislature of Norway is still known as the Storting (Big Thing) today.

Towards the end of the Viking Age, royal power became centralized, and the kings consolidated power and control over assemblies. As a result, things lost most of their political role and began to function mainly as courts in the later Middle Ages.

===Norway===
In the period between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, Norway went through a state-formation process that elevated the control and power of the king. On the regional level, it has been assumed that the king would have taken control of the organization of assemblies via local representatives. Today, few thingsteads from Norway are known for sure, and as new assembly sites are found, scholars question whether these are old jurisdiction districts which the king used as a foundation for his organization or whether he created new administrative units. In southeast Norway in particular, one hypothesis for why the king would have established new thing sites might be that they were a &quot;strategic geopolitical response to the threat from the Danish king in the beginning of the 11th century.&quot; Since the record of Norwegian thing sites is not comprehensive, it is not favorable to rely on archeological and topographical characteristics to determine whether they were established before the state-formation period.

In northern and southwestern Norway, there appears to have been a close association between chieftains&#x27; farms and sites interpreted as assemblies or court sites. These areas were considered neutral ground where the landowning elite could meet for political reasons and for Norse rituals. This view is based partly on Norse sagas&#x27; narratives of Viking chieftains and the distribution of large grave mounds. Ultimately, this neutrality was important for thing participants&#x27; cooperation; royal officials required cooperation to look after the king&#x27;s interests in local areas. In this regard, Norwegian things became an arena for cooperation between the royal representatives and the farmers.

Based on what is known from later medieval documents, one deep-rooted custom of Norwegian law areas was the bearing of arms coming from the old tradition of the wapentake &quot;weapon-take&quot;, which refers to the rattling of weapons at meetings to agree. The Law of the Gulating provides that the handling of these weapons should be controlled and regulated.

This is seen at Haugating, the thing for Vestfold in Norway, which was located in Tønsberg at Haugar (from the Old Norse &quot;haugr&quot; meaning hill or mound). This site was one of Norway&#x27;s most important places for the proclamation of kings. In 1130, Harald Gille called together a meeting at the Haugating, where he was declared King of Norway. Sigurd Magnusson was proclaimed king in 1193 at the Haugating. Magnus VII was acclaimed hereditary King of Norway and Sweden at the Haugating in August 1319.

===Sweden===

Similar to Norway, thing sites in Sweden experienced changes in administrative organization beginning in the late tenth and eleventh century. This resulted from the power struggle between the rising Christian royal power establishing itself and the old, local magnate families attempting to maintain control. The battle for power between the king and local magnates is most visible through runic inscriptions at thing sites used to make power statements. Swedish assembly sites could be characterized by several typical features: large mounds, rune-stones, and crossings between roads by land or water to allow for greater accessibility.

A famous incident took place when Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker told the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung (c. 980–1022) that the people, not the king, held power in Sweden; the king realized that he was powerless against the thing and gave in. The main things in Sweden were the Thing of all Swedes, the Thing of all Geats, and the Lionga thing.

The island of Gotland had twenty things in late medieval times, each represented at the island-thing called &quot;landsting&quot; by its elected judge. New laws were decided at the &quot;landsting&quot;, which also took other decisions regarding the island. The &quot;landsting&quot;″s authority was successively eroded after the island was occupied by the Teutonic Order in 1398. In late medieval times, the thing comprised twelve representatives for the farmers, free-holders or tenants.

===Iceland===
As a representative legislative body, the things in Iceland were similar to those in greater Scandinavia but had a clear organizational structure. Iceland was divided into four administrative quarters during the Viking Age with a fixed number of thirty-nine goðis &quot;lawmakers&quot;: twelve &quot;goðis&quot; in the northern quarter and nine each in the eastern, southern, and western quarters.

The main distinction between Iceland and greater Scandinavia lies in the organization of the Icelandic Althing (&quot;Alþingi&quot;), the main assembly during the Viking period and the Middle Ages. Unlike other European societies in the Middle Ages, Iceland was unique for relying on the Althing&#x27;s legislative and judicial institutions at the national level rather than an executive branch of government. Þingvellir was the site of the Althing, and it was a place where people came together once a year to bring cases to court, render judgments, and discuss laws and politics. At the annual Althing, the thirty-nine &quot;goðis&quot; along with nine others served as voting members of the Law Council (Lögrétta), a legislative assembly. The Lögrétta reviewed the laws which the lawspeaker recited, made new laws, set fines and punishments and were informed of sentences of outlawry and banishment passed by the courts in local spring assemblies.

Besides the Althing, there were local assembly districts in each of the four quarters of Iceland, and each year a Spring Assembly (&quot;vorþing&quot;) was brought together by three &quot;goðis&quot; who lived in each local assembly district (&quot;samþingsgoðar&quot;). The four quarters also had courts (&quot;fjórðungsdómar&quot;) that met at the Althing after a constitutional reform around 965. The &quot;goðis&quot; appointed the judges for these courts from the farmers in their districts.

===Greenland===
In the early twentieth century, scholars identified two potential Greenlandic thing sites at Brattahlíð in Eiríksfjörður and Garðar in Einarsfjörður; both are located in the Eastern Settlement of Greenland. These two sites were located through written sources and archeological evidence. Between these two Greenlandic sites, several overlapping characteristics support the hypothesis that these booth sites are assemblies. However, not all &quot;assembly features&quot; previously seen in Scandinavia appear at every assembly site, and there are also characteristics that have either not been recorded in Greenland or are unique to Greenland.

The temporary turf structures of Greenland have only been recorded in Iceland and would not have been seen at the assembly sites of Viking Age Sweden. Further, the booth sites at Brattahlíð and Garðar were close to high-status farms. Taken together, it indicates that trade would have taken place at these sites, and given the sparse nature of the Greenlandic settlement, it is reasonable that the participants of a thing would have taken the opportunity for social interaction or trade when gathered with others.

===British Isles===
In England, there is Thingwall on the Wirral. In the Yorkshire and former Danelaw areas of England, wapentakes—another name for the same institution—were used in public records. Several places ending in the &quot;-by&quot; &quot;village&quot; place name suffix originally possessed their laws, by-laws, and jurisdiction subject to the wapentake in which they served, which often extended over a surrounding ground called a thorpe &quot;hamlet&quot;. If there were a riding surrounding the wapentake, the wapentake would merely be a local assembly coordinating the power of the riding. In Scandinavian York&#x27;s case, it would be under the king&#x27;s command at what is now King&#x27;s Square, York.

The Kingdom of East Anglia controlled the Danelaw, which had been organized as the Five Boroughs. The Five were fortifications defending the land against Wessex, or against the Vikings, depending on who ruled there; together with Lindsey, Lincolnshire, which was divided into three ridings like Yorkshire. Again, the naming of the two roads named Inner and Outer Ting Tong on a hill-top in Devon between Budleigh Salterton, Woodbury and Exmouth is widely derided as fanciful, but may be derived from Thing-Tun, a &quot;dun&quot; (hill fort) or &quot;tun&quot; (settlement) around the place where the Thing used to meet.

Thynghowe was an important Danelaw meeting place, or thing, located in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, England. It was lost to history until its rediscovery in 2005–06 by local history enthusiasts Lynda Mallett and Stuart Reddish. The site lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands in Sherwood Forest. Experts believe it may also indicate the boundary of the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. English Heritage has recently inspected the site, and has confirmed it was known as the &quot;Thynghowe&quot; in 1334 and 1609. It functioned as a place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues. Thynghowe is an Old Norse name, although the site may be older than the Danelaw, perhaps even Bronze Age. &quot;Howe&quot; is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; &quot;mound&quot;. This often indicates the presence of a prehistoric burial mound.

===Frisia===
The Frisian Kingdom knew three levels of things: the highest level of the civitas, the middle level of the pagus, and the lowest level of the centena (hundredth). The pagi are the oldest building block, and they probably took place three times a year and were attended by all freemen. Early-medieval Frisia consisted of about 16 pagi. The other thing levels only became relevant during the Middle Ages. The thing was led by law-speakers called &quot;asega&quot; &quot;lawspeaker&quot;. Every pagus had its own thing, but due to a lack of written sources, it isn&#x27;t easy to establish where the thingsteads were. Thing sites are being presumed by historians at Naaldwijk in the pagus Maasland (Land of the River Meuse), at Katwijk in the pagus Rijnland &quot;land of the Rhine&quot;, at Heemskerk in the pagus Kennemerland, at De Waal in the pagus Texel, at Franeker in the pagus Westergo and at Dokkum in the pagus Oostergo. From the 12th century the thing called Upstalsboom took place on the level of the civitas. At Upstalsboom, near the current town of Aurich in the East Frisia region, Germany, delegates and judges from all seven Frisian sealands used to gather once a year.

===Place names===
The assembly of things were typically held at a specially designated place, often a field or common, like Þingvellir, the old location of the Icelandic Alþing. The parliament of the Isle of Man is still named after the meeting place of the thing, Tynwald, which etymologically is the same word as &quot;þingvellir&quot;; there is still an annual public assembly at Tynwald Hill each July 5, where the new Manx laws are read out and petitions delivered). Other equivalent place names can be found across northern Europe: in Scotland, there is Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands and Tingwall, occurring both in Orkney and Shetland, and further south there is Tinwald, in Dumfries and Galloway and – in England – Thingwall, a village on the Wirral Peninsula. In Sweden, there are several places named Tingvalla, the modern Swedish form of Þingvellir, and the Norwegian equivalent is found in the place name Tingvoll. In Dublin, Ireland, the &quot;Thingmote&quot; was a raised mound, 40 foot high and 240 foot in circumference, where the Norsemen assembled and made their laws. It stood south of the river, where Saint Andrew&#x27;s Church now stands, until 1685.

===Unanswered questions===
It is contested between scholars to what extent things were sites of economic transactions and commerce and arenas for political and legal decisions. In Norway, it is clear that the assemblies functioned as an administrative level for economic transactions and taxes to the king. The role of commerce at the thing is more undetermined in Iceland in particular because of the role of saga literature in influencing conclusions about things. Þingvellir was thought of as a trading place as a result of saga passages and law texts that refer to trade:


As shown in the &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot;, meetings at Þingvellir required people to travel from long distances and gather together for an extended period, thus it was inevitable that entertainment, food, tools, and other goods would have played a role in the gatherings. The main question is whether trade was conducted in the assembly or on the margins of the gathering. Similarly, there are unanswered questions about the connection between trade and assembly in Greenland. Research on Scandinavian trade and assembly is burgeoning, and thus far evidence has mostly been found in written sources, such as the sagas, and place names, &quot;such as the &#x27;Disting&#x27; market that is said to have been held during the thing meetings at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden.&quot;

==National legislatures, current institutions and legal terms==

The national legislatures of Iceland, Norway and Denmark all have names that incorporate &quot;thing&quot;:

* Alþingi The Icelandic &quot;General Thing&quot;
* Folketing – The Danish &quot;People&#x27;s Thing&quot;
* Storting – The Norwegian &quot;Great Thing&quot;

The legislatures of the self-governing territories of Åland, Faroe Islands, Greenland and Isle of Man also have names that refer to &quot;thing&quot;:

* Lagting – The Ålandic &quot;Law Thing&quot;
* Løgting – The Faeroese &quot;Law Thing&quot;; also, the Faeroes are divided into six &quot;várting&quot; (administrative districts)
* Landsting – The Greenlandic &quot;Land Thing&quot;
* Tynwald – The Manx &quot;Thing Meadow&quot; on the Isle of Man, formerly called &quot;Ting&quot;

In addition, &quot;thing&quot; can be found in the name of the Swedish Assembly of Finland (&quot;Svenska Finlands folkting&quot;), a semi-official body representing the Finland Swedish, and those of the three distinct elected Sámi assemblies which are all called &quot;Sameting&quot; in Norwegian and Swedish (Northern Sami &quot;Sámediggi&quot;).

The Swedish national legislature, since medieval times, has borne a different style, Riksdag, which is cognate to the old name of the German national assembly, Reichstag. In Sweden, however, &quot;ting&quot; is used to name the subnational county councils, which are called Landsting. That name was also used in medieval times for the tings that governed the historical Landskap provinces, that were superseded by the counties in the 17th century. The name &quot;ting&quot; is also found in the names of the first level instances of the Swedish and Finnish court system, which are called &quot;tingsrätt&quot; (), the &#x27;court of the thing&#x27;.

Similarly, prior to 1953, the Danish legislature was known as Rigsdagen, which comprised the two houses of the Folketing &quot;People&#x27;s Thing&quot; and Landsting &quot;Land Thing&quot;. The latter, which was reserved for people of means, was abolished by the constitution of 1953.

The Norwegian parliament, the &quot;Storting&quot;, has historically been divided into two chambers named the &quot;Lagting&quot; and the &quot;Odelsting&quot;, which translates loosely into the &quot;Thing of the Law&quot; and the &quot;Thing of the Allodial rights&quot;. However, for much of the Storting&#x27;s recent history, the division into Lagting and Odelsting has been mostly ceremonial, and the Storting has generally operated as a unicameral parliament. A constitutional amendment passed in February 2007 abolished the Lagting and Odelsting, making this &quot;de facto&quot; unicameralism official following the 2009 election.

On the lower administrative level the governing bodies on the county level in Norway are called Fylkesting, the Thing of the County. The names of the judicial courts of Norway contain for the most part the affix &quot;ting&quot;. The primary level of courts is called the &quot;Tingrett&quot;, with the same meaning as the Swedish &quot;Tingsrätt&quot;, and four of the six Norwegian Courts of Appeal are named after historical Norwegian regional Things (&quot;Frostating&quot;, &quot;Gulating&quot;, &quot;Borgarting&quot; and &quot;Eidsivating&quot;).

In Dutch, the word &quot;geding&quot; refers to a lawsuit or trial, most noticeably with the term &quot;kort geding&quot; (literally: &quot;short thing&quot;) which refers to an injunction.

When first published, qmail was the first security-aware mail transport agent; since then, other security-aware MTAs have been published. The most popular predecessor to qmail, Sendmail, was not designed with security as a goal and, as a result, has been a perennial target for attackers. In contrast to sendmail, qmail has a modular architecture composed of mutually untrusting components; for instance, the SMTP listener component of qmail runs with different credentials from the queue manager or the SMTP sender. qmail was also implemented with a security-aware replacement to the C standard library and, as a result, has not been vulnerable to stack and heap overflows, format string attacks or temporary file race conditions.

===Performance===
When it was released, qmail was significantly faster than Sendmail, particularly for bulk mail tasks such as mailing list servers. qmail was originally designed as a way to manage large mailing lists.

===Simplicity===
At the time of qmail&#x27;s introduction, Sendmail configuration was notoriously complex, while qmail was simple to configure and deploy.

===Innovations===
qmail encourages the use of several innovations in mail (some originated by Bernstein, others not):

; Maildir
: Bernstein invented the Maildir format for qmail, which splits individual email messages into separate files. Unlike the &quot;de facto&quot; standard mbox format, which stored all messages in a single file, Maildir avoids many locking and concurrency problems, and can safely be provisioned over NFS. qmail also delivers to mbox mailboxes.

; Wildcard mailboxes
: qmail introduced the concept of user-controlled wildcards. Out of the box, mail addressed to &quot;user-&quot;wildcard&quot;&quot; on qmail hosts is delivered to separate mailboxes, allowing users to publish multiple mail addresses for mailing lists and spam management.

qmail also introduces the Quick Mail Transport Protocol (QMTP), an e-mail transmission protocol that is designed to have better performance than Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the de facto standard; and Quick Mail Queuing Protocol (QMQP), a network protocol designed to share e-mail queues between several hosts.

===Modularity===
qmail is nearly a completely modular system in which each major function is separated from the other major functions. It is easy to replace any part of the qmail system with a different module as long as the new module retains the same interface as the original.

==Controversy==

===Security reward and Georgi Guninski&#x27;s vulnerability===
In 1997, Bernstein offered a US$500 reward for the first person to publish a verifiable security hole in the latest software version.

In 2005, security researcher Georgi Guninski found an integer overflow in qmail. On 64-bit platforms, in default configurations with sufficient virtual memory, the delivery of huge amounts of data to certain qmail components may allow remote code execution. Bernstein disputes that this is a practical attack, arguing that no real-world deployment of qmail would be susceptible. Configuration of resource limits for qmail components mitigates the vulnerability.

On November 1, 2007, Bernstein raised the reward to US$1000. At a slide presentation the following day, Bernstein stated that there were 4 &quot;known bugs&quot; in the ten-year-old qmail-1.03, none of which were &quot;security holes&quot;. He characterized the bug found by Guninski as a &quot;potential overflow of an unchecked counter&quot;. &quot;Fortunately, counter growth was limited by memory and thus by configuration, but this was pure luck.&quot;

On May 19, 2020, a working exploit for Guninski&#x27;s vulnerability was published by Qualys but exploit authors&#x27; state they were denied the reward because it contains additional environmental restrictions.

===Frequency of updates===
The core qmail package has not been updated for many years. New features were initially provided by third-party patches, from which the most important at the time were brought together in a single meta-patch called &quot;netqmail&quot;.

===Standards compliance===
qmail was not designed as a drop-in replacement for Sendmail, and does not behave exactly as Sendmail did in all situations. In some cases, these differences in behavior have become grounds for criticism. For instance, qmail&#x27;s approach to bounce messages (a format called QSBMF) differs from the standard format of delivery status notifications specified by the IETF in RFC 1894, meanwhile advanced to draft standard as RFC 3464, and recommended in the SMTP specification.

Some qmail features have been criticized for introducing mail forwarding complications; for instance, qmail&#x27;s &quot;wildcard&quot; delivery mechanism and security design prevents it from rejecting messages from forged or nonexistent senders during SMTP transactions. In the past, these differences may have made qmail behave differently when abused as a spam relay, though modern spam delivery techniques are less influenced by bounce behavior.

===Copyright status===
qmail was released to the public domain in November 2007. Until November 2007, qmail was license-free software, with permission granted for distribution in source form or in pre-compiled form (a &quot;var-qmail package&quot;) only if certain restrictions (primarily involving compatibility) were met. This unusual licensing arrangement made qmail non-free according to some guidelines (such as the DFSG) and was a cause of controversy.

qmail is the only broadly deployed public domain software message transfer agent (MTA).

<text>Daniel Julius Bernstein (sometimes known as djb; born October 29, 1971, Mandarin name: 狄傑比) is an American mathematician, cryptologist, and computer scientist. He was a visiting professor at CASA at Ruhr University Bochum until 2024, as well as a research professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Before this, he was a visiting professor in the department of mathematics and computer science at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

== Early life ==
Bernstein attended Bellport High School, a public high school on Long Island, graduating in 1987 at the age of 15. The same year, he ranked fifth in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. In 1987, he achieved a Top 10 ranking in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and was a member of the second-place team from Princeton University the following year. Bernstein earned a B.A. in mathematics from New York University (1991) and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley (1995), where he studied under Hendrik Lenstra.

== &quot;Bernstein v. United States&quot; ==

The export of cryptography from the United States was controlled as a munition starting from the Cold War until recategorization in 1996, with further relaxation in the late 1990s. In 1995, Bernstein brought the court case &quot;Bernstein v. United States&quot;. The ruling in the case declared that software was protected speech under the First Amendment, which contributed to regulatory changes reducing controls on encryption. Bernstein was originally represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He later represented himself.

== Cryptography ==
Bernstein designed the Salsa20 stream cipher in 2005 and submitted it to eSTREAM for review and possible standardization. He later published the ChaCha20 variant of Salsa in 2008. In 2005, he proposed the elliptic curve Curve25519 as a basis for public-key schemes. He worked as the lead researcher on the Ed25519 version of EdDSA. The algorithms made their way into popular software. For example, since 2014, when OpenSSH is compiled without OpenSSL they power most of its operations, and OpenBSD package signing is based on Ed25519.

Nearly a decade later, Edward Snowden disclosed mass surveillance by the National Security Agency, and researchers discovered a backdoor in the Agency&#x27;s Dual EC DRBG algorithm. These events raised suspicions of the elliptic curve parameters proposed by NSA and standardized by NIST. Many researchers feared that the NSA had chosen curves that gave them a cryptanalytic advantage. Google selected ChaCha20 along with Bernstein&#x27;s Poly1305 message authentication code for use in TLS, which is widely used for Internet security. Many protocols based on his works have been adopted by various standards organizations and are used in a variety of applications, such as Apple iOS, the Linux kernel, OpenSSH, and Tor.

In spring 2005, Bernstein taught a course on &quot;high speed cryptography.&quot; He introduced new cache attacks against implementations of AES in the same time period.

In April 2008, Bernstein&#x27;s stream cipher &quot;Salsa20&quot; was selected as a member of the final portfolio of the eSTREAM project, part of a European Union research directive.

In 2011, Bernstein published RFSB, a variant of the Fast Syndrome Based Hash function.

He is one of the editors of the 2009 book &quot;Post-Quantum Cryptography&quot;.

== Software ==
Starting in the mid-1990s, Bernstein wrote a number of security-aware programs, including qmail, ezmlm, djbdns, ucspi-tcp, daemontools, and codice_1.

Bernstein criticized the leading DNS package at the time, BIND, and wrote djbdns as a DNS package with security as a primary goal. Bernstein offers &quot;security guarantees&quot; for qmail and djbdns in the form of monetary rewards for the identification of flaws. A purported exploit targeting qmail running on 64-bit platforms was published in 2005, but Bernstein believes that the exploit does not fall within the parameters of his qmail security guarantee. In March 2009, Bernstein awarded $1000 to Matthew Dempsky for finding a security flaw in djbdns.

In August 2008, Bernstein announced DNSCurve, a proposal to secure the Domain Name System. DNSCurve applies techniques from elliptic curve cryptography with the goal of providing a vast increase in performance over the RSA public-key algorithm used by DNSSEC. It uses the existing DNS hierarchy to propagate trust by embedding public keys into specially formatted, backward-compatible DNS records.

Bernstein proposed Internet Mail 2000, an alternative system for electronic mail, which he intended to replace the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol (POP3) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

Bernstein is also known for his string hashing function &quot;djb2&quot; and the cdb database library.

== Mathematics ==
Bernstein has published a number of papers on mathematics and computation. Many of his papers deal with algorithms or implementations.

In 2001, Bernstein circulated &quot;Circuits for integer factorization: a proposal,&quot; which suggested that, if physical hardware implementations could be brought close to their theoretical efficiency, the then-popular estimates of adequate security parameters might be off by a factor of three. Since 512-bit RSA was breakable at the time, so might be 1536-bit RSA. Bernstein was careful not to make any actual predictions, and emphasized the importance of correctly interpreting asymptotic expressions. Several prominent researchers (among them Arjen Lenstra, Adi Shamir, Jim Tomlinson, and Eran Tromer) disagreed strongly with Bernstein&#x27;s conclusions. Bernstein has received funding to investigate whether this potential can be realized.

Bernstein is also the author of the mathematical libraries DJBFFT, a fast portable FFT library, and codice_2, an asymptotically fast small prime sieve with low memory footprint based on the sieve of Atkin (rather than the more usual sieve of Eratosthenes). Both have been used effectively in the search for large prime numbers.

In 2007, Bernstein proposed the use of a (twisted) Edwards curve, Curve25519, as a basis for elliptic curve cryptography; it is employed in Ed25519 implementation of EdDSA.

In February 2015, Bernstein and others published a paper on a stateless post-quantum hash-based signature scheme called SPHINCS. In July 2022, SPHINCS+, a signature scheme adapted from SPHINCS by Bernstein and others, was one of four algorithms selected as winners of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization competition. It was the only hash-based algorithm of the four winners.

In April 2017, Bernstein and others published a paper on Post-Quantum RSA that includes an integer factorization algorithm claimed to be &quot;often much faster than Shor&#x27;s&quot;.

== Teaching ==
In 2004, Bernstein taught a course on computer software security where he assigned each student to find ten vulnerabilities in published software. The 25 students discovered 44 vulnerabilities, and the class published security advisories about the issues.

<doc id="198984" wikidata="Q124291" url="?curid=198984" title="Electrical conductor">
<text>In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electric current) in one or more directions. Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors. The flow of negatively charged electrons generates electric current, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases.

In order for current to flow within a closed electrical circuit, one charged particle does not need to travel from the component producing the current (the current source) to those consuming it (the loads). Instead, the charged particle simply needs to nudge its neighbor a finite amount, who will nudge &quot;its&quot; neighbor, and on and on until a particle is nudged into the consumer, thus powering it. Essentially what is occurring is a long chain of momentum transfer between mobile charge carriers; the Drude model of conduction describes this process more rigorously. This momentum transfer model makes metal an ideal choice for a conductor; metals, characteristically, possess a delocalized sea of electrons which gives the electrons enough mobility to collide and thus affect a momentum transfer.

As discussed above, electrons are the primary mover in metals; however, other devices such as the cationic electrolyte(s) of a battery, or the mobile protons of the proton conductor of a fuel cell rely on positive charge carriers. Insulators are non-conducting materials with few mobile charges that support only insignificant electric currents.

==Resistance and conductance==
The resistance of a given conductor depends on the material it is made of, and on its dimensions. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. For example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance and conductance of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the length of the conductor, measured in metres [m], &quot;A&quot; is the cross-section area of the conductor measured in square metres [m2], σ (sigma) is the electrical conductivity measured in siemens per meter (S·m−1), and ρ (rho) is the electrical resistivity (also called &quot;specific electrical resistance&quot;) of the material, measured in ohm-metres (Ω·m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are reciprocals: formula_3. Resistivity is a measure of the material&#x27;s ability to oppose electric current.

This formula is not exact: It assumes the current density is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situation. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.

Another situation this formula is not exact for is with alternating current (AC), because the skin effect inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. Then, the &quot;geometrical&quot; cross-section is different from the &quot;effective&quot; cross-section in which current actually flows, so the resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors are near each other carrying AC current, their resistances increase due to the proximity effect. At commercial power frequency, these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as busbars in an electrical substation, or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.

Aside from the geometry of the wire, temperature also has a significant effect on the efficacy of conductors. Temperature affects conductors in two main ways, the first is that materials may expand under the application of heat. The amount that the material will expand is governed by the thermal expansion coefficient specific to the material. Such an expansion (or contraction) will change the geometry of the conductor and therefore its characteristic resistance. However, this effect is generally small, on the order of 10−6. An increase in temperature will also increase the number of phonons generated within the material. A phonon is essentially a lattice vibration, or rather a small, harmonic kinetic movement of the atoms of the material. Much like the shaking of a pinball machine, phonons serve to disrupt the path of electrons, causing them to scatter. This electron scattering will decrease the number of electron collisions and therefore will decrease the total amount of current transferred.

==Conductor materials==

Conduction materials include metals, electrolytes, superconductors, semiconductors, plasmas and some nonmetallic conductors such as graphite and conductive polymers.

Copper has a high conductivity. Annealed copper is the international standard to which all other electrical conductors are compared; the International Annealed Copper Standard conductivity is , although ultra-pure copper can slightly exceed 101% IACS. The main grade of copper used for electrical applications, such as building wire, motor windings, cables and busbars, is electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper (CW004A or ASTM designation C100140). If high conductivity copper must be welded or brazed or used in a reducing atmosphere, then oxygen-free high conductivity copper (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used. Because of its ease of connection by soldering or clamping, copper is still the most common choice for most light-gauge wires.

Silver is 6% more conductive than copper, but due to cost it is not practical in most cases. However, it is used in specialized equipment, such as satellites, and as a thin plating to mitigate skin effect losses at high frequencies. Famously, of silver on loan from the United States Treasury were used in the making of the calutron magnets during World War II due to wartime shortages of copper.

Aluminum wire is the most common metal in electric power transmission and distribution. Although only 61% of the conductivity of copper by cross-sectional area, its lower density makes it twice as conductive by mass. As aluminum is roughly one-third the cost of copper by weight, the economic advantages are considerable when large conductors are required.

The disadvantages of aluminum wiring lie in its mechanical and chemical properties. It readily forms an insulating oxide, making connections heat up. Its larger coefficient of thermal expansion than the brass materials used for connectors causes connections to loosen. Aluminum can also &quot;creep&quot;, slowly deforming under load, which also loosens connections. These effects can be mitigated with suitably designed connectors and extra care in installation, but they have made aluminum building wiring unpopular past the service drop.

Organic compounds such as octane, which has 8 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, cannot conduct electricity. Oils are hydrocarbons, since carbon has the property of tetracovalency and forms covalent bonds with other elements such as hydrogen, since it does not lose or gain electrons, thus does not form ions. Covalent bonds are simply the sharing of electrons. Hence, there is no separation of ions when electricity is passed through it. Liquids made of compounds with only covalent bonds cannot conduct electricity. Certain organic ionic liquids, by contrast, can conduct an electric current.

While pure water is not an electrical conductor, even a small portion of ionic impurities, such as salt, can rapidly transform it into a conductor.

==Wire size==
Wires are measured by their cross sectional area. In many countries, the size is expressed in square millimetres. In North America, conductors are measured by American wire gauge for smaller ones, and circular mils for larger ones.

==Conductor ampacity==
The ampacity of a conductor, that is, the amount of current it can carry, is related to its electrical resistance: a lower-resistance conductor can carry a larger value of current. The resistance, in turn, is determined by the material the conductor is made from (as described above) and the conductor&#x27;s size. For a given material, conductors with a larger cross-sectional area have less resistance than conductors with a smaller cross-sectional area.

For bare conductors, the ultimate limit is the point at which power lost to resistance causes the conductor to melt. Aside from fuses, most conductors in the real world are operated far below this limit, however. For example, household wiring is usually insulated with PVC insulation that is only rated to operate to about 60 °C, therefore, the current in such wires must be limited so that it never heats the copper conductor above 60 °C, causing a risk of fire. Other, more expensive insulation such as Teflon or fiberglass may allow operation at much higher temperatures.

==Isotropy==
If an electric field is applied to a material, and the resulting induced electric current is in the same direction, the material is said to be an &quot;isotropic electrical conductor&quot;. If the resulting electric current is in a different direction from the applied electric field, the material is said to be an &quot;anisotropic electrical conductor&quot;.

<doc id="198986" wikidata="Q228422" url="?curid=198986" title="Conductor (rail)">
<text>A conductor (North American English) or guard (Commonwealth English) is a train crew member responsible for operational and safety duties that do not involve actual operation of the train/locomotive. The &quot;conductor&quot; title is most common in North American railway operations, but the role is common worldwide under various job titles. In Commonwealth English, a conductor is also known as guard or train manager.

The responsibilities of a conductor or guard typically include the following:

* Ensuring that the train follows applicable safety rules and practices
* Making sure that the train stays on schedule starting from the stations
* Opening and closing power operated doors
* Selling and checking tickets, and other customer service duties
* Ensuring that any cars and cargo are picked up and dropped off properly
* Completing en-route paperwork
* Directing the train&#x27;s movement while operating in reverse
* Coupling or uncoupling cars
* Assisting with the setting out or picking up of rolling stock

Some rapid transit systems employ conductors to make announcements and open and close doors, duties otherwise performed by engineers. The conductor often stays in the center of the train where they can best view the platform. While advances in automation allow most transit systems to use &quot;one person train operation&quot; (OPTO), a few, such as the New York City Subway, Toronto Transit Commission and Sydney Trains continue to employ Guards.

== Commuter and freight trains in North America ==
In North America, the conductor manages a freight, passenger, or other type of train, and directly supervises the train crew, which can include a brakeman, flagman, ticket collector, assistant conductor, and on board service personnel, and is responsible for the movement of the train. The engineer (driver) takes direction from the conductor. The portman (station master), and additional &quot;engine crew&quot; members (fireman, pilot engineer) share responsibility for safe and efficient train operation and adherence to railway rules and procedures. On some railroads, union contracts specify that a conductor must progress to engineer.

Other duties carried out by the conductor include:
*Jointly coordinate with the engineer and dispatcher the train&#x27;s movement authority, and verifying this authority is not exceeded
*Communicate and coordinate with other parties—yardmasters, trainmasters, dispatchers, on board service personnel, etc.
*Be alert to wayside signals, switch position, and other conditions that affect safe train movement
*Mechanically inspect rolling stock
*Assist the engineer in testing the train&#x27;s air brakes
*Signal the engineer when to start or stop moving
*Keep a log of the journey
*Check tickets and collect fares on passenger trains
*Keep records of consignment notes and waybills
*Direct, coordinate, and usually manually perform, shunting or switching

Passenger trains may employ one or more brakemen/assistant conductors who assist the conductor and engineer in the safe and prompt movement of the train, to share the workload, and accept delegated responsibility. If a train crew&#x27;s route, or tour of duty, exceeds a single shift, or conflicts with a legal or contractual limit on the number of work hours, more than one crew may be assigned, each with its own brakeman/assistant conductor. Onboard service crew members on passenger trains normally remain on duty for the entire run, including assigned meal and sleep breaks.

Since nearly the beginning of railroading in North America, the conductor on freight trains rode aboard a caboose, along with the rear flagman and the rear brakeman, and performed duties from there. Advances in technology and pressure to reduce operating costs made cabooses redundant, and in most cases they have been eliminated. This relocated the conductor from the rear of the train to the locomotive (or locomotives) at the head of the train. In most cases, these same conditions gradually eliminated members of the train crew, such as the head brakemen, flagmen, and others.

Most freight trains on most railroads today have a crew of two: one engineer and one conductor. Railroad companies continue to press for reduced operating and labor costs and this threatens to eliminate second men. Railroads rationalize that since the engineer is already qualified as a conductor, he can easily assume the duties of a conductor. In fact, on most railroads, engineers begin as brakemen, then become conductors, and finally engineers. Some railroads already implement such a strategy, notably the Montana Rail Link, and operate with an engineer, and a conductor. However, most railroads are contractually obligated to employ a brakeman/assistant conductor in addition to the engineer, via crew consist agreements negotiated with the major rail unions, primarily the United Transportation Union (UTU). Therefore, eliminating the conductor&#x27;s position would require that the railroads and unions negotiate a new agreement. If the railroads were successful, conductors already trained and certified as engineers would theoretically be able to work as engineers. Those that have not yet progressed to engineer would have to be trained as engineers as positions became available. Others would have to accept other positions or possibly lose their jobs. The primary union for engineers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers does not support this movement, claiming that requiring its members to operate trains alone would be unsafe.

=== Remote control locomotives ===
By the late 1990s, remote control locomotives were increasingly popular on North American railroads for switching duties in rail yards. This system allows the conductor to directly control the locomotive(s) via a wireless remote unit, as opposed to radioing commands to an engineer in the cab. Some Class I rail yards utilize RCO packs for their conductors, while others do not, depending on the size and type of yard. Class I railroads train conductors on the use of RCO packs with classroom and hands-on instruction, culminating with on-the-job training and certification as a RCO operator. Currently, Class I railroads such as Norfolk Southern require RCO qualified conductors to work from job boards that perform RCO operations exclusively (when in a yard that utilizes RCO switching).

=== Train hosts ===
As there is no explicit federal requirement for a two-person train crew in the United States, the Utah Transit Authority originally planned their FrontRunner service to be operated by an operator only, with revenue collected by a proof-of-payment system. Before operation began, the FRA required FrontRunner to employ a second crewmember on each train to assist with emergency evacuation, disabled access, and other safety-sensitive situations. FrontRunner classified this job as a &quot;train host&quot;, with a focus on customer service rather than railroad operations. Some other services, such as Amtrak&#x27;s Downeaster, also use train hosts to assist the assistant conductor with non-revenue-related customer service duties.

== Subway trains in North America ==
In subway trains, the conductor&#x27;s basic duties are:

* Verifying train alignment on the platform
* Opening and closing the train doors
* Making announcements
* Observing the platform during departure

=== Greater Boston ===
All heavy rail trains in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority operate with two-person crews consisting of a motorman and a conductor. The conductor is located in the cab of the second-last car of the train. When a train arrives at a station, the conductor opens the doors using cab controls. Two sets of controls are provided on each side of the cab for this purpose. There are two door zones: One set of controls operates the doors in the conductor&#x27;s car and the doors forward of that car, and the other set of controls operates the doors to the rear of the conductor&#x27;s car. When passengers have completed boarding or exiting, the conductor looks forward and closes the doors forward of their cab. This process is repeated for the doors to the rear of the conductor&#x27;s cab. A door chime is used to notify the passengers that the doors are closing.

=== New York City ===
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York City) transit system operates trains using two-person crews consisting of a motorman and conductor. The conductor is located in the middle of the train and is responsible for opening the doors and closing them. When a train arrives at a station, the conductor verifies the train alignment on the platform by observing a black-and-white &quot;zebra board&quot; mounted to the platform wall or ceiling. When a train is aligned properly, the 6-feet long zebra board should be located directly opposite of the conductor&#x27;s cab.

Before opening the doors, the train conductor is to open the cab window and point to the zebra board with their index finger to confirm the stop position to the motorman. The doors, operated from a control panel located on the appropriate side of the car, are opened once the alignment verification is made. Like MBTA, there are two separate controls for the doors, those for doors forward of the conductor and those for the doors to the rear of the conductor.

After the doors are opened, the conductor sticks their head out the window to observe passenger boarding and exiting. The doors stay open for at least ten seconds, and when the conductor decides to close the doors, the conductor announces a door-closing warning using a PA system on the train. When the platform is clear, the conductor closes the doors in the rear cars. When a locked-door signal is received, the conductor closes the doors in the forward section of the train. Door chimes warn passengers that the doors are closing. When all the doors are closed, the conductor removes the door key, which alerts the motorman that it is safe to proceed.

As the train departs the station, the conductor observes the platform for a distance of three car lengths. Station departure observations are made to ensure that no passenger or item is trapped between the doors and is dragged along the platform. The conductor is required to observe the forward and rear cars at least twice during these observations.

=== Port Authority Trans-Hudson ===
Each PATH train operates with a two-person crew consisting of a motorman and conductor. The conductor is responsible for door operation and making announcements. The conductor is located in the rear end of the first car.

When a train enters a station, the conductor opens the doors from a control panel on the appropriate side of the car. There are two separate controls, one set operates just the doors in the conductor&#x27;s car, and another set operates the rest of the doors. As the doors open, the conductor opens the cab window to observe passenger boarding and exiting. After a preliminary observation that the doors are clear, the conductor uses the train&#x27;s PA system to warn passengers that the train doors are closing. When the doors are observed to be clear, the conductor closes the doors in their car. When the locked-door signal is received, the rear car doors are closed. When all the doors are closed, the conductor removes the door key, which tells the motorman to proceed. The conductor then observes the platform until the train has left the station.

=== Chicago ===
Traditionally, an &#x27;L&#x27; motorman would operate the train, and a conductor would open/close the doors and make station announcements. However, with the opening of the Yellow Line in 1964, the Chicago Transit Authority began phasing out conductors. All lines were converted to one-person operation by 1998, making the CTA the first transit agency in the nation to do so system-wide. The elimination of conductors saved an estimated $13.8 million, and most were re-trained as customer service reps at stations or supervisors.

=== Toronto ===
The Toronto Transit Commission is somewhat different because its heavy rail lines use a combination of single-person and two-person crews. On the TTC&#x27;s Line 1 and Line 2, trains operate with a crew of two train operators, consisting of a motorman and a conductor. The employees who perform these roles are cross-trained, and switch roles each time when a train reaches the end of a line and needs to reverse direction. The conductor is responsible for door control and observation and is located in the rear cab of the last car in a train. A trainline buzzer system is used to notify the motorman that it is safe to proceed.

After arrival at a station and before opening the doors, the conductor will verify the train alignment by observing a green triangle placed on the station wall. The green triangle marks the stopping location of the conductor and should be directly in front of the conductor&#x27;s cab. The conductor is required to confirm the stop position to the motorman by pointing out the cab window at the green triangle with their index finger.

One set of door controls is provided in the cab to close all the doors at once. A door opening chime is played when the doors open. The conductor sticks their head out the cab window to observe the platform and doors, and when the doors are clear, they will press a button that closes the doors. At exactly the same time, door closing chimes are played, followed by an automated announcement of &quot;please stand clear of the doors&quot;. The conductor will use the buzzer to notify the motorman that the train can proceed.

When the train begins to leave the station, the conductor will observe the platform with their head out the window. An orange triangle, placed on the platform wall, marks the location where the conductor may cease platform departure observations and pull their head back into the cab. It is a safety precaution to watch the platform to make sure that no passenger is being dragged by the train into the tunnel.

== Train guard (United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand)==
In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the person with ultimate responsibility for operation of a train has traditionally been called the &quot;guard&quot;, a term that derives from stagecoach days.

Until the latter part of the 20th century, guards on passenger trains in those countries did not have routine responsibilities for ticket inspection or sale. Their job focused on the safe operation of their train, timekeeping, and handling parcels and other consignments. A dedicated &quot;travelling ticket inspector&quot; handled revenue protection duties. In recent years, guards have been dispensed with and passenger train conductors have been assigned more responsibility for on-train revenue collection and ticket inspection.

As well as ticketing and customer care, guards must be trained in &quot;emergency protection&quot; duties, should an emergency arise, along with other operational roles. That involves using emergency equipment such as detonators, track circuit clips and flags, to prevent other trains colliding with, for example, a disabled or derailed train. If a driver becomes incapacitated, the guard is the only person who can protect the train. Other day-to-day duties include operating the public address system and train doors.

===United Kingdom===
Under British Rail, there were several grades of guard, depending on whether the guard worked on freight or passenger trains—and a purely operational guard grade worked freight and passenger trains without customer contact. When the guard has significant customer contact, the position is usually classified as conductor-guard or conductor. Since British Rail, there have been a number of titles for a guard&#x27;s grade but, with a few exceptions, all now perform some sort of customer-facing role.

There have been other disputes over guards on Merseyrail, CrossCountry, Govia Thameslink Railway, South Western Railway, Northern Rail, First Great Western, ScotRail, most of which have been won by the workforce and their union, the RMT.

In the UK, guard duties include:
* Opening and closing of train doors
* Ticket checks on most train operating companies 
* Keeping passengers informed of any short notice changes to the service and then keeping the driver informed of any changes 
* Dealing with an emergency and being trained in Personal Track Safety so that the guard is able to safely evacuate all passengers from the train - including using equipment like paddles, short circuit bars, and track circuit operating clips 
* Small repairs of the train, including changing a blown shoe fuse, for example
* Historically, to assist with braking on freight trains not fitted with continuous brakes, by applying the handbrake in the brake van

It was a well-known British tradition for a guard to have two signal flags: a red one to signal the driver to stop, and a green one to signal the driver to depart. Nowadays, these flags are seldom used except on heritage railways. At night, the guard gave the signals using a lamp with red and green lights instead of using flags. Guards still occasionally use a whistle to attract the driver&#x27;s attention and to warn passengers that the train is about to move, even though the electronic communication systems are now very sophisticated.

On long-distance expresses, the conductor&#x27;s title is sometimes enhanced to senior conductor, in line with the implied prestige of operating those trains. Historically, under British Rail, long-distance intercity trains were normally worked by the most senior guards at the depot, hence the name senior conductor. Several more recent private UK passenger train operators have renamed the senior conductor&#x27;s passenger-facing title to &quot;train manager&quot;. The RSSB rulebook still refers collectively to those individuals as guards.

On UK railways, modernisation and economic pressure has led to some trains losing their guards and becoming driver-only-operated (DOO). The most recent axing of the conventional guard was on Southern rail, after a two-year dispute between the train operating company and the workforce, which ultimately led to the guards losing their safety-critical roles. British Rail first introduced that on some commuter services in London and Glasgow, as well as on almost all non-passenger trains. The last London Underground trains to operate with guards were the 1959 stock used on the Northern Line; following their withdrawal on 27 January 2000, all trains on the London Underground have been DOO.

In 2003, a controversial amendment to the UK operational rule book moved part of the guard&#x27;s safety and operational role to the driver. With rail service privatisation, train operating companies attempted to bring in DOO to other network areas, c2c operating from London Fenchurch Street is an example of that. Currently, several titles describe a guard: &quot;train manager&quot;, &quot;train host&quot; or &quot;conductor&quot;. South Western Railway and Merseyrail still use the term &quot;guard&quot;. The role of the guard is set out by a mixture of the Railway Rule Book and train operating companies.

===Australia===
In Australia, there is a combination of driver-only operated trains and trains with a guard, depending largely on state-based railway practice.

==== New South Wales ====
All passenger trains in New South Wales operate with a driver and guard. Guards were removed from freight trains in the 1980s, but they still operate with a two-man locomotive crew.

===== Greater Sydney area =====
Sydney Trains, which operates metropolitan trains, and intercity trains, have a train guard. Guards are ultimately responsible for the safety of all passengers on the train. They control the operation of doors and the train public address system, perform platform duties, provide basic customer service, ensure the train runs to schedule, and accept and deliver internal mail. On Sydney Trains, the guard is located in the middle of older trains, but on the newer Waratah trains, and on certain intercity services, they work from the rear. The guard is not responsible for inspecting tickets, a role performed by Transport Officers and NSW Police.

===== NSW Regional trains =====
On NSW TrainLink regional Xplorer and XPT services the train guard is known as a Passenger Service Supervisor (PSS). While still responsible for the safety of passengers, the PSS is also in charge of delivering customer service and a number of value-add functions on the train including ticket inspections and manning the cafe alongside Passenger Attendants. On Xplorer trains, the driver operates the doors when the PSS gives clearance to depart. On XPT trains, the PSS performs the platform duties of a guard in conjunction with the driver.

==== Queensland ====
Passenger trains are operated by Queensland Rail, and all have both a driver and guard for suburban passenger services, or a passenger services supervisor for long-distance services.

==== Victoria ====
Trains in metropolitan Melbourne have been driver-only since the early 1990s. When the city&#x27;s rail franchise was offered to the current operator, Metro Trains Melbourne, a proposal existed to reinstate guards on some peak train services, but that option was rejected in favour of hiring additional platform staff.

Regional trains operated by V/Line have a driver and conductor. The conductor performs platform duties and, on locomotive-hauled services, operates the train doors and handles passenger luggage. Conductors are responsible for internal mail, passenger safety and assistance, including on board announcements, and perform ticket sales and inspection duties.

==== South Australia ====
Adelaide Metro&#x27;s metropolitan rail network is configured for driver-only operation, but also operate with passenger service assistants (PSAs). That is safety role, but has a focus on customer service and revenue protection. Normally, the train driver operates the doors, but PSAs are also able to. &quot;The Ghan, Great Southern, Indian Pacific&quot; and &quot;The Overland&quot; all have so-called train managers.

==== Western Australia ====
Transperth trains are all driver-only operated.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, inner-city commuter rail networks are staffed by a driver and a train manager (guard) as a minimum.

In Wellington, where ticketing is still paper-based, each train has between one and three passenger operators (ticket collectors). The exact number of passenger operators depends on how many multiple units or carriages make up the train.

In Auckland, off-board ticketing and smartcard systems have reduced the staff level to driver and train manager only. Auckland train managers are now not responsible for revenue on trains, as Revenue Protection officers carry out these roles.

== Conductors/guards in Europe ==
===Germany===

A conductor (&quot;Zugführer&quot; or &quot;Zugchef&quot; in German) supervises the operational safety of a train and is responsible for its proper operation. They are authorized to issue instructions to all employees, for example train attendants, on the train. The conductor also provides passenger service and checks tickets together with the train attendants.

The conductor determines if a train is ready to depart from a platform and orders the engineer to depart via visual or aural signals. Conductors are trained in coupling and uncoupling cars, operating of the brakes, calculating braking power for the engineer, and other technical subjects related to the cars. They are further trained in customer services and selling and checking tickets.

On local trains, and depending on the level of automations, the duties of a conductor can be taken over by other personnel or left to automatic systems.

===Hungary===

In Hungary a conductor may assist the train driver in testing the train&#x27;s air brakes, and sometimes they have to lead the shunting, mostly when the trains are switching lines. Hungarian train conductors are responsible for the departure of the trains. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a ready signal to the train driver. During the day they use a disc (which is white and has a green border) to give the ready signal to the train driver.

After sunset they give signals with flashlights. Train drivers are not allowed to move the train without the conductor in chief giving them the ready signal. Conductors, along with train drivers, are responsible for keeping the trains on schedule. There is always at least one conductor in chief on passenger trains in Hungary. No passenger trains may depart without one, as only they have the right to give the departure signal.

Some longer trains may have additional conductors who are under the command of the conductor in chief. If there is more than one conductor on a train, then the signal procedure is as follows:

After all passengers have left or entered the train and the departure time has arrived, the conductor in chief asks the other conductor for his ready signal. If it is safe to depart he gives a ready signal to the conductor in chief who then gives the same signal to the train driver.

As in Belgium and in the Netherlands conductors also collect and punch tickets, fine people for not having a valid fare and make announcements to the passengers. They also sell tickets on the trains; if the passengers have entered the train at a station where a ticket office is operating they can buy a ticket only with payment of a fine. However, if the passengers got on at a station or stop where they didn&#x27;t have an option to buy a ticket, they can buy from the conductor without having to pay a fine.

===Ireland===
Most Iarnród Éireann trains are driver-only operated. An on-board train host provides passengers with assistance, makes announcements, and performs minor maintenance. A minority of routes still have guards operating the doors, giving the ready-to-start signal with a green flag, and checking and selling tickets.

===Netherlands/Belgium===
In Belgium and The Netherlands, train conductors have multiple tasks involving train safety and customer services. Belgian/Dutch train conductors are responsible for the departure of the train. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a ready signal to the train driver. Therefore, train conductors in Belgium and The Netherlands always close (and in some scenarios also open) the doors. They are also responsible for performing safety tasks in case of an emergency or accident, such as fire, evacuation, etc. Because of these tasks, there has to be at least one conductor on each passenger train; a train without a conductor is uncommon, but still appears on some regional Dutch trains. The departure trains always have one conductor who is conductor-in-chief. He is responsible for the entire train, the on-board crew and the passengers. Some longer trains may have additional conductors who are under command of the conductor-in-chief. Besides the safety tasks, conductors also collect and punch tickets, fine people for not having a valid fare and make announcements to the passengers.

===Switzerland===
Conductors in Switzerland are assigned to either regional or long-distance trains. In the former case, their job is mainly to check for tickets (and to issue a &quot;ticket supplement&quot; in the event of a missing or incorrect ticket) or to assist customers with inquiries. In the latter case, they are responsible not only for the same tasks, but also for preparing the train for departure, making announcements, signaling the closing of the doors and departure from each station, and assisting customers in the event of a security incident.

==Railway guards in Asia==

=== India ===

In India, train managers (earlier called guard) are posted on all passenger trains and goods trains and no passenger-carrying train is allowed to move without a guard. The passenger train guard, generally called a &quot;mail guard,&quot; is completely responsible for the train, its schedule, and safety of passengers and the locomotive pilot. These guards wear a specific uniform (generally white).

During the day, the guard uses the traditional green flag to signal the pilot to depart, and the red flag to stop, assisted by two-way radios. After sunset, the guard uses lamp signals in place of the flags. A couple of minutes before signalling departure to the pilot, the guard blows a whistle to warn passengers to board the train. After ensuring all passengers are safe to travel, the guard signals the green flag by waving it from the brake van. In an emergency, the guard uses the red flag to indicate a stop, and may directly apply brakes to stop the train. The pilot is not allowed to move the train without a signal from the guard, as the guard is in charge of the train.

Passenger guards also accept heavy parcels and luggage boxes that passengers cannot carry in coaches. Some perishable goods like vegetables and milk are also transported under the supervision of the guard, who is responsible for proper loading and unloading.

Keeping the passenger train on-schedule is an important guard function. Guards carry a first aid box with their belongings, along with other important items, all in a medium-sized duty box (generally painted red). The name, designation and base location of the Guard are printed in white on the box. A designated passenger train, halting at all stations, carries a large heavy cast iron cash safe in the guard&#x27;s brake van, where cash receipts from ticket sales is deposited in a leather pouch by the station manager (earlier called the station master). Since the late 1990s, each guard is provided with a two-way radio so that they can communicate with the locomotive pilot, and other trains if required. The radio has not yet replaced the traditional red and green flags.

=== Japan ===
Guards are used on most passenger railway lines in Japan. Working from the rear driving cab, their responsibilities include opening and closing of doors, sounding the departure melody, making announcements, ensuring on-time departure as well as the safety of passengers boarding and alighting.

==Tram (streetcar) conductor==
Many antique or heritage trams (streetcars), which operated through the earlier part of the 20th century, were designed for operation by a crew of two or more. The conductor primarily collected fares and signaled the driver when safe to depart from stopping places. The conductor also assisted with shunting when necessary, changing the trolley pole and attended to passengers&#x27; needs.

Modern vehicle design and ticketing arrangements have largely eliminated the need for conductors on street railways and light rail systems. In recent years a number of modern tram or light rail systems have introduced (or re-introduced) conductors to minimise fare evasion and to provide customer care, supervision and security functions, even in situations where a second crew member is not strictly needed.

In England, the Sheffield Supertram and West Midlands Metro modern light rail systems have both started using conductors due to problems with ticket machine reliability. Nottingham Express Transit started with conductors, but now sells tickets from ticket machines or online. Manchester Metrolink and Croydon Tramlink both rely on ticket machines at stops.

Systems of ticket checking and selling by a conductor:
*takes place while entering, the vehicle cannot leave until this is (almost) finished
*takes place after entering an entrance lobby, while the vehicle already moves, after which the passenger moves to the seating area of the car
*the passengers get seated and the conductor comes to them

Modern mass transit systems which operate with conductors on trams include:

<doc id="198987" wikidata="Q3460931" url="?curid=198987" title="Fishers Island, New York">
<text>Fishers Island is an island that is part of Southold, New York, United States at the eastern end of Long Island Sound, off the southeastern coast of Connecticut across Fishers Island Sound. About long and wide, it is about from the tip of Long Island at Orient Point, each from Napatree Point at the southwestern tip of Rhode Island and Groton Long Point in Connecticut, and about southeast of New London, Connecticut. It is accessible from New London by plane and regular ferry service.

The island is part of the town of Southold in Suffolk County. It is a census-designated place (CDP). As of the 2010 census, there were 236 people living year-round on of land. The population rises to about 2,000 during peak summer weekends, as throngs disembark on the island from Connecticut.

==History==
The island was called &quot;Munnawtawkit&quot; by the Pequot Indians. Adriaen Block was the first recorded European visitor, and he named it Vischer&#x27;s Island in 1614 after one of his companions. It remained a wilderness for the next 25 years, visited occasionally by Dutch traders.

John Winthrop the Younger obtained a grant of Fisher&#x27;s Island in 1640 from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, &quot;reserving the right of Connecticut if it should be decided to be theirs.&quot; He simultaneously applied to the Connecticut General Court for a similar grant in order that there might be no flaw in his title. The title was given to him in the following words, which are copied from the records of a General Court held at Hartford, Connecticut, April 9, 1641:
:Upon Mr. Winthrop&#x27;s motion to the court for Fisher&#x27;s Island, it is the mind of the court that so far as it hinders not the public good of the country, either for fortifying for defense, or setting up a trade for fishing or salt and such like, he shall have liberty to proceed therein.

Winthrop lived only one winter on the island. He was named governor of the Connecticut Colony 1657–58 and 1659–76, and he used the island to raise sheep for food and wool. He died in 1676 and his son Fitz-John installed a lessee farmer from England on the island named William Walworth. Walworth brought a system of cultivation that was continued on the island for nearly 200 years. He established farmland out of the heavily forested island. Walworth and his family vacated the island nine years later due to the threat of pirates. Fishers Island remained in the Winthrop family of Connecticut until 1863, when ownership passed to Robert R. Fox, and then to Edmund and Walton Ferguson, also of Connecticut.

The island was the subject of a border dispute between New York and Connecticut. The states of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island meet in the waters east of Fishers Island. The British took possession of New York City from the Dutch in 1664, and all of Suffolk County was claimed by Connecticut, with British settlers there accepting its jurisdiction. A 1664 land patent given to the Duke of York included all islands in Long Island Sound, apparently thus granting Fishers Island also to the Province of New York. The Duke of York held a grudge against Connecticut. The New Haven settlers had hidden three of the judges who sentenced his father King Charles I to death in 1649. Settlers throughout Suffolk County pressed to stay under Connecticut&#x27;s jurisdiction, but Governor Sir Edmund Andros threatened to eliminate their rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676. A joint commission from Connecticut and New York in 1879 reiterated that New York has legal title to Fishers Island.

The island was a target of British soldiers during the Revolutionary War, who raided islands in Long Island Sound for supplies. Many of the residents of Fishers Island took their herds to the relative safety of Connecticut in 1776. The raids continued, though, and the British burned many of the island&#x27;s homes in 1779.

In 1783, brick-making was established as the island&#x27;s only industry, using the vast amounts of available clay. This business was discontinued in 1889. In 1870, a lifesaving station was erected at the western end of the island by the State of Connecticut, which overlooked the waters between Fishers Island and Little Gull Island. The Race Rock Light was constructed in 1878 as a navigational aid for travel in the Race, located about west of Fishers Island. In the early 1900s, a permanent Coast Guard station was built on the west end. In 1898, the Fergusons sold on the western end to the federal government. This land was developed as Fort H.G. Wright, which was named after the Civil War Union commander who was born in Clinton, Connecticut. The fort was established as part of the Endicott Program, a large coastal defense project. It was largely abandoned following World War II. Over the years, Fort Wright drew a large number of residents to the island. The 1890s brought a growing summer population and the construction of the Fishers Island Yacht Club.

The E.W. &amp; W. Ferguson business was established to manage the Mansion House Hotel and Cottages, a ferry service, and the electricity, water, and telephone enterprises. It was renamed Fishers Island Farms in 1918, then the Fishers Island Utility Company in 1965, following the death of a company president. As of 2022, the firm still owns and operates the water, telephone service (area code 631, exchange 788), and electrical utilities. The ferry is operated by the Fishers Island Ferry District, a public entity financed through a special tax district. The town has contracts with the Ferry District to operate Elizabeth Field airport and to manage other structures that were part of Fort Wright.

Hurricanes have played an important role in the island&#x27;s history, with the Great September Gale of 1815 and the New England Hurricane of 1938 causing widespread damage. The 1815 storm destroyed nearly all of the trees with powerful winds and a storm surge that flooded coastal towns. The consequences for Fishers Island were visible for almost a century and a half. A 1910 panoramic photograph shows more boats in Hay and West harbors than there are mature trees. Until the 1950s, Fishers Island had the look of Ireland: stone walls, few trees, and windswept moors.

The 1938 storm blew in seeds, returning Fishers to its pre-1815 foliage. The damage from this storm was less severe than the 1815 storm, with only a few island residences destroyed, primarily by wind.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.48%, is water.

Fishers Island represents a section of the same terminal moraine that formed the North Fork of Long Island, which comes ashore at Watch Hill, Rhode Island. During the late phase of the Wisconsin glaciation, glacial Lake Connecticut formed at the retreating fore edge of the ice sheet, over what now is Long Island Sound; it formed an outlet in its moraine dam at The Race, famous for rip currents, which still separates Fishers Island from the North Fork. Fishers Island is essentially a long barrow of rocky till scoured from the surface of southern Connecticut.

===Climate===
Fishers Island&#x27;s weather is influenced by the proximity of Long Island Sound and the ocean, and prevailing winds that generally blow offshore. The climate is one of only a few locations on an east coast in the Northern Hemisphere that is oceanic (Koppen Cfb). Because the ocean stays warm during the fall and winter months, Fishers Island stays warmer than the mainland (Connecticut) during this time. Although summer days can be hot on Fishers Island, because of its oceanic climate, temperatures are lower than on the mainland in nearby Connecticut and Rhode Island. For example, the July and August, average daytime temperature on the island usually range in mid- to upper 70s when they average in the low to mid-80s in nearby areas of New England.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 289 people, 138 households, and 77 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 625 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the community was 95.50% White, 1.04% African American, 1.04% Asian, and 2.42% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.38% of the population. More than 53% of inhabitants of the island have mainland homes in Connecticut.

There were 138 households, out of which 26.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.2% were married couples living together, 5.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.5% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.09 and the average family size was 2.72.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 21.8% under the age of 18, 2.1% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 18.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.2 males.

The median income for a household in the community was $50,521, and the median income for a family was $59,583. Males had a median income of $47,917 versus $26,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $31,652. About 4.5% of families and 9.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.8% of those under the age of eighteen and 7.9% of those 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
The island has closer links with Connecticut, to its north, than with the rest of New York, to the southwest.

Tom Clavin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the connection remains merely political, not emotional&quot; to New York State, and that &quot;in appearance, accent, location, and sensibility, this is a decidedly New England community&quot;.

Fishers Island&#x27;s ZIP code is 06390, corresponding to Connecticut ZIP codes that begin with &quot;06&quot;, while other residential ZIP codes in New York State begin with &quot;1&quot;. Originally, the ZIP Code for the island was 11943, but it was ultimately changed to allow for easier mail delivery, since it is closer to Connecticut than the rest of Long Island. 

The island is the only point in Suffolk County to which telephone calls placed from the New York City area are classified as long distance rather than regional; any telephone call placed from Fishers Island to anywhere else is treated as long distance. 

The only way for New York state troopers to get to Fishers Island is to travel through Connecticut and take the ferry from New London. 

Every athletic team at Fishers Island School plays against Connecticut teams; none of the teams from the school played against any New York team in 2011–2012. Trash from the island is sent to Wallingford, Connecticut. Residents also closely adhere to Connecticut&#x27;s state laws regarding recycling.

Since the turn of the 20th century, &quot;old-money&quot; families have selected the island for their summer vacations, such as the Rockefeller family, Du Pont family, Whitney family, and Roosevelt family. Their luxurious dwellings reflect an emphasis on continuity and tradition. Cleveland Amory described it as the last resort of the big rich, and they want it kept that way. 

Most of the year-round residents live on the western end of the island. The island offers all the necessities for small-town life, including a K-12 school (Fishers Island School), bowling alley, movie theater, liquor store, grocery store, two gas stations, volunteer fire department, and post office. The west end also has a small air strip (Elizabeth Field), a museum, an ice cream shop, two boutiques, a hardware store, and a restaurant-bar. The island is also home to the Fishers Island Oyster Farm, a family-owned and managed oyster farm that sells oysters directly to customers and chefs, including Manhattan restaurants such as Balthazar and PJ Clarke&#x27;s.

==Parks and recreation==
Beaches include South Beach, Isabella Beach, Chocomount Beach, and Dock Beach, located at West Harbor.

Fishers Island Club features tennis courts, a beachfront, clubhouse, employee housing, and a golf course which President Dwight D. Eisenhower called a &quot;real course&quot;.

Hay Harbor is a club featuring golf, tennis, swimming and sailing.

Fishers Island Yacht Club holds races in the summer, and maintains two racing fleets.

==Government==
In 2004, two officials in the Southold government were from Fishers Island. Clavin said Fishers Island residents felt this was inadequate and that the removal of a Fishers Island resident from the Southold zoning board of appeals led to calls for secession from New York and incorporation into Connecticut.

==Education==
Fishers Island Union Free School District is located at 19 Greenwood Road and consists of one school that serves 68 students in grades PK through 12. In 2014, the district spent $36,811 per pupil. The district spends 71% on instruction, and 29% on support services. The district&#x27;s student-teacher ratio is five students for every full-time equivalent teacher.

==Media==
The seaside scenes in the movie &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; were shot on Fishers Island around the grounds of the mansion built by Bethlehem Steel heir Robert Linderman. Many other movies have also been filmed there.

<text>The Aegis Combat System is an American integrated naval weapons system, which uses computers and radars to track and guide weapons to destroy enemy targets. It was developed by the Missile and Surface Radar Division of RCA, and it is now produced by Lockheed Martin.

Initially used by the United States Navy, Aegis is now used also by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, Spanish Navy, Royal Norwegian Navy, Republic of Korea Navy, and Royal Australian Navy, and is planned for use by the Royal Canadian Navy. As of 2022, a total of 110 Aegis-equipped ships have been deployed, and 71 more are planned (see operators).

Aegis BMD (Ballistic Missile Defense) capabilities are being developed as part of the NATO missile defense system.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Aegis&quot; is a reference that dates back to Greek mythology, with connotations of a protective shield, as the Aegis was the buckler (shield) of Zeus, worn by Athena.

==Overview==

The Aegis Combat System (ACS) implements advanced command and control (command and decision, or C&amp;D, in Aegis parlance). It is composed of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS), the fast-reaction component of the Aegis Anti-Aircraft Warfare (AAW) capability, along with the Phalanx Close In Weapon System (CIWS), and the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System. Mk 41 VLS is available in different versions that vary in size and weight. There are three lengths: for the self-defense version, for the tactical version, and for the strike version. The empty weight for an 8-cell module is for the self-defense version, for the tactical version, and for the strike version, thus incorporating anti-submarine warfare (ASW) systems and Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles (TLAM). Shipboard torpedo and naval gunnery systems are also integrated.

AWS, the heart of Aegis, comprises the AN/SPY-1 Radar, MK 99 Fire Control System, Weapon Control System (WCS), the Command and Decision Suite, and Standard Missile family of weapons; these include the basic RIM-66 Standard, the RIM-156 Standard ER extended range missile, and the newer RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 designed to counter ballistic missile threats. A further SM-2 based weapon, the RIM-174 Standard ERAM (Standard Missile 6) was deployed in 2013. Individual ships may not carry all variants. Weapons loads are adjusted to suit assigned mission profile. The Aegis Combat System is controlled by an advanced, automatic detect-and-track, multi-function three-dimensional passive electronically scanned array radar, the AN/SPY-1. Known as &quot;the Shield of the Fleet&quot;, the SPY high-powered (6 megawatt) radar is able to perform search, tracking, and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a track capacity of well over 100 targets at more than . However, the AN/SPY-1 Radar is mounted lower than the AN/SPS-49 radar system and so has a reduced radar horizon.

The Aegis system communicates with the Standard missiles through a radio frequency (RF) uplink using the AN/SPY-1 radar for mid-course update missile guidance during engagements, but still requires the AN/SPG-62 fire-control radar for terminal guidance. This means that with proper scheduling of intercepts, a large number of targets can be engaged simultaneously.

The computer-based command-and-decision (C&amp;D) element is the core of the Aegis Combat System and came from the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) threat evaluation and weapons assignment (TEWA) function. This interface makes the ACS capable of simultaneous operation against almost all kinds of threats.

In December 2019, Lockheed Martin released a promotional video heralding the 50th anniversary of the Aegis combat system.

== Development ==

Aegis was initially developed by the Missile and Surface Radar Division of RCA, which was later acquired by General Electric. The division responsible for the Aegis systems became Government Electronic Systems. This, and other GE Aerospace businesses, were sold to Martin Marietta in 1992. This became part of Lockheed Martin in 1995.

By the late 1950s, the U.S. Navy replaced guns with guided missiles on its ships. These were sufficient weapons but by the late 1960s, the U.S. Navy recognized that reaction time, firepower, and operational availability in all environments did not match the anti-ship missile threat. The new threat of Soviet anti-ship missiles exposed a weakness in contemporary naval radar. The requirements of both tracking and targeting these missiles was limited by the number of radars on each ship, which was typically 2–4. In 1958 the navy started the Typhon Combat System, a prophetic program culminating in the futuristic but unreliable AN/SPG-59 phased array radar, which was never made viable and was cancelled in 1963 to be replaced by the Advanced Surface Missile System (ASMS).

As a result, the U.S. Navy decided to develop a program to defend ships from anti-ship missile threats. An Advanced Surface Missile System (ASMS) was promulgated and an engineering development program was initiated in 1964 to meet the requirements. ASMS was renamed &quot;Aegis&quot; in December 1969 after the aegis, the shield of the Greek god Zeus. The name was suggested by Captain L. J. Stecher, a former Tartar Weapon System manager, after an internal U.S. Navy contest to name the ASMS program was initiated. Captain Stecher also submitted a possible acronym of Advanced Electronic Guided Interceptor System although this definition was never used. The main manufacturer of the Aegis Combat System, Lockheed Martin, makes no mention of the name Aegis being an acronym, nor does the U.S. Navy.

In 1970, then-Captain Wayne Meyer was named Manager Aegis Weapons System. Under his leadership the first systems were successfully deployed on various U.S. Navy vessels.

The first Engineering Development Model (EDM-1) was installed in a test ship, , in 1973. During this time frame, the Navy envisioned installing the Aegis Combat System on both a nuclear-powered &quot;strike cruiser&quot; (or CSGN) and a conventionally-powered destroyer (originally designated DDG 47). The CSGN was to be a new, 17,200 ton cruiser design based on the earlier and cruisers. The Aegis destroyer design would be based on the gas turbine powered . When the CSGN was cancelled, the Navy proposed a modified &quot;Virginia&quot;-class design (CGN 42) with a new superstructure designed for the Aegis Combat System and with a displacement of 12,100 tons. As compared to the CSGN, this design was not as survivable and had reduced command and control facilities for an embarked flag officer. Ultimately this design was also cancelled during the Carter Administration due to its increased cost compared to the non-nuclear DDG 47. With the cancellation of the CGN 42, the DDG 47 Aegis destroyer was redesignated as CG 47, a guided missile cruiser.

The first cruiser of this class was , which used two twin-armed Mark-26 missile launchers, fore and aft. The commissioning of the sixth ship of the class, opened a new era in surface warfare as the first Aegis ship outfitted with the Martin Marietta Mark-41 Vertical Launching System (VLS), allowing a wider missile selection, more firepower, and survivability. The improved AN/SPY-1B radar went to sea in , ushering in another advance in Aegis capabilities. introduced the AN/UYK-43/44 computers, which provide increased processing capabilities.

During 1980, the was designed using an improved sea-keeping hull form, reduced infrared and radar cross-sections, and upgrades to the Aegis Combat System. The first ship of the class, , was commissioned during 1991. A notional design that incorporated the capabilities of a VLS-capable &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; with a hull and superstructure designed to &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; standards, called &quot;Cruiser Baseline&quot;, was studied although not built.

Flight II of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class, introduced in 1992, incorporated improvements to the SPY-1 radar, and to the Standard missile, active electronic countermeasures, and communications. Flight IIA, introduced in 2000, added a helicopter hangar with one anti-submarine helicopter and one armed attack helicopter. The Aegis program has also projected reducing the cost of each Flight IIA ship by at least $30 million.

Recent Aegis Combat System ships come with active electronically scanned array radars which use solid-state gallium nitride emitters. These include Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) and Spanish s, which use the AN/SPY-7 radar from Lockheed-Martin, and s which use AN/SPY-6 radar from Raytheon. AN/SPY-6 radar will also be installed in Flight III and Flight IIA &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, giving them Ballistic Missile Defense capability currently deployed on Flight I and Flight II ships.

== Ballistic missile defense ==

The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMD) program by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency enables the Aegis system to act in a sea-based ballistic missile defense function, to counter short- and medium-range ballistic missiles of the variety typically employed by a number of potential opponent states. The program is part of the United States national missile defense strategy and NATO European missile defense system.

BMD capabilities allow vessels equipped with Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) to intercept ballistic missiles in post-boost phase and prior to reentry, using the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) mid-course interceptors and the RIM-156 Standard Missile 2 Extended Range Block IV (SM-2ER Block IV) terminal-phase interceptors. The SM-2ER Block IV can engage the ballistic missiles within the atmosphere (i.e. endoatmospheric intercept) in the terminal phase of a missile&#x27;s trajectory with a blast fragmentation warhead. The Standard Missile 3 is a development of the SM2-ER Block IV, capable of exo-atmospheric intercept (i.e. above the atmosphere) during the midcourse phase; its kinetic warhead (KW) is designed to destroy a ballistic missile&#x27;s warhead by colliding with it. RIM-174 Standard ERAM (Standard Missile 6) extended range active missile is a further development of the SM-2ER Block IV, which adds a booster and an active radar homing seeker. SM-6 can be used for either air defense or ballistic missile defense, providing extended range and increased firepower; it is not intended to replace the SM-2 series of missiles. The SM-6 Block IB includes a larger 21-inch rocket motor that sits on top of the 21-inch booster.

To enable Ballistic Missile Defense capabilities, signal processing for the SPY-1 radar was upgraded using commercial off-the-shelf components and open architecture standards. The Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) provides Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability for the first 28 ships (DDGs 51–78) of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers. This capability is also incorporated in and following new construction, as well as Aegis Ashore. MMSP modifies transmitters of the SPY-1D radar to enable dual-beam operation for reduced frame times and better reaction time, and provides stability for all waveforms, allowing the radar system to detect, track, and support engagements of a broader range of threats. MMSP improves performance in littoral, ducted clutter, electronic attack (EA), and chaff environments and provides greater commonality in computer programs and equipment.

As of January 2025, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are the only countries to purchase or deploy the Aegis BMD on their military ships.

Flight III of &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers starting with are equipped with AN/SPY-6 AESA radar from Raytheon, which is 30 times more sensitive and thus can handle 30 times more targets comparing to the SPY-1D radar, providing increased air and missile defense capabilities. Flight IIA ships will also be upgraded to SPY-6 in the future, giving them Aegis BMD capabilities.

Aegis Ashore is a land-based version of Aegis BMD which includes the AN/SPY-1 radar and command systems, and Mk 41 VLS equipped SM-3 and SM-6 missiles. Test installation exists at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. A site in Deveselu, Romania is operational since 2016, and a site near Redzikowo, Poland will become operational in 2022. Japan intended to deploy two systems with an AN/SPY-7 AESA radar by 2021, but cancelled these plans in 2020. Possible deployments of Aegis Ashore include U.S. naval base at Guam.

U.S. Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) program aims to integrate Aegis BMD and its AN/SPY-1 and AN/SPY-6 radars with MIM-104 Patriot (AN/MPQ-65A and GhostEye), NASAMS (GhostEye MR), AN/TPY-2 (THAAD and GMD), and F-35 Lightning II (AN/APG-81) radars to form a plug and fight network of land, sea, and air-based sensors to help detect and track ballistic missile threats and select Patriot and THAAD surface-to-air launchers that are best positioned for a successful intercept.

===NATO European Phased Adaptive Approach===

On 5 October 2011, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that the United States Navy will station four Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System warships at Naval Station Rota, Spain, to strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and bolster the ballistic missile defense (BMD) of NATO as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) missile defense program. On 16 February 2012, it was reported that the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers &quot;Donald Cook&quot; and &quot;Ross&quot; would be relocated to Rota during Fiscal Year 2014, followed by &quot;Porter&quot; and &quot;Carney&quot; in fiscal year 2015. On 9 May 2013, Commander Destroyer Squadron 60 was formally designated to perform type-command administrative oversight for the four BMD-capable destroyers based at Rota, Spain.

===JMSDF Aegis Afloat===


The Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) currently operates four , two , and two guided-missile destroyers as part of its &quot;Aegis Afloat&quot; program (&quot;See table below&quot;).

Additionally, on 31 August 2022, The Japan Ministry of Defense announced that JMSDF will operate two &quot;Aegis system equipped ships&quot; (イージス・システム搭載艦 in Japanese) (&quot;pictured&quot;) to replace the earlier plan of Aegis Ashore installations, commissioning one by the end of fiscal year 2027, and the other by the end of FY2028. The budget for design and other related expenses are to be submitted in the form of &quot;item requests&quot;, without specific amounts, and the initial procurement of the lead items are expected to clear legislation by FY2023. Construction is to begin in the following year of FY2024. At 20,000 tons each, both vessels will be the largest surface combatant warships operated by the JMSDF, and according to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, they will &quot;arguably [be] the largest deployable surface warships in the world.&quot;.

On 6 October 2022, five warships from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held a multilateral ballistic missile defense exercise in the Sea of Japan (&quot;pictured&quot;) as part of the military response to ongoing North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile tests over the Japanese home islands.

On 16 November 2022, the guided-missile destroyer fired an SM-3 Block IIA missile, successfully intercepting the target outside the atmosphere in the first launch of the missile from a Japanese warship. On 18 November 2022, the likewise fired an SM-3 Block IB missile with a successful hit outside the atmosphere (&quot;pictured&quot;). Both test firings were conducted at the U.S. Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai Island, Hawaii, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Missile Defense Agency. This was the first time the two ships conducted SM-3 firings in the same time period, and the tests validated the ballistic missile defense capabilities of Japan&#x27;s newest s.

On 23 December 2022, the Japanese Ministry of Defense&#x27;s 2023 budget and program guidance illustrated examples of operation (運用の一例) for the Aegis-equipped naval forces of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF). The two ASEV warship would be exclusively tasked for dedicated ballistic missile defense (BDM) missions (BMD等) and operate off the Korean peninsula in the Sea of Japan, allowing the other Aegis guided-missile destroyers to meet other contingencies (侵攻阻止) while operating independently to maintain the sea lines of communication (SLOC) open in the East China Sea southwest of the Japanese home islands.

On 22 February 2023, five warships from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held a multilateral ballistic missile defense exercise in the Sea of Japan in response to the launch of a North Korean Hwasong-15 ballistic missile on 18 February 2023, landing in Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Sea of Japan, in an area 125 miles west of the island of Ōshima, which lies west of the main island of Hokkaido. Two additional ICBMs were subsequently launched on 20 February 2023, with both landing in the Sea of Japan off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. On 19 December 2023, United States, Japan, and South Korea announced the activation of a real-time North Korea missile warning system as well as jointly established a multi-year trilateral exercise plan in response to North Korea&#x27;s continued ballistic missile launches.

==System problems==
In 2010, it was reported that Aegis radar systems on board some individual warships were not being maintained properly. A Navy panel headed by retired Vice Adm. Phillip Balisle issued the &quot;Balisle report,&quot; which asserted that over-emphasis on saving money, including cuts in crews and streamlined training and maintenance, led to a drastic decline in readiness, and left Aegis Combat Systems in low state of readiness.

===Iran Air Flight 655===


The Aegis system was involved in a disaster in which mistakenly shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988 resulting in 290 civilian deaths.

A formal military investigation by the United States Navy concluded that the Aegis system was completely operational and well maintained. The investigation found that if the commanding officer had relied on the complete tactical data displayed by the Aegis system, the engagement might never have occurred. Additionally, psychological effects of the crew subconsciously manipulating the data to accord with a predefined scenario greatly contributed to the false identification. The investigation found that the Aegis Combat System did not contribute to the incident and that the system&#x27;s recorded target data contributed to the investigation of the incident. The discrepancies between the Aegis data report and what the ship&#x27;s personnel reported to the commanding officer are as follows:

Other analyses found that ineffective user interface design caused poor integration with the crisis management human processes it was intended to facilitate. The Aegis System software shuffles target tracking numbers as it gathers additional data. When the captain asked for a status of the original target identifier TN4474, the Aegis system had recycled that identifier to a different target which was descending, indicating possible attack posture. An article by David Pogue in &quot;Scientific American&quot; rated it as one of the five &quot;worst digital user-interface debacles of all time.&quot;

===2024 F/A-18F shootdown===
On December 22, 2024 USS Gettysburg (CG-64) shot down an F/A-18F Super Hornet belonging to Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11) and flying off the . USCENTCOM stated that both the pilot and weapon systems officer ejected and were recovered safely shortly after, with only one receiving minor injuries after an initial assessment. The Gettysburg also fired on a second F/A-18 and missed by ~100 feet. The missile missed thanks to the pilot performing evasive maneuvers. Investigation on these incidents are in progress, as of January 2025.

==Operators==
* The Royal Australian Navy commissioned three s which have Aegis as the core of their combat systems, with the last entering service in 2020. The Australian Government announced that the class of nine s to be built in the next decade will also be Aegis equipped, but with a tactical interface developed by Saab Australia. The number of &quot;Hunter&quot;-class frigates were reduced to 6 following the Australian government&#x27;s Enhanced Lethality Surface Combatant Fleet program.
*The Royal Canadian Navy has awarded Lockheed Martin Canada building 15 Canadian Surface Combatants. The ships will be equipped with the AN/SPY-7(V)1 solid state radar and the International Aegis Fire Control Loop (IAFCL) is integrated with Canada&#x27;s combat management system, CMS 330, developed by Lockheed Martin Canada for the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s ships. The program will make Canada the owner of the world&#x27;s second largest Aegis fleet.
* The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force operates eight Aegis ships comprising the four s that entered service from 1993 and two improved units known as the from 2007. Two further improved units known as the were ordered with the first being commissioned in 2020 and the second in 2021.
* The Royal Norwegian Navy has acquired five Spanish-built s equipped with the Aegis system, with the first, entering service in 2006 and the last, , in 2011. One, was sunk after colliding with an oil tanker. After being raised, it was thought that repairing the ship was too costly and so it was decided to scrap the ship.
* Republic of Korea Navy currently operates 4 s, with the lead ship commissioned in 2008. 2 further vessels have been ordered. The three earlier &quot;Batch I&quot; vessels use Aegis Baseline 7. The three latter &quot;Batch II&quot; vessels use Aegis Baseline 9, which allows the radar to be used for air warfare and BMD at the same time.
* The Spanish Navy is currently operating five F100 Aegis frigates, and starting it 2024, it will operate the as well. The F-110 class will incorporate the International Aegis Fire Control Loop (IAFCL) integrated with SCOMBA, the national combat system developed by Navantia.
* The U.S. Navy currently operates the Aegis equipped s and s and has ordered more of the latter. It will reportedly integrate the new Aegis Baseline 10 on its upcoming &quot;Constellation&quot;-class frigates.

Informally, some media refer to the Chinese phased-array radar air-defense destroyers, Type 052C and Type 052D destroyers, as &quot;Chinese Aegis&quot;. Outside foreign observers retain the usage of &quot;Aegis&quot; mainly for the brand-name Aegis Combat System-equipped classes.

<text>Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters is a 1992 video game, the sequel to &quot;Star Control&quot;. It was developed by Toys for Bob (Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III) and originally published by Accolade in 1992 for MS-DOS. The game includes exoplanet-abundant star systems, hyperspace travel, extraterrestrial life, and interstellar diplomacy. There are 25 alien races with which communication is possible.

Released to critical acclaim, &quot;Star Control II&quot; is widely viewed today as one of the greatest PC games ever made. It has appeared on lists of the greatest video games of all time.

The game was ported to 3DO by Crystal Dynamics in 1994 with an enhanced multimedia presentation. The source code of the 3DO port was licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later in 2002, the game content under CC-BY-NC-SA-2.5. The 3DO source code was the basis of the open source game &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Star Control 3&quot;, was released in 1996.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Star Control II&quot; is an action-adventure science fiction game, set in an open universe. It features ship-to-ship combat based on the original &quot;Star Control&quot;, but removes the first game&#x27;s strategy gameplay to focus on story and dialog, as seen in other adventure games. The player&#x27;s goal is to free Earth from the evil Ur-Quan, by recruiting aliens to help. The main gameplay elements are exploring the galaxy, gathering resources, building a fleet, defeating enemy ships, and conversing with aliens.

One-on-one spaceship battles take place in real-time, based on the core gameplay of the original &quot;Star Control&quot;. Each ship has unique weapons, maneuvers, and secondary abilities, and winning a battle requires a combination of ship selection and skill. This combat mode can be played separately in a two-player battle mode called Super Melee. In the story mode, the player is limited to the ships they can gain from sympathetic alien races, whereas Super Melee includes every ship in both &quot;Star Control&quot; games. The only ship unique to the story mode is the player&#x27;s capital ship, which is upgraded as the player gains new technology and resources.

After a brief opening sequence, the player is given near total freedom to explore the galaxy at large. Exploration often involves travelling to stars, landing on planets, and gathering resources. The player navigates their star map, with over 500 stars and 3800 planets to potentially visit. Players must manage their risk as they explore, as planets with more dangerous hazards usually feature more valuable resources, which are vital to upgrade the player&#x27;s fleet. More rarely, a planet will feature an interactive alien race, who the player can engage with as a potential friend or foe. The interactive dialog options help advance the story, with branching conversations similar to other adventure games. These conversations also reveal secrets and information about the galaxy. The game vastly expands on the characters and backstory from the first game, with each species having their own characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.

== Plot ==

Whereas the first &quot;Star Control&quot; stores most of its lore in the instruction manual, &quot;Star Control II&quot; continues the story with a rich in-game experience, playing through events after the Alliance is defeated by the Hierarchy. In the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient Precursor subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition&#x27;s Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.

The player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth&#x27;s caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what&#x27;s happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans&#x27; allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an internecine war with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans&#x27; distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.

The Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on their side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan&#x27;s hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a Precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a Precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan. After escaping the ship through a pod, the explosion incapacitates the commander for some time, until he later awakens at the medbay in the Earth Starbase. There, he learns that the loss of the Sa-Matra was a crippling blow to the Ur-Quan and witnesses the deactivation of the slave shield over Earth, revealing its true colors to space.

==Development==
=== Concept ===

&quot;Star Control II&quot; began as a more ambitious project than the original &quot;Star Control&quot;, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a &quot;science fiction adventure role-playing game&quot;. The team credits the pre-existing combat from the original &quot;Star Control&quot; with giving them a strong core to build a larger game around. The sequel would develop into a much more detailed adventure than the first edition. Ford explains that the original &quot;Star Control&quot; had &quot;some story there, but it was mostly in the manual. In &quot;Star Control II&quot;, we made a conscious decision to tell more of a story&quot;. The duo would downplay the scale of the game when pitching it to their publisher Accolade, and the game&#x27;s development would eventually go over schedule.

Reiche and Ford drew inspiration from many science-fiction authors, as well as peers in the game industry. A few years earlier, Reiche had been friends with Greg Johnson during the creation of &quot;Starflight&quot;, inspiring Reiche to offer creative input on Johnson&#x27;s expansive science fiction game. Once Reiche and Ford conceived &quot;Star Control 2&quot;, they would draw large inspiration from &quot;Starflight&quot;. This friendship and mutual admiration even led to hiring Greg Johnson, whom they credit as &quot;one of the most significant contributors to &quot;Star Control II&quot;&quot;. Ford also cites their shared love of author Jack Vance from their childhood, and were intrigued by the idea of exaggerated societies taken to their extremes, and intelligent characters committed to an interesting agenda. Reiche would cite the influence of numerous fiction authors over the &quot;Star Control&quot; series, including Jack Vance, Orson Scott Card, Robert Heinlein, David Brin, and Andre Norton. David Brin&#x27;s &quot;Uplift&quot; Universe and Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot; series are often mentioned as inspiration for &quot;Star Control II&quot;.

=== Technology ===
The creators started by asking &quot;what people do when they go out and have an adventure in space&quot;, while keeping in mind what they could actually implement. This led them to create numerous stars and planets, through a combination of procedural generation and handcrafted assets. Despite the fact that exoplanets had yet to be fully discovered, Reiche initially took on the challenge of simulating planetary systems based on scientific principles. They ultimately decided to bypass some details of the simulation, due to its lack of distinct planets to explore. Instead, they imagined cracked planets with magma chasms, ruby planets with precious zirconium, and even rainbow colored planets. The planets were created with a procedurally generated height map, which required difficult programming solutions to simulate the appearance of a 3D sphere. They additionally simulated 3D asteroids by digitizing images of pumice they had taken from a parking lot.

The &quot;Star Control II&quot; team also invented their own fictional, flat version of space, so that the stars could be arranged in a more clear and interesting way. The algorithmically assisted generation of the star map helped to create a vast, mysterious setting for players to explore. The map also added circles of influence for the aliens, not just to describe their location, but to provide narrative hints about their changing power, relationships, and stories.

=== Fictional universe ===
Reiche and Ford wanted their new game to further investigate their self-described &quot;superficial&quot; stories and aliens from the original &quot;Star Control&quot;. Thus, the story for &quot;Star Control II&quot; would greatly expand on those original characters, and add a few more.

This was the last time that Reiche would design a game using pen and paper, including dozens of flow charts for the major plot points, player choices, and dialog trees. Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, &quot;I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. &quot;&#x27;What do you guys do&quot;?&#x27; And they tell me.&quot; Early in the process, they used the first game&#x27;s character and ship images to create simple visual stories about the two main sides of the conflict. The main antagonist the Ur-Quan were already understood as a race of slavers in &quot;Star Control&quot;, so Reiche developed their motivation by writing their backstory as slaves themselves. To justify the Mycon&#x27;s organic structures and high energy plasma, they decided that the Mycon lived beneath the planet&#x27;s crust, and must have been artificially created to survive there. Fred Ford inspired the character design for the Earth starbase commander, as well as the Pkunk&#x27;s insult ability, while the Spathi were inspired by a running joke about Paul Reiche&#x27;s desire for self-preservation. The rich storytelling was a contrast to the first game&#x27;s emphasis on player versus player combat, but they realized that their combat artificial intelligence could give story-loving players an option to delegate battles.

Once Reiche and Ford imagined the different alien personalities, Reiche hand-drew a flow chart for each alien&#x27;s dialog options, which Ford would implement into the game with placeholder tags. However, the sheer quantity of writing and art proved to be challenging for the game&#x27;s epic scale. Fred Ford surprised the team with his prolific coding, and it was the rest of the team who needed to catch-up with art, writing, music, and other assets. They quickly enlisted the help of friends and family to create game content. One crucial friend was &quot;Starflight&quot; creator Greg Johnson, who Reiche had previously helped on &quot;Starflight&quot; while sharing office space. Johnson ended up writing dialog for several aliens, as well as creating most of the artwork for the alien spaceships. They were also able to hire fantasy artist George Barr through mutual friends, who had inspired the game&#x27;s &quot;pulp science-fiction&quot; feel, and happened to be living nearby. Long-time friend Erol Otus was another collaborator, who Reiche describes as contributing the widest range of content, including music, text, art, illustrations for the game manual, and (later) voice-acting.

The largest number of collaborators were needed for the game&#x27;s numerous dialog options. The creators were admirers of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games, and aimed to achieve the same level of player choice and humor. Reiche felt that each character needed their own font to match their distinct personality, and built a font-editing system to achieve this.

=== Deadline and budget ===
Reiche and Ford felt it was difficult to maintain Accolade&#x27;s interest in the game. In fact, Accolade had played a version of the game with placeholder dialog, and was content to ship the game with the &quot;cryptic&quot; text as-is. This led to an industry legend that the duo absconded to Alaska to finish the game without Accolade&#x27;s interference. The creators later clarified that Accolade did not interfere with development and was satisfied to publish the game in any form, and that this was important to their creative freedom and artistic success. As the project went over schedule, their payment from Accolade came to an end. Fred Ford decided to financially support the team for the final months of development, and they were ultimately able to finish the project with the help of numerous family, friends, and other collaborators.

The team stretched their music budget by holding a contest to create the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Reiche and Ford had previously discovered the sample-based MOD file format while porting the first &quot;Star Control&quot;&#x27;s music to consoles. They posted the music contest to a newsgroup for Amiga users, despite the fact that the game was for PC, because Amiga hobbyists were the main community of MOD-tracker users in that time. The contest attracted people from around the world, due to the popularity of the MOD format in the largely European demoscene. The contest also led them to discover a teenager named Dan Nicholson, who they hired to create additional music as needed. Further music came from existing team member Erol Otus, who first composed the Ur-Quan theme on a synthesizer before it was re-sampled and exported to the MOD file format. The critically acclaimed soundtrack would include music from Aaron Grier, Erol Otus, Eric Berge, Riku Nuottajärvi, and Dan Nicholson.

Months after its release, the team would create hours of voice dialog for the 3DO version of the game, taking advantage of space afforded by CD-ROM technology, while bucking the trend of CD-based games with full motion video. Game Developer Magazine featured the game in its list of open source space games, praising its scale and charm, as well as its new features. In the end, the 3DO version would feature 11 hours of voice audio, including performances from Reiche, as well as friends Greg Johnson and Erol Otus.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Control II&quot; received a positive reception around its release, as well as several awards. Soon after, &quot;Star Control II&quot; began to appear on many &quot;all time best&quot; lists for players and industry figures, a reputation that has continued ever since.

=== Reviews and awards ===
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Star Control II&quot; was as much a sequel to &quot;Starflight&quot; as to &quot;Star Control&quot;. The reviewer praised the VGA graphics and wrote that the game &quot;has some of the best dialogue ever encountered in this genre&quot;. He concluded that the game &quot;has been placed on this reviewer&#x27;s top ten list of all time ... one of the most enjoyable games to review all year. It is not often that a perfect balance is struck between role playing, adventure, and action/arcade&quot;. In their 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the future, they gave the game four-plus stars out of five, stating that &quot;it offers hours of &#x27;simple, hot and deep&#x27; play&quot;. &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game a full five-star review, telling their readers that &quot;if you are a science-fiction gamer who enjoys a superb game environment, a high dollar-to-play ratio, and numerous challenges, SC2 is a definite must-have for your software library&quot;. &quot;Questbusters&quot; called it the &quot;best science-fiction role-playing game since &quot;Starflight&quot;&quot;, and &quot;best RPG of the year&quot;. Giving the game four out of five stars, &quot;Game Players&quot; described the game&#x27;s epic scale, where &quot;there&#x27;s so much to do -- so many planets to explore and mysteries to solve and battles to fight -- that the game may dominate your spare time&quot;. &quot;PC Games&quot; noted the game&#x27;s &quot;rich history&quot;, describing the game as &quot;part arcade, part role-play, &quot;Star Control II&quot; is all science fiction, with an emphasis on &quot;fiction&quot;.&quot; &quot;COMPUTE!&quot; suggested that the game &quot;gives you exactly what you want in a space adventure&quot;, also giving the strongest praise for the music and sound as &quot;among the best done for any game on the market.&quot; The game was also rated 96/100 by Finnish magazine &quot;Pelit&quot;, who immediately hailed it as one of the best games of the year.

Reviewing the 3DO version, &quot;GamePro&quot; remarked that the user-friendly interface makes the complicated gameplay easy to handle. They also praised the impressive graphics and the voice acting&#x27;s use of unique vocal inflections for each alien race, and concluded that the game is &quot;an addicting epic sci-fi adventure that will have patient space explorers and zero-gravity tacticians glued to their screens for a million hours. All others should stay away.&quot; The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; likewise praised the accessible interface and impressive graphics, but complained that the alien voices are sometimes difficult to understand. They cited the CD-quality audio and the Melee mode as other strong points, and one of them commented that it &quot;blows [the PC version] out of the water.&quot; They gave it an 8.25 out of 10. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;if you&#x27;ve the patience to spend hours digging for minerals, the game is addictive, but not state of the art.&quot;

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Star Control II&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #36 (1993), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Mystery, puzzles, combat, exploration, and more make &quot;Star Control II&quot; a science fiction software delight.&quot;

The year of its release, the Game Developers Conference honored &quot;Star Control II&quot; as an exceptional game among their &quot;Class of &#x27;93&quot;, calling it a &quot;perfect blend of action and adventure&quot;, as well as &quot;sound that is exceptional enough to make gamers think they&#x27;ve upgraded their sound boards&quot;. The game also received &quot;Pelit&quot; magazine&#x27;s first &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award, and an award from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, naming it the magazine&#x27;s 1993 Adventure Game of the Year (a co-honor with &quot;Eric the Unready&quot;).

=== &quot;Greatest game&quot; lists ===
&quot;Star Control II&quot; quickly began to appear on &quot;all-time favorite&quot; lists, a practice that continued for many years. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Star Control II&quot; as the 21st best computer game ever. The editors called it &quot;an epic&quot; and &quot;thoroughly enjoyable to play and look at.&quot; That same year, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the 33rd best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;If ever a game deserved an award for being underrated, it&#x27;s &quot;Star Control II&quot;.&quot; The next year, players voted the game into &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Readers Top 40. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; created their own list in 1996, ranking &quot;Star Control II&quot; as the 29th best PC game of all time, calling it &quot;a stunning mix of adventure, action, and humor.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; also ranked it among their top 50 games of all time.

This acclaim continued well into the next millennium. In 2000, &quot;GameSpy&quot; inducted &quot;Star Control II&quot; into their Hall of Fame, and ranked it the 26th best game of all time just one year later. The Sydney Morning Herald noted &quot;Star Control II&quot; on its 2002 list, ranking the game as the 26th best game of all time. In 2003, &quot;GameSpot&quot; included &quot;Star Control II&quot; on their list of greatest games of all time. In the same year, &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Star Control II&quot; as their 53rd greatest game of all time, and ranked it again at 17th greatest in 2005. In 2006, Computer Gaming World inducted &quot;Star Control II&quot; into their Hall of Fame, explaining that &quot;what made &quot;Star Control II&quot; stand out, though, was the incredible amount of backstory and interaction with all the alien species&quot;. PC Gamer listed &quot;Star Control II&quot; the 52nd greatest PC game in their 2011 rankings, and Hardcore Gaming 101 listed it among their 2015 rankings of 200 best video games of all time.

Compared to classic games from the same period, &quot;Star Control II&quot; is also ranked on several &quot;best of&quot; lists. Hardcore Gaming selected the game for their 2007 list of favorite classics, with &quot;a combination of sandbox space travel and arcade-style combat, a plotline equal to any space opera you can name, hundreds of pages&#x27; worth of interactive dialog and dozens of memorable, unique races, it&#x27;s easy to see why most reviews of &quot;Star Control II&quot; quickly turn into love letters.&quot; When &quot;Kotaku&quot; compiled their 2013 list of &quot;Classic PC Games You Must Play&quot;, &quot;Star Control II&quot; reached the very top of the list. In 2014, USGamer mentioned the game as one of the landmark titles from the 1990s. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; remembers &quot;Star Control II&quot; as one of the top 10 games made for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and later listed it among their top 100 retro games at the 68th position. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also ranked it at #37 among their list of classic DOS games. Its status as a classic game would lead &quot;IGN&quot; to list the series among the top 10 franchises that needed to be resurrected. Comparing it to the original &quot;Star Control&quot;, Cinema Blend celebrates &quot;Star Control II&quot; in their short list of sequels that progressed well beyond their predecessors.

=== &quot;Greatest design&quot; lists ===
&quot;Star Control II&quot; is also recognized for its excellence in several creative areas, including writing, design, and music. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked &quot;Star Control II&quot; among their top 15 most rewarding game endings, proclaiming that the game &quot;entertains right down to the end, with the some of the funniest credits since Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Holy Grail&quot;&quot;. The game&#x27;s ending was similarly ranked as the third greatest of all time according to &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s editors, with their readers ranking it the sixth greatest ending. Moreover, GameSpot twice acclaimed the Ur-Quan among their top ten game villains, mentioning them at the top of one 1999 list as &quot;one of the very best villains. Even now, we are hard-pressed to find a race of adversaries as complex and three-dimensional as the Ur-Quan.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also included the Ur-Quan in their 2021 list of best aliens in pop culture, describing them as &quot;tremendous sci-fi villains, importing heady old-school concepts into &quot;Star Control&quot;&#x27;s relentlessly fun space-based action&quot;.

The world design of &quot;Star Control II&quot; is also celebrated, with &quot;Paste&quot; magazine giving it top ranking on their list of &quot;games that capture the infinite potential of space&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; ranked the &quot;Star Control II&quot; universe among their top ten game worlds, whereas GameRant listed &quot;Star Control II&quot; as the third largest open world map, also noting it as &quot;perhaps the most underrated game of all time&quot;.

The game&#x27;s music is remembered as the 37th greatest game soundtrack by the music magazine &quot;FACT&quot;, describing it as &quot;a lost 80s treasure trove of unreleased techno, synth pop and Italo&quot;. The music of &quot;Star Control II&quot; was similarly listed as the second greatest game soundtrack according to &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s editors, which was echoed once again by their readers.

== Legacy ==
Long after its release, &quot;Star Control II&quot; continues to garner acclaim across the game industry. Responding to film critics who criticized video games as a superficial medium, &quot;The Escapist&quot; magazine highlighted &quot;Star Control II&quot; as &quot;the scripting was second to none. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fantastical setting - the story maturely dealt with wide ranging issues, from genocide to religious extremism, and still remained terrifying, touching, and damn funny in places.&quot; The magazine would revisit this in a 2014 retrospective, calling it a &quot;must play for space loving gamers&quot;, offering &quot;a massive experience filled with exploration, action and some of the funniest aliens you&#x27;ll run into any video game&quot;. &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; featured the game in 2016, celebrating &quot;some of the most memorable aliens ever put in a game, and still some of the best written.&quot; In a 2018 retrospective of the entire series, &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; notes that &quot;there are aspects of &quot;Star Control II&quot; that are rough around the edges..., [b]ut once you surmount those obstacles, it reveals itself as one of the smartest, funniest, most adventure-filled science fiction games ever made&quot;. In a multi-part feature on the history of video games, VGChartz noted that &quot;Star Control II&quot; is &quot;often considered one of the greatest games ever made&quot;. &quot;Kotaku&quot; referred to it as &quot;one of the early &#x27;90s most revolutionary sci-fi games&quot;, and game historian Rusel DeMaria describes it as one of the best games ever written. Additionally, The Dickinson Press called it &quot;one of the best PC games ever&quot;, and &quot;The Completist&quot; notes it as &quot;one of the greatest games ever made&quot;.

Indeed, &quot;Star Control II&quot; is admired and influential amongst notable developers in the game industry. Tim Cain credits &quot;Star Control II&quot; with inspiring his open-ended design in both &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;&quot;, calling it his personal favorite RPG of all time and one of the best computer games ever developed. Founder of BioWare Ray Muzyka also cites &quot;Star Control&quot; as an inspiration, stating that &quot;the uncharted worlds in &quot;Mass Effect&quot; comes from imagining what a freely explorable universe would be like inside a very realistic next-gen game.&quot; Indeed, journalists have noted heavy similarities in the story, characters, and overall experience of &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, even calling &quot;Star Control II&quot; a spiritual predecessor. &quot;FACT&quot; notes that &quot;Star Control II&quot;&#x27;s &quot;galaxy-spanning sci-fi setting whose adventure elements foreshadowed &quot;Mass Effect&quot; by a good 15 years&quot;. &quot;PCGamesN&quot; explains further, that &quot;while &quot;Star Control II&quot; is a little clunky and esoteric by modern standards, this was the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; of its era, defining many of the elements you might have taken for granted in Bioware&#x27;s classic sci-fi RPG series. ... &quot;Star Control&quot;″s weird and wonderful alien races are far more exciting than anything Bioware gave us.&quot; Henrik Fahraeus of Paradox Interactive credits &quot;Star Control II&quot; as a major influence on strategy game &quot;Stellaris&quot;, after expressing disappointment that the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series lacked the exploration and openness of &quot;Star Control II&quot;. Game writer and narrative designer Zoë Quinn called &quot;Star Control II&quot; a childhood obsession, describing how she &quot;filled several notebooks with notes and maps as I constantly explored Fake Space, trying to see everything and uncover all the secrets in the game.&quot; Vice President of Insomniac Games Brian Hastings ranked &quot;Star Control II&quot; as one of his top games, and one of &quot;the most original and perfectly executed games ever&quot;. Alexx Kay of Irrational Games hailed &quot;Star Control II&quot; as the best game &quot;by a mile&quot;, noting that it was &quot;one of the first story-based games where your actions had clear consequences&quot;. In Joshua Bycer&#x27;s book &quot;20 Essential Games to Study&quot;, his first chapter is devoted to analyzing &quot;Star Control II&quot;, as an unprecedented open world game far ahead of its contemporaries.

&quot;Star Control II&quot; is sometimes credited as a spiritual successor to &quot;Starflight&quot;, inheriting its legacy as a genre-defining space exploration game.

===&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot;===

&quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot; is a modified open-source release of &quot;Star Control 2&quot;, based on a freely available version of the original 3DO code.

=== Sequel and continuity ===
In 2017, Reiche and Ford announced plans to create a direct sequel to &quot;The Ur-Quan Masters&quot;, which would effectively bypass the story from &quot;Star Control 3&quot;, created by the now defunct Legend Entertainment. This announcement comes after years of fan requests for a sequel. Due to disagreements between the trademark owner of &quot;Star Control&quot; and the ownership of the intellectual property within the games previously sold under the trademark, the game development was halted. A settlement has been reached, and work resumed in the fall of 2020.

After leaving Toys for Bob, Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III co-founded Pistol Shrimp Games alongside Ken Ford and Dan Gerstein, under which they are currently developing &quot;Free Stars: Children of Infinity&quot;. On April 4, 2024, the official trailer for this project was released on the GameSpot channel on YouTube. The campaign to fund the game launched on Kickstarter on April 16, 2024, and has ended on May 18, 2024, collecting more than $650 000.

<doc id="198999" wikidata="Q209419" url="?curid=198999" title="Pink-footed goose">
<text>The pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) is a goose which breeds in eastern Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, and recently Novaya Zemlya. It is migratory, wintering in northwest Europe, especially Ireland, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and western Denmark. The name is often abbreviated in colloquial usage to &quot;pinkfoot&quot; (plural &quot;pinkfeet&quot;). &quot;Anser&quot; is the Latin for &quot;goose&quot;, and &quot;brachyrhynchus&quot; comes from the ancient Greek &quot;brachus&quot;, meaning &quot;short&quot;, and &quot;rhunchos&quot;, meaning &quot;bill&quot;.

== Description ==

It is a medium-sized goose, long, the wingspan , and weighing . It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, similar in pattern to tundra bean goose but pink where that species is orange, and pink feet. The body is mid-grey-brown, the head and neck a richer, darker brown, the rump and vent white, and the tail grey with a broad white tip. The upper wing-coverts are of a somewhat similar pale bluish-grey as in the greylag goose, and the flight feathers blackish-grey. 

==Taxonomy==
The species is surprisingly most closely related to the larger taiga bean goose &quot;Anser fabalis&quot;, rather than the similarly-sized subspecies of the tundra bean goose &quot;A. serrirostris rossicus&quot;, with which it had earlier been linked. It produces a medley of high-pitched honking calls, being particularly vocal in flight, with large skeins being almost deafening.

==Population==

There are two largely discrete populations of pink-footed goose. The Greenland and Iceland population winters in Great Britain, while the Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya population winters in the Netherlands and Denmark, with small numbers also in Norway (where it is common on migration), northern Germany, and Belgium.

Populations have risen spectacularly over the last 50 years, due largely to increased protection from shooting on the wintering grounds. Numbers wintering in Ireland and Great Britain have risen almost tenfold from 30,000 in 1950 to 292,000 in October 2004. The numbers wintering in Denmark and the Netherlands have also risen, with about 34,000 in 1993. The most important single breeding site, at Þjórsárver in Iceland (holding 10,700 pairs in 1970), was only discovered in 1951, by Sir Peter Scott and his team who made an expedition to seek the breeding grounds. Within Great Britain, the most important wintering areas are in Norfolk (147,000 in 2004), Lancashire (44,000 in 2004), and Aberdeenshire (primarily on autumn and spring passage). In Ireland it winters mainly in County Louth. Large to huge wintering flocks graze on farmland; individual flocks can be spectacular, such as the 66,000 at Loch of Strathbeg, Aberdeenshire in early September 2003.

A 2023 paper documented the rapid formation of a new breeding population of pink-footed geese on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in Russia. This population was formed within 10 years by individuals from the Svalbard breeding population; the colonisation of this new habitat was thought to be facilitated by climate change (with warming causing Novaya Zemlya to gain a climate more akin to Svalbard&#x27;s climate from decades prior) and the capacity for cultural transmission and social learning among the geese. This range expansion is thought to be one of the most dramatic climate change-induced distribution changes in a migratory bird. This population numbered about 3,000 to 4,000 birds as of 2023.

==Ecology==

Nesting is often on cliffs close to glaciers to provide protection from mammalian predators (mainly Arctic fox), also on islets in lakes. Three to six eggs are laid in early to mid-May in Iceland, late May in Svalbard, with incubation lasting 26–27 days. On hatching, the goslings accompany the parents on foot to the nearest lake, where they fledge after about 56 days. Southbound migration is from mid-September to early October, and northbound from mid-April to early May.

The diet is almost entirely vegetarian. In summer, they feed on a wide range of tundra plants, both on land and in water. In winter, they graze primarily on oilseed rape, sugar beet, potato, and various grasses; damage to crops can be extensive, though their grazing can also benefit particularly sugar beet and potato farmers by gleaning leaves and roots left behind after the crop is harvested, reducing the transmission of crop diseases from one year to the next.

==Vagrancy==
Despite the proximity to the large winter numbers in Great Britain, only very small numbers occur in Ireland and France. It is a rare vagrant to several other European countries and as far south as Morocco and the Canary Islands, and also to eastern Canada and the United States (from Newfoundland south to Pennsylvania). From November to December 2022, one was seen repeatedly throughout Kentucky, the first known instance of the bird being seen in the state.

The pink-footed goose is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>USS &quot;Takanis Bay&quot; (CVE-89) was a of the United States Navy, which served during World War II. She was named after Takanis Bay on the west side of Yakobi Island in Alaska (near Sitka). Launched in March 1944 and commissioned in April, she served as a carrier training vessel, operating off of San Diego. Following the end of hostilities, she repatriated troops from the Pacific theater as part of Operation Magic Carpet.

==Design and description==
&quot;Takanis Bay&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of (an extreme width of ), and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38-caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number, particularly due to the constant turnover of pilots and aircraft for training.

==Construction==
The escort carrier was laid down on 16 December 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1126, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 10 March; sponsored by Mrs. Alden R. Sanborn; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 15 April 1944, Captain Anthony R. Brady in command.

==Service history==
After a brief shakedown, &quot;Takanis Bay&quot; reported to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, where she operated in support of carrier training operations. On 22 May, the first landing was made on the carrier&#x27;s flight deck. Until the end of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945, a steady stream of carrier squadrons was trained onboard &quot;Takanis Bay&quot;, rotating off for service on a frontline carrier once they had finished qualifications. In this period, between 24 May 1944 to 28 August 1945, she qualified a record 2,509 pilots. She also engaged in the most landings of any Casablanca-class carrier: 20,159 landings. This record, at the time, was only surpassed by the venerable frontline fleet carriers and . On 24 July 1945, pilots of VC-20 made 446 landings on a single day. Remarkably, only a single pilot died throughout her career as a training carrier, albeit accidents were frequent.

On 28 August 1945, she left San Diego, bound for Pearl Harbor, where she was assigned to Carrier Transport Squadron, Pacific Fleet. She joined the fleet of carriers repatriating American servicemen from around the Pacific theater. Between 28 August and 3 January 1946, she ferried about 6,500 troops. Firstly, in two trips, she returned 1,300 servicemen from Hawaii to San Diego. Late in September, the carrier was officially assigned to the Operation Magic Carpet fleet. While docked in San Diego, bunks for 800 passengers were installed in the hangar deck. Once modifications were complete, she made two more round trip voyages to Hawaii, along with a trip to the Tokyo Bay area.

&quot;Takanis Bay&quot; arrived at San Pedro, California, on 2 January 1946. On 3 January, she was released from the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, and ordered to Tacoma, Washington. She was moved to Puget Sound in April, where inactivation work was begun, and she was decommissioned on 18 June. &quot;Takanis Bay&quot; was reclassified CVU-89 on 12 June 1955 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1959. She was sold on 29 June 1960 to Hyman-Michaels Company, Chicago, Illinois, for scrap and broken up in Portland, Oregon.

<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy writings, Isengard () is a large fortress in Nan Curunír, the Wizard&#x27;s Vale, in the western part of Middle-earth. In the fantasy world, the name of the fortress is described as a translation of Angrenost, a word in Tolkien&#x27;s elvish language, Sindarin, a compound of two Old English words: and , meaning &quot;enclosure of iron&quot;.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Orthanc, the tower at the centre of Isengard, is the home of the Wizard Saruman. He had been ensnared by the Dark Lord Sauron through the tower&#x27;s &quot;palantír&quot;, a far-seeing crystal ball able to communicate with others like it. Saruman had bred Orcs in Isengard, in imitation of Sauron&#x27;s forces, to be ready for war with Rohan. The Orcs cut down many trees in the forest of the Ents, who retaliate by destroying Isengard while the army of Orcs is away attacking Rohan at Helm&#x27;s Deep. However, the Ents are unable to harm the tower of Orthanc. Saruman, isolated in the tower, is visited by members of the Fellowship of the Ring; his staff is broken by the Wizard Gandalf.

Isengard has been described by Tolkien scholars as an industrial hell, and as an illustration of the homogeneity of evil, in contrast to the evident diversity of the free societies of Middle-earth, including those of the Elves, Dwarves, and Gondor. Others have compared it to Vichy France, and its proposed governor on behalf of Mordor, the Mouth of Sauron, to a traitorous Quisling.

== Fictional history ==

=== Construction ===

The Númenóreans in exile built Isengard in the Second Age as a walled circular enclosure, with the tower of Orthanc at its centre. It lay just outside the north-western corner of Rohan, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south.
The river Isen or Angren began on Methedras, the southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains. Methedras stood behind Isengard, forming its northern wall. The rest of its perimeter consisted of a large wall, the Ring of Isengard, breached only by the inflow of the river at the north-east through a portcullis, and the gate of Isengard at the south, at both shores of the river. For most of its history, Isengard was a green and pleasant place, with many fruiting trees.

Orthanc was built towards the end of the Second Age by men of Gondor from four many-sided columns of rock joined by an unknown process and then hardened. No known weapon could harm it. Orthanc rose to more than above the plain of Isengard, and ended in four sharp peaks. Its only entrance was at the top of a high stair, and above that was a small window and balcony. It housed one of the palantírs of the South Kingdom, and was guarded by a warden.

=== Depopulation ===

In the Third Age the land around Isengard (Calenardhon) became depopulated, and the last warden of Orthanc was recalled to Minas Tirith. Isengard remained guarded by a small company, led by a hereditary captain. Contact with Minas Tirith gradually decreased and eventually ceased altogether. When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, becoming the land of Rohan, Isengard was the sole fortress retained by Gondor north of the Ered Nimrais. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the fortress became Dunlending in all but name. The tower of Orthanc however remained locked and inaccessible to the Dunlendings, as the Steward of Gondor alone held the keys in Minas Tirith. The line of hereditary Captains died out, and during the rule of Rohan&#x27;s King Déor, Isengard became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Isengard as their base, the Dunlendings continually raided Rohan until during the rule of Helm Hammerhand, the Dunlending lord Freca and his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim fought off the invaders and blockaded Isengard, eventually taking it.

Gondor did not wish to relinquish its claim to the tower, but lacked the strength to garrison it. A solution presented itself to the Steward of Gondor, Beren, as the Wizard Saruman suddenly reappeared from the East, offering to guard Isengard. Beren gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc. At first he resided there as Warden of the Tower on behalf of Gondor. The valley became known as Nan Curunír, the &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Vale&quot;. On Sauron&#x27;s return to Mordor, Saruman asserted himself as Lord of Isengard.

=== War of the Ring ===

During the War of the Ring, Saruman prepares for war against Rohan, defiling the valley of Isengard with deep pits where he breeds large numbers of powerful warrior Orcs, Uruk-hai, smithing weapons in underground workshops full of machinery, and felling the valley&#x27;s trees.

The Orcs of Isengard bear upon their shields the symbol of a White Hand on a black field, and on their helmets an S-rune () to signify &quot;Saruman&quot;. A carved and painted White Hand of stone is set on a black pillar outside the gates of Isengard.
Treebeard, leader of the Ents, seeing that the Orcs would destroy his forest of Fangorn, leads an army of Ents and Huorns to Isengard, destroys it, and floods it, leaving Saruman isolated in the tower of Orthanc. The hobbits Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took, as the new &quot;doorwardens&quot;, receive Théoden King of Rohan, Aragorn and the wizard Gandalf at the wrecked gates. Gandalf speaks with Saruman and breaks his staff. Grima Wormtongue throws the Orthanc palantír, a stone of seeing, at the party; both Pippin and Aragorn later use it, seeing and deceiving Sauron as to the Fellowship&#x27;s intentions.

Saruman is locked in Orthanc and guarded by Treebeard, who later sets him free. Saruman hands the tower&#x27;s keys over to Treebeard, and takes Gríma with him. Saruman exploits Treebeard&#x27;s unwillingness to see any living thing caged, most likely using his power with words.

=== Restoration ===

During the Fourth Age, when Aragorn has been crowned as King Elessar (&quot;Elfstone&quot;), he visits Orthanc, finding there heirlooms of Isildur, among them the &quot;Elendilmir&quot;, the Star of Arnor, and the small gold case on a chain that Isildur had used to carry the One Ring, evidence that Saruman had found and apparently destroyed Isildur&#x27;s remains. Isengard is restored, and the entire valley granted to the Ents. The Ents name the new forest the Treegarth of Orthanc. Orthanc becomes again a tower of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.

== Origins ==

=== Etymology ===

&quot;Isengard&quot; is from Old English , &quot;iron&quot; and , &quot;court, enclosure&quot;. The names, supposedly given by the Rohirrim, for Orthanc, the cunningly-built tower of Isengard, and for the Ents, the tree-giants of Fangorn forest who eventually destroy Isengard, are similarly in reality from Old English. Both are found in the poem &quot;The Ruin&quot;, which describes the ancient Roman ruins as , &quot;skilful work&quot;, and , &quot;the work of giants&quot; and in &quot;Maxims II&quot;.
Clark Hall gives the meanings of the noun as &quot;intelligence, understanding, mind; cleverness, skill; skilful work, mechanical art&quot;, and as an adjective &quot;ingenious, skilful&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggests that Tolkien may have chosen to read the phrase also as &quot;Orthanc, the Ent&#x27;s fortress&quot;. 

The historian Casper Clemmensen suggests that Tolkien was inspired by Norse mythology and the Danish landcape, with the manor house Isgård (&quot;Ice manor&quot;) on the Djursland peninsula as the inspiration for Isengard.

=== Bilingual pun ===

The name of the tower of Orthanc is unique in that it is explicitly stated to be a bilingual pun in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;: Tolkien gives the two meanings as &quot;Mount Fang&quot; in Elvish (Sindarin), and &quot;Cunning Mind&quot; in the &quot;language of the Mark of Old&quot;, Rohirric. However, &quot;Orthanc&quot; genuinely means &quot;Cunning Mind&quot; in the language Tolkien had used to represent Rohirric, Old English: he had pretended that he had translated Rohirric into Old English, and the related Westron into modern English. The unlikely coincidence of homonyms and synonyms makes Tolkien&#x27;s claim about Rohirric look like a mistake.

=== Illustrations ===

Tolkien made detailed sketches of Isengard and Orthanc, published in &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator&quot;, as he developed his conception of them.

== Interpretations ==

=== Industrial hell ===

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar describes Isengard as an &quot;industrial hell&quot;. He quotes Tolkien&#x27;s description of Isengard, supplying his own emphasis on Tolkien&#x27;s words: &quot;tunneled .. circle .. dark .. deep .. graveyard of unquiet dead .. the ground trembled .. treasuries .. furnaces .. iron wheels .. endlessly .. lit from beneath .. venomous&quot;. Huttar comments: &quot;The imagery is familiar, its connotations plain. This is yet another hell [after Moria and Mordor]&quot;. All the same, he writes, the tower of Orthanc cannot but be admired, with its &quot;marvellous shape&quot; and wonderful, ancient strength; he supposes that for Tolkien, technology could neither be &quot;wholeheartedly embraced nor utterly rejected&quot;.

Shippey, discussing Saruman&#x27;s character, notes several facts about him: Treebeard&#x27;s comment that &quot;He has a mind of metal and wheels&quot;; that Isengard means &quot;Irontown&quot;; that the Ents are attacked in Isengard with &quot;a kind of napalm [or] perhaps ... [given] Tolkien&#x27;s own experience, a Flammenwerfer&quot;. Shippey concludes that Saruman had been led into &quot;wanton pollution ... by something corrupting in the love of machines&quot;, which he connects to &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s own childhood image of industrial ugliness ... Sarehole Mill, with its literally bone-grinding owner&quot;.

David D. Oberhelman, writing in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, states, following Anne C. Petty, that there are multiple &quot;industrial &#x27;hells&#x27; in Tolkien&#x27;s work, such as Saruman&#x27;s blighted, machine-ridden Isengard&quot;. He notes that its prototype was the fallen Vala Morgoth&#x27;s subterranean fortress, Angband, whose name meant &quot;Iron Prison&quot; or &quot;Hell of Iron&quot;.

=== Vichy status ===

Isengard is the promised reward for the nameless &quot;Mouth of Sauron&quot;, as soon as Gondor and its allies had surrendered. In his words in front of the Black Gate:

Shippey compares Sauron&#x27;s offer to the Vichy treaty imposed on France after its surrender in 1940: &quot;sovereignty over the disputed territory of Ithilien [East of the Anduin], the Alsace-Lorraine of Middle-earth, is to be transferred&quot;, and in the lands to the West &quot;a demilitarized zone, with what one can only call Vichy status, which will pay war-reparations, and be governed [from Isengard] by what one can again only call a Quisling&quot;.&#x27;

=== Homogeneity of evil ===

During the War of the Ring, Isengard was controlled by Saruman until the fortress&#x27;s destruction, but Saruman had become &quot;more like Sauron than he realizes&quot;, like him believing in &quot;supremacy through absolute power&quot;, and unintentionally a pupil of Sauron, having against Elrond&#x27;s advice &quot;stud[ied] too deeply the arts of the enemy&quot;. The Tolkien scholars Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull note that the palantír in Orthanc had formed what Gandalf called &quot;some link between Isengard and Mordor, which I have not yet fathomed&quot;: the link was that Sauron had used the stone to take control of Saruman, and through him his forces of Orcs. In &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Tolkien himself described Saruman&#x27;s Isengard as &quot;only a little copy, a child&#x27;s model or a slave&#x27;s flattery ... [of Sauron&#x27;s] vast fortress, armoury, prison, furnace of great power, Barad-dûr&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Brian Rosebury writes that Tolkien was making the point that whereas good government in free societies like those of Gondor, the Dwarves, the Elves, the Drúedain, and the Shire leads to diversity, &quot;evil tends to homogeneity&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s films of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Isengard and Orthanc were based on Alan Lee&#x27;s illustrations and modelled under the direction of Richard Taylor; Lee worked as the project&#x27;s conceptual artist in New Zealand throughout the making of the film trilogy. The very large miniature or &quot;bigature&quot; of Orthanc was cast and then carved from micro-crystalline wax by Wētā Workshop to resemble obsidian, black volcanic glass; it was made at 1/35 scale, standing some high. The model of the walled circular area of Isengard was more than wide. In post-production, the long shots of the Orthanc model were combined, using chroma keying, with panoramic views of the Mount Earnslaw / Pikirakatahi region and Mount Aspiring National Park near Queenstown and Glenorchy, New Zealand.

<text>The lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) is a goose closely related to the larger greater white-fronted goose (&quot;A. albifrons&quot;). It breeds in the northernmost Palearctic, but it is a scarce breeder in Europe, with a reintroduction attempt in Fennoscandia.

== Taxonomy ==
The lesser white-fronted goose was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas erythropus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as northern Europe but this was restricted to northern Sweden in 1913. The lesser white-fronted goose is now one of 11 species placed in the genus &quot;Anser&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The specific epithet comes from &quot;anser&quot;, the Latin for &quot;goose&quot;, and &quot;erythropus&quot;, &quot;red-footed&quot;, derived from the old Greek &quot;eruthros&quot; &quot;red&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; &quot;foot&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The lesser white-fronted goose is closely related to the greater white-fronted goose (&quot;Anser albifrons&quot;).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The lesser white-fronted goose winters further south in Europe and is a rare winter vagrant to Great Britain and India. Individual birds formerly appeared regularly at WWT Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, England, where they inspired Sir Peter Scott to set up The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust—modern records, however, are far less frequent, a consequence of the species&#x27; decline on its European breeding grounds. An attractive species, it is also widely kept in wildfowl collections and, as a result, escapes do occur; individuals seen in summer, or in the company of other feral geese, are likely to be of captive origin.

== Description ==
The two white-fronted goose species differ little other than in size (the lesser, at length and with a wingspan, is not much bigger than a mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;)), but both may be readily distinguished from the greylag goose by their bright orange legs and their mouse-coloured upper wing-coverts. The greylag goose has a flesh-coloured bill and legs and the upper wing-coverts are bluish-grey.

Both white-fronted goose species have a very conspicuous white face and broad black bars which cross the belly.

Adult lesser white-fronted geese, as well as being smaller than greater white-fronted geese, have an obvious yellow eye-ring and the white facial blaze goes up to the crown.

== Conservation ==
The lesser white-fronted goose is considered an endangered species, but there are programmes to reintroduce animals into the wild to strengthen the population. Additionally it is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

=== Fennoscandian population ===
This genetically distinct population is now estimated at 20 breeding pairs or 60–80 total individuals at most. They breed in northern Norway and overwinter in Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. There is a major stop-over site at Hortobágy National Park, Hungary, where the birds spend up to two months during autumn and one month during the spring migration.

Another part of the Fennoscandian population breeds in northern Sweden. The population size in 2015 is estimated to about 15 breeding pairs or 40–50 individuals in all. These birds follow a western migration route and spend the winter in Netherlands and Germany. According to the IUCN Red List in 2015, the conservation status of this population is Critically Endangered.

<text>The bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) is a goose that breeds in Central Asia in colonies of thousands near mountain lakes and winters in South Asia, as far south as peninsular India. It lays three to eight eggs at a time in a ground nest. It is known for the extreme altitudes it reaches when migrating across the Himalayas.

==Taxonomy==
The grey goose genus &quot;Anser&quot; has no other member indigenous to the Indian region, nor any at all to the Ethiopian, Australian, or Neotropical regions. Ludwig Reichenbach placed the bar-headed goose in the monotypic genus &quot;Eulabeia&quot; in 1852, though John Boyd&#x27;s taxonomy treats both &quot;Eulabeia&quot; and the genus &quot;Chen&quot; as subgenera of &quot;Anser&quot;.

==Description==
The bird is pale grey and is easily distinguished from any of the other grey geese of the genus &quot;Anser&quot; by the black bars on its head. It is also much paler than the other geese in this genus. In flight, its call is a typical goose honking. A mid-sized goose, it measures in total length and weighs .

==Ecology==
The summer habitat is high-altitude lakes where the bird grazes on short grass. The species has been reported as migrating south from Tibet, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia before crossing the Himalayas. The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. It suffers predation from crows, foxes, ravens, sea eagles, gulls and others. The total population may, however, be increasing, but it is complex to assess population trends, as this species occurs over more than .

The bar-headed goose is one of the world&#x27;s highest-flying birds, having been heard flying across Mount Makalu – the fifth highest mountain on earth at  – and apparently seen over Mount Everest –  – although this is a second-hand report with no verification. This demanding migration has long puzzled physiologists and naturalists: &quot;there must be a good explanation for why the birds fly to the extreme altitudes... particularly since there are passes through the Himalaya at lower altitudes, and which are used by other migrating bird species.&quot; In fact, bar-headed geese had for a long time not been directly tracked (using GPS or satellite logging technology) flying higher than , and it is now believed that they do take the high passes through the mountains. The challenging northward migration from lowland India to breed in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of climbing flight ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end, according to research published in 2011.The 2011 study found the geese peaking at an altitude of around 6,400 m (21,000 ft). In a 2012 study that tagged 91 geese and tracked their migration routes, it was determined that the geese spent 95% of their time below , choosing to take a longer route through the Himalayas in order to utilize lower-altitude valleys and passes. Only 10 of the tagged geese were ever recorded above this altitude, and only one exceeded , reaching . All but one of these high-altitude flights were recorded at night, which along with the early morning, is the most common time of day for geese migration. The colder denser air during these times may be equivalent to an altitude hundreds of meters lower. It is suspected by the authors of these two studies that tales of the geese flying at are apocryphal. Bar headed geese have been observed flying at .

The bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas to spend the winter in parts of South Asia (from Assam to as far south as Tamil Nadu. The modern winter habitat of the species is cultivated fields, where it feeds on barley, rice and wheat, and may damage crops. Birds from Kyrgyzstan have been seen to stopover in western Tibet and southern Tajikistan for 20 to 30 days before migrating farther south. Some birds may show high wintering site fidelity.
They nest mainly on the Tibetan Plateau. Intraspecific brood parasitism is noticed with lower rank females attempting to lay their eggs in the nests of higher ranking females.

The bar-headed goose is often kept in captivity, as it is considered beautiful and breeds readily. Recorded sightings in Great Britain are frequent, and almost certainly relate to escapes. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years, and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel. It is possible that, owing to a combination of frequent migration, accidental escapes and deliberate introduction, the species is becoming gradually more established in Great Britain.

The bar-headed goose has escaped or been deliberately released in Florida, U.S., but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and it may only persist due to continuing escapes or releases.

==Physiology and morphology==

The main physiological challenge of bar-headed geese is extracting oxygen from hypoxic air and transporting it to aerobic muscle fibres in order to sustain flight at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. Studies have found that bar-headed geese breathe more deeply and efficiently under low-oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment. The haemoglobin of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen than that of low-altitude geese, which has been attributed to a single amino acid point mutation. This mutation causes a conformational shift in the haemoglobin molecule from the low-oxygen to the high-oxygen affinity form. The left-ventricle of the heart, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body via systemic circulation, has significantly more capillaries in bar-headed geese than in lowland birds, maintaining oxygenation of cardiac muscle cells and thereby cardiac output. Compared to lowland birds, mitochondria (the main site of oxygen consumption) in the flight muscle of bar-headed geese are significantly closer to the sarcolemma, decreasing the intracellular diffusion distance of oxygen from the capillaries to the mitochondria.

Bar-headed geese have a slightly larger wing area for their weight than other geese, which is believed to help them fly at high altitudes. While this decreases the power output required for flight in thin air, birds at high altitude still need to flap harder than lowland birds.

==Cultural depiction==

The bar-headed goose has been suggested as being the model for the Hamsa of Indian mythology. Another interpretation suggests that the bar-headed goose is likely to be the &quot;Kadamb&quot; in ancient and medieval Sanskrit literature, whereas &quot;Hamsa&quot; generally refers to the swan.

<text>Herbert Randolph Sugar (June 7, 1936 – March 25, 2012) was an American boxing writer and sports historian known for his trademark fedora and unlit cigar.

==Early life and education==
Sugar was born in Washington, D.C., on June 7, 1936. In 1953, he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, where he was a reporter and columnist for the school&#x27;s newspaper. His entry in the high school yearbook for that year predicted he &quot;will become a radio announcer or sports writer&quot;. Sugar graduated from the University of Maryland before earning a JD and MBA from the University of Michigan in 1960.

==Career==
After passing the bar, Sugar worked in advertising, including with the McCann Erickson agency. He was Publisher-Editor of Baseball Monthly magazine in 1962. Sugar bought &quot;Boxing Illustrated&quot; magazine in 1969 and was editor until 1973. From 1979 to 1983 he was editor and publisher of &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. In 1988 he again became editor of &quot;Boxing Illustrated&quot;. In 1998 he founded &quot;Bert Sugar&#x27;s Fight Game&quot;.

Sugar wrote more than 80 books, focusing on his favorite sports of boxing and baseball. Among his boxing books are &quot;Great Fights&quot;, &quot;Bert Sugar on Boxing&quot;, &quot;100 Years of Boxing&quot;, &quot;Sting like a Bee&quot; (with José Torres), &quot;The Ageless Warrior&quot; (Preface, with Mike Fitzgerald) and &quot;Boxing&#x27;s Greatest Fighters&quot;. Sugar was ranked as &quot;The Greatest Boxing Writer of the 20th Century&quot; by the International Veterans Boxing Association.

In May 2009 Sugar published &quot;Bert Sugar&#x27;s Baseball Hall of Fame: A Living History of America&#x27;s Greatest Game&quot; through Running Press.

With James Randi, Sugar co-wrote a book about Harry Houdini titled &quot;Houdini, His Life and Art&quot;.

Along with Lou Albano, he helped write &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to Pro Wrestling&quot;. He wrote a regular sports column for &quot;Smoke Magazine&quot;, a quarterly cigar lifestyle magazine. Sugar was described by sportscaster Bob Costas as being &quot;Runyonesque&quot; (in reference to Damon Runyon).

==Representation in other media==
Sugar appeared in several films playing himself, including &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1992), &quot;The Great White Hype,&quot; and &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;. Interviews with Sugar feature in the documentary &quot;Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson&quot;.

==Death==
Sugar died as a result of lung cancer on March 25, 2012, at age 75, with his family at his bedside at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York.

<doc id="199013" wikidata="Q27074540" url="?curid=199013" title="Snow goose">
<text>The snow goose (Anser caerulescens) is a species of goose native to North America. Both white and dark morphs exist, the latter often known as blue goose. Its name derives from the typically white plumage. The species was previously placed in the genus &quot;Chen&quot;, but is now typically included in the &quot;gray goose&quot; genus &quot;Anser&quot;.

Snow geese breed north of the timberline in Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and the northeastern tip of Siberia, and spend winters in warm parts of North America from southwestern British Columbia through parts of the United States to Mexico. 

==Taxonomy==
In 1750 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the snow goose in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The blue-winged goose&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of Canada by James Isham. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the snow goose with the ducks and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Anas caerulescens&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The snow goose is now placed in the genus &quot;Anser&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The scientific name is from the Latin &quot;anser&quot;, &quot;goose&quot;, and &quot;caerulescens&quot;, &quot;bluish&quot;, derived from &quot;caeruleus&quot;, &quot;dark blue&quot;. The snow goose is the sister species to Ross&#x27;s goose (&quot;Anser rossii&quot;).

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. c. caerulescens&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – lesser snow goose – breeds in northeast Siberia, north Alaska and northwest Canada, winters in south USA, north Mexico and Japan
* &quot;A. c. atlanticus&quot; (Kennard, 1927) – greater snow goose – breeds in northeast Canada and northwest Greenland, winters in northeast USA

The greater snow goose is distinguished from the nominate form by being slightly larger. It nests farther north and east. The lesser snow goose can be found in two color phases, the normal white-colored animals and a dark gray-colored &quot;blue&quot; phase. The greater snow goose is rarely seen in a blue phase.

==Description==

The snow goose has two color plumage morphs, white (snow) or gray/blue (blue), thus the common description as &quot;snows&quot; and &quot;blues&quot;. White-morph birds are white except for black wing tips, but blue-morph geese have bluish-gray plumage replacing the white except on the head, neck and tail tip. The immature blue phase is drab or slate-gray with little to no white on the head, neck, or belly. Both snow and blue phases have rose-red feet and legs, and pink bills with black tomia (&quot;cutting edges&quot;), giving them a black &quot;grin patch&quot;. The colors are not as bright on the feet, legs, and bill of immature birds. The head can be stained rusty-brown from minerals in the soil where they feed. They are very vocal and can often be heard from more than a mile away.

White- and blue-morph birds interbreed and the offspring may be of either morph. These two colors of geese were once thought to be separate species; since they interbreed and are found together throughout their ranges, they are now considered two color phases of the same species. The color phases are genetically controlled. The dark phase results from a single dominant gene and the white phase is homozygous recessive. When choosing a mate, young birds will most often select a mate that resembles their parents&#x27; coloring. If the birds were hatched into a mixed pair, they will mate with either color phase.
The species is divided into two subspecies on the basis of size and geography. Size overlap has caused some to question the division. The smaller subspecies, the lesser snow goose (&quot;C. c. caerulescens&quot;), lives from central northern Canada to the Bering Straits area. The lesser snow goose stands tall and weighs . The larger subspecies, the greater snow goose (&quot;C. c. atlanticus&quot;), nests in northeastern Canada. It averages about and , but can weigh up to . The wingspan for both subspecies ranges from .

==Breeding==
Long-term pair bonds are usually formed in the second year, although breeding does not usually start until the third year. Females are strongly philopatric, meaning they will return to the place they hatched to breed.

Snow geese often nest in colonies. Nesting usually begins at the end of May or during the first few days of June, depending on snow conditions. The female selects a nest site and builds the nest on an area of high ground. The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and may be reused from year to year. After the female lays the first of three to five eggs, she lines the nest with down. The female incubates for 22 to 25 days, and the young leave the nest within a few hours of hatching.

The young feed themselves, but are protected by both parents. After 42 to 50 days they can fly, but they remain with their family until they are two to three years old.

Where snow geese and Ross&#x27;s geese breed together, as at La Pérouse, they hybridize at times, and hybrids are fertile. Rare hybrids with the greater white-fronted goose, Canada goose, and cackling goose have been observed.

==Migration==
Snow geese breed from late May to mid-August, but they leave their nesting areas and spend more than half the year on their migration to-and-from warmer wintering areas. During spring migration (the reverse migration), large flocks of snow geese fly very high and migrate in large numbers along narrow corridors, more than from traditional wintering areas to the tundra.

The lesser snow goose travels through the Central Flyway, Mississippi Flyway, and Pacific Flyway across prairie and rich farmland to their wintering grounds on grassland and agricultural fields across the United States and Mexico, especially the Gulf coastal plain. The larger and less numerous greater snow goose travels through the Atlantic Flyway and winters on a relatively more restricted range on the Atlantic coastal plain. Traditionally, lesser snow geese wintered in coastal marsh areas where they used their short but strong bills to dig up the roots of marsh grasses for food. However, they have also since shifted inland towards agricultural areas, likely the cause behind the unsustainable population increase in the 20th century. This shift may help to contribute to increased goose survival rates, leading to overgrazing on tundra breeding grounds.

In March 2015, 2,000 snow geese were killed in northern Idaho from an avian cholera epidemic while flying their spring migration to northern Canada.

==Vagrancy==
The snow goose is a rare vagrant to Europe, but escapes from collections have occurred, and it is an occasional feral breeder. Snow geese are visitors to the British Isles where they are seen regularly among flocks of brant, barnacle goose, and greater white-fronted goose. There is also a feral population in Scotland from which many vagrant birds in Britain seem to derive.

Around 2015, a small group of 3–5 snow geese landed on the north shore of O&#x27;ahu. They were seen and photographed several times over the course of 3–4 months. 

In Central America, vagrants are frequently encountered during winter.

==Ecology==
Outside of the nesting season, they usually feed in flocks. In winter, snow geese feed on left-over grain in fields. They migrate in large flocks, often visiting traditional stopover habitats in spectacular numbers. Snow geese frequently travel and feed alongside greater white-fronted geese; in contrast, the two tend to avoid travelling and feeding alongside Canada geese, which are often heavier birds.

The population of greater snow geese was in decline at the beginning of the 20th century, but has now recovered to sustainable levels. Snow geese in North America have increased to the point where the tundra breeding areas in the Arctic and the saltmarsh wintering grounds are both becoming severely degraded, and this affects other species using the same habitat.

Major nest predators include Arctic foxes and skuas. The biggest threat occurs during the first couple of weeks after the eggs are laid and then after hatching. The eggs and young chicks are vulnerable to these predators, but adults are generally safe. They have been seen nesting near snowy owl nests, which is likely a solution to predation. Their nesting success was much lower when snowy owls were absent, leading scientists to believe that the owls, since they are predatory, were capable of keeping competing predators away from the nests. A similar association as with the owls has been noted between geese and rough-legged hawks. Additional predators at the nest have reportedly included wolves, coyotes and all three North American bear species. Few predators regularly prey on snow geese outside of the nesting season, but bald eagles (as well as possibly golden eagles) will readily attack wintering geese.

==Population==
The breeding population of the lesser snow goose exceeds 5 million birds, an increase of more than 300% since the mid-1970s. The population is increasing at a rate of more than five percent per year. Non-breeding geese (juveniles or adults that fail to nest successfully) are not included in this estimate, so the total number of geese is likely higher. Lesser snow goose population indices are the highest they have been since population records have been kept, and evidence suggests that large breeding populations are spreading to previously untouched sections of the Hudson Bay coastline. The cause of this overpopulation may be the heavy conversion of land from forest and prairie to agricultural usage in the 20th century.

Since the late 1990s, efforts have been underway in the U.S. and Canada to reduce the North American population of lesser snow and Ross&#x27;s geese to sustainable levels due to the documented destruction of tundra habitat in Hudson Bay and other nesting areas. The Light Goose Conservation Order was established in 1997 and federally mandated in 1999. Increasing hunter bag limits, extending the length of hunting seasons, and adding new hunting methods have all been successfully implemented, but have not reduced the overall population of snow geese in North America.

==Conservation order for light geese==

The late 1990s was when the mid-continent population of snow geese was recognized as causing significant damage to the arctic and sub-arctic breeding grounds which was also causing critical damage to other varieties of waterfowl species and other wildlife that uses the arctic and sub-arctic grounds for home habitat. The increase in population in substantial amounts raised concern to then DU chief biologist Dr. Bruce Batt who was part of a committee that put together various data and submitted it to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife Service with the recommendation on ways to combat the growing population and the damage that the snow geese were creating in the arctic breeding grounds.

The committee recommended relaxing hunting restrictions and giving hunters a better opportunity to harvest more snow geese on their way back to the breeding grounds in the spring. The suggested restrictions were to allow the use of electronic callers, unplugged shotguns, extended shooting hours, and no bag limits. Two years after the Light Goose Conservation Order was introduced it was federally mandated in 1999.

<text>Infix notation is the notation commonly used in arithmetical and logical formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of operators between operands—&quot;infixed operators&quot;—such as the plus sign in .

==Usage==
Binary relations are often denoted by an infix symbol such as set membership &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot; when the set &quot;A&quot; has &quot;a&quot; for an element. In geometry, perpendicular lines &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are denoted formula_1 and in projective geometry two points &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are in perspective when formula_2 while they are connected by a projectivity when formula_3

Infix notation is more difficult to parse by computers than prefix notation (e.g. + 2 2) or postfix notation (e.g. 2 2 +). However many programming languages use it due to its familiarity. It is more used in arithmetic, e.g. 5 × 6.

==Further notations==
Infix notation may also be distinguished from function notation, where the name of a function suggests a particular operation, and its arguments are the operands. An example of such a function notation would be in which the function denotes addition (&quot;sum&quot;): .

==Order of operations==
In infix notation, unlike in prefix or postfix notations, parentheses surrounding groups of operands and operators are necessary to indicate the intended order in which operations are to be performed. In the absence of parentheses, certain precedence rules determine the order of operations.

<text>USS &quot;Reuben James&quot; (FFG-57), an &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class guided missile frigate, was the third ship of the U.S. Navy named for Reuben James, a boatswain&#x27;s mate who distinguished himself fighting the Barbary pirates. Her crew totaled 201 enlisted, 18 chief petty officers, and 26 officers.

==Ship history ==

===1980s ===
The contract to build &quot;Reuben James&quot; was awarded on 22 March 1982 to Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California. Her keel was laid on 19 November 1983, and she was launched on 8 February 1985; sponsored by Lois Haight Herrington, wife of Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) John S. Herrington. She was delivered to the Navy on 3 March 1986, and commissioned on 22 March. She was faster than 30 knots (34.5 mph; 55.5 km/h) and powered by two gas turbine engines. Armed with anti-air and anti-ship missiles, an automated three-inch (76 mm) gun, an anti-missile defense system, and two SH-60 Seahawk anti-submarine helicopters, &quot;Reuben James&quot; was tasked with hunting submarines as well as with battle group escort and maritime interception. &quot;Reuben James&quot; joined the Red Stallions of Destroyer Squadron Thirty-One in June 1987.

Assigned to Mideast Force on her maiden deployment, &quot;Reuben James&quot; participated in twenty-two Operation Earnest Will convoy missions, serving as the convoy commander&#x27;s flagship on ten of those missions.

===1990s ===
On 10 September 1990, &quot;Reuben James&quot; visited Vladivostok in the Soviet Union.

In August 1991, &quot;Reuben James&quot; moved from Long Beach, California, to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 1  October 1998, she joined the &quot;Ke Koa O Ke Kai&quot;, Destroyer Squadron Thirty-One.

In 1994 &quot;Reuben James&quot; collided with while fueling underway (UNREP). The flight deck sustained damage in addition to hangar fire and external hangar wall damage. HSL-37 detachment was on board.

During a WestPac deployment on 21 February 1996, the ship&#x27;s rudder fell off in the Indian Ocean. The ship used its Auxiliary Power Units (APU) to try to stay on station until rendezvoused with the USNS Catawba (T-ATF-168) on 23 February.
USNS Catawba towed Reuben James to Bahrain for repairs. Since a dry dock wasn&#x27;t available, divers installed a new rudder while the ship was at the pier.

En route to WestPac deployment in 1997, the air detachment&#x27;s SH-60B Seahawk helicopter was conducting deck landing practice. The Seahawk had landed and was not secured to the deck because it was preparing to lift off again. The ship was hit by a rogue wave which caused the ship to roll steeply to port and the blades of the helicopter struck the flight deck causing the helicopter to roll on its port side and spin 90 degrees with the tail hanging over the port side of the flight deck. The ship docked in Guam where the helicopter was craned off to be repaired. No fault was found with the flight crew or the ship&#x27;s personnel for the mishap.

===2000s ===
&quot;Reuben James&quot; participated in the CARAT 2000 exercises, including phases in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. The first phase of CARAT began in the Philippines on 14 June and the final phase, conducted in Singapore, ended on 22 September. CARAT 2000 demonstrated U.S. commitment to security and stability in Southeast Asia while increasing the operational readiness and capabilities of U.S. forces. The exercise also promoted interoperability and cooperation with U.S. regional friends and allies by offering a broad spectrum of mutually beneficial training opportunities.

In Malaysia, CARAT 2000 encompassed two weeks of extensive training to promote interoperability between U.S. naval forces and the Royal Malaysian Navy and Army. The Strait of Malacca was the setting for several exercises. These included anti-submarine warfare, anti-air warfare, and gunnery exercises. One of the exercises was a semi-final battle problem, or night encounter exercise. The two navies&#x27; task groups steamed together in formation for more than 25 hours. The Malaysian-U.S. naval task group was divided into two opposing forces. The Blue Forces consisted of &quot;Reuben James&quot;, , , and the Malaysian ships and . The Blue Forces were supported by U.S. helicopters from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron (Light) HSL-37, Detachment Four, from Hawaii. The Orange Forces consisted of the frigate , the Malaysian ships KD &quot;Perkasa&quot;, KD &quot;Laksamana Tun Abdul Jamil&quot;, and a U.S. Navy P-3C Orion aircraft. , homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and , homeported in San Diego, also joined the task group in individual phases.

For nine months from 2 August 2002, to 27 April 2003, &quot;Reuben James&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf and participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom as part of Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three, the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Battle Group. After serving approximately six months in theater, &quot;Reuben James&quot; started to make its way back to Pearl Harbor. On New Year&#x27;s Day 2003, while in port in Brisbane, Australia, the ship was ordered to turn around and go back to the Persian Gulf and the deployment was extended indefinitely. Finally, after an extended deployment of almost nine months, the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Battle Group was relieved by . This deployment was extremely long, breaking a number of records, including the longest deployment ever for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

In July 2003, &quot;Reuben James&quot; hosted the Japanese Hatakaze-class destroyer for exercises in Pearl Harbor. On 23 October 2003 the crew of &quot;Reuben James&quot; dressed ship and manned the rails to render honors to President George W. Bush as he toured Pearl Harbor and visited the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial.

From February to April 2004, she deployed to the Eastern Pacific with an embarked Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment in support of counter-narcotics operations.

Between July and December 2004, &quot;Reuben James&quot; went through an extensive modernization and maintenance program. In October 2004, &quot;Reuben James&quot; participated in PASSEX exercises with the .

As part of Expeditionary Strike Group 3 (ESG 3), &quot;Reuben James&quot; deployed on 15 February 2006 on a WESTPAC mission to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The strike group also consisted of Amphibious Squadron (COMPHIBRON) 3, the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), , the guided-missile cruiser , the guided-missile destroyer , the amphibious transport dock , the dock landing ship , Tactical Air Control Squadron(TACRON) 11, and the &quot;Black Jacks&quot; of Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 21.

En route to the Persian Gulf, &quot;Reuben James&quot; stopped in New Caledonia. The strike group relieved on station in early April 2006 and began its mission of conducting maritime security operations. During operations, &quot;Reuben James&quot; performed services such as providing medical assistance to Sri Lankan fishermen and rescuing Kenyan sailors. Expeditionary Strike Group 3 was relieved on 9 July 2006 and &quot;Reuben James&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in August 2006.

&quot;Reuben James&quot; participated in a Passing Exercises (PASSEX) with the Philippine Navy frigate off the coast of Hawaii on 30 July 2011.

The frigate completed her final deployment on 3 May 2013. During the final cruise, the ship visited Japan, Brunei and the Philippines in support of theatre security operations and CARAT 2012. &quot;Reuben James&quot; was also awarded the USCG Meritorious Unit Citation for fisheries patrols in the economic exclusion zones of Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Nauru.

==Final disposition==
&quot;Reuben James&quot; was decommissioned on 18 July 2013, and sunk on 18 January 2016 in a test of a new anti-surface warfare variant of the Raytheon Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) at the U.S. Pacific Missile Range Facility near Hawaii.

==Cultural references ==

&quot;Reuben James&quot; played a significant role in Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. She appeared in the 1990 movie &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (although her appearance in the film was anachronistic, since she was commissioned about a year after the events in the film). In some scenes, &quot;Reuben James&quot; was portrayed in the film by other &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; frigates — &quot;Wadsworth&quot; (now ORP &quot;Generał Tadeusz Kościuszko&quot;) and (the hull number can be seen as Soviet submariners are in their rafts) The ship was later featured prominently in the 2010 novel by Don Brown entitled &quot;Malacca Conspiracy&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Reuben James&quot; (DE-153) was a in the United States Navy. She was the second ship named for Reuben James, a Boatswain&#x27;s Mate who distinguished himself fighting the Barbary pirates.

&quot;Reuben James&quot; was laid down on 7 September 1942 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, launched on 6 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Oliver Hiram Ward, and commissioned on 1 April 1943.

==Service history==
First based in Miami, Florida, she conducted anti-submarine patrols and provided training in convoy escort and anti-submarine warfare. In March 1944, she shifted homeport from Miami to Norfolk, Virginia. In June 1944, she escorted a convoy from New York to Norfolk. Between 13 July and 7 November 1944, &quot;Reuben James&quot; successfully escorted two convoys to the Mediterranean, returning with westbound convoys.

<text>USS &quot;Reuben James&quot; (DD-245) was a four-funnel that was constructed after World War I. She was the first United States Navy ship to be named after Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Reuben James ( 1776–1838), who had distinguished himself fighting in the First Barbary War, and was the first US Naval ship to be sunk by hostile action in the European Theater of World War II. Four US flagged merchant ships were also sunk by hostile action before Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Reuben James&quot; was laid down on 2 April 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, launched on 4 October 1919, and commissioned on 24 September 1920. The destroyer was sunk by a torpedo attack from German submarine near Iceland on 31 October 1941, resulting in the deaths of 100 crewmembers, before the United States had joined the war.

==Early service history==
Assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Reuben James&quot; served in the Mediterranean Sea from 1921 to 1922 after she had left from Newport, Rhode Island, on 30 November 1920, to Zelenika, Yugoslavia, and arrived on 18 December. During the spring and the summer of 1921, she sailed in the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean out of Zelenika and Gruž (Dubrovnik), Yugoslavia and assisted refugees and participated in postwar investigations and the allied occupation of the eastern Adriatic. In October 1921 at Le Havre, she joined the protected cruiser at ceremonies marking the return of the Unknown Soldier to the United States. At Danzig, from 29 October 1921 to 3 February 1922, she assisted the American Relief Administration in its efforts to relieve hunger and misery. After duty in the Mediterranean, she departed Gibraltar on 17 July.

Then based at New York City, she patrolled the coast of Nicaragua to prevent the delivery of weapons to revolutionaries in early 1926. During the spring of 1929, she participated in fleet maneuvers that helped develop naval airpower. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 20 January 1931. She was recommissioned on 9 March 1932, and started operating again in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea by patrolling Cuban waters during the coup by Fulgencio Batista. She transferred to San Diego in 1934. After maneuvers that evaluated aircraft carriers, she returned to the Atlantic Fleet in January 1939.

==World War II==
At the beginning of World War II in Europe in September 1939, the &quot;Reuben James&quot; was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol, which guarded the Atlantic and the Caribbean approaches to the American coast. In March 1941, she joined the force established to escort convoys sailing to Great Britain. The force escorted convoys as far as Iceland, after which the convoys became the responsibility of British escorts. The force was based at Hvalfjörður, Iceland, and commanded by Lieutenant Commander Heywood Lane Edwards, the commander of the USS &quot;Reuben James&quot;. On 23 October she sailed from Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, with four other destroyers, escorting eastbound Convoy HX 156. 

===Sinking===
At dawn on 31 October 1941, she was torpedoed near Iceland by German submarine commanded by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Erich Topp. &quot;Reuben James&quot; had positioned herself between an ammunition ship in the convoy and the known position of a German &quot;wolfpack,&quot; a group of submarines poised to attack the convoy. The destroyer was not flying the ensign of the United States and was in the process of dropping depth charges on another U-boat when she was engaged. &quot;Reuben James&quot; was hit forward by a torpedo meant for a merchant ship and her entire bow was blown off when a magazine exploded. The bow sank immediately. The aft section floated for five minutes before going down. Of a crew of seven officers and 136 enlisted men, plus one enlisted passenger, 100 were killed. Only 44 enlisted men and no officers survived.

<doc id="199018" wikidata="Q543778" url="?curid=199018" title="Miguel Cotto">
<text>Miguel Ángel Cotto Vázquez (born October 29, 1980) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2017. He is a multiple-time world champion, and the first Puerto Rican boxer to win world titles in four weight classes, from light welterweight to middleweight. In 2007 and 2009, he reached a peak active pound for pound ranking of seventh by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. Cotto started out his career as a hard-hitting pressure fighter, but evolved over the years into a more refined boxer-puncher as he moved up in weight.

As an amateur, Cotto represented Puerto Rico in the lightweight and light welterweight divisions at various international events, including the 1999 Pan American Games, the 2000 Olympics, and the 1998 Junior World Championships; the latter in which he won a lightweight silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated Kelson Pinto for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title to move up in weight. In his first welterweight fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated Carlos Quintana for the vacant WBA title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to Antonio Margarito in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it once before losing it to Manny Pacquiao in the same year.

In 2010, he moved up to light middleweight and won the WBA title from Yuri Foreman. Having been promoted by the WBA to Super champion status, Cotto won a 2011 rematch against Margarito. He lost the WBA (Super) title in 2012 to Floyd Mayweather Jr., in one of the most anticipated fights in modern boxing history. The year would end on a further sour note for Cotto, as he lost in an upset to Austin Trout. Two years later, Cotto defeated Sergio Martínez to win the unified WBC, &quot;Ring&quot;, and lineal middleweight titles. In doing so, he became the first four-weight world champion from Puerto Rico. In 2015, he defended his titles once before losing to Canelo Álvarez. After more than a year of inactivity, Cotto returned in 2017 to become the WBO light middleweight champion, but lost the title in his final fight to Sadam Ali. Miguel Cotto&#x27;s primary physician is Dr. Ernesto Garcia.

==Early life==
Cotto was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Puerto Rican parents, and relocated to Caguas, Puerto Rico, with his family before he turned two. There are several figures linked to boxing in his family, including his late father Miguel Cotto Sr., his brother José Miguel Cotto, his second cousin Abner Cotto, and his uncle and former boxing trainer Evangelista Cotto. Cotto began boxing as a child to help lose weight, not anticipating it to end up being his career path. He was taken to the Bairoa Gym in Caguas. There, he was able to develop into a top amateur fighter.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, the young Cotto participated in several international tournaments, these include: The 1998 Junior World Championships that took place in Buenos Aires, where he finished in second place while competing in the Lightweight division. His three victories here were by points, the results were: Andrey Kolevin of Ukraine by points 15–3, Dana Laframboise of Canada by points 6–1, and Darius Jasevicius representing Lithuania 9–5. His only loss was to Anton Solopov of Russia by points with a score of 8–9. In 1999, Cotto competed in the Pan American Games that took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He only fought once in a loss to Dana Laframboise of Canada by points with a final score of 2–5. Following his participation in the Pan American tournament, Cotto was part of the Boxing World Championships in Houston, Texas. He lost his only fight by points to Robertas Nomeikas. In his final amateur tournament, Cotto represented Puerto Rico as a Light Welterweight at 2000 Sydney Olympic Games where he lost to Mahamadkadir Abdullayev of Uzbekistan by points. Cotto decided to turn professional after the loss to Abdulaev, ending his amateur career with a record of 125–23.

== Professional career ==
=== Early career ===
Early in his career Cotto defeated former world title contender John Brown by decision in the tenth round. He led the score through the entire fight and scored a knockdown in the second round. The judges gave Cotto scores of 100–89, 100–89, and 100–88.

In 2001, Cotto suffered a dangerous injury that threatened his boxing career. As he was driving to the gymnasium at 5 a.m., he apparently fell asleep and crashed, breaking his arm and requiring hospitalization.

On September 13, 2003, Cotto defeated Demetrio Ceballos by knockout in the seventh round at Las Vegas. In a fight where Cotto injured Ceballos with numerous combinations in the sixth round, switching between the orthodox and southpaw stances. In the seventh round Cotto displayed an aggressive style that led to the referee stopping the fight with 0:32 remaining in the round. With this, he was ranked number one in his division by the World Boxing Association.

Cotto&#x27;s first fight of 2004, was a fourth-round knockout victory over the former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his luggage to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard who thought he was an unaccompanied minor.

On April 8, 2004, he defeated the former world title challenger, Lovemore N&#x27;dou, by unanimous decision in Las Vegas. The first three rounds of the fight had a slow pace with neither of the boxers establishing control of the fight. Cotto dominated the fourth and fifth rounds managing to land combinations on N&#x27;dou&#x27;s head. N&#x27;dou won the seventh and eighth rounds after landing more accurate hits than Cotto. The last three rounds were even with both fighters establishing short periods of control in the fight. The judges gave Cotto scores of 117–111, 116–112, and 115–113.

=== Light welterweight ===
====Cotto vs. Bailey====

On September 11, 2004, Cotto faced Brazilian Kelson Pinto, for the vacant World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title. This represented the third fight between them, with Pinto being victorious in their two previous encounters, both of which took place while they were still amateurs. The fight was televised by HBO from San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this card Cotto utilized a defensive stance with his hands in a high position instead of his usual aggressive orthodox stance. Over the course of the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns and won the World Boxing Organization Junior Welterweight Championship by knockout in the sixth round.

====Cotto vs. Bailey====

On December 11, 2004, he successfully defended his title, beating former world champion Randall Bailey by knockout in the sixth round, as part of the Vitali Klitschko-Danny Williams undercard in Las Vegas. Cotto&#x27;s performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in his face that opened cuts over and under both of his eyes. As a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn&#x27;t want to continue and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004, the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico&#x27;s fighter of the year for 2004.

====Cotto vs. Corley====

Cotto&#x27;s second title defense took place on February 26, 2005, in the Rubén Rodríguez in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, against Demarcus Corley. During the fight Cotto practiced a boxing style that was more aggressive than usual, trading hits with Corley over the course of the first round. During the fight both boxers were deducted one point following illegal low blows. Cotto scored three knockdowns before the fight was stopped by the referee at 2:45 of the fifth round following a combination by Miguel. Corley claimed that the referee stopped the fight prematurely stating that &quot;the ref just stopped the fight premature. If he wanted to stop the fight, he could have stopped it when I had [Cotto] hurt.&quot; Just a few days after retaining the crown versus Corley, Cotto received a personal blow, when his stablemate and friend, former 2004 Olympian Joseph Serrano, was shot in the head upon leaving the Bairoa gym. Serrano survived the shot, but was in critical but stable condition at a local hospital.

====Cotto vs. Abdulaev====
On June 11, 2005, Cotto faced the last man to beat him as an amateur, former Olympic gold medalist Mohamed Abdulaev from Uzbekistan. As amateurs, Abdulaev eliminated Cotto from the first round of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This time they met as professionals in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Before the beginning of the fight Cotto received a positive ovation from the public. During the first round Miguel went on the offensive scoring hits on Abdullaev&#x27;s head and body while he was in a defensive stance. In the fourth round a left hook by Miguel hurt Abdullaev, who proceeded to focus his hits on Cotto&#x27;s body. Abdullaev&#x27;s offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev&#x27;s eye was swollen to the point of being almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight&#x27;s referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev&#x27;s eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.

====Cotto vs. Torres====

Cotto&#x27;s third championship defense took place on September 24, 2005, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo Torres of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto&#x27;s punches landed in Torres&#x27; beltline. Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.

On March 4, 2006, Cotto defended his WBO Junior Welterweight title by knocking out Gianluca Branco, who had to give up during the eighth round of their bout due to a shoulder injury. Cotto dominated the fight as a result of jab combinations in a card that took place in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

==== Cotto vs. Malignaggi ====
Cotto&#x27;s next scheduled match was against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006, in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi&#x27;s right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance over the course of the fight, by stating &quot;this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto&#x27;s a great fighter, but I&#x27;m disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion&quot;. Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116–111, 116–111, and 115–112.

=== Welterweight ===
==== Cotto vs. Quintana ====
Cotto relinquished his title in late 2006 and announced his intention to move to the welterweight division to challenge Carlos Quintana for the WBA&#x27;s championship. The fight took place on December 2, 2006. Cotto defeated Quintana by technical knockout in the fifth round. Following a punch to the body, Quintana surrendered prior to the start of the sixth round and Cotto won the vacant World Boxing Association Welterweight Championship. Cotto&#x27;s Welterweight reign began successfully on March 3, 2007, when he retained his belt with a technical knock out victory in the eleventh round over Oktay Urkal. Urkal&#x27;s corner threw in the towel because he was apparently down in the fight, and had just had a second point deducted for a head butt, leading to his corner&#x27;s belief that the referee was unfair.

====Cotto vs. Judah====

On June 9, 2007, Cotto defended the WBA Welterweight Title against Zab Judah in New York City, performing before a sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden.

At the moment of the stoppage, the judges had Cotto leading 97–91. Cotto won by technical knockout in the eleventh round when the referee stopped the fight.

==== Cotto vs. Mosley ====
Miguel Cotto and Shane Mosley fought on November 10, 2007, at Madison Square Garden in a card made possible by a legal settlement between Top Rank Boxing, Cotto&#x27;s promoter, and Mosley&#x27;s promoter, Golden Boy Promotions. The fight was broadcast on HBO Pay-Per-View and was won by Cotto via unanimous decision. During the course of the fight Cotto pursued Mosley who was reacting in a slow fashion. Late in the fight Mosley displayed more aggression at one point becoming the aggressor. Cotto&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;a rare moment in sports when a sudden star rises from what is categorically termed as goodness, to the cusp of greatness.&quot; On April 12, 2008, Cotto successfully defended the championship against Alfonso Gómez. Throughout the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns before the fight was stopped following the fifth round, when the doctor indicated to the referee that Gómez couldn&#x27;t continue. Cotto was selected the World Boxing Association&#x27;s &quot;Boxer of the Year&quot;, during the organization&#x27;s annual award celebration, which took place in Buenos Aires.

==== Cotto vs. Margarito ====

On July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Cotto suffered his first loss as a professional to Antonio Margarito in an unsuccessful title defense. Cotto had taken the early initiative, frequently landing a series of punches on Margarito during the early rounds while using his footwork to avoid danger. However, Margarito presented constant offensive pressure of Cotto and eventually began to wear down Cotto&#x27;s resistance by trapping him against the ropes. Cotto was hurt in the seventh round after a pair of Margarito uppercuts caused his nose to bleed. Margarito continued to chase his opponent down and inflicted further damage towards the end of the tenth round. Margarito then threw a series of punches at the start of the eleventh round, with Cotto against the ropes and bleeding profusely. A combination from Margarito finally forced Cotto to his knee. He got up, but Margarito continued landing combinations. Evangelista Cotto threw in the towel after Cotto again fell to the canvas in the corner of the ring. Two judges had Margarito ahead by a score of 96–94 at the time of the stoppage, while the third judge had the fight even. HBO analyst Harold Lederman had also scored the fight even. Cotto&#x27;s loss to Margarito has since come under suspicion due to Margarito&#x27;s subsequent attempted use of illegal hand-wraps in a fight against Shane Mosley.

==== Cotto vs. Jennings ====
Cotto returned to action on February 21, 2009, in a card held at the Madison Square Garden, sporting the first of his trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent&#x27;s style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more fluidly, connecting with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team&#x27;s staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team&#x27;s nutritionist as his new trainer.

==== Cotto vs. Clottey ====
At an official press conference on April 14, 2009, in New York, it was announced that Cotto would be defending his title against Ghanaian boxer Joshua Clottey, in a fight that was originally intended to be an unification that also included the International Boxing Federation&#x27;s title on June 13, 2009.

In the third round an accidental head clash opened a severe laceration over Cotto&#x27;s left eye. The injury bled profusely during the fourth round, but he was able to control the pace. In the fifth round, Clottey was pushed to the floor during an exchange and was injured in his left knee, receiving time to recover before the contest resumed. In the sixth, Cotto trapped Clottey in a corner and gained offensive advantage. During the next two rounds, Clottey controlled the offensive, noticing that Cotto was unable to see right punches. During the last rounds, Cotto decided to employ his technique from outside, while the fight&#x27;s tempo remained close. The judges decided the fight&#x27;s outcome by split decision, awarding scores of 115–112 and 116–111 for Cotto and 114–113 for Clottey. When the scorecards were read, Clottey shouted, &quot;Oh no! This can&#x27;t happen&quot;, then went over to Bob Arum and said, &quot;That&#x27;s it, I quit, I&#x27;m done with boxing. I can&#x27;t take it anymore.&quot; Arum said he thought it was &#x27;a magnificent fight and you have to continue.&#x27;

==== Cotto vs. Pacquiao ====

Immediately after the Clottey fight, negotiations began to pursue a contest against Manny Pacquiao (49–3–2, 38 KOs). Even before Pacquiao defeated Ricky Hatton, Bob Arum, who represents both Cotto and Pacquiao, stated that he was interested in this matchup. Subsequently, Pacquiao expressed interest in fighting Cotto. The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto&#x27;s camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao&#x27;s smaller physique. Cotto&#x27;s camp also conceded the larger share of the purse to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto&#x27;s 35% share.

On November 14, 2009, the fight took place in front of a sold-out crowd of 16,200 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Pacquiao defeated Cotto via TKO, 55 seconds into the 12th round, dethroning Cotto as a WBO welterweight champion.

The fight also generated a live gate of $8,847,550 from an official crowd of 15,930.

=== Light middleweight ===
==== Cotto vs. Foreman ====

After the Pacquiao fight, Cotto moved to the light middleweight division. On June 5, 2010, he fought against undefeated Israeli WBA light Middleweight Champion Yuri Foreman at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Bob Arum had said that if Cotto were to win, he would become a front runner to defend the WBA belt against Manny Pacquiao in November. Cotto stated that he would consider a return to the welterweight division, in case of an interesting fight. Cotto ended up knocking Foreman down with a signature left hook to the body in the ninth round, after Foreman tore his knee, Cotto, claiming the WBA light middleweight title, his fourth overall in three different weight divisions.

==== Cotto vs. Mayorga ====

On January 19, 2011, in a press conference at Times Square, New York, Bob Arum and Don King, working together for the first time in five years, officially announced that Cotto would defend his WBA light middleweight title against former two-division world champion Ricardo Mayorga at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 12, 2011, live on Showtime PPV. In front of 7,247 at the MGM, Cotto defeated Mayorga via TKO in the 12th round, retaining his WBA light middleweight title. Throughout the fight, Mayorga looked to engage, however the discipline on Cotto played a big part in the win, saving his big shots for the final round. A left hook landed, which dropped Mayorga and ended the bout. At the time of stoppage, Cotto was ahead by five points on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. With the win, Cotto&#x27;s record for world title fights improved to (17–2).

He was very heavy handed, I felt his punches the whole fight.&quot; He also mentioned how before the last round, his trainer Emanuel Steward told him he would be able to stop Mayorga in the last round, which was the conclusion of the fight.

==== Cotto vs. Margarito II ====

On July 30, 2011, it was announced that Cotto would make a second defence of his WBA title against rival Antonio Margarito (38–7, 27 KOs) in a rematch to their first fight, which took place in July 2008. The fight was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on December 3, 2011. The MGM Grand was also considered as a possible venue. At first, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) denied Margarito a boxing license on October 31, 2011. The reason for the denial was not due to the cheating allegations, but instead due to the damage to Margarito&#x27;s eye in the Manny Pacquiao fight. An appeal was filed and a hearing took place to where several leading eye doctors testified that Margarito should be allowed to fight. A final decision was expected on November 18, 2011. Without a license, Margarito could not fight in the state of New York. Arum initially stated that if Margarito was not licensed to fight, then Vanes Martirosyan would take his place on the card. However, Arum later stated that the fight would be moved to a venue in a state that Margarito holds a license. On November 18, 2011, the NYSAC did not make a final vote as expected. Instead, they ordered Margarito to be examined by their own doctor. Based on the findings of their own doctor, they would make a decision on whether Margarito received a license. The New York State Athletic Commission granted Antonio Margarito a license to box in New York after a hearing in Manhattan. A sold-out crowd of 21,239 was announced. Cotto avenged the defeat from 2008 stopping Margarito in the 10th round. The fight was stopped at the start of the 10th round because of the condition of Margarito&#x27;s right eye, which was swollen shut. This was the same eye that was badly damaged in his fight with Pacquiao and the one that almost kept the New York State Athletic Commission from granting him his boxing license because of the special procedure that was performed on it in 2010. At the time of stoppage, Cotto lead 89–82 on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. For the fight, Cotto earned a minimum $5 million, the figure would increase due to PPV shares and Margarito earned $2.5 million.

==== Cotto vs. Mayweather Jr. ====

On February 1, 2012, undefeated seven-time world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (41–0, 25 KO&#x27;s) announced that he would challenge Cotto for his WBA &#x27;Super&#x27; light middleweight title at the MGM Grand on May 5, 2012. Mayweather took to Twitter, &quot;I&#x27;m fighting Miguel Cotto on May 5th because Miss Pac Man is ducking me.&quot; He also claimed to have offered Pacquiao a guaranteed $40 million, with $20 million upfront. The last time Mayweather fought at 154 pounds was in 2007, in his win against Oscar De La Hoya. Mayweather came in at 151, while Cotto came in at 154 pounds. The fight started off with Cotto establishing himself as the fight&#x27;s aggressor, but with Mayweather winning the first two rounds using effective counter-punching and body movement to block most of Cotto&#x27;s punches. However, in the third round Cotto seemed to successfully swarm Mayweather and land decent flurries to steal himself the round. Then from rounds 4-9 the action was closely contested, with both fighters using their partially contrasting styles in attempts to one-up the other. Ultimately though, Mayweather managed to adjust to Cotto&#x27;s new rhythm of attacking in flurries and used his now-newly tweaked counter-punching style to win a lot of the final rounds, in what people thought had secured Mayweather the decision victory. Cotto had Mayweather against the ropes many times, resulting in some damage and a lot of bleeding from Mayweather&#x27;s nose. Cotto&#x27;s eyes had some partial swelling. Mayweather won via unanimous decision with scores of 117–111, 117–111, and 118–110. The crowd booed loudly when the scores were read out.

Cotto was humble in defeat, &quot;The judges said I lost the fight; I can&#x27;t do anything else. I&#x27;m happy with my fight and performance and so is my family. I can&#x27;t ask for anything else.&quot; When they hugged at the end, Mayweather told Cotto, &quot;You are a hell of a champion — the toughest guy I fought.&quot; Cotto landed 105 of 506 punches thrown (21%), while Mayweather landed 179 punches of 687 thrown (26%).

On August 31, 2012, terms were agreed for Austin Trout to defend his WBA light middleweight title against Cotto on December 1 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 13,096 attended the Garden. Trout started the fight off fast, using his quick combinations to continually get his punches off first against Cotto. Trout also used his superior footwork to evade most of Cotto&#x27;s punches, and was able to out muscle Cotto off the ropes when he was cornered in the fight. During the middle rounds, Cotto found success trapping Trout on the ropes and keeping him there, ripping Trout with body shots and finding the range with his left hook. Trout regained control in the later rounds, even backing Cotto up later in the fight, and stunned Cotto several times down the stretch with his straight left hand.

Cotto looked like the Cotto of old, by displaying an aggressive style early on in the fight and landing powerful body shots. One punch in his arsenal that was brought back to life, was the vicious left hook which he was known for in his days of dominance in the junior welterweight and welterweight divisions. The second round saw Cotto landing body shots at will and with less than 10 seconds left in the round he staggered Rodríguez with a sharp left hook. In the beginning of the third round, with Rodríguez still feeling the effects of the left hook at the end of round two, Cotto forced Rodríguez in to the ropes landed a left hook to the temple, followed by flurry of punches which knocked Rodríguez onto the canvas. The referee then stopped the fight and gave Cotto a third-round TKO victory.

Martinez was inactive for a year before the bout and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee. Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martinez was unable to bend, flex and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martinez himself proclaimed that his knee had nothing to do with the outcome of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot.

Highlights were shown on regular HBO a week later and averaged 970,000, peaking at 1.126 million. The fight generated $20 million from 350,000 buys on HBO PPV. This was considered a disappointment as HBO projected the fight would do around a 500,000 buyrate. Bob Arum, Cotto&#x27;s promoter stated the reason for a downfall in PPV buys was simply because there was too many of them. Martinez&#x27;s promoter Lou DiBella added that there was a lot events that same weekend, which would have impact on the boxing event. The promotion did however make a profit due to the $4.7 million live gate.

==== Cotto vs. Geale ====
In March 2015, Cotto signed with Jay Z&#x27;s Roc Nation Sports. In April they announced that Cotto would be making his first defence of his titles, after winning them nearly a year ago, against 34 year old former unified middleweight champion Daniel Geale (31–3, 16 KOs) on June 6, 2015, at the Barclays Center in New York.

On fight night, Geale stepped on the HBO scales and weighed 182 pounds. After three one-sided rounds, Cotto knocked Geale down twice in the fourth round to retain his world titles. After the second knockdown, referee Harvey Dock asked Geale if he wanted to continue, in which Geale replied &#x27;No&#x27;, prompting Dock to wave off the fight at 1:28 into round 4. Compubox stats showed, at the time of stoppage, Cotto had landed 68 of 183 punches thrown (37%) and Geale landed 33 of 127 (26%).Gennady Golovkin was in attendance.

==== Cotto vs. Alvarez ====

Cotto lost to Saul &quot;Canelo&quot; Álvarez on November 21, 2015, via unanimous decision. The fight was close throughout as both boxers were cautious in their attacks, neither fighter was seriously hurt. As Cotto attacked with a jab the whole fight, and didn&#x27;t sit down on his punches, instead deciding to employ movement. Álvarez responded with power punches, landing especially to the body. Both fighters showed iron chins, with Cotto repeatedly coming back after hard shots to the head. The scorecards at the end of the night were highly controversial as they did not show the competitiveness of the fight, with many boxing pundits having Álvarez winning by a round or two, others called it a draw.

==== WBC withdraws recognition ====
On November 17, 2015, in the week leading up to his fight with Alvarez, the WBC announced that they were withdrawing recognition of Cotto as their Middleweight World Champion. The WBC&#x27;s reasoning was &quot;After several weeks of communications, countless attempts and good faith time extensions trying to preserve the fight as a WBC World Championship, Miguel Cotto and his promotion did not agree to comply with the WBC Rules &amp; Regulations, while Canelo Alvarez has agreed to do so.&quot; This meant that, though Cotto was stripped of his title, Alvarez still had the opportunity to win the championship. Cotto then stated publicly that the reason the WBC stripped him of his title was because he refused to pay their sanctioning fees, which he believed to be excessive.

=== Return to light middleweight ===
There were negotiations from January 2016 for a fight between Cotto and former four-weight division champion Juan Manuel Márquez.

Kamegai gave a good effort but fell short every time he would connect with a punch, Cotto would counter with a combination of his own. Cotto spent the early rounds backed against the ropes on the back foot and still managed to do some damage landing hooks to the head of Kamegai. After round 10, Cotto started boxing on the outside and decided to settle for a decision win, he explained in the post-fight, &quot;I think I did my best and I&#x27;m happy with my performance.

According to a source, regardless of who Cotto fights, Lemieux would still appear on the card. Also in September, three-weight world champion Mikey Garcia took to social media and called out Cotto for a fight in December. On September 21, he reiterated his desire to move up to 154 to be Cotto&#x27;s final foe. Cotto&#x27;s trainer was also open for the fight to take place. On October 7, ESPN reported that terms were agreed for Cotto&#x27;s final fight against former Olympian and world welterweight title challenger Sadam Ali (25–1, 14 KOs) to take place on December 2 at Madison Square Garden. Information in regards to the contracted weight of the fight wasn&#x27;t discussed at this point. Cotto weighed 151.6 pounds, the lightest he had weighed eight years. Ali came in at 153 pounds.

In a surprising upset, in front of 12,391 mostly Puerto Rican fans, Cotto lost his final bout of his career via a 12-round unanimous decision. The three judges&#x27; scorecards read 115–113, 116–112, and 115–113 all in favour of Ali, who also claimed the WBO light middleweight title. Cotto stated after the fight that he had torn his left bicep in round 7. Cotto started the fight off well, but appeared to slow down midway. Cotto was hurt several times in the fight, and looked on the verge of being stopped a number of occasions, however Ali never looked as though he was going for a knockout. After round 8, two judges had Cotto in front, whilst the third had it even. Although mentioned the bicep injury, Cotto went on to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make excuses. Sadam won the fight. It is my last fight. I am good, and I want to be happy in my home with my family.&quot; Cotto ended his career with a (8–2) record at MSG. Ali thanked Cotto for giving him the opportunity to fight him, &quot;I worked hard for it. I took advantage of this fight, and I made sure to make it count. I want to thank team Cotto, they could have taken an easier fight if they wanted to.&quot; Compubox stats showed that Cotto landed 163 of 536 punches thrown (30.4%), whilst Ali landed 139 of his 647 thrown (21.5%). For his final fight, Cotto earned a minimum purse of $1 million. Ali earned a career high $700,000 purse. Cotto was set to have surgery on December 6 to mend a ruptured biceps tendon, which was successful. Cotto&#x27;s final professional bout averaged 944,000 viewers and peaked at 1.012 million on HBO.

=== Retirement ===
Cotto kept his word and retired after his loss to Sadam Ali. When asked if the fight was his last, Cotto said, &quot;It is. I want to be happy in my home and enjoy my family.&quot; Cotto then told the fans, &quot;Thank you for supporting me at every opportunity. &quot;I&#x27;m so glad to call Madison Square Garden my home.&quot; After a 17-year professional career, Cotto officially retired with a record of 41 wins, with 33 wins inside the distance, and 6 losses.

== Personal life ==
Cotto is married to Melissa Guzmán with whom he has three children, Luis, Alondra and Miguel Cotto III. Cotto has another daughter from a previous relationship, who was born in November 2006.

Cotto also owns and presides a boxing promotion named &quot;Promociones Miguel Cotto&quot;, which organizes fight cards in Puerto Rico. Similarly he founded &quot;El Ángel&quot;, a non-profit organization that promotes physical activity and measures against infant obesity. Marc Eckō, fashion designer and owner of Eckō Unltd., selected Cotto when promoting the brand within the sport, citing the boxer&#x27;s &quot;fearless&quot; demeanor as one of the main reasons behind this agreement. As a product of this partnership, Eckō Unltd. produced boxing gear for him as well as mainstream clothing accessories for the general public. Miguel Cotto&#x27;s uncle David Cotto was the first Cotto to be a boxer, he was trained by Bob Foster out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and managed by Jack Luce. David was a stablemate of Clint Jackson and Tommy Cordova. His career was cut short due to a gunshot wound to his right hand while working as an NYPD officer.
