<text>The architecture of the United States demonstrates a broad variety of architectural styles and built forms over the country&#x27;s history of over two centuries of independence and former Spanish, French, Dutch and British rule.

Architecture in the United States has been shaped by many internal and external factors and regional distinctions. As a whole it represents a rich eclectic and innovative tradition.

==Pre-Columbian==

The oldest surviving non-imported structures on the territory that is now known as the United States were made by the Ancient Pueblo People of the four corners region. The Tiwa speaking people have inhabited Taos Pueblo continuously for over 1000 years. Algonquian villages Pomeiooc and Section in what later became coastal North Carolina survive from the late 16th century. Artist and cartographer John White stayed at the short-lived Roanoke Colony for 13 months and recorded over 70 watercolor images of indigenous people, plants, and animals.

The remote location of the Hawaiian Islands from North America gave ancient Hawaii a substantial period of precolonial architecture. Early structures reflect Polynesian heritage and the refined culture of Hawaii. Post-contact late-19th-century Hawaiian architecture shows various foreign influences such as the Victorian, Georgian, and early-20th-century Spanish Colonial Revival styles.

==Colonial==

When the Europeans settled in North America, they brought their architectural traditions and construction techniques for building. The oldest buildings in America have examples of that. Construction was dependent on the available resources. Wood and brick are the most common elements of English buildings in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the coastal South. It had also brought the conquest, destruction, and displacement of the indigenous peoples existing buildings in their homeland, as their dwelling and settlement construction techniques devalued compared to colonial standards. The colonizers appropriated the territories and sites for new forts, dwellings, missions, churches, and agricultural developments.

===Spanish influences===

The Spanish colonial architecture in the United States was markedly different from the European styles adopted in other parts of America such as the simple French colonial houses in the Mississippi Valley, which were consisted of adjoining rooms that opened upon a &quot;galerie&quot;. The Spanish architecture (particularly evident in ecclesiastical establishments) built in the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Florida, and Georgia was similar to the design adopted in Mexico. According to scholars, the Spaniards built without any consideration to the cost, believing that their tenure in America would be eternal.

====Florida====

Spanish colonial architecture was built in Florida and the Southeastern United States from 1559 to 1821. The &quot;conch style&quot; is represented in Pensacola, Florida and other areas of Florida, adorning houses with balconies of wrought iron, as appears in the mostly Spanish-built French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Fires in 1788 and 1794 destroyed the original French structures in New Orleans. Many of the city&#x27;s present buildings date to late-18th-century rebuilding efforts.

The two earliest continuously occupied European settlements in the United States are St. Augustine, Florida founded in 1565 and Santa Fe, New Mexico. St. Augustine, the first continuously European-occupied city in North America, was established in 1565. Beginning in 1598, quarried coquina from Anastasia Island contributed to a new colonial style of architecture in this city. Coquina is a limestone conglomerate, containing small shells of mollusks. It was used in the construction of residential homes, the City Gate, the Cathedral Basilica, the Castillo de San Marcos, and Fort Matanzas. The city of St. Augustine is one of the rare vestiges of 17th-century Spanish colonial architecture in the present day United States.

====Southwest====
Spanish exploration of the North American deserts, the present day Southwestern United States, began in the 1540s. The conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado crossed this region in search of the mythical cities of gold. Instead they found the ancient culture and architecture of the Pueblo people. The Pueblo people built dwellings of adobe, a sun-dried clay brick, with exposed wooden ceiling beams. Their cubic form and dense arrangement gave villages a singular aspect. The modest unadorned structures remained constant and cool. The Spanish conquered these pueblos and made Pueblo de Santa Fe the administrative capital of the Santa Fe de Nuevo México Province in 1609. The Palace of the Governors was built between 1610 and 1614, mixing Pueblo Indian and Spanish influences. The building is long and has a patio. The Mission San Francisco de Asis in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico dates from the 1770s and used the adobe technique as well, which gave the edifice a striking look of bold austerity. Centuries later the Pueblo Revival Style architecture style developed in the region. The Mission San Xavier del Bac near Tucson, Arizona, has Churrigueresque detailing from southern examples in New Spain. Its facade is framed by two massive towers and the entrance is flanked by estipites.

====California province====


In the late 18th century, the Spanish founded a series of &quot;presidios&quot; (forts) in the upper Las Californias Province to resist Russian and British colonization there, the Presidio of San Diego, Presidio of Santa Barbara, Presidio of Monterey, and Presidio of San Francisco were established to do this and support the occupation by new missions and settlements. From 1769 to 1823, the Franciscans created a linear network of twenty-one Missions in California. The missions had a significant influence on later regional architecture. An example of a period residence is the Casa de la Guerra, in Santa Barbara.

===Dutch influences===

Developed from around 1630 with the arrival of Dutch colonists to New Amsterdam and the Hudson River Valley in what is now New York and in Bergen in what is now New Jersey. Initially the settlers built small, one room cottages with stone walls and steep roofs to allow a second floor loft. By 1670 or so, two-story gable-end homes were common in New Amsterdam.

===French influences===

French Colonial developed in the settlements of the Illinois Country and French Louisiana. It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of French Canada and the Caribbean. It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after Spain assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the Creole cottage, Creole townhouse, and French Creole plantation house.

===English influences===
Excavations at the first permanent English-speaking settlement, Jamestown, Virginia (founded 1607) have unearthed part of the triangular James Fort and numerous artifacts from the early 17th century. Nearby Williamsburg was Virginia&#x27;s colonial capital and is now a tourist attraction as a well-preserved 18th-century town.

The New World population of 200,000 in 1657, ninety percent of whom drew from England, used the same simple construction techniques as those in their respective mother countries. These settlers often came to the New World for economic purposes, therefore revealing why most early homes reflect the influences of modest village homes and small farms. The appearance of structures was very plain and made with little imported material. Windows, for example, were extremely small. The size did not increase until long after the British were manufacturing glass. This was because the Venetians had not rediscovered the strictly Roman clear glass until the 15th century and it did not come to England until another hundred years later. The few windows that did exist on early colonial homes had small panes held together by a lead framework, much like a typical church&#x27;s stained glass window. The glass that was used was imported from England and was incredibly expensive. In the 18th century, many of these houses were restored and sash windows replaced the originals. These were invented by Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and were made so that one panel of glass easily slid up, vertically, behind another.
Timber, especially white and red cedar, made for a great building resource and was readily abundant for the settlers in the English colonies, so naturally many houses were made of wood. As for decorative elements, as said before most colonial houses were built plainly and therefore most colonial house designs led to a very simple outcome. Although one subtle element of ornamentation that was used on the front door. The owner would take nails, think of an object or pattern to make with them, and nail that decoration onto the door. The more nails one had, the more extravagant and elaborate the pattern could become.

The most prized architectural aspect of the house was the chimney. Large and usually made of brick or stone, the chimney was very fashionable at this time, specifically 1600–1715. During the Tudor period in England, which lasted up until around 1603, coal became the popular material for heating the home. Before that, a wood fire was burned on the floor in the center of the house, with the smoke escaping only through windows and vents. With coal, this method could not suffice because the smoke was unacceptably black and sticky. It needed to be contained and the function of a chimney was to do just that.

The oldest remaining building of Plymouth, Massachusetts is the Harlow Old Fort House built 1677 and now a museum. The Fairbanks House (ca. 1636) in Dedham, Massachusetts is the oldest remaining wood-frame house in North America. Several notable colonial era buildings remain in Boston. Boston&#x27;s Old North Church, built 1723 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren, became an influential model for later United States church design.

====Georgian architecture====
The Georgian style appeared during the 18th century, and Palladian architecture took hold of colonial Williamsburg in the Colony of Virginia. The Governor&#x27;s Palace there, built in 1706–1720, had a vast gabled entrance at the front. It respects the principle of symmetry and uses the materials that were found in the Tidewater region of the Mid-Atlantic colonies: red brick, white painted wood, and blue slate used for the roof with a double slant. This style is used to build the houses for prosperous plantation owners in the country and wealthy merchants in town.

In religious architecture, the common design features were brick, stone-like stucco, and a single spire that tops the entrance. They can be seen in Saint Paul&#x27;s Church (1761) in Mount Vernon, New York or Saint Paul&#x27;s Chapel (1766) in New York, New York. The architects of this period were more influenced by the canons of Old World architecture. Peter Harrison (1716–1755) used his European techniques in designing the Redwood Library and Athenaeum (1748 and 1761), in Newport, Rhode Island and now the oldest community library still occupying its original building in the United States. Boston and Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony were two primary cities where the Georgian style took hold, but in a simpler style than in England, adapted to the colonial limitations.

==Architecture for a new nation==
In 1776, the members of the Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence of the Thirteen Colonies. After the long and distressing American Revolutionary War, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the existence of the new republic, the United States of America. Even though it was a firm break with the English politically, the Georgian influences continued to mark the buildings constructed. Public and commercial needs grew in parallel with the territorial extension. The buildings of these new federal and business institutions used the classic vocabulary of columns, domes and pediments, in reference to ancient Rome and Greece, which symbolize the democracy of the newfound nation. Architectural publications multiplied: in 1797, Asher Benjamin published &quot;The Country Builder&#x27;s Assistant&quot;. Americans looked to affirm their independence in the domains of politics, economics, and culture with new civic architecture for government, religion, and education.

===Federal architecture===

In the 1780s the Federal style of architecture began to diverge bit-by-bit from the Georgian style and became a uniquely American genre. At the time of the War of Independence, houses stretched out along a strictly rectangular plan, adopting curved lines and favoring decorative details such as garlands and urns. Certain openings were ellipsoidal in form, one or several pieces were oval or circular.

The Bostonian architect Charles Bulfinch fitted the Massachusetts State House&#x27; in 1795–1798 with an original gilded dome. He worked on the construction of several houses in Louisburg Square of the Beacon Hill quarter in Boston. Samuel McIntire designed the John Gardiner-Pingree house (1805) in Salem, Massachusetts with a gentle sloped roof and brick balustrade. With Palladio as inspiration, he linked the buildings with a semi-circular column supported portico.

The Federal style of architecture was popular along the Atlantic coast from 1780 to 1830. Characteristics of this style include neoclassical elements, bright interiors with large windows and white walls and ceilings, and a decorative yet restrained appearance that emphasized rational elements. Significant federal style architects at the time include: Asher Benjamin, Charles Bulfinch, Samuel McIntire, Alexander Parris, and William Thornton.

===Thomas Jefferson===

Thomas Jefferson, who was the third president of the United States between 1801 and 1809, was a scholar in many domains, including architecture. Having journeyed several times in Europe, he hoped to apply the formal rules of palladianism and of antiquity in public and private architecture and master planning. He contributed to the plans for the University of Virginia, which began construction in 1817. The project was completed by Benjamin Latrobe applying Jefferson&#x27;s architectural concepts. The university library is situated under a The Rotunda covered by a dome inspired by the Pantheon of Rome. The combination created a uniformity thanks to the use of brick and wood painted white. For the new Virginia State Capitol building (1785–1796) in Richmond, Virginia, Jefferson was inspired by the ancient Rome Maison Carrée in Nîmes, but chose the Ionic order for its columns. A man of the Age of Enlightenment, Thomas Jefferson had participated in the emancipation of New World architecture by expressing his vision of an art-form in service of democracy. He contributed to developing the Federal style in his country by combining European Neoclassical architecture and American democracy.

Thomas Jefferson also designed the buildings for his plantation Monticello, near Charlottesville, Virginia. Monticello is a tribute to the Neo Palladian style, modeled on the Hôtel de Salm in Paris, that Jefferson saw while the ambassador to France. Work on Monticello commenced in 1768 and modifications continued until 1809. This American variation on Palladian architecture borrowed from British and Irish models and revived the tetrastyle portico with Doric columns. This interest in Roman elements appealed in a political climate that looked to the ancient Roman Republic as a model

===New capital city===

The United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., is an example of uniform urbanism: the design of the capitol building was imagined by the French Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant. This ideal of the monumental city and neoclassicism. Several cities wanted to apply this concept, which is part of the reason why Washington, D.C., did. The new nation&#x27;s capital should have the best examples of architecture at the time.

The White House was constructed after the creation of Washington, D.C., by congressional law in December 1790. After a contest, James Hoban, an Irish American, was chosen and the construction began in October 1792. The building that he had conceived was modeled upon the first and second floors of the Leinster House, a ducal palace in Dublin, Ireland which is now the seat of the Irish Parliament. But during the War of 1812, a large part of the city was burned, and the White House was ravaged. Only the exterior walls remained standing, but it was reconstructed. The walls were painted white to hide the damage caused by the fire. At the beginning of the 20th century, two new wings were added to support the development of the government.

The United States Capitol was constructed in successive stages starting in 1792. Shortly after the completion of its construction, it was partially burned by the British during the War of 1812. Its reconstruction began in 1815 and did not end until 1830. During the 1850s, the building was greatly expanded by Thomas U. Walter. In 1863, the imposing &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;, was placed on the top of the current (new at the time) dome.

The Washington Monument is an Obelisk erected in honor of George Washington, the first American president. It was Robert Mills who had designed it originally in 1838. There is a perceivable color difference towards the bottom of the monument, which is because its construction was put on hiatus for lack of money. At high, it was completed in 1884 and opened to the public in 1888.

===South===

Much architecture of the Deep South was developed in the context of the plantation economy. Plantation complexes in the Southern United States often featured European-derived styles for the slaveowners&#x27; houses, while housing for enslaved African Americans often drew upon vernacular building traditions.

Anglophone plantation owners often favored the Greek Revival style, featuring a neoclassical pediment with columns, as at &quot;Belle Meade Plantation&quot; in Tennessee, with a symmetrical columned porch and narrow windows. The domestic architecture in the South adapted the neoclassical model by supporting a mid-height balcony on the front without a pediment or entrance portico, such as at Oak Alley Plantation, in St. James Parish, Louisiana. These houses adapted to the regional climate and into the economy of a plantation with enslaved labor for construction.

In regions that had experienced French and Spanish colonization, such as the Gulf Coast, buildings were often constructed in Creole architectural styles.

==Frontier vernacular==

The Homestead Act of 1862 brought property ownership within reach for millions of citizens, displaced native peoples, and changed the character of settlement patterns across the Great Plains and Southwest. The law offered a modest farm free of charge to any adult male who cultivated the land for five years and built a residence on the property. This established a rural pattern of isolated farmsteads in the Midwest and West instead of the European and eastern U.S. states&#x27; villages and towns. Settlers built homes from local materials, such as rustic sod, semi-cut stone, mortared cobble, adobe bricks, and rough logs. They erected log cabins in forested areas and sod houses, such as the Sod House (Cleo Springs, Oklahoma), in treeless prairies. The present-day sustainable architecture method of Straw-bale construction was pioneered in late-19th-century Nebraska with baling machines.

The Spanish and later Mexican Alta California Ranchos and early American pioneers used the readily available clay to make adobe bricks, and distant forests&#x27; tree trunks for beams sparingly. Locally made roof tiles were produced by the Mission Indians. As milled wood became more available in the mid-19th century the Monterey Colonial architecture style first developed in Monterey and then spread. The Leonis Adobe, Larkin House, and Rancho Petaluma Adobe are original examples.

==Mid-19th century==
===Greek Revival===

Greek revival style attracted American architects working in the first half of the 19th century. The young nation, free from Britannic protection, was persuaded to be the new Athens, that is to say, a foyer for democracy.
Benjamin Latrobe (1764–1820) and his students William Strickland (1788–1854) and Robert Mills (1781–1855) obtained commissions to build some banks and churches in the big cities (Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC).

Some state capitol buildings adopted the Greek Revival style such as in North Carolina (Capitol building in Raleigh, rebuilt in 1833–1840 after a fire) or in Indiana (Capitol building in Indianapolis). One later example of these is the Ohio State Capitol in Columbus, designed by Henry Walters and completed in 1861. The simple façade, continuous cornice and the absence of a dome give the impression of the austerity and greatness of the building. It has a very symmetrical design and houses the Supreme Court and a library. A rare style also was adopted around this time, Egyptian Revival architecture.

===Italianate===
===Gothic Revival===

From the 1840s on, the Gothic Revival style became popular in the United States, under the influence of Andrew Jackson Downing (1815–1852). He defined himself in a reactionary context to classicism and development of romanticism. His work is characterized by a return to Medieval decor: chimneys, gables, embrasure towers, warhead windows, gargoyles, stained glass and severely sloped roofs. The buildings adopted a complex design that drew inspiration from symmetry and neoclassicism.

The great families of the east coast had immense estates and villas constructed in the style, with antipodes of Neoclassicism. Some took Horace Walpole&#x27;s Strawberry Hill House as a model. Alexander Jackson Davis (1803–1892) worked on villa projects in the Hudson River Valley and used details from the Gothic to Baroque repertoire. For the Jay Gould estate country house &quot;Lyndhurst&quot; in Tarrytown, New York, Alexander Jackson Davis designed a building with a complex asymmetrical outline, and opened the double-height art gallery with stained glass windows.

New York City is home to James Renwick Jr&#x27;s Saint Patrick Cathedral, an elegant synthesis of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Reims and the Cologne Cathedral. The project was entrusted to him in 1858 but completed by the erection of two spires on the facade in 1888. The use of materials lighter than stone allowed to pass from flying buttresses to exterior buttresses. Renwick also showed his talent in Washington, D.C., with the construction of the Smithsonian Institution. But his critics reproached him for having broken the architectural harmony of the capital by building an eccentric combination in red brick using Byzantine, Romanesque, Lombard, and eclectic themes.

Richard Upjohn (1802–1878) specialized in the rural churches of the northeast, but his major work is still &quot;Trinity Church&quot; in New York. His red sandstone architecture makes reference to the 16th-century forms in Europe. The Gothic Revival style was also used in the construction of universities (Yale, Harvard) and churches. The success of the Gothic Revival was prolonged up until the beginning of the 20th century in numerous Skyscrapers, notably in Chicago and in New York.

==Gilded Age and late 1800s==
===Late Victorian architecture===

Following the American Civil War and through the turn of the 20th century, a number of related styles, trends, and movements emerged, are loosely and broadly categorized as &quot;Victorian,&quot; due to their correspondence with similar movements of the time in the British Empire during the later reign of Queen Victoria. Many architects working during this period would cross various modes, depending on the commission. Key influential American architects of the period include Richard Morris Hunt, Frank Furness, and Henry Hobson Richardson.

After the war, the uniquely American Stick Style developed as a form of construction that uses wooden rod trusswork, the origin of its name. The style was commonly used in houses, hotels, railway depots, and other structures primarily of wood. The buildings are topped by high roofs with steep slopes and prominent decoration of the gables. The exterior is not bare of decoration, even though the main objective remains comfort. Richard Morris Hunt constructed John N. Griswold&#x27;s house in Newport, Rhode Island in 1862 in this style. The &quot;Stick Style&quot; was progressively abandoned after c. 1873, gradually evolving into the Queen Anne Style.

On the west coast in California, Oregon, and Washington, domestic architecture evolved equally towards a more modern style. San Francisco has many representations of the Italianate, Stick-Eastlake, and Queen Anne styles of Victorian architecture, c. 1850s–1900. Constructed with Redwood lumber they resisted the 1906 San Francisco earthquake itself, though some burned in the aftermath. They introduced the contemporary services of central heating and electricity. The Carson Mansion conceived of by Builder-Architects, Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom and built by an army of over 100 craftsman from the massive lumber operations of its owner, is prominently situated at the head of Old Town Eureka, California on Humboldt Bay. It is widely regarded as one of the highest executions of Queen Anne style in California and the United States.

On the east coast the Queen Anne evolved into the Shingle Style architecture. It is characterized by attention to a more relaxed rustic image. Richardson designed the William Watts Sherman House (1874–1875) in Newport, Rhode Island, and the Mary Fiske Stoughton House (1882–1883) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Charles Follen McKim the Newport Casino (1879–1881) using shingle clad asymmetrical facades.

While medieval influence rode high, in the second half of the 19th century, architects also responded to commissions for estate scale residences with Renaissance Revival residences. Industry and commerce tycoons invested in stone and commissioned mansions replicating European palaces. The Biltmore Estate near to Asheville, North Carolina is in the Châteauesque style of French Renaissance Revival, and is the largest private residence in the U.S. Richard Morris Hunt interpreted the Louis XII and François I wings from the Château de Blois for it.

===Rise of the skyscraper===

The most notable United States architectural innovation has been the skyscraper. Several technical advances made this possible. In 1853, Elisha Otis invented the first safety elevator which prevented a car from falling down the shaft if the suspending cable broke. Elevators allowed buildings to rise above the four or five stories that people were willing to climb by stairs for normal occupancy. An 1868 competition decided the design of New York City&#x27;s six story Equitable Life Building, which would become the first commercial building to use an elevator. Construction commenced in 1873. Other structures followed such as the Auditorium Building, Chicago in 1885 by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan. This adopted Italian palazzo design details to give the appearance of a structured whole: for several decades American skyscrapers would blend conservative decorative elements with technical innovation.

Soon skyscrapers encountered a new technological challenge. Load-bearing stone walls become impractical as a structure gains height, reaching a technical limit at about 20 stories (culminating in the 1891 Monadnock Building by Burnham &amp; Root in Chicago). Professional engineer William LeBaron Jenney solved the problem with a steel support frame in Chicago&#x27;s 10-story Home Insurance Building, 1885. Arguably this is the first true skyscraper. The use of a thin curtain wall in place of a load-bearing wall reduced the building&#x27;s overall weight by two thirds. Another feature that was to become familiar in 20th-century skyscrapers first appeared in Chicago&#x27;s Reliance Building, designed by Charles B. Atwood and E.C. Shankland, Chicago, 1890–1895. Because outer walls no longer bore the weight of a building it was possible to increase window size. This became the first skyscraper to have plate glass windows take up a majority of its outer surface area.

Some of the most graceful early towers were designed by Louis Sullivan (1856–1924), America&#x27;s first great modern architect. His most talented student was Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959), who spent much of his career designing private residences with matching furniture and generous use of open space.

===Beaux-Arts and the American Renaissance===
Daniel Burnham&#x27;s &quot;White City&quot; of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, held in Chicago, Illinois, ceremonially marks the dawn of the golden age for the Beaux-Arts style, and larger firms such as McKim, Mead and White. The era is documented in photo architectural albums such as the &quot;Architectural photographic series&quot; of Albert Levy.

The Columbian Exposition also reflected the rise of American landscape architecture and city planning. Notable were the works of Frederick Law Olmsted, an already-prominent and prolific landscape architect who had designed the Midway Plaisance of the 1893 Exhibition, having previously designed New York&#x27;s Central Park in the 1850s, the layout of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and many other works nationwide. Olmsted and his sons were also involved in the City Beautiful movement, which, as its name suggests, sought to aesthetically (and thus culturally) transform cities. The aspirations of the movement can be seen in the McMillan Plan for Washington, D.C.

As the century progressed, the Beaux-Arts influence would become somewhat more restrained, returning to its more Neoclassical roots. The Lincoln Memorial (1915–1922), made out of marble and white limestone, takes its form from doric order Greek temples without a pediment. Its architect, Henry Bacon, student of the ideas from the Beaux-Arts school, intended the 36 columns of monument to represent each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death. The Jefferson Memorial was the last great monument constructed in the Beaux-Arts tradition, in the 1940s. Its architect, John Russell Pope, wanted to bring to light Jefferson&#x27;s taste for Roman buildings. This is why he decided to imitate the Pantheon in Rome and grace the building with a similar type dome. It was severely criticized by the proponents of the International Style.

==Early suburbs (1890–1930)==
With the boom in the use of electric streetcars, the inner ring of suburbs developed around major cities, later to be aided by the advent of bicycles and automobiles. This boom in construction would result in a new, distinctly American form of house would emerge: the American Foursquare.

==Revivalism in the 20th century==

The trend of reviving previous styles continued over from the 19th century. Many of the revivals beginning in the late 19th century on into the 20th century would focus more on regional characteristics and earlier styles endemic to the United States and eclectically from abroad, further influenced by the rise of middle-class tourism.

===Mediterranean revival===

The early 20th century saw Mediterranean Revival style architecture enter the large estate design vocabulary. A major and significant example is the Hearst Castle on the Central Coast of California, designed by architect Julia Morgan. The San Francisco Bay Area estate Filoli, by Willis Polk, is in Woodside, California with the mansion and gardens now part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and open to the public.

the Dumbarton Oaks estate, in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., has Italian Renaissance gardens by early landscape architect Beatrix Farrand and architectural design by several architects including Philip Johnson. The Harold Lloyd Estate, &quot;Greenacres&quot; in Beverly Hills, California, is a significant example from the 1920s, with extensive gardens by a leading estate Landscape designer in that era, A.E. Hanson.

===Spanish Colonial revival===
The 1915 Panama–California Exposition the architecture by Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr. intentionally moved beyond the Mission Revival Style, from their studying Spanish Colonial architecture and its Churrigueresque and Plateresque refinements in Mexico. The project was a popular success, and introduced the Spanish Colonial Revival style to many design professionals and the public in California and across the country.

George Washington Smith, based in Montecito and Santa Barbara, designed the detailed and integrated Andalusian Spanish Colonial Revival Casa del Herrero estate in 1926. Smith, Bertram Goodhue, Wallace Neff, and other notable architects created many &#x27;Country Place Era&#x27; properties throughout California during this period. A civic example is the Santa Barbara County Courthouse and a commercial example the Mission Inn in Riverside, California.

===Georgian revival===

The Georgian style predominated residential design in the British colonial era in the thirteen Colonies. At the Mount Pleasant mansion (1761–1762) in Philadelphia, the residence is constructed with an entrance topped by a pediment supported by Doric columns. The roof has a balustrade and a symmetrical arrangement, characteristic of the neoclassic style popular in Europe then.

In the early decades of the twentieth century when there was a growing nostalgia for its sense of order, the style was revived and adapted and in the United States came to be known as the Colonial Revival. From 1910–1930, the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant, with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style. In the immediate post-war period (c. 1950s–early 1960s), Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed, but in simplified form. In the present-day, many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles.

==Style Moderne and the Interwar skyscraper==
===Skyscrapers as architectural battleground===
One culturally significant early skyscraper was New York City&#x27;s Woolworth Building designed by architect Cass Gilbert, 1913. Raising previous technological advances to new heights, 793 ft (233 m), it was the world&#x27;s tallest building until 1930. Frank Woolworth was fond of gothic cathedrals. Cass Gilbert constructed the office building as a cathedral of commerce and incorporated many Gothic revival decorative elements. The main entrance and lobby contain numerous allegories of thrift, including an acorn growing into an oak tree and a man losing his shirt. The popularity of the new Woolworth Building inspired many Gothic revival imitations among skyscrapers and remained a popular design theme until the art deco era. Other public concerns emerged following the building&#x27;s introduction. New York City&#x27;s 1916 Zoning Resolution setback law, which remained in effect until 1960, allowed structures to rise to any height as long as it reduced the area of each tower floor to one quarter of the structure&#x27;s ground floor area. The Woolworth Building represents this type of building referred to as &quot;wedding cake&quot; skyscrapers.
Another significant event in skyscraper history was the competition for Chicago&#x27;s Tribune Tower. Although the competition selected a gothic design influenced by the Woolworth building, some of the numerous competing entries became influential to other 20th-century architectural styles. Second-place finisher Eliel Saarinen submitted a modernist design. An entry from Walter Gropius brought attention to the Bauhaus school.

==Roadside architecture==
The automobile culture of the United States has spawned numerous forms of architectural expression peculiar to that country (or alongside Canada), often vernacular in origin, especially in Diners.

===&quot;Parkitecture&quot;===

National Park Service rustic – sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture – is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service (NPS) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment. Since its founding in 1916, the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings. The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world, reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture.

===Miami Modern===

Morris Lapidus pioneered the &quot;Miami Modern&quot; style, best seen in the Ritz-Carlton South Beach, which went through a $90 million renovation in 2019.

==Post-War suburbs==
The 1944 G. I. Bill of Rights was another federal government decision that changed the architectural landscape. Government-backed loans made home ownership affordable for many more citizens. Affordable automobiles, unprecedented federal and state investment in highways encouraging workers to live ever further from their workplace, corresponding with a decline in public transportation investment and popular preference for single family detached homes, led to the rise of suburbs. Simultaneously praised for their quality of life and condemned for architectural monotony, these have become a familiar feature of the United States landscape.

==Modernism and reactions==
===Early Modernism===

Interest in the simplification of the interior space and exterior facade progressed due to the work of Irving Gill, characterized by several Californian houses with flat roofs in the 1910s such as the Walter Luther Dodge house in Los Angeles. Rudolf M. Schindler and Richard Neutra adapted European modernism to the Californian context in the 1920s with the former&#x27;s &quot;Lovell Beach House&quot; in Newport Beach and Schindler House in West Hollywood, and the latter&#x27;s Lovell Health House in the Hollywood Hills.
===International style===
* Ludwig Mies van der Rohe – Farnsworth House (Plano, Illinois), 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments
* Louis Kahn – Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Phillips Exeter Academy Library

* Richard Neutra – Von Sternberg House, Kaufmann Desert House
* Eero Saarinen – TWA Flight Center, Dulles International Airport
* Welton Becket – Capital Records Building, Riverplace Tower, Equitable Life Building

* Antoine Predock – CLA Building, Flint RiverQuarium, McNamara Alumni Center

European architects who emigrated to the United States before World War II launched what became a dominant movement in architecture, the International Style. The Lever House introduced a new approach to a uniform glazing of the skyscraper&#x27;s skin, and located in Manhattan. An influential modernist immigrant architect was Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969) and Walter Gropius (1883–1969), both former directors of Germany&#x27;s famous design school, the Bauhaus.

The Reliance Building&#x27;s move toward increased window area reached its logical conclusion in a New York City building with a Brazilian architect on land that is technically not a part of the United States. United Nations headquarters, 1949–1950, by Oscar Niemeyer has the first complete glass curtain wall.

American government buildings and skyscrapers of this period have are a style known as Federal Modernism. Based on pure geometric form, buildings in the International style have been both praised as minimalist monuments to American culture and corporate success by some, and criticized as sterile glass boxes by others.

Skyscraper hotels gained popularity with the construction of John Portman&#x27;s (1924–) Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta followed by his Renaissance Center in Detroit which remains the tallest skyscraper hotel in the Western Hemisphere.

===Postmodernism===

In reaction to the &quot;glass boxes&quot; issue, some younger American architects such as Michael Graves (1945– ) have rejected the austere, boxy look in favor of postmodern buildings, such as those by Philip C. Johnson (1906–2005) with striking contours and bold decoration that alludes to historical styles of architecture.

=== Political perspectives ===
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued the Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture executive order on his first day back in office, promoting the use of &quot;traditional and classical&quot; architecture for civic buildings. The executive order mandated that more classical styles of architecture such as Neoclassicism be applied to public buildings, while rejecting Modernist ideas. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) criticized Trump&#x27;s directive, expressing &quot;[extreme] concern&quot; and saying mandates related to architectural styles stifle innovation and harm local communities.

==Architecture as an American profession==
===Education and practice===
The formal education and practice of U.S. architecture started in the early 19th century when Thomas Jefferson, and others, realized a need for trained architects to fulfill an acute need for professionals to support an expanding nation. It was then that architectural education became institutionalized within a formal setting; prior to this, the dominant model for training was apprenticeship to artisan, &quot;at best a hit-or miss proposition educationally.&quot; Additionally, most who called themselves architects during that general time period, were male, well-off, white, and trained in the French Ecole des Beaux Arts (School of Fine Arts) education philosophy. According to Georg Hegel, a fine art philosophy, by definition, that focused on aesthetics and intellectual purpose, rather than any practical function.

This is the basis in which Thomas Jefferson, and others, formalized U.S. architectural pedagogy 150 years ago. According to Ernest Boyer and Lee Mitgang, a philosophy that advocated for:
# leaving the practical nature of the profession to be learned outside of formal education;
# architectural design to be conducted by a competitive method, with judgements by jury;
# the study of design be continuous through school, and design problems should not be overly practical, but rather should stimulate the imagination through the study of great masters;
# and an architectural curriculum include as broad a cultural background as time permits.
This philosophy does not mention scientific or social science research. This legacy has meant that today, fewer than 20% of the 115 accredited Schools of Architecture offer a Ph.D. program; in addition, only a handful more offer exposure to and experience in rigorous research within building science &amp; technology centers and laboratory settings. According to Gordon Chong, the architectural profession having emphasized &quot;looking back as a means for justifying design decisions for future design,&quot; there remains a significant imbalance in learning between experience, intuition, and evidence-based design.

There are currently over 83,000 members of the American Institute of Architects. The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) estimates the number of architects licensed in the United States at 105,847. Architecture firms employ approximately 158,000 people in the United States (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33 professions are identified as over 90% white, including architecture at 91.3% white. A number of allied professions are also over 90% white, including construction managers (91.8%), construction supervisors (91.8%), and cost estimators (93.9%), and related construction tradespersons including electricians (90.0%), painters (90.7%), carpenters (90.9%), cement masons (91.2%), steel workers (92.3%), and sheet metal workers (93.5%). The US labor force is 80% white.

<doc id="199140" wikidata="Q3174534" url="?curid=199140" title="Peace through strength">
<text>&quot;Peace through strength&quot; is a phrase that suggests that military power can help preserve peace. It has been used by many leaders from Roman Emperor Hadrian in the second century AD to former US President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The concept has long been associated with realpolitik. The idea has critics, with Andrew Bacevich stating, Peace through strength&#x27; easily enough becomes &#x27;peace through war.

==History==
The phrase and the concept date to ancient times. Roman Emperor Hadrian (AD 76–138) is said to have sought &quot;peace through strength or, failing that, peace through threat.&quot; Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was a symbol of the policy.

===United States===
The first US president, George Washington, enunciated a policy of peace through strength in his fifth annual message to Congress, the 1793 State of the Union Address. He said:
There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.

In Federalist No. 24, Alexander Hamilton argued for peace through strength by stating that strong garrisons in the west and a navy in the east would help to deter potential conflicts with Britain, Spain and various Native American peoples.

&quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; is the motto of the Eighth Air Force, established in 1944.

&quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; (1952) is the title of a book about a defense plan by Bernard Baruch, a World War II adviser to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, published by Farrar, Straus and Young. For supporters of the MX missile in the 1970s, the missile symbolized &quot;peace through strength.&quot;

====Republican Party====
During Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign in the United States, the Republican Party spent about $5 million on TV ads promoting Goldwater&#x27;s foreign policy position of &quot;Peace through Strength.&quot; President Gerald Ford alluded to the concept in his 1977 State of the Union Address. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, who had campaigned for Goldwater in 1964, used the phrase during his election challenge against Jimmy Carter by accusing the incumbent of weak, vacillating leadership that invited enemies to attack the United States and its allies. Reagan later considered it one of the mainstays of his foreign policy as president. In 1986, he explained it thus:
We know that peace is the condition under which mankind was meant to flourish. Yet peace does not exist of its own will. It depends on us, on our courage to build it and guard it and pass it on to future generations. George Washington&#x27;s words may seem hard and cold today, but history has proven him right again and again. &quot;To be prepared for war,&quot; he said, &quot;is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.&quot; Well, to those who think strength provokes conflict, Will Rogers had his own answer. He said of the world heavyweight champion of his day: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anyone insult Jack Dempsey.&quot;

The approach has been credited for forcing the Soviet Union to lose the arms race and end the Cold War. &quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; is the official motto of the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; (CVN-76).

&quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; has appeared in every party platform of the Republican Party since 1980.

On assuming office in January 2017, Donald Trump cited the idea of &quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; as central to his overall &quot;America First&quot; foreign policy. As such the introduction to US National Defense Strategy of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will &quot;preserve peace through strength.&quot; The document proceeds to detail what &quot;achieving peace through strength requires.&quot;

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, &quot;peace through strength&quot; is a slogan of Taiwanese nationalism, meaning to emphasize Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty, strengthen its military power, and work with the United States and Japan to guard against possible aggression by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Lai Ching-te, the eighth president of the Republic of China (Taiwan), emphasized &quot;peace through strength&quot; even before he became president. On June 19, 2024, president Lai reiterated that &quot;peace must rely on strength, which is to say avoiding war by preparing for war to achieve peace&quot;.

==Criticism==
For Andrew Bacevich, &quot;belief in the efficacy of military power almost inevitably breeds the temptation to put that power to work. &#x27;Peace through strength&#x27; easily enough becomes &#x27;peace through war.

Jim George of Australian National University used the term to describe part of what he argued was the Straussian and neoconservative foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration.

The mock inversion &quot;strength through peace&quot; has been used on occasion to draw criticism to the militaristic system of diplomacy advocated by &quot;peace through strength&quot;. Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich adopted the slogan &quot;Strength Through Peace&quot; during his 2008 presidential run as part of his platform as a peace candidate against the Iraq War.

==Trademark dispute==
During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, the non-profit American Security Council Foundation (ASCF) and its for-profit direct-mail provider, Communications Corporation of America, sought to influence United States foreign policy by promoting the idea, but after the Soviet collapse of 1991, ASCF fell into obscurity, and other organizations continued to promote the slogan. The Heritage Foundation and the Center for Security Policy (CSP) have also used the term in print. The ASCF registered a trademark for the phrase in April 2011. In September 2012, ASCF filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against CSP and Frank Gaffney, prompting the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; to ridicule ASCF&#x27;s Director of Operations, Gary James, for editing the online encyclopedia Wikipedia article titled &#x27;Peace through strength&#x27; so that it was &quot;drenched in ... ASCF references&quot;. Following a counterclaim by the CSP alleging that the trademark application had been fraudulent, in August 2013 the ACSF announced that it had settled the lawsuit with the CSP and would cancel its trademark claim.

<text>Visual art of the United States or American art is visual art made in the United States or by U.S. artists. Before colonization, there were many flourishing traditions of Native American art, and where the Spanish colonized Spanish Colonial architecture and the accompanying styles in other media were quickly in place. Early colonial art on the East Coast initially relied on artists from Europe, with John White (1540-c. 1593) the earliest example. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, artists primarily painted portraits, and some landscapes in a style based mainly on English painting. Furniture-makers imitating English styles and similar craftsmen were also established in the major cities, but in the English colonies, locally made pottery remained resolutely utilitarian until the 19th century, with fancy products imported.

But in the later 18th century two U.S. artists, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, became the most successful painters in London of history painting, then regarded as the highest form of art, giving the first sign of an emerging force in Western art. American artists who remained at home became increasingly skilled, although there was little awareness of them in Europe. In the early 19th century the infrastructure to train artists began to be established, and from 1820 the Hudson River School began to produce Romantic landscape painting that were original and matched the huge scale of U.S. landscapes. The American Revolution produced a demand for patriotic art, especially history painting, while other artists recorded the frontier country. A parallel development taking shape in rural U.S. was the American craft movement, which began as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.

After 1850 Academic art in the European style flourished, and as richer Americans became very wealthy, the flow of European art, new and old, to the US began; this has continued ever since. Museums began to be opened to display much of this. Developments in modern art in Europe came to the U.S. from exhibitions in New York City such as the Armory Show in 1913. After World War II, New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world. Since then many U.S. movements have shaped Modern and Postmodern art. Art in the United States today covers a huge range of styles.

==Beginnings==

One of the first painters to visit British America was John White (c. 1540 – c. 1606), who made important watercolor records of Native American life on the Eastern seaboard (now in the British Museum). White first visited America as the artist and map-maker for an expedition of exploration, and in the early years of the Colonial period most other artists trained in Western styles were officers in the army and navy, whose training included sketching landscapes. Eventually the English settlements grew large enough to support professional artists, mostly portrait-painters, often largely self-taught.

Among the earliest was John Smybert (1688–1751), a trained artist from London who emigrated in 1728 intending to be a professor of fine art, but instead became a portrait painter and printseller in Boston. His friend Peter Pelham was a painter and printmaker. Both needed other sources of income and had shops. Meanwhile, the Spanish territories later to be American could see mostly religious art in the late Baroque style, mostly by native artists, and Native American cultures continued to produce art in their various traditions.

==Eighteenth century==
After the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which marked the official beginning of the American national identity, the new nation needed a history, and part of that history would be expressed visually. Most of early American art (from the late 18th century through the early 19th century) consists of history painting and especially portraits. As in Colonial America, many of the painters who specialized in portraits were essentially self-taught; notable among them are Joseph Badger, John Brewster Jr., and William Jennys. The young nation&#x27;s artists generally emulated the style of British art, which they knew through prints and the paintings of English-trained immigrants such as John Smibert (1688–1751) and John Wollaston (active 1742–1775).

Robert Feke (1707–1752), an untrained painter of the colonial period, achieved a sophisticated style based on Smibert&#x27;s example. Charles Willson Peale, who gained much of his earliest art training by studying Smibert&#x27;s copies of European paintings, painted portraits of many of the important figures of the American Revolution. Peale&#x27;s younger brother James Peale and six of Peale&#x27;s nieces and sons— Anna Claypoole Peale, Sarah Miriam Peale, Raphaelle Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Rubens Peale and Titian Peale—were also artists. Painters such as Gilbert Stuart made portraits of the newly elected government officials, which became iconic after being reproduced on various U.S. Postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.

John Singleton Copley painted emblematic portraits for the increasingly prosperous merchant class, including a portrait of &quot;Paul Revere&quot; (ca. 1768–1770). The original version of his most famous painting, &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot; (1778), is in the collection of The National Gallery of Art while there is another version in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and a third version in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Benjamin West painted portraits as well as history paintings of the French and Indian War. West also worked in London where many American artists studied under him, including Washington Allston, Ralph Earl, James Earl, Samuel Morse, Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Gilbert Stuart, John Trumbull, Mather Brown, Edward Savage and Thomas Sully. John Trumbull painted large battle scenes of the Revolutionary War.
When landscape was painted it was most often done to show how much property a subject owned, or as a picturesque background for a portrait.

===Selection of works by early American artists===
==Nineteenth century==

The first well-known U.S. school of painting—the Hudson River School—appeared in 1820. Thomas Cole pioneered the movement which included Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Doughty and several others. As with music and literature, this development was delayed until artists perceived that the New World offered subjects unique to itself; in this case the westward expansion of settlement brought the transcendent beauty of frontier landscapes to painters&#x27; attention.

The Hudson River painters&#x27; directness and simplicity of vision influenced and inspired such later artists as John Kensett and the &quot;Luminists&quot;; as well as George Inness and the &quot;tonalists&quot; (which included Albert Pinkham Ryder and Ralph Blakelock among others), and Winslow Homer (1836–1910), who depicted the rural U.S.—the sea, the mountains, and the people who lived near them.

The Hudson River School landscape painter Robert S. Duncanson was one of the first important African American painters. John James Audubon, an ornithologist whose paintings documented birds, was one of the most important naturalist artists in the early U.S. His major work, a set of colored prints entitled &quot;The Birds of America&quot; (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Edward Hicks was a U.S. folk painter and distinguished minister of the Society of Friends. He became a Quaker icon because of his paintings.

Paintings of the Great West, many of which emphasized the sheer size of the land and the cultures of the native people living on it, became a distinct genre as well. George Catlin depicted the West and its people as honestly as possible. George Caleb Bingham, and later Frederic Remington, Charles M. Russell, the photographer Edward S. Curtis, and others recorded the U.S. Western heritage and the Old American West through their art.

History painting was a less popular genre in U.S. art during the 19th century, although &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot;, painted by the German-born Emanuel Leutze, is among the best-known U.S. paintings. The historical and military paintings of William B. T. Trego were widely published after his death (according to Edwin A. Peeples, &quot;There is probably not an American History book which doesn&#x27;t have (a) Trego picture in it&quot;).

Portrait painters in the U.S. in the 19th century included untrained limners such as Ammi Phillips, and painters schooled in the European tradition, such as Thomas Sully and G.P.A. Healy. Middle-class city life found its painter in Thomas Eakins (1844–1916), an uncompromising realist whose unflinching honesty undercut the genteel preference for romantic sentimentalism. As a result, he was not notably successful in his lifetime, although he has since been recognized as one of the most significant U.S. artists. One of his students was Henry Ossawa Tanner, the first African-American painter to achieve international acclaim.

A trompe-l&#x27;œil style of still-life painting, originating mainly in Philadelphia, included Raphaelle Peale (one of several artists of the Peale family), William Michael Harnett, and John F. Peto.

The most successful U.S. sculptor of his era, Hiram Powers, left the U.S. in his early thirties to spend the rest of his life in Europe, where he adopted a conventional style for his idealized female nudes such as &quot;Eve Tempted&quot;. Several important painters who are considered American spent much of their lives in Europe, notably Mary Cassatt, James McNeill Whistler, and John Singer Sargent, all of whom were influenced by French Impressionism. Theodore Robinson visited France in 1887, befriended Monet, and became one of the first U.S. painters to adopt the new technique. In the last decades of the century American Impressionism, as practiced by artists such as Childe Hassam and Frank W. Benson, became a popular style.

===Selection of notable 19th-century works===

==Twentieth century==



Controversy soon became a way of life for American artists. In fact, much of American painting and sculpture since 1900 has been a series of revolts against tradition. &quot;To hell with the artistic values,&quot; announced Robert Henri (1865–1929). He was the leader of what critics called the Ashcan school of painting, after the group&#x27;s portrayals of the squalid aspects of city life.

American realism became the new direction for American visual artists at the turn of the 20th century. The Ashcan painters George Bellows, Everett Shinn, George Benjamin Luks, William Glackens, and John Sloan were among those who developed socially conscious imagery in their works. The photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) led the Photo-Secession movement, which created pathways for photography as an emerging art form.

Soon the Ashcan school artists gave way to modernists arriving from Europe—the cubists and abstract painters promoted by Stieglitz at his 291 Gallery in New York City. John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Alfred Henry Maurer, Arthur B. Carles, Arthur Dove, Henrietta Shore, Stuart Davis, Wilhelmina Weber, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Morgan Russell, Patrick Henry Bruce, Andrew Dasburg, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, and Gerald Murphy were some important early American modernist painters. Early modernist sculptors in America include William Zorach, Elie Nadelman, and Paul Manship. Florine Stettheimer developed an extremely personal faux-naif style.

After World War I many American artists rejected the modern trends emanating from the Armory Show and European influences such as those from the School of Paris. Instead they chose to adopt various—in some cases academic—styles of realism in depicting American urban and rural scenes. Grant Wood, Reginald Marsh, Guy Pène du Bois, and Charles Sheeler exemplify the realist tendency in different ways. Sheeler and the modernists Charles Demuth and Ralston Crawford were referred to as Precisionists for their sharply defined renderings of machines and architectural forms. Edward Hopper, who studied under Henri, developed an individual style of realism by concentrating on light and form, and avoiding overt social content.

===The American Southwest===
Following the first World War, the completion of the Santa Fe Railroad enabled American settlers to travel across the west, as far as the California coast. New artists&#x27; colonies started growing up around Santa Fe and Taos, the artists&#x27; primary subject matter being the native people and landscapes of the Southwest.

Images of the Southwest became a popular form of advertising, used most significantly by the Santa Fe Railroad to entice settlers to come west and enjoy the &quot;unsullied landscapes.&quot; Walter Ufer, Bert Geer Phillips, E. Irving Couse, William Henry Jackson, Marsden Hartley, Andrew Dasburg, and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe were some of the more prolific artists of the Southwest. Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, who was born in the late 19th century, became known for her paintings featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of New Mexico as seen in &quot;Ram&#x27;s Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills&quot;. O&#x27;Keeffe visited the Southwest in 1929 and moved there permanently in 1949; she lived and painted there until she died in 1986.

===Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s)===

The Harlem Renaissance was another significant development in American art. In the 1920s and 30s a new generation of educated and politically astute African-American men and women emerged who sponsored literary societies and art and industrial exhibitions to combat racist stereotypes. The movement, which showcased the range of talents within African-American communities, included artists from across America, but was centered in Harlem. The work of the Harlem painter and graphic artist Aaron Douglas and the photographer James VanDerZee became emblematic of the movement. Artists associated with the Harlem Renaissance include Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, Charles Alston, Augusta Savage, Archibald Motley, Lois Mailou Jones, Palmer Hayden and Sargent Johnson.

===New Deal art (1930s)===

When the Great Depression worsened, president Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal created several public arts programs. The purpose of the programs was to give work to artists and decorate public buildings, usually with a national theme. The first of these projects, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), was created after successful lobbying by the unemployed artists of the Artists Union. The PWAP lasted less than one year, and produced nearly 15,000 works of art. It was followed by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (FAP/WPA) in 1935, which funded some of the most well-known American artists.

The style of much of the public art commissioned by the WPA was influenced by the work of Diego Rivera and other artists of the contemporary Mexican muralism movement. Several separate and related movements began and developed during the Great Depression including American scene painting, Regionalism, and Social Realism. Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Grant Wood, Maxine Albro, Ben Shahn, Joseph Stella, Reginald Marsh, Isaac Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Spencer Baird Nichols and Jack Levine were some of the best-known artists.

Not all of the artists who emerged in the years between the wars were Regionalists or Social Realists; Milton Avery&#x27;s paintings, often nearly abstract, had a significant influence on several of the younger artists who would soon become known as Abstract Expressionists. Joseph Cornell, inspired by Surrealism, created boxed assemblages incorporating found objects and collage.

===Abstract expressionism===

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists formed the first American movement to exert major influence internationally: abstract expressionism.
This term, which had first been used in 1919 in Berlin, was used again in 1946 by Robert Coates in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and was taken up by the two major art critics of that time, Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg. It has always been criticized as too large and paradoxical, yet the common definition implies the use of abstract art to express feelings, emotions, what is within the artist, and not what stands without.

The first generation of abstract expressionists included Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, Phillip Guston, Ad Reinhardt, James Brooks, Richard Pousette-Dart, William Baziotes, Mark Tobey, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Theodoros Stamos, Jack Tworkov, Wilhelmina Weber Furlong, David Smith, and Hans Hofmann, among others. Milton Avery, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, Tony Smith, Morris Graves and others were also related, important and influential artists during that period.

Though the numerous artists encompassed by this label had widely different styles, contemporary critics found several common points between them. Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, Hofmann, Motherwell, Gottlieb, Rothko, Still, Guston, and others were an American painters associated with the abstract expressionist movement and in most cases Action painting (as seen in Kline&#x27;s &quot;Painting Number 2&quot;, 1954); as part of the New York School in the 1940s and 1950s.

Many first generation abstract expressionists were influenced both by the Cubists&#x27; works (which they knew from photographs in art reviews and by seeing the works at the 291 Gallery or the Armory Show), by the European Surrealists, and by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and Henri Matisse as well as the Americans Milton Avery, John D. Graham, and Hans Hofmann. Most of them abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects. Often the abstract expressionists decided to try instinctual, intuitive, spontaneous arrangements of space, line, shape and color. Abstract Expressionism can be characterized by two major elements: the large size of the canvases used (partially inspired by Mexican frescoes and the works they made for the WPA in the 1930s), and the strong and unusual use of brushstrokes and experimental paint application with a new understanding of process.

====Color Field painting====
The emphasis and intensification of color and large open expanses of surface were two of the principles applied to the movement called Color Field painting. Ad Reinhardt, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman were categorized as such. Another movement was called Action Painting, characterized by spontaneous reaction, powerful brushstrokes, dripped and splashed paint and the strong physical movements used in the production of a painting. Jackson Pollock is an example of an Action Painter: his &quot;creative process&quot;, incorporating thrown and dripped paint from a stick or poured directly from the can, revolutionized painting methods.

Willem de Kooning famously said about Pollock &quot;he broke the ice for the rest of us.&quot; Ironically Pollock&#x27;s large repetitious expanses of linear fields are characteristic of Color Field painting as well, as art critic Michael Fried wrote in his essay for the catalog of &quot;Three American painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella&quot; at the Fogg Art Museum in 1965.
Despite the disagreements between art critics, Abstract Expressionism marks a turning-point in the history of American art: the 1940s and 1950s saw international attention shift from European (Parisian) art, to American (New York) art.

Color field painting continued as a movement in the 1960s, as Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Gene Davis, Helen Frankenthaler, and others sought to make paintings which would eliminate superfluous rhetoric with repetition, stripes and large, flat areas of color.

===After abstract expressionism===

During the 1950s abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as Neo-Dada, Post painterly abstraction, Op Art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, Shaped canvas painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements like Pop Art, the Bay Area Figurative Movement and later in the 1970s Neo-expressionism.

Lyrical Abstraction along with the Fluxus movement and Postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of &quot;Artforum&quot; in 1969) sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of Eva Hesse.

Lyrical Abstraction, Conceptual Art, Postminimalism, Earth Art, Video, Performance art, Installation art, along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field Painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop Art, Photorealism and New Realism extended the boundaries of Contemporary Art in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with Color Field Painting and Abstract Expressionism, especially in the freewheeling usage of paint texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting. However the styles are markedly different.

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s painters as powerful and influential as Adolph Gottlieb, Phillip Guston, Lee Krasner, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Richard Diebenkorn, Josef Albers, Elmer Bischoff, Agnes Martin, Al Held, Sam Francis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Ellsworth Kelly, Morris Louis, Gene Davis, Frank Stella, Joan Mitchell, Friedel Dzubas, Paul Jenkins and younger artists like Brice Marden, Robert Mangold, Sam Gilliam, Sean Scully, Elizabeth Murray, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Ronald Davis, Dan Christensen, Susan Rothenberg, Ross Bleckner, Richard Tuttle, Julian Schnabel, Peter Halley, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Fischl and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Other modern American movements===

Members of the next artistic generation favored a different form of abstraction: works of mixed media. Among them were Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) and Jasper Johns (1930- ), who used photos, newsprint, and discarded objects in their compositions. Pop artists, such as Andy Warhol (1928–1987), Larry Rivers (1923–2002), and Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997), reproduced, with satiric care, everyday objects and images of American popular culture—Coca-Cola bottles, soup cans, comic strips.

Realism has also been continually popular in the United States, despite modernism&#x27;s impact; the realist tendency is evident in the city scenes of Edward Hopper, the rural imagery of Andrew Wyeth, and the illustrations of Norman Rockwell. In certain places Abstract Expressionism never caught on; for example, in Chicago, the dominant art style was grotesque, symbolic realism, as exemplified by the Chicago Imagists Cosmo Campoli (1923–1997), Jim Nutt (1938- ), Ed Paschke (1939–2004), and Nancy Spero (1926–2009).

===Contemporary art into the 21st century===
At the beginning of the 21st century, contemporary art in the United States in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of Cultural pluralism. The &quot;crisis&quot; in painting and current art and current art criticism today is brought about by pluralism. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude that prevails; an &quot;everything going on&quot; syndrome; with no firm and clear direction and yet with every lane on the artistic superhighway filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made in the United States albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

Hard-edge painting, Geometric abstraction, Appropriation, Hyperrealism, Photorealism, Expressionism, Minimalism, Lyrical Abstraction, Pop art, Op art, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Monochrome painting, Neo-expressionism, Collage, Intermedia painting, Assemblage painting, Digital painting, Postmodern painting, Neo-Dada painting, Shaped canvas painting, environmental mural painting, Graffiti, traditional figure painting, Landscape painting, Portrait painting, are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century.

<text>American literature is literature written or produced in the United States and in the colonies that preceded it. The American literary tradition is part of the broader tradition of English-language literature but also includes literature produced in languages other than English.

The American Revolutionary Period (1775–1783) is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson. An early novel is William Hill Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Sympathy&quot;, published in 1791. Writer and critic John Neal in the early- to mid-nineteenth century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture, by criticizing predecessors, such as Washington Irving, for imitating their British counterparts and by influencing writers such as Edgar Allan Poe. Edgar Allan Poe took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. Ralph Waldo Emerson pioneered the influential Transcendentalism movement; Henry David Thoreau, author of &quot;Walden&quot;, was influenced by this movement. The conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired writers, like Harriet Beecher Stowe, and authors of slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass. Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851). Major American poets of the nineteenth century include Walt Whitman, Melville, and Emily Dickinson. Mark Twain was the first major American writer to be born in the West. Henry James achieved international recognition with novels like &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881).

Following World War I, modernist literature rejected nineteenth-century forms and values. F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the carefree mood of the 1920s, but John Dos Passos and Ernest Hemingway, who became famous with &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, and William Faulkner, adopted experimental forms. American modernist poets included diverse figures such as Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Ezra Pound, and E. E. Cummings. Depression-era writers included John Steinbeck, author of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939). America&#x27;s involvement in World War II led to works such as Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1948), Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969). Prominent playwrights of these years include Eugene O&#x27;Neill, who won a Nobel Prize. In the mid-twentieth century, drama was dominated by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. Musical theater was also prominent.

In late 20th century and early 21st century, there has been increased popular and academic acceptance of literature written by immigrant, ethnic, and LGBT writers, and of writings in languages other than English.
Examples of pioneers in these areas include LGBT author Michael Cunningham, Asian American authors Maxine Hong Kingston and Ocean Vuong, and African Americans authors such as Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison. In 2016, the folk-rock songwriter Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Native American literature ==
=== Oral literature ===
Oral literature and storytelling has existed among the various Indigenous tribes, prior to the arrival of European colonists. The traditional territories of some tribes traverse national boundaries and such literature is not homogeneous but reflects the different cultures of these peoples.

=== Published books ===
In 1771 the first work by a Native American in English, &quot;A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul, an Indian&quot;, by Samson Occom, from the Mohegan tribe, was published and went through 19 editions. &quot;The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta&quot; (1854) by John Rollin Ridge (Cherokee, 1827–67) was the first novel by a Native American, and &quot;O-gi-maw-kwe Mit-I-gwa-ki&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Woods&quot;) (1899) by Simon Pokagon (Potawatomi, 1830–99) was &quot;the first Native American novel devoted to the subject of Indian life&quot;.

A significant event in the development of Native American literature in English came with the awarding of the Pulitzer Prize in 1969 to N. Scott Momaday (Kiowa tribe) for his novel &quot;House Made of Dawn&quot; (1968).

==Colonial literature==

The Thirteen Colonies have often been regarded as the center of early American literature. However, the first European settlements in North America had been founded elsewhere, many years earlier. The first item printed in Pennsylvania was in German and was the largest book printed in any of the colonies before the American Revolution. Spanish and French had two of the strongest colonial literary traditions in the areas that now comprise the United States. Moreover, a wealth of oral literary traditions existed on the continent among the numerous different Native American tribes. However, with the onset of English settlement of North America, the English language established a foothold in North America that would spread with the growth of England&#x27;s political influence in the continent and the continued arrival of settlers from the British Isles. This included the English capture of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1664, with the English renaming it New York and changing the administrative language from Dutch to English.

From 1696 to 1700, only about 250 separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the American colonies. This is a small number, compared to the output of the printers in London at the time. London printers published materials written by New England authors, so, the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.

Some American literature of the time consisted of pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a European and colonial audience. Captain John Smith could be considered the first American author with his works &quot;A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as Hath Happened in Virginia ...&quot; (1608) and &quot;The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles&quot; (1624). Other writers of this genre included Daniel Denton, Thomas Ashe, William Penn, George Percy, William Strachey, Daniel Coxe, Gabriel Thomas, and John Lawson.

===Topics of early prose===

The religious disputes that prompted settlement in America were important topics of early American literature. A journal written by John Winthrop, &quot;The History of New England&quot;, discussed the religious foundations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Edward Winslow also recorded a diary of the first years after the &quot;Mayflower&#x27;s&quot; arrival. &quot;A modell of Christian Charity&quot; by John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts, was a Sermon preached on the &quot;Arbella&quot; (the flagship of the Winthrop Fleet) in 1630. This work outlined the ideal society that he and the other Separatists would build, in an attempt to realize a &quot;Puritan utopia&quot;. Other religious writers included Increase Mather and William Bradford, author of the journal published as a &quot;History of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–47&quot;. Others like Roger Williams and Nathaniel Ward more fiercely argued state and church separation. Others, such as Thomas Morton, cared little for the church; Morton&#x27;s &quot;The New English Canaan&quot; mocked the Puritans and declared that the local Native Americans were better people than them.

Other late writings described conflicts and interaction with the Indians, as seen in writings by Daniel Gookin, Alexander Whitaker, John Mason, Benjamin Church, and Daniel J. Tan. John Eliot translated the Bible into the Algonquin language (1663) as &quot;Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God&quot;. It was the first complete Bible printed in the Western hemisphere; Stephen Daye printed 1,000 copies on the first printing press in the American colonies.

Of the second generation of New England settlers, Cotton Mather stands out as a theologian and historian, who wrote the history of the colonies with a view to God&#x27;s activity in their midst and to connecting the Puritan leaders with the great heroes of the Christian faith. His best-known works include the &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot; (1702), the &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; and &quot;The Biblia Americana&quot;.

Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield represented the Great Awakening, a religious revival in the early 18th century that emphasized Calvinist thought. Other Puritan and religious writers include Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, John Wise, and Samuel Willard. Less strict and serious writers included Samuel Sewall (who wrote a diary revealing the daily life of the late 17th century), and Sarah Kemble Knight (who likewise wrote a diary).

New England was not the only area in the colonies with a literature: southern literature was also growing at this time. The diary of planter William Byrd and his &quot;The History of the Dividing Line&quot; (1728) described the expedition to survey the swamp between Virginia and North Carolina but also comments on the differences between American Indians and the white settlers in the area. In a similar book, &quot;Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West&quot;, William Bartram described the Southern landscape and the Indian tribes he encountered; Bartram&#x27;s book was popular in Europe, being translated into German, French and Dutch.

As the colonies moved toward independence from Britain, an important discussion of American culture and identity came from the French immigrant J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, whose &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot; (1782) addresses the question &quot;What is an American?&quot;, by moving between praise for the opportunities and peace offered in the new society and recognition that the solid life of the farmer must rest, uneasily, between the oppressive aspects of the urban life and the lawless aspects of the frontier, where the lack of social structures leads to the loss of civilized living.

This same period saw the beginning of African-American literature, through the poet Phillis Wheatley and the slave narrative of Olaudah Equiano, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot; (1789). At this time, American Indian literature also began to flourish. Samson Occom published his &quot;A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul&quot; and a popular hymnbook, &quot;Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot;, &quot;the first Indian best-seller&quot;.

===Revolutionary period===

The Revolutionary period also contained political writings, including those by colonists Samuel Adams, Josiah Quincy, John Dickinson, and Joseph Galloway, the last being a loyalist to the crown. Two key figures were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; and &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot; are esteemed works, with their wit and influence toward the formation of a budding American identity. Paine&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The American Crisis&quot; writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the time.

During the Revolutionary War, poems and songs such as &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; were popular. Major satirists included John Trumbull and Francis Hopkinson. Philip Morin Freneau also wrote poems about the War.

During the 18th century, writing shifted from the Puritanism of Winthrop and Bradford to Enlightenment ideas of reason. The belief that human and natural occurrences were messages from God no longer fit with the budding anthropocentric culture. Many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through the laws of physics, as described by Isaac Newton. One of these was Cotton Mather. The first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Mather&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Philosopher&quot; (1721). The enormous scientific, economic, social, and philosophical, changes of the 18th century, called the Enlightenment, impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture, making way for democratic principles. The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life, as seen in the literature of this time. In 1670, the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111,000. Thirty years later, it was more than 250,000. By 1760, it reached 1,600,000. The growth of communities, and therefore social life, led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies. These new ideas can be seen in the popularity of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

Even earlier than Franklin was Cadwallader Colden (1689–1776), whose book &quot;The History of the Five Indian Nations&quot;, published in 1727 was one of the first texts published on Iroquois history. Colden also wrote a book on botany, which attracted the attention of Carl Linnaeus, and he maintained a long term correspondence with Benjamin Franklin.

==Post-independence==
In the post-war period, Thomas Jefferson established his place in American literature through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, his influence on the U.S. Constitution, his autobiography, his Notes on the State of Virginia, and his many letters. The Federalist essays by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay presented a significant historical discussion of American government organization and republican values. Fisher Ames, James Otis, and Patrick Henry are also valued for their political writings and orations.

Early American literature struggled to find a unique voice in existing literary genre, and this tendency was reflected in novels. European styles were frequently imitated, but critics usually considered the imitations inferior.

=== The first American novel ===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the first American novels were published. These fictions were too lengthy to be printed for public reading. Publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted. This scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time. Among the first American novels are Thomas Attwood Digges&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Alonso&quot;, published in London in 1775 and William Hill Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Sympathy&quot; published in 1789. Brown&#x27;s novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related.

In the next decade, important women writers also published novels. Susanna Rowson is best known for her novel &quot;Charlotte: A Tale of Truth&quot;, published in London in 1791. In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot;. &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs. Reaching more than a million and a half readers over a century and a half, &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; often is criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.

Hannah Webster Foster&#x27;s &quot;The Coquette: Or, the History of Eliza Wharton&quot; was published in 1797 and was extremely popular. Told from Foster&#x27;s point of view and based on the real life of Eliza Whitman, the novel is about a woman who is seduced and abandoned. Eliza is a &quot;coquette&quot; who is courted by two very different men: a clergyman who offers her a comfortable domestic life and a noted libertine. Unable to choose between them, she finds herself single when both men get married. She eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn. &quot;The Coquette&quot; is praised for its demonstration of the era&#x27;s contradictory ideas of womanhood. even as it has been criticized for delegitimizing protest against women&#x27;s subordination.
Both &quot;The Coquette&quot; and &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment. These novels are of the sentimental genre, characterized by overindulgence in emotion, an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions, as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity. Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature.
While many of these novels were popular, the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone.

Charles Brockden Brown is the earliest American novelist whose works are still commonly read. He published &quot;Wieland&quot; in 1798, and in 1799 published &quot;Ormond&quot;, &quot;Edgar Huntly&quot;, and &quot;Arthur Mervyn&quot;. These novels are of the Gothic genre.

The first writer to be able to support himself through the income generated by his publications alone was Washington Irving. He completed his first major book in 1809 titled &quot;A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty&quot;.

Of the picaresque genre, Hugh Henry Brackenridge published &quot;Modern Chivalry&quot; in 1792–1815; Tabitha Gilman Tenney wrote &quot;Female Quixotism: Exhibited in the Romantic Opinions and Extravagant Adventure of Dorcasina Sheldon&quot; in 1801; Royall Tyler wrote &quot;The Algerine Captive&quot; in 1797.

Other notable authors include William Gilmore Simms, who wrote &quot;Martin Faber&quot; in 1833, &quot;Guy Rivers&quot; in 1834, and &quot;The Yemassee&quot; in 1835. Lydia Maria Child wrote &quot;Hobomok&quot; in 1824 and &quot;The Rebels&quot; in 1825. John Neal wrote &quot;Keep Cool&quot; in 1817, &quot;Logan&quot; in 1822, &quot;Seventy-Six&quot; in 1823, &quot;Randolph&quot; in 1823, &quot;Errata&quot; in 1823, &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; in 1825, and &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (earliest use of the Salem witch trials as the basis for a novel) in 1828. Catherine Maria Sedgwick wrote &quot;A New England Tale&quot; in 1822, &quot;Redwood&quot; in 1824, &quot;Hope Leslie&quot; in 1827, and &quot;The Linwoods&quot; in 1835. James Kirke Paulding wrote &quot;The Lion of the West&quot; in 1830, &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Fireside&quot; in 1831, and &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; in 1832. Omar ibn Said, a Muslim slave in the Carolinas, wrote an autobiography in Arabic in 1831, considered an early example of African-American literature. Robert Montgomery Bird wrote &quot;Calavar&quot; in 1834 and &quot;Nick of the Woods&quot; in 1837. James Fenimore Cooper was a notable author best known for his novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; written in 1826. George Tucker produced in 1824 the first fiction of Virginia colonial life with &quot;The Valley of Shenandoah&quot;. He followed in 1827 with one of the country&#x27;s first science fictions: &quot;A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians&quot;.

==19th century – Unique American style==

After the war with Britain in 1812, there was an increasing desire to produce a uniquely American literature and culture. Literary figures who took up the cause included Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, and James Fenimore Cooper. Irving wrote humorous works in &quot;Salmagundi&quot; and the satire &quot;A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker&quot; (1809). Bryant wrote early romantic and nature-inspired poetry, which evolved away from their European origins. Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; about Natty Bumppo (which includes &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, 1826) treated uniquely American material in ways that were popular both in the new country and Europe.

John Neal as a critic played a key role in developing American literary nationalism. Neal criticized Irving and Cooper for relying on old British conventions of authorship to frame American phenomena, arguing that &quot;to succeed ... [the American writer] must resemble nobody ... [he] must be unlike all that have gone before [him]&quot; and issue &quot;another Declaration of Independence, in the great Republic of Letters.&quot; As a pioneer of the literary device he referred to &quot;natural writing&quot;, Neal was &quot;the first in America to be natural in his diction&quot; and his work represents &quot;the first deviation from ... Irvingesque graciousness.&quot;

Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston but raised in Virginia and identified with the South. In 1832, he began writing short stories, such as &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;, &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, that explore hidden depths of human psychology and push the boundaries of fiction. Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, is seen as the first detective story.

Humorous writers were also popular and included Seba Smith and Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber in New England and Davy Crockett, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, Johnson J. Hooper, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, and George Washington Harris writing about the American frontier.

In New England, a group of writers known as Boston Brahmins included James Russell Lowell, then in later years Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.
In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who had renounced his ministry, published his essay &quot;Nature&quot;, which argued that men should dispense with organized religion and reach a lofty spiritual state by studying and interacting with the natural world. He expanded his influence with his lecture &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, delivered in Cambridge in 1837, which called upon Americans to create a uniquely American writing style. Both the nation and the individual should declare independence. Emerson&#x27;s influence fostered the movement now known as Transcendentalism. Among the leaders was Emerson&#x27;s friend, Henry David Thoreau, a nonconformist and critic of American commercial culture. After living mostly by himself for two years in a nearby cabin by a wooded pond, Thoreau wrote &quot;Walden&quot; (1854), a memoir that urges resistance to the dictates of society. Other Transcendentalists included Amos Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, Orestes Brownson, and Jones Very.

As one of the great works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman, so too was a work about America from this generation. Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835 and 1840) described his travels through the young nation, making observations about the relations between American politics, individualism, and community.

The political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and his paper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, along with poet John Greenleaf Whittier and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her world-famous &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852). These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography.
In 1837, the young Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804–1864) collected some of his stories as &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;, a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents. Hawthorne went on to write full-length &quot;romances&quot;, quasi-allegorical novels that explore the themes of guilt, pride, and emotional repression. His masterpiece, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850), is a drama, set in Puritan Massachusetts, about a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery with a minister who refuses to acknowledge his own sin.

Herman Melville (1819–1891) made a name for himself with &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot;, adventure tales based loosely on his own life at sea and jumping ship to live among South Sea natives. Becoming a friend of Hawthorne&#x27;s in 1850, Melville was inspired by his work. &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851) became not only an adventure tale about the pursuit of a white whale, but also an exploration of obsession, the nature of evil, and human struggle against the elements. It was a critical and commercial failure, as were his subsequent novels. He turned to poetry and did not return to fiction until the short novel &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor&quot;, which he left unfinished at his death in 1891. In it, Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war. His more profound books sold poorly, and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death. He was rediscovered in the 1920s.

Anti-transcendental works from Melville, Hawthorne, and Poe all comprise the Dark romanticism sub-genre of popular literature at this time.

===Ethnic writers===
Slave narrative autobiography from this period include Frederick Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot; (1845) and Harriet Jacobs&#x27;s &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; (1861). At this time, American Indian autobiography develops, most notably in William Apess&#x27;s &quot;A Son of the Forest&quot; (1829) and George Copway&#x27;s &quot;The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh&quot; (1847). Moreover, minority authors were beginning to publish fiction, as in William Wells Brown&#x27;s &quot;Clotel; or, The President&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1853), Frank J. Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Garies and Their Friends&quot;, (1857) Martin Delany&#x27;s &quot;Blake; or, The Huts of America&quot; (1859–62) and Harriet E. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Our Nig: Sketches from the Life of a Free Black&quot; (1859) as early African-American novels, and John Rollin Ridge&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta&quot; (1854), which is considered the first American Indian novel but is also an early story that talks about Mexican-American issues.

==Late 19th century Realist fiction==
Mark Twain (the pen name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was among the first major American writers to be born away from the East Coast – in the border state of Missouri. His regional masterpieces were the memoir &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; and the novels &quot;Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884). Twain&#x27;s style – influenced by journalism, wedded to the vernacular, direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous – changed the way Americans write their language. His characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents.

Other writers interested in regional differences and dialect were George W. Cable, Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler Harris, Mary Noailles Murfree (Charles Egbert Craddock), Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Henry Cuyler Bunner, and William Sydney Porter (O. Henry). A version of local color regionalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of Charles W. Chesnutt (writing about African Americans), of María Ruiz de Burton, one of the earliest Mexican-American novelists to write in English, and in the Yiddish-inflected works of Abraham Cahan.

William Dean Howells also represented the realist tradition through his novels, including &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; (1885) and his work as editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

Henry James (1843–1916) confronted the Old World-New World dilemma by writing directly about it. Although he was born in New York City, James spent most of his adult life in England. Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe. With its intricate, highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance. His masterpieces include &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1880), &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881), &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1886), &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1902), &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1903), and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1904). 

Stephen Crane (1871–1900), best known for his Civil War novel &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1895), depicted the life of New York City prostitutes in &quot;&quot; (1893). And in &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; (1900), Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945) portrayed a country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman. Frank Norris&#x27;s (1870–1902) fiction was predominantly in the naturalist genre. His notable works include &quot;McTeague: A Story of San Francisco&quot; (1899), &quot;The Octopus: A Story of California&quot; (1901) and &quot;The Pit&quot; (1903). Norris along with Hamlin Garland (1860–1940) wrote about the problems of American farmers and other social issues from a naturalist perspective. Garland is best known for his fiction involving hard-working Midwestern farmers. (&quot;Main-Travelled Roads&quot; (1891), &quot;Prairie Folks&quot; (1892), &quot;Jason Edwards&quot; (1892).)

===Social novel===
Edward Bellamy&#x27;s utopian novel &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1888) was concerned with political and social issues.

==20th century prose==
At the beginning of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass a broader range of experiences, and sometimes connected these to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up. &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1920) centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.

Social issues and the power of corporations was the central concern of some writers at this time. Upton Sinclair (1878–1968), most famous for his muckraking novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906), advocated socialism. Jack London (1876–1916) was also very committed to social justice and socialism through some of his books as &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; or &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot;. Other political writers of the period included Edwin Markham (1852–1940) and William Vaughn Moody. Journalistic critics, including Ida M. Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens, were labeled &quot;The Muckrakers&quot;. Henry Brooks Adams&#x27;s literate autobiography, &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; (1907) also depicted a stinging description of the education system and modern life.

Race was a common issue as well, as seen in the work of Pauline Hopkins, who published five influential works from 1900 to 1903. Similarly, Sui Sin Far wrote about Chinese-American experiences, and Maria Cristina Mena wrote about Mexican-American experiences.

Prominent among mid-western and western American writers were Willa Cather (1873–1947) and Wallace Stegner (1909–1993), both of whom had a major opus set largely in their regions.

===1920s===
Experimentation in style and form soon joined the new latitudes in subject matter. In 1909, Gertrude Stein (1874–1946), by then an expatriate in Paris, published &quot;Three Lives&quot;, an innovative work influenced by her familiarity with cubism, jazz, and other movements in contemporary art and music. Stein labeled a group of expatriate literary figures who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; a term later used as by Ernest Hemingway.

The 1920s brought sharp changes to American literature. Many writers had direct experience of the First World War, and they used it to frame their writings. Writers like Henry James, Gertrude Stein, and poets Ezra Pound, H.D. and T. S. Eliot demonstrate the growth of an international perspective in American literature. American writers had long looked to European models for inspiration, but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid-19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes, writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene, not as imitators but as equals. Something similar was happening back in the States, as Jewish writers (such as Abraham Cahan) used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience.
The period of peace and debt-fueled economic expansion that followed WWI was the setting for many of the stories and novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940). Fitzgerald&#x27;s work captured the restless, pleasure-hungry, defiant mood of the 1920s, a decade he named the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald&#x27;s characteristic theme, expressed poignantly in his masterpiece &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, is the tendency of youth&#x27;s golden dreams to dissolve in failure and disappointment. Fitzgerald also dwells on the collapse of long-held American Ideals, such as liberty, social unity, good governance and peace, features which were severely threatened by the pressures of modern early 20th century society. Sinclair Lewis and Sherwood Anderson also wrote novels with critical depictions of American life. John Dos Passos wrote a famous anti-war novel, &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, describing scenes of blind hatred, stupidity, and criminality; and the suffocating regimentation of army life. He also wrote about the war in the U.S.A. trilogy which extended into the Depression. Experimental in form, the U.S.A. trilogy weaves together various narrative strands, which alternate with contemporary news reports, snatches of the author&#x27;s autobiography, and capsule biographies of public figures including Eugene Debs, Robert La Follette and Isadora Duncan.

Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), once labelled the &quot;brightest talent of the modern American epoch,&quot; was most famous for his production of short stories and novels such as &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;A Farewell to Arms.&quot; In contrast to writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway is regarded as the predecessor of literary minimalism, and preferred to write using short prose, avoiding the usage of adverbs and adjectives wherever possible. Hemingway&#x27;s adoption of this minimalist style came as a result of his time working as a journalist at the Kansas City Star. In 1954, Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, and has persisted as one of the most influential writers, both culturally and stylistically, to have emerged from early 20th-Century America.

William Faulkner (1897–1962) won the Nobel Prize in 1949. Faulkner encompassed a wide range of humanity in Yoknapatawpha County, a Mississippian region of his own invention. He recorded his characters&#x27; seemingly unedited ramblings to represent their inner states, a technique called &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;. He also jumbled time sequences to show how the past – especially the slave-holding era of the Deep South – endures in the present. Among his great works are &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, and &quot;Light in August&quot;.

===1930s – Depression-era===

Depression era literature offered blunt, direct social criticism. John Steinbeck (1902–1968) set many of his stories in Salinas, California, where he was born. His style was simple and evocative, winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics. His poor, working-class characters struggled to lead a decent and honest life. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939), considered his masterpiece, is a strong, socially-oriented novel of the Joads, a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a better life. Other of his popular novels include &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, and &quot;East of Eden&quot;. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962.

In his short life, Nathanael West produced two short novels that later came to be considered classics. &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; plumbs the life of reluctant (and, to comic effect, male) advice columnist who cannot deal with the tragic letters he receives. &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; satirizes Hollywood stereotypes and the dark ironies of Hollywood life.

In non-fiction, James Agee&#x27;s &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot; observes and depicts the lives of three struggling tenant-farming families in Alabama in 1936. Combining factual reporting with poetic beauty, Agee presented an accurate and detailed report of what he had seen coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience. In doing so, he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the American population.

Henry Miller&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novels of sexual exploration, written and published in Paris, were deemed pornographic and officially banned from the United States until 1962. By then, the themes and stylistic innovations in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (1934) and &quot;Black Spring&quot; had already set an example that paved the way for sexually frank novels of personal experience of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Post-World War II fiction==

===Novel===
The period was dominated by the last few of the realistic modernists, the wildly Romantic beatniks, and explorations of personal, racial, and ethnic themes.

World War II was the subject of several major novels: Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1948), Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969). While the Korean war was a source of trauma for the protagonist of &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; (1962), by Southern author Walker Percy, winner of the National Book Award; his attempt at exploring &quot;the dislocation of man in the modern age.&quot;

Though born in Canada, Chicago raised Saul Bellow became one of the most influential American writers. Works like &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; (1953) and &quot;Herzog&quot; (1964), Bellow painted vivid portraits of Jewish life in America that opened the way for further work. He was honored by the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976. Other noteworthy novels are J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (1951), Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1963), and Russian-American Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955). The highly popular &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960) by Harper Lee was a less intense novel of racial inequality and white responsibility.

The 1950s poetry and fiction of the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; developed, initially from a New York circle of intellectuals and then established more officially later in San Francisco. The term &quot;Beat&quot; referred to the countercultural rhythm of the Jazz scene, to a sense of rebellion regarding the conservative stress of post-war society, and to an interest in new forms of spiritual experience through drugs, alcohol, philosophy, and religion (specifically Zen Buddhism). Allen Ginsberg set the tone with his Whitmanesque poem &quot;Howl&quot; (1956), a work that begins: &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness&quot;. Among the achievements of the Beats, in the novel, are Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957), the chronicle of a soul-searching travel through the continent, and William S. Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1959), a more experimental work structured as a series of vignettes relating, among other things, the narrator&#x27;s travels and experiments with hard drugs.


In contrast, John Updike approached American life from a more reflective but no less subversive perspective. His 1960 novel &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;, the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the American middle class and frank discussion of taboo topics such as adultery. Notable among Updike&#x27;s characteristic innovations was his use of present-tense narration, his rich, stylized language, and his attention to sensual detail. His work is also deeply imbued with Christian themes. The two final installments of the Rabbit series, &quot;Rabbit is Rich&quot; (1981) and &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot; (1990), were both awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Other notable works include the Henry Bech novels (1970–98), &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1984), &quot;Roger&#x27;s Version&quot; (1986) and &quot;In the Beauty of the Lilies&quot; (1996), which literary critic Michiko Kakutani called &quot;arguably his finest&quot;.

Frequently linked with Updike is the novelist Philip Roth. Roth vigorously explores Jewish identity in American society, especially in the postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in Newark, New Jersey, Roth&#x27;s work is known to be highly autobiographical, and many of Roth&#x27;s main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman, are thought to be alter egos of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1969), and &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel &quot;American Pastoral&quot; (1997).

In the realm of African-American literature, Ralph Ellison&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot; was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post-war years. The story of a black Underground Man in the urban north, the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an existential character study. Richard Wright was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story, &quot;The Man Who Was Almost a Man&quot; (1939), and his controversial second novel, &quot;Native Son&quot; (1940), and his legacy was cemented by the 1945 publication of &quot;Black Boy&quot;, a work in which Wright drew on his childhood and mostly autodidactic education in the segregated South, fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit. Because of its polemical themes and Wright&#x27;s involvement with the Communist Party, the novel&#x27;s final part, &quot;American Hunger&quot;, was not published until 1977.

Perhaps the most ambitious and challenging post-war American novelist was William Gaddis, whose uncompromising, satiric, and large novels, such as &quot;The Recognitions&quot; (1955) and &quot;J R&quot; (1975) are presented largely in terms of unattributed dialog that requires almost unexampled reader participation. Gaddis&#x27;s primary themes include forgery, capitalism, religious zealotry, and the legal system, constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of modern American life. Gaddis&#x27;s work, though largely ignored for years, anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious &quot;postmodern&quot; fiction writers as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Joseph McElroy, William H. Gass, and Don DeLillo. Another neglected and challenging postwar American novelist, albeit one who wrote much shorter works, was John Hawkes, whose surreal visionary fiction addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with narrative voice and style. Among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel &quot;The Lime Twig&quot; (1961).

===Short fiction===

In the postwar period, the art of the short story again flourished. Among its most respected practitioners was Flannery O&#x27;Connor, who developed a distinctive Southern gothic esthetic in which characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols. A devout Catholic, O&#x27;Connor often imbued her stories, among them the widely studied &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot; and &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot;, and two novels, &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1952); &quot;The Violent Bear It Away&quot; (1960), with deeply religious themes, focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age. Other important practitioners of the form include Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff, and the more experimental Donald Barthelme.

=== Literary non-fiction ===
Major American essayists of the 20th century included writers such as James Baldwin, Gore Vidal, Susan Sontag, Flannery O&#x27;Connor and Joan Didion.

==Contemporary fiction==

Though its exact parameters remain disputable, from the early 1990s to the present day the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive commingling of high and low culture. In 1973, he published &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, &quot;V.&quot; (1963), &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; (1966), &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; (1997), and &quot;Against the Day&quot; (2006).

Toni Morrison, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, writing in a distinctive lyrical prose style, published her controversial debut novel, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, to critical acclaim in 1970. Coming on the heels of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, the novel, widely studied in American schools, includes an elaborate description of incestuous rape and explores the conventions of beauty established by a historically racist society, painting a portrait of a self-immolating black family in search of beauty in whiteness. Since then, Morrison has experimented with lyric fantasy, as in her two best-known later works, &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1977) and &quot;Beloved&quot; (1987), for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; along these lines, critic Harold Bloom has drawn favorable comparisons to Virginia Woolf, and the Nobel committee to &quot;Faulkner and to the Latin American tradition [of magical realism].&quot; &quot;Beloved&quot; was chosen in a 2006 survey conducted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years.
Writing in a lyrical, flowing style that eschews excessive use of the comma and semicolon, recalling William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway in equal measure, Cormac McCarthy seizes on the literary traditions of several regions of the United States and includes multiple genres. He writes in the Southern Gothic aesthetic in his Faulknerian 1965 debut, &quot;The Orchard Keeper&quot;, and &quot;Suttree&quot; (1979); in the Epic Western tradition, with grotesquely drawn characters and symbolic narrative turns reminiscent of Melville, in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (1985), which Harold Bloom styled &quot;the greatest single book since Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;&quot;, calling the character of Judge Holden &quot;short of Moby Dick, the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature&quot;; in a much more pastoral tone in his celebrated Border Trilogy (1992–98) of &quot;bildungsromans&quot;, including &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; (1992), winner of the National Book Award; and in the post-apocalyptic genre in the Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Road&quot; (2007). His novels are noted for achieving both commercial and critical success, several of his works having been adapted to film.

Don DeLillo, who rose to literary prominence with the publication of his 1985 novel, &quot;White Noise&quot;, a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with &quot;Americana&quot;. He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon. His 1997 novel &quot;Underworld&quot; chronicles American life through and immediately after the Cold War and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years. Among his other important novels are &quot;Libra&quot; (1988), &quot;Mao II&quot; (1991) and &quot;Falling Man&quot; (2007).
Seizing on the distinctly postmodern techniques of digression, narrative fragmentation and elaborate symbolism, and strongly influenced by the works of Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace began his writing career with &quot;The Broom of the System&quot;, published to moderate acclaim in 1987. His second novel, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996), a futuristic portrait of America and a playful critique of the media-saturated nature of American life, has been consistently ranked among the most important works of the 20th century, and his final novel, unfinished at the time of his death, &quot;The Pale King&quot; (2011), has garnered much praise and attention. In addition to his novels, he also authored three acclaimed short story collections: &quot;Girl with Curious Hair&quot; (1989), &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot; (1999) and &quot;&quot; (2004). Jonathan Franzen, Wallace&#x27;s friend and contemporary, rose to prominence after the 2001 publication of his National Book Award-winning third novel, &quot;The Corrections&quot;. He began his writing career in 1988 with the well-received &quot;The Twenty-Seventh City&quot;, a novel centering on his native St. Louis, but did not gain national attention until the publication of his essay, &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;, in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, discussing the cultural role of the writer in the new millennium through the prism of his own frustrations. &quot;The Corrections&quot;, a tragicomedy about the disintegrating Lambert family, has been called &quot;the literary phenomenon of [its] decade&quot; and was ranked as one of the greatest novels of the past century. In 2010, he published &quot;Freedom&quot; to great critical acclaim.

Other notable writers at the turn of the century include Michael Chabon, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; (2000) tells the story of two friends, Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, as they rise through the ranks of the comics industry in its heyday; Denis Johnson, whose 2007 novel &quot;Tree of Smoke&quot; about falsified intelligence during Vietnam both won the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was called by critic Michiko Kakutani &quot;one of the classic works of literature produced by [the Vietnam War]&quot;; and Louise Erdrich, whose 2008 novel &quot;The Plague of Doves&quot;, a distinctly Faulknerian, polyphonic examination of the tribal experience set against the backdrop of murder in the fictional town of Pluto, North Dakota, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and her 2012 novel &quot;The Round House&quot;, which builds on the same themes, was awarded the 2012 National Book Award.

===Autofiction===

Autofiction is a literary movement that has gained steam in American literature throughout the 21st century. Coined in 1977 by French author Serge Doubrovsky, the autofictional subgenre blends autobiography and fiction, thereby allowing authors to go beyond the limitations of form and substance imposed by these genres. A well-established term in the French literary world, it has been less discussed in American literary criticism, despite the recent proliferation of such novels.

Of the autofiction genre, English professor Bran Nicol states: American autofiction is best regarded less as a form which interrogates the complex workings of memory and their effect on subjectivity and more as evidence of the preoccupation with the conditions of authorship, especially institutional, which has characterized American writing in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Notable American authors known to have written in the autofiction genre include Bret Easton Ellis, Sheila Heti, Maggie Nelson, Chris Kraus, and Ben Lerner

==Poetry==

Puritan poetry was highly religious, and one of the earliest books of poetry published was the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot; (1640), a set of translations of the biblical Psalms; however, the translators&#x27; intention was not to create literature, but to create hymns that could be used in worship. Among lyric poets, the most important figures are Anne Bradstreet, who wrote personal poems about her family and homelife; pastor Edward Taylor, whose best poems, the &quot;Preparatory Meditations&quot;, were written to help him prepare for leading worship; and Michael Wigglesworth, whose best-selling poem, &quot;The Day of Doom&quot; (1660), describes the time of judgment. It was published in the same year that anti-Puritan Charles II was restored to the British throne. He followed it two years later with &quot;God&#x27;s Controversy With New England&quot;. Nicholas Noyes was also known for his doggerel verse.

===18th century===
The 18th century saw an increasing emphasis on America itself as fit subject matter for its poets. This trend is most evident in the works of Philip Freneau (1752–1832), who is also notable for the unusually sympathetic attitude to Native Americans, which was reflective of his skepticism toward American culture. However, this late colonial-era poetry generally was influenced by contemporary poetry in Europe. The work of Rebecca Hammond Lard (1772–1855), is still relevant today, writing about the environment as well as also human nature.

===19th century===

The Fireside Poets (also known as the Schoolroom or Household Poets) were some of America&#x27;s first major poets domestically and internationally. They were known for their poems being easy to memorize due to their general adherence to poetic form (standard forms, regular meter, and rhymed stanzas) and were often recited in the home (hence the name) as well as in school (such as &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;), as well as working with distinctly American themes, including some political issues such as abolition. They included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Longfellow achieved the highest level of acclaim and is often considered the first internationally acclaimed American poet, being the first American poet given a bust in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner.

Walt Whitman (1819–1892) and Emily Dickinson (1830–1886), two of America&#x27;s greatest 19th-century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style. Walt Whitman was a working man, a traveler, a self-appointed nurse during the American Civil War (1861–1865), and a poetic innovator. His magnum opus was &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of American democracy. Taking that motif one step further, the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being egotistical. For example, in &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, the long, central poem in &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, Whitman writes: &quot;These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me&quot;.

In his words Whitman was a poet of &quot;the body electric&quot;. In &quot;Studies in Classic American Literature&quot;, the English novelist D. H. Lawrence wrote that Whitman &quot;was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something &#x27;superior&#x27; and &#x27;above&#x27; the flesh.&quot;

By contrast, Emily Dickinson lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small-town Amherst, Massachusetts. Her poetry is ingenious, witty, and penetrating. Her work was unconventional for its day, and little of it was published during her lifetime. Many of her poems dwell on the topic of death, often with a mischievous twist. One, &quot;Because I could not stop for Death&quot;, begins, &quot;He kindly stopped for me&quot;. The opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet: &quot;I&#x27;m nobody! Who are you? / Are you nobody too?&quot;

===20th century===

American poetry arguably reached its peak in the early-to-mid-20th century, with such noted writers as Wallace Stevens and his &quot;Harmonium&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot; (1950), T. S. Eliot and his &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922), Robert Frost and his &quot;North of Boston&quot; (1914) and &quot;New Hampshire&quot; (1923), Hart Crane and his &quot;White Buildings&quot; (1926) and the epic cycle, &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1930), Ezra Pound, &quot;The Cantos&quot; (1917–1969). William Carlos Williams and his epic poem about his New Jersey hometown, &quot;Paterson&quot;, Marianne Moore, E. E. Cummings, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Langston Hughes.

Pound&#x27;s poetry is complex and sometimes obscure, with references to other art forms and to a vast range of Western and Eastern literature. He influenced many poets, notably T. S. Eliot (1888–1965), another expatriate. Eliot wrote spare, cerebral poetry, carried by a dense structure of symbols. In &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, he embodied a jaundiced vision of post–World War I society in fragmented, haunted images. Like Pound&#x27;s, Eliot&#x27;s poetry could be highly allusive, and some editions of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; come with footnotes supplied by the poet. In 1948, Eliot won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

====Post-World War II====

Among the most respected postwar American poets are: John Ashbery, the key figure of the surrealistic New York School of poetry, and his celebrated &quot;Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1976); Elizabeth Bishop and her &quot;North &amp; South&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1956) and &quot;Geography III&quot; (National Book Award, 1970); Richard Wilbur and his &quot;Things of This World&quot;, winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for Poetry in 1957; John Berryman and his &quot;The Dream Songs&quot;, (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1964, National Book Award, 1968); A.R. Ammons, whose &quot;Collected Poems 1951–1971&quot; won a National Book Award in 1973 and whose long poem &quot;Garbage&quot; earned him another in 1993; Theodore Roethke and his &quot;The Waking&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1954); James Merrill and his epic poem of communication with the dead, &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1977); Louise Glück for &quot;The Wild Iris&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1993) and &quot;Faithful and Virtuous Night&quot; (National Book Award, 2014), who is additionally the only living American author publishing primarily written poetry awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; W.S. Merwin for &quot;The Carrier of Ladders&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1971) and &quot;The Shadow of Sirius&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 2009); Mark Strand for &quot;Blizzard of One&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1999); Robert Hass for &quot;Time and Materials&quot;, which won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Poetry in 2008 and 2007 respectively; and Rita Dove for &quot;Thomas and Beulah&quot; (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1987).

In addition, in this same period the confessional, whose origin is often traced to the publication in 1959 of Robert Lowell&#x27;s &quot;Life Studies&quot;, and beat schools of poetry enjoyed popular and academic success, producing such widely anthologized voices as Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, Gary Snyder, Anne Sexton, and Sylvia Plath, among many others. Other notable poets of the late 20th century include Louise Glück, Mary Oliver, Gary Snyder, Robert Pinsky, and others.

=== 21st century ===

Stylistic and cultural diversity remain distinguishing features of American poetry. Notable poets of the 21st century include Amanda Gorman, Saul Williams, Ocean Vuong, Saeed Jones, Alex Dimitrov, Ada Limón, Ben Lerner, and others.

==Drama==


Although the American theatrical tradition can be traced back to the arrival of Lewis Hallam&#x27;s troupe in the mid-18th century and was very active in the 19th century, as seen by the popularity of minstrel shows and of adaptations of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, American drama attained international status only in the 1920s and 1930s, with the works of Eugene O&#x27;Neill, who won four Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize.

American dramatic literature, by contrast, remained dependent on European models, although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to American topics and themes, such as immigrants, westward expansion, temperance, etc. At the same time, American playwrights created several long-lasting American character types, especially the &quot;Yankee&quot;, the &quot;Negro&quot; and the &quot;Indian&quot;, exemplified by the characters of Jonathan, Sambo and Metamora. In addition, new dramatic forms were created in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show. Among the best plays of the period are James Nelson Barker&#x27;s &quot;Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father&quot;, Anna Cora Mowatt&#x27;s &quot;Fashion; or, Life in New York&quot;, Nathaniel Bannister&#x27;s &quot;Putnam, the Iron Son of &#x27;76&quot;, Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana&quot;, and Cornelius Mathews&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem&quot;.

Realism began to influence American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramas—and in the growth of local color plays, it also showed up in the more subdued, less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.

The most ambitious attempt at bringing modern realism into the drama was James Herne&#x27;s &quot;Margaret Fleming&quot; (1890), which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue, psychological insight, and symbolism. The play was not successful, and both critics and audiences thought it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as the main character nursing her husband&#x27;s illegitimate child onstage.

In the middle of the 20th century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, as well as by the maturation of the American musical, which had found a way to integrate script, music and dance in such works as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Later American playwrights of importance include Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, August Wilson and Tony Kushner.

==Ethnic studies and literature==

One of the developments in late-20th-century American literature was the increase of literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond African Americans and Jewish Americans. This development came alongside the growth of the Civil Rights Movement and its corollary, the ethnic pride movement, which led to the creation of Ethnic Studies programs in most major universities. These programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study, alongside such other new areas of literary study as women&#x27;s literature, gay and lesbian literature, working-class literature, postcolonial literature, and the rise of literary theory as a key component of academic literary study.

===Ethnic literature===
The second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of American Jewish writers such as Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, Joseph Heller, Philip Roth, Chaim Potok, and Bernard Malamud. Potok&#x27;s novels about a young New York Jewish boy&#x27;s coming of age, &quot;The Chosen&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot; figured prominently in this movement.

After being relegated to cookbooks and autobiographies for most of the 20th century, Asian American literature achieved widespread notice through Maxine Hong Kingston&#x27;s fictional memoir, &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; (1976), and her novels &quot;China Men&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book&quot;. Chinese-American author Ha Jin in 1999 won the National Book Award for his second novel, &quot;Waiting&quot;, about a Chinese soldier in the Revolutionary Army who has to wait 18 years to divorce his wife for another woman, all the while having to worry about persecution for his protracted affair, and twice won the PEN/Faulkner Award, in 2000 for &quot;Waiting&quot; and in 2005 for &quot;War Trash&quot;.

Other notable Asian-American novelists include Amy Tan, best known for her novel, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1989), tracing the lives of four immigrant families brought together by the game of Mahjong, and Korean American novelist Chang-Rae Lee, who has published &quot;Native Speaker&quot;, &quot;A Gesture Life&quot;, and &quot;Aloft&quot;. Such poets as Marilyn Chin and Li-Young Lee, Kimiko Hahn and Janice Mirikitani have also achieved prominence, as has playwright David Henry Hwang. Equally important has been the effort to recover earlier Asian American authors, started by Frank Chin and his colleagues; this effort has brought Sui Sin Far, Toshio Mori, Carlos Bulosan, John Okada, Hisaye Yamamoto and others to prominence.
Indian-American author Jhumpa Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her debut collection of short stories, &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; (1999), and went on to write a well-received novel, &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2003), which was shortly adapted to film in 2007. In her second collection of stories, &quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot;, released to widespread commercial and critical success, Lahiri shifts focus and treats the experiences of the second and third generation.

Hispanic literature also became important during this period, starting with acclaimed novels by Tomás Rivera (&quot;...y no se lo tragó la tierra&quot;) and Rudolfo Anaya (&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;), and the emergence of Chicano theater with Luis Valdez and &quot;Teatro Campesino&quot;. Latina writing became important thanks to authors such as Sandra Cisneros, an icon of an emerging Chicano literature whose 1983 bildungsroman &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; is taught in schools across the United States, Denise Chavez&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Menu Girls&quot; and Gloria Anzaldúa&#x27;s &quot;Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza&quot;.

Dominican-American author Junot Díaz received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his 2007 novel &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot;, which tells the story of an overweight Dominican boy growing up as a social outcast in Paterson, New Jersey. Another Dominican author, Julia Alvarez, is well known for &quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot; and &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot;. Cuban American author Oscar Hijuelos won a Pulitzer for &quot;The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love&quot;, and Cristina García received acclaim for &quot;Dreaming in Cuban&quot;.
Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists who write in English and Spanish include Giannina Braschi, author of the Spanglish classic &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; and Rosario Ferré, best known for &quot;Eccentric Neighborhoods&quot;. Puerto Rico has also produced important playwrights such as René Marqués (&quot;The Oxcart&quot;), Luis Rafael Sánchez (&quot;The Passion of Antigone Perez&quot;), and José Rivera (&quot;Marisol&quot;). Major poets of Puerto Rican diaspora who write about the life of American immigrants include Julia de Burgos (&quot;I was my own route fui&quot;), Giannina Braschi (&quot;Empire of Dreams&quot;), and Pedro Pietri (&quot;Puerto Rican Obituary&quot;). Pietri was a co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Café, a performance space for poetry readings. Lin-Manuel Miranda, a Nuyorican poet and playwright, wrote the popular Broadway musicals &quot;Hamilton&quot; and &quot;In the Heights&quot;.

Spurred by the success of N. Scott Momaday&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;House Made of Dawn&quot;, Native American literature showed explosive growth during this period, known as the Native American Renaissance, through such novelists as Leslie Marmon Silko (e.g., &quot;Ceremony&quot;), Gerald Vizenor (e.g., &quot;&quot; and numerous essays on Native American literature), Louise Erdrich (&quot;Love Medicine&quot; and several other novels that use a recurring set of characters and locations in the manner of William Faulkner), James Welch (e.g., &quot;Winter in the Blood&quot;), Sherman Alexie (e.g., &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot;), and poets Simon Ortiz and Joy Harjo. The success of these authors has brought renewed attention to earlier generations, including Zitkala-Sa, John Joseph Mathews, D&#x27;Arcy McNickle and Mourning Dove.

More recently, Arab American literature, largely unnoticed since the New York Pen League of the 1920s, has become more prominent through the work of Diana Abu-Jaber, whose novels include &quot;Arabian Jazz&quot; and &quot;Crescent&quot; and the memoir &quot;The Language of Baklava&quot;.

<text>Ürümqi is the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwestern China. With a census population of 4 million in 2020, Ürümqi is the second-largest city in China&#x27;s northwestern interior after Xi&#x27;an, as well as the largest in Central Asia in terms of population. Ürümqi has seen significant economic development since the 1990s and currently serves as a regional transport node and a cultural, political and commercial center.

Ürümqi is one of the top 500 cities in the world by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is also home to Xinjiang University, a comprehensive university with the highest academic level in Xinjiang, under the Project 211 and the Double First-Class Construction.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ürümqi&quot; comes from the Mongolic Oirat language and means &quot;beautiful pasture&quot; (, ). It was originally the name of a small town founded by the Oirat-speaking Dzungars, a Mongolic ethnic group.

The Qing dynasty took Ürümqi by force in 1755, during its conquest of the Dzungar Khanate. Qing forces expanded the town into a walled city from 1763 to 1767. Upon completing the expansion, the Qing renamed the city Dihua (; previously romanized as &quot;Tihwa&quot;), which means &quot;to enlighten and civilize&quot;. Believing the name &quot;Dihua&quot; to be belittling and ethnically chauvinist, the Chinese Communist Party restored the name &quot;Ürümqi&quot; on 1 February 1954.

== History ==
=== Early period ===
During prehistory, the site of the future Ürümqi was occupied by a nomadic people known in Chinese accounts as the Jushi, who lived mainly on the northern slopes of the surrounding Tianshan Mountains. The Jushi are often regarded as likely precursors of the Tocharian peoples, who later established city states in the Tarim Basin, south of the present site of Ürümqi.

The oldest known settlement, a town called &quot;Urabo&quot; (Chinese: Wulabo), was located about from the southern suburbs of the present-day Ürümqi.

Han Chinese states, located to the east, exerted increasing control of the Tarim Basin. Under the name Luntai, the city was founded by the Tang government, in 648 CE, the 22nd year of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s reign, as part of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West. It was a seat of local government and collected taxes from the caravans along the northern route of the Silk Road.

After the Tang retreated from the Western Regions, the region came under the control of the Uyghurs of the Khaganate and Gaochang/Qocho. There is little information about the Ürümqi area during the time between the Tang and Qing dynasties, and researchers believe that there were no permanent settlements there for most of this period. The Mongols referred to the wider area as Bishbalik, meaning five cities, a reference to the five towns that surrounded the present-day Ürümqi area.

===Dzungar period===
The Oirat-speaking Dzungar tribes that formed the Dzungar Khanate were the last major power to control Ürümqi before the Manchus gained control of Xinjiang. During the Ming dynasty, there was a record of a place at Jiujiawan to the west of present Ürümqi, which may have been the Dzungar town that was later destroyed during the Qing conquest. The Mongolians also used the area as herding ground in this period. Steppe peoples had used the location, the pass between the Bogda Shan to the east and the Tian Shan to the west, connecting the Dzungar Basin to the north and the Turpan Depression to the south.

Ürümqi remained a small town of lesser importance than the oasis and Silk Road trade center Turpan to the southeast. Fighting for the control of Dzungaria led to the Khoshuuts (now classified as Mongols) leaving Ürümqi for Qinghai and Tibet in the 1620s and 1630s. The Uyghurs were introduced into the Ürümqi area in the 18th century by the Dzungars who moved them from the west Tarim region to be &quot;taranchis&quot; or farmers in Ürümqi.

===Qing rule===
In the 18th century, the Qing went to war against the Dzungar Khanate. Ürümqi was taken by the Qing in 1755, and the Dzungars of the region were eliminated in the Dzungar genocide. One writer, Wei Yuan, described the resulting desolation in what became northern Xinjiang as &quot;an empty plain for a thousand &quot;li&quot;, with no trace of man&quot;. A fort was built (either in 1755 or 1758 depending on sources), and the Qing then established garrisons of Manchu and Mongol bannermen and Han Chinese troops at Ürümqi. After 1759, the Qing government established state farms in the under-populated areas around Ürümqi, where there was fertile, well-watered land. Manchu soldiers also constructed a temple with red walls dedicated to Guandi on Pingding mountain overlooking Ürümqi, which gave Ürümqi the nickname &quot;Red Temple&quot;.

The Manchus began to construct a walled city in 1763 to the south of the first fort, and it was completed in 1767. The Qianlong Emperor named the new settlement &quot;Dihua&quot; (; Manchu: &quot;Wen de dahabure fu&quot;), meaning &quot;to enlighten and civilize&quot;. In 1771, another city named Gongning Cheng () was built nearby to the northwest to house Manchu bannermen, and this would become the seat of government. The bannermen settlement to the west was commonly referred to as &quot;Mancheng&quot; (), while Dihua to the east became a Han Chinese town commonly called &quot;Hancheng&quot; (). The Ürümqi of the early period was therefore a twin-city, with Gongning Cheng forming the administrative center while Dihua grew into Xinjiang&#x27;s commercial and financial center.

Han Chinese from all over China moved into Dihua, as did Chinese Hui Muslims from Gansu and Shaanxi. The origin of Hui in Ürümqi is often indicated by the names of their mosques. By 1762, more than 500 shops had already been opened by Chinese migrants to the area of modern-day Ürümqi. Those Qing literati who visited Dihua were impressed by its cultural sophistication and similarity to eastern China. The writer Ji Yun compared Dihua to Beijing, in that both had numerous wine shops which offered daily performances of Chinese music and dance.

In 1870, the Battle of Ürümqi took place between the Turkic Muslim forces of Yaqub Beg against the Dungan Muslim forces of Tuo Ming (Daud Khalifa). With the help of Xu Xuegong&#x27;s Han Chinese militia, Yaqub Beg&#x27;s forces defeated the Dungans. Gongning Cheng was captured, its Qing administrator killed, and the city burnt to the ground and abandoned. The Qing later regained control of Ürümqi. In 1884, the Guangxu Emperor established Xinjiang as a province, with Dihua as its capital.

===Republican era===
After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, Xinjiang was ruled from Ürümqi by a succession of warlords: Yang Zengxin (1911–1928), Jin Shuren (1928–1933), Sheng Shicai (1933–1942), and Zhang Zhizhong (1942–1949) as governor of Xinjiang. Of these, Yang and Sheng were considered capable rulers.

During the Kumul Rebellion, the First Battle of Ürümqi and the Second Battle of Ürümqi took place between the forces of Ma Zhongying&#x27;s 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) and Jin Shuren and Sheng Shicai&#x27;s provincial forces. At the second battle, Ma was assisted by the Han Chinese General Zhang Peiyuan.

===People&#x27;s Republic era===
On 1 February 1954, following the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the city&#x27;s name was officially changed back to Ürümqi. The ruling Chinese Communist Party believed that the name &quot;Dihua&quot;, which literally means &quot;to enlighten and civilize&quot;, was belittling and ethnically chauvinist.

Ürümqi became the &quot;de facto&quot; political and economic capital of Xinjiang in 1962, following protests against Chinese rule in the previous capital Yining (Ghulja). In what came to be known as the Yi–Ta incident, 60,000 Chinese citizens left Yining and Tacheng for the Soviet Union, prompting the Chinese government to move its administrative buildings and industrial focus from Yining to Ürümqi. The Chinese government also began construction on a railway connecting Ürümqi to China proper in the east. As a result, Xinjiang was culturally and economically reoriented away from Central Asia and toward China proper.

In the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping relaxed China&#x27;s tight control over Xinjiang, and Ürümqi benefited from the development of the oil and gas industry in Xinjiang.

New mosques were built in Ürümqi with financial assistance from the Chinese government. While the Chinese government implemented strict rules on religion in southern Xinjiang, the treatment of the Uyghurs and their religion in Ürümqi were more lax and permissive.

In May 1989, unrest in Ürümqi resulted in 150 injuries. In February 1997, bombings in Ürümqi following the Ghulja incident resulted in 20 deaths and scores of injuries.

====July 2009 riots and subsequent unrest====
In the largest eruption of ethnic violence in China in decades, there were riots in July 2009 between ethnic Han Chinese and Uyghurs. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter covering the riot described the violence as &quot;clashes with riot police and Uyghurs rampaging through the city and killing Han civilians. Then, for at least three days, bands of Han vigilantes roamed Urumqi, attacking and killing Uyghurs.&quot; Before the riot broke out, young Uyghurs had marched through the city &quot;to protest a case of judicial discrimination&quot;. According to official figures, most of the 197 killed in the riot were Han, a statement which &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Edward Wong says is disputed by Uyghurs.

== Geography ==
The largest city in western China, Ürümqi has earned a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the most remote city from any sea in the world. It is about from the nearest coastline as Ürümqi is the closest major city to the Eurasian pole of inaccessibility, although Karamay and Altay, both in Xinjiang, are closer. The city has an administrative area of and has an average elevation of .

The location in the southwestern suburbs of Ürümqi (Ürümqi County) was designated by local geography experts as the &quot;center point of Asia&quot; in 1992, and a monument to this effect was erected there in the 1990s. The site is a local tourist attraction.

===Water supply===
Although surrounded by deserts (the Gurbantünggüt in the north and the Taklamakan in the south), the Ürümqi area is naturally watered by a number of small rivers flowing from the snow-capped Tian Shan mountains: the main range of the Tian Shan in south of the city (Ürümqi County), and the Bogda Shan east of the city (Dabancheng District).

There are 20,000 glaciers in Xinjiang – nearly half of all the glaciers in China. Since the 1950s, Xinjiang&#x27;s glaciers have retreated by between 21 percent to 27 percent due to global warming. Tianshan Glacier No. 1 (), origin of Ürümqi River, is the largest glacier near a major city in China, but has already split into two smaller glaciers.

As the Ürümqi region&#x27;s population and economy are growing, the water demand exceeds the natural supply. To alleviate water shortages, the Irtysh–Ürümqi Canal was constructed in the first decade of the 21st century. The canal&#x27;s main trunk terminates in the so-called &quot;Reservoir 500&quot; (; ) in the far north-eastern suburbs of the city (on the border of Ürümqi&#x27;s suburban Midong District and Fukang City). A new industrial area, called Ganquanbao Industrial Park (), or Industrial New City 500 () was being developed in 2009, west of the reservoir, relying on it for water supply. From the reservoir area water is further distributed over a network of canals throughout the lower Midong District.

=== Climate ===
Ürümqi lies on the boundary between a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dcac&quot;) and a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BSac&quot;). It sees vast differences between summer and winter temperatures, featuring very warm to hot summers, with a July daily average of , and frigid winters, with a January daily average of . The annual average temperature is . Although the cityʼs summers are slightly wetter than its winters, sunny weather is much more likely in the hotter months, and relative humidity is the lowest during summer. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 33 percent in December to 75 percent in September, the city receives 2,643 hours of bright sunshine annually. Its annual precipitation is about . Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 27 February 1951 to on 1 August 1973.


==Cityscape==
===Air quality and pollution===

Blacksmith Institute mentioned Ürümqi in &quot;2007 World&#x27;s Worst Polluted Places&quot; caused by air pollution along with Linfen and Lanzhou, all in China. In 2008, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; listed Ürümqi as one of the top ten worst places to live in the world due to sulphurous pollution. Heavy haze is extremely common in winter, which frequently affects air traffic. Officials believed that severe winter air pollution in Ürümqi is mainly caused by energy-heavy industries and the outdated coal-firing winter heating system.

According to a report by Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of Fudan University, the average PM2.5 and TSP concentrations in the winter of 2007 were 12 times higher than USA standard for PM2.5 and 3 times the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of China for TSP. The sulfur dioxide from industrial emissions mixed with the local anthropogenic aerosol with the transported soil dust from outside the city were the main sources of the high concentration of sulfate, one of the main factors causing the heavy air pollution over Ürümqi.

===Timing of sunrise===
Because of the use of a single time zone for all of China, in Ürümqi which is at a far western location in China, the sun is 2 hours and 10 minutes behind China Standard Time (CST = UTC+8). During early January the sun does not rise until 09:45 and it sets between 18:45 and 19:10 local time. In September and March, the sun rises around 08:00, and sets around 19:45. However, in June the sun rises at about 06:25 and does not set until 21:45.

== Administrative divisions ==
Ürümqi currently comprises 8 county-level subdivisions: 7 districts and 1 county.

== Demographics ==

Ürümqi has been a multi-ethnic city from the time of the Qing conquest; in the early years, the Manchus lived in Gongning Cheng, Han Chinese in Dihua and various other ethnic groups such as the Hui, Uyghurs and others in the suburban districts. Muslims settled to the south of the walled-city of Dihua, and although the walls have since been demolished, the Muslims are still concentrated there.

A census in 1787 showed that there were 114,348 Hui and Han in the prefectures of Zhenxi (which included Barköl and Hami) and Ürümqi. In Ürümqi city itself, there were 39,000 people in the 1880s and by the early 20th century, 50,000 people. Ürümqi in 1908 was said to have been inhabited by Uyghurs (then called Turkis), Chinese, Manchus and a few Mongols, with the Uyghurs estimated to comprise a quarter of the population.

In the People&#x27;s Republic era, an active program to resettle Han population in Xinjiang was initiated. In 1960, there were 76,496 Uyghurs and 477,321 Han Chinese in Ürümqi.

According to the 2000 census, Ürümqi had 2,081,834 inhabitants, with a population density of 174.53 inhabitants/km2 (452.3 inhabitants/sq. mi.).

In the 2010 census, the population was recorded as 3,112,559. Part of the increase was due to boundary changes, for example, Miquan was merged into Midong District and became part of Ürümqi in 2007.

In 2021, Ürümqi was estimated to have a population of 4.544 million people.

== Economy ==
Ürümqi is a major industrial center within Xinjiang. Ürümqi, together with Karamay and Korla, account for 64.5 percent of the total industrial output of Xinjiang. Ürümqi is also the largest consumer center in the region, recording ¥41.9 billion retail sales of consumer goods in 2008, an increase of 26 percent from 2007. , the city&#x27;s GDP was (), while the GDP per capita was around (). Ürümqi has been a central developmental target for the China Western Development project that the Central Government is pursuing.

The Urumqi Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Fair has been held annually since 1991 and has been upgraded into the first China-Eurasia Expo in 2011. Its purpose is to promote domestic and foreign markets. The 17th Fair has attracted participants from the Ministry of Commerce and the China Council for Promotion of International Trade.

Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group is the largest real estate enterprise and most powerful privately owned company in Xinjiang and is currently engaged in energy and automobiles. China CITIC Bank Mansion, headquarters of Guanghui, located in one of the CBDs in North Xinhua Road, is the tallest building in Ürümqi and Xinjiang; with a height of , it is also the tallest in Northwestern China and Central Asia. Zhongshan Road (Sun Yat-sen Road; ) has been one of the ten most famous commercial streets in China since 2005. Zhongshan Road has always been the hub of consumer electronics in the city, with the largest computer, mobile phone and consumer electronics market in Xinjiang, including Baihuacun, Cyber Digital Plaza and Fountain Plaza.

As the economic center in Xinjiang, Ürümqi has expanded its urban area since the 1990s. The CBDs in the city increased rapidly all around the major districts. Despite the old city areas being primarily in the south, the development in the north part began since the late 1980s. The completion of the new office tower for Ürümqi Municipal Government in 2003 at Nanhu Square () in Nanhu Road marked a shift of the city center to the north. Lacking a subway, the city commenced the construction of viaducts for Outer Ring Road () since 2003, which considerably facilitates transport. Youhao Road () and surrounding neighborhood, is the commercial center for business, shopping and amusement. Youhao Group (), the namesake local enterprise, owns a major market share of retails. Maison Mode Urumqi (), open since 2008, became one of the few notable department stores for luxury merchandise in the city. The Ürümqi Economic and Technological Development Zone (UETD) located in the northern Toutunhe District, has been a leading base for steel, machinery manufacturing, biochemistry and other industrial innovations.

<text>Mark Freuder Knopfler (born 12 August 1949) is a British musician. He was the lead guitarist, singer and songwriter of the rock band Dire Straits from 1977 to 1995. He pursued a solo career after the band dissolved, and is now an independent artist.

Knopfler was born in Glasgow, and raised in Blyth, near Newcastle. After graduating from the University of Leeds and working for three years as a college lecturer, Knopfler co-founded Dire Straits with his younger brother, David Knopfler. The band recorded six albums, including &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (1985), one of the best-selling albums in history. After Dire Straits disbanded in 1995, Knopfler began a solo career, and has produced ten solo albums to date. He has composed and produced film scores for nine films, including &quot;Local Hero&quot; (1983), &quot;Cal&quot; (1984), &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997) and &quot;Altamira&quot; (2016). He has produced albums for Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, and Randy Newman.

Described by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; as a virtuoso, Knopfler is a fingerstyle guitarist and was ranked 27th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. With Dire Straits, Knopfler sold between 100 million and 120 million records. A four-time Grammy Award winner, Knopfler is the recipient of the Edison Award, the Steiger Award and the Ivor Novello Award, as well as holding three honorary doctorate degrees in music from universities in the United Kingdom. Knopfler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.

==Biography==
===1949–1976: Early life===
Mark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in Glasgow, Scotland, to an English mother, Louisa Mary (née Laidler), and a Hungarian Jewish father, Erwin Knopfler. His mother was a teacher and his father was an architect and a chess player who left his native Hungary in 1939 to flee the Nazis. Knopfler later described his father as a Marxist agnostic.

The Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area where Mark&#x27;s younger brother David was born on 27 December 1952. Mark&#x27;s older sister Ruth was born in Newcastle, where Mark&#x27;s parents were married, in 1947. The family moved to Knopfler&#x27;s mother&#x27;s hometown of Blyth, near Newcastle, in North East England when he was seven years old. Mark had attended Bearsden Primary School in Scotland for two years; both brothers attended Gosforth Grammar School in Newcastle.

Originally inspired by his uncle Kingsley&#x27;s harmonica and boogie-woogie piano playing, Mark soon became familiar with many different styles of music. Although he hounded his father for an expensive Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster electric guitar just like Hank Marvin&#x27;s, he eventually bought a twin-pick-up Höfner Super Solid for £50 ().

In 1963, when he was 13, he took a Saturday job at the Newcastle &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; newspaper earning six shillings and sixpence. Here he met the poet Basil Bunting, who was a copy editor. In 2015, Knopfler wrote a track in tribute to him.

At this time, Knopfler got around the country largely by hitchhiking, and also hitched through Europe a number of times.

During the 1960s, he formed and joined several bands and listened to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, B. B. King, Django Reinhardt, Hank Marvin, and James Burton. At the age of 16, he made a local television appearance as part of a harmony duo, with his classmate Sue Hercombe.

In 1968, after studying journalism for a year at Harlow College, Knopfler was hired as a junior reporter in Leeds for the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. During this time, he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer, country blues enthusiast and part-time performer Steve Phillips, one year his senior, from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles. The two formed a duo called &quot;The Duolian String Pickers&quot;, which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues. Two years later, Knopfler decided to further his education, and later graduated with a degree in English at the University of Leeds.

In April 1970, while living in Leeds, he recorded a demo disc of an original song he had written, &quot;Summer&#x27;s Coming My Way&quot;. The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, The Notting Hillbillies.

Upon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in High Wycombe called Brewers Droop. This group had issued studio-recorded material before Knopfler joined, and went into the studio while Knopfler was a member -- but Brewer&#x27;s Droop material with Knopfler remained unissued until appearing on their 1989 archival album &quot;The Booze Brothers&quot;. 

One night, while spending time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it usable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it, leading to the development of his signature playing style. He said in a later interview, &quot;That was where I found my &#x27;voice&#x27; on guitar.&quot; After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at Loughton College in Essex – a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local pub bands, including the Café Racers.

By the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the Café Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with John Illsley, a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in Buckhurst Hill and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together, and soon Mark invited John to join the Café Racers.

===1977–1995: Dire Straits===
Dire Straits&#x27; first demos were recorded in three sessions in 1977, with David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist, John Illsley as bass guitarist, and Pick Withers as drummer. On 27 July 1977, they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: &quot;Wild West End&quot;, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot;, &quot;Sacred Loving&quot; (a David Knopfler song), and &quot;Water of Love&quot;. They later recorded &quot;Southbound Again&quot;, &quot;In the Gallery&quot;, and &quot;Six Blade Knife&quot; for BBC Radio London—and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;, &quot;Eastbound Train&quot;, and &quot;Real Girl&quot;. Many of these songs reflect Knopfler&#x27;s experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous &quot;Dire Straits,&quot; which was released in the following year: &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot; recalled images of life in Newcastle; &quot;In The Gallery&quot; is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); and &quot;Lions&quot;, &quot;Wild West End&quot;, and &quot;Eastbound Train&quot; were all drawn from Knopfler&#x27;s early days in the capital.

On its initial release in October 1978, the album &quot;Dire Straits&quot; received little fanfare in the UK, but when &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; was released as a single, it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off – first across Europe, and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Communiqué,&quot; produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, followed in June 1979.

Their third album, &quot;Making Movies&quot;, released in October 1980, moved towards more complex arrangements and production, which continued for the remainder of the group&#x27;s career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s most personal compositions, most notably &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, with its intro &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which also featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits from 1980 onwards, with Mark Knopfler and John Illsley the only members to remain throughout the group&#x27;s 18-year existence. In 1980 whilst the recording sessions for &quot;Making Movies&quot; were taking place, tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career. The remaining trio continued the album, with Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band guesting on keyboards and session guitarist Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited on the album. After the recording sessions were completed, keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as full-time members for the &quot;On Location&quot; tour of Europe, North America, and Oceania.

In September 1982, the group&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; was released. This featured the tracks &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;, &quot;Industrial Disease&quot;, &quot;It Never Rains&quot;, and the title track of the album, &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Pick Withers left the band.

In early 1983, with &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song EP titled &quot;ExtendedancEPlay&quot;. Featuring the hit single &quot;Twisting by the Pool&quot;, this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams, (formerly of Rockpile and Man). An eight month long Love over Gold Tour followed which finished with two sold-out concerts at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. In March 1984 the double album &quot;&quot; was released, which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in VHS video and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart, and was reissued in DVD and Blu-ray format in 2010.

During 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits, some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams played on Phil Everly&#x27;s and Cliff Richard&#x27;s song &quot;She Means Nothing To Me&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1983, taken from the album &quot;Phil Everly&quot;. Knopfler had also expressed his interest writing film music, and after producer David Puttnam responded he wrote and produced the music score to the film &quot;Local Hero&quot;. The album was released in April 1983 and received a BAFTA award nomination for Best Score for a Film the following year. Alan Clark also contributed, and other Dire Straits members Illsley, Lindes and Williams played on one track, &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot;, and Gerry Rafferty contributed lead vocals on &quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot;. The closing track on the album and on the credits in the film is the instrumental &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; which was released as a single and became a popular live staple for Dire Straits, entering the band&#x27;s repertoire from 1983 onwards.

&quot;Local Hero&quot; was followed in 1984 by Knopfler&#x27;s music scores for the films &quot;&quot;Cal&quot; (soundtrack)&quot; and &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;, both of which also featured Terry Williams, as well as keyboardist Guy Fletcher. Also during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Infidels&quot; album, as well as &quot;Knife&quot; by Aztec Camera. He also wrote the song &quot;Private Dancer&quot; for Tina Turner&#x27;s comeback album of the same name to which other Dire Straits members John Illsley, Alan Clark, Hal Lindes and Terry Williams contributed. Knopfler also contributed lead guitar to Bryan Ferry&#x27;s album &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, released in June 1985.
Dire Straits&#x27; biggest studio album by far was their fifth, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. Recording of the album started at the end of 1984 at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios in Montserrat with Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman producing. There were further personnel changes. Guy Fletcher joined the band as a full-time member, so the group now had two keyboardists, while second guitarist Hal Lindes left the band early on during the recording sessions and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni, a New York-based guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler (although Sonni&#x27;s contribution to the album was minimal). The then permanent drummer Terry Williams was released from the recording sessions after the first month and temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded the album&#x27;s drum parts within three days before leaving for other commitments. Williams would be back in the band as a full-time member for the music videos and the 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followed.

Released in May 1985, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; became an international blockbuster that has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, and in 2006 was the fourth best selling album in UK chart history. &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; spawned several chart singles including the US # 1 hit &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, which was the first video played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format as it was also one of the first DDD CDs ever released, Other successful singles were &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, and the album&#x27;s title track. The band embarked on a 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour of over 230 shows which was immensely successful.

After the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; world tour Dire Straits ceased to work together for some time, Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble Ferry Aid on &quot;Let It Be&quot; in the wake of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The track reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in March 1987. Knopfler wrote the music score for the film &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, released at the end of 1987. It featured the song &quot;Storybook Love&quot; with Willy DeVille. 

Mark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit (featured on the &quot;French and Saunders&quot; show) titled &quot;The Easy Guitar Book Sketch&quot; with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians David Gilmour, Lemmy from Motörhead, Mark King from Level 42, and Gary Moore. Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmour&#x27;s guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skit.

Dire Straits regrouped for 11 June 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act, and were accompanied by Eric Clapton, who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. Jack Sonni and Terry Williams both officially left the band shortly afterwards. In September 1988 Mark Knopfler announced the official dissolution of Dire Straits, saying that he &quot;needed a rest&quot;. In October 1988, a compilation album, &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, was released and reached number one in the United Kingdom.

In 1989, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies, a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum. It leaned heavily towards American roots music – folk, Blues and country music. The band members included keyboardist Guy Fletcher, with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. For both the album and the tour Paul Franklin was added to the line-up on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, &quot;Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time&quot; was released in March 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with Chet Atkins, &quot;Neck and Neck&quot;, which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this low-key tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.
In 1990, Knopfler, John Illsley, and Alan Clark performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth, joined by Eric Clapton, Ray Cooper, and guitarist Phil Palmer (who was at that time part of Eric Clapton&#x27;s touring band), and in January the following year, Knopfler, John Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler, Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by sidemen Phil Palmer, pedal steel guitarist Paul Franklin, percussionist Danny Cummings and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro.

The follow-up to &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was finally released in September 1991. &quot;On Every Street&quot; was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer Chris Whitten joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling world tour featuring 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. This was to be Dire Straits&#x27; final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager Ed Bicknell is quoted as saying &quot;The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed.&quot; John Illsley agreed, saying &quot;Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.&quot; This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group&#x27;s final dissolution in 1995.

Following the tour, Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released, both live albums. &quot;On the Night&quot;, released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits&#x27; final world tour. In 1995, following the release of &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; (a contractual release to Vertigo Records), Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist. Knopfler later recalled that, &quot;I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. It&#x27;s self-protection, a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing.&quot; Knopfler would spend two years recovering from the experience, which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.

Since the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler&#x27;s solo material to date, while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently, notably to four of Knopfler&#x27;s recent solo album releases: &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; (with Emmylou Harris), &quot;Kill to Get Crimson&quot;, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; and &quot;One Deep River&quot;.

In October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform. Illsley said that a reunion would be &quot;entirely up to Mark&quot;; however, he also observed that Knopfler was enjoying his success as a solo artist. When asked about a possible reunion, Knopfler responded, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again&quot;, and that the global fame Dire Straits achieved in the 1980s &quot;just got too big&quot;.

In 2018, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Knopfler did not attend the induction ceremony; however, remaining members John Illsley, Guy Fletcher and Alan Clark were in attendance to accept the award on behalf of the band.

In November 2021, John Illsley published his autobiography &quot;My Life in Dire Straits&quot;, in which he confirms that Knopfler has no interest in reforming Dire Straits, which he again reiterated in an interview in November 2023. He reflected that the band members had &quot;reached the end of the road&quot; after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was &quot;pretty happy&quot; when the band&#x27;s run came to an end, recalling feeling &quot;mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted&quot; by the time Dire Straits disbanded. At the time, Illsley also said, &quot;I can openly admit to you that I really enjoyed the success of the band, I&#x27;m speaking for Mark as well, we both really enjoyed [it]. It comes with a certain amount of stress, obviously. You&#x27;ve got to really dig deep sometimes to keep it working. I think Mark said – and I hope I&#x27;m quoting him correctly here – but he said that success is great, but fame is what comes out of the exhaust pipe of a car. It&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t really want&quot;.

Dire Straits remain one of the most popular British rock bands as well as one of the world&#x27;s most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of more than 120 million.

===1996–present: Solo career===

Knopfler&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Golden Heart&quot;, was released in March 1996. It featured the UK single &quot;Darling Pretty&quot;. The album&#x27;s recording sessions helped create his backing band, which is also known as &quot;The 96ers&quot;. It features his old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This band&#x27;s main line-up has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christopher&#x27;s Dunblane massacre tribute cover, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;.

Knopfler composed his first film score in 1983 for Local Hero. In 1997, he recorded the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;. During that same year &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;, which included &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, Dire Straits&#x27; first hit. 2000 saw the release of his solo album, &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia.&quot; This has been his most successful to date. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the &quot;Music for Montserrat&quot; concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing alongside artists such as Sting, Phil Collins, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney.

In July 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts under the name of &quot;Mark Knopfler and friends&quot; with former Dire Straits members John Illsley, Chris White, Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher, playing old material from the Dire Straits years. The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. At these four concerts (three of the four were at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, the fourth at Beaulieu on the south coast) they were joined by Jimmy Nail, who provided backing vocals for Knopfler&#x27;s 2002 composition &quot;Why Aye Man&quot;.

Also in 2002, Knopfler released his third solo album, &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot;. In March 2003 he was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road, Belgravia and suffered a broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs. The planned &quot;Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot; tour was subsequently cancelled, but Knopfler recovered and returned to the stage in 2004 for his fourth album, &quot;Shangri-La.&quot;
&quot;Shangri-La&quot; was recorded at the Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California, in 2004, where the Band had made recordings years before for their documentary/movie, &quot;The Last Waltz.&quot; In the promo for &quot;Shangri-La&quot; on his official website, he said his current line-up of Glenn Worf (bass), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Chad Cromwell (drums), Richard Bennett (guitar), and Matt Rollings (piano) &quot;...play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did.&quot; The &quot;Shangri-La&quot; tour took Knopfler to countries such as India and the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In India, his concerts at Mumbai and Bangalore were well received, with over 20,000 fans at each concert.

In November 2005 a compilation, &quot;Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits &amp; Mark Knopfler&quot; was released, consisting of material from most of Dire Straits&#x27; studio albums and Knopfler&#x27;s solo and soundtrack material. The album was released in two editions, as a single CD (with a grey cover) and as a double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot;, a duet with country music singer Emmylou Harris, which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.

Released in April 2006, &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland, No. 2 in Norway and Sweden, No. 3 in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, No. 8 in Austria and UK, No. 9 in Spain, No. 17 in the United States (&quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Chart), No. 25 in Ireland, and No. 41 in Australia. &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Folk Rock/Americana Album&quot; at the 49th Grammy Awards (11 February 2007) but lost out to Bob Dylan&#x27;s nomination for &quot;Modern Times&quot;.

Joined by Emmylou Harris, Knopfler supported &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; with a limited—15 concerts in Europe, 1 in Canada, and 8 in the United States—but highly successful tour of Europe and North America. Selections from the duo&#x27;s performance of 28 June at the Gibson Amphitheatre, Universal City, California, were released as a DVD entitled &quot;Real Live Roadrunning&quot; on 14 November 2006. In addition to several of the compositions that Harris and Knopfler recorded together in the studio, &quot;Real Live Roadrunning&quot; features solo hits from both members of the duo, as well as three tracks from Knopfler&#x27;s days with Dire Straits.
A charity event in 2007 went wrong: a Fender Stratocaster guitar signed by Knopfler, Clapton, Brian May, and Jimmy Page, which was to be auctioned for £20,000 to raise the money for a children&#x27;s hospice, was lost when being shipped. It vanished after being posted from London to Leicestershire, England.&quot; Parcelforce, the company responsible, agreed to pay £15,000 for its loss.

Knopfler released his fifth solo studio-album, &quot;Kill to Get Crimson&quot;, on 14 September 2007 in Germany, 17 September in the UK and 18 September in the United States. During the autumn of 2007 he played a series of intimate &#x27;showcases&#x27; in various European cities to promote the album. A tour of Europe and North America followed in 2008.

Continuing a pattern of high productivity through his solo career, Knopfler began work on his next studio album, entitled &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, in September 2008 with long-time bandmate Guy Fletcher, who again compiled a pictorial diary of the making of the album on his website. The album was released on 14 September the following year and Knopfler subsequently undertook an extensive tour across Europe and America. The album met with moderate success on the charts (much of it in Europe) reaching No. 1 only in Norway but peaking in the Top 5 in most major European countries (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands). The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard European Album chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Rock Album chart.
Knopfler&#x27;s solo live performances employ minimal stage production other than some lighting effects. He sometimes drinks tea during shows. Richard Bennett, who has been playing with him on tour since 1996, has also joined in drinking tea with him on stage. On 31 July 2005, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver, BC, the tea was replaced with whisky as a &quot;last show of tour&quot; sort of joke.

In February 2009, Knopfler gave an intimate solo concert at the Garrick Club in London. He had recently become a member of the exclusive gentlemen&#x27;s club for men of letters. In 2010, he appeared on the Thomas Dolby EP &quot;Amerikana&quot;, performing on the track &quot;17 Hills&quot;. In February 2011, Knopfler began work on his next solo album, &quot;Privateering&quot;, once again working with Guy Fletcher. In October and November 2011, he took a break from the recording sessions to take part in a European tour with Bob Dylan. The next year Knopfler covered a Bob Dylan song, &quot;Restless Farewell&quot;, for an Amnesty International 50th Anniversary celebration record.

On 3 September 2012, Knopfler&#x27;s seventh solo album, &quot;Privateering&quot;, was released. This was his first double album solo release and contained 20 new songs. After a further tour with Bob Dylan in the US during October and November, the Privateering tour of Europe followed in Spring/Summer 2013. A short run of five shows were played in the US that Autumn. Knopfler began work on another studio album in September 2013, again at his British Grove Studios in London with Guy Fletcher co-producing. On 16 September 2014, it was announced that this new album would be entitled &quot;Tracker&quot;, and that it would see a release in early 2015. European tour dates were also announced for Spring/Summer 2015. In 2016 he collaborated with the Italian bluesman Zucchero Fornaciari playing in &quot;Ci si arrende&quot; and &quot;Streets of Surrender (S.O.S.)&quot; contained in &quot;Black Cat&quot;.

With the November release of 2018&#x27;s &quot;Down the Road Wherever&quot;, a world tour in support of the new album was announced for 2019. During interviews, Knopfler hinted that it would be his last one. The tour started with a show on 25 April in Barcelona during which Knopfler said to the live audience that the tour would be his last ever. However, during the tour this statement softened, and he said he would continue as he loves touring so much. The final concert of the tour (and Knopfler&#x27;s final headline show to date) took place in New York City at Madison Square Garden on 25 September 2019.

Knopfler appears in Cliff Richard&#x27;s song &quot;PS Please&quot; included on the Richard album &quot;Music... The Air That I Breathe&quot; released in 2020.

Knopfler penned the score for the musical version of &quot;Local Hero&quot;, including new songs alongside adding lyrics to the original instrumental music, reuniting again with Bill Forsyth.

In January 2024, Knopfler announced his latest album, &quot;One Deep River&quot;, which was released in April 2024, collaborating with Guy Fletcher once again. Also in early 2024, Knopfler assembled a supergroup, referred to as Mark Knopfler&#x27;s Guitar Heroes, to record a new version of &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; to support the Teenage Cancer Trust and Teen Cancer America. The recording was produced by Guy Fletcher and was released on 15 March 2024, featuring contributions from more than sixty musicians.

===Country music===

In addition to his work in Dire Straits and solo, Knopfler has made several contributions to country music. In 1988 he formed country-focused band the Notting Hillbillies, with Guy Fletcher, Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, &quot;Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time&quot; was released in 1990 and featured the minor hit single &quot;Your Own Sweet Way&quot;. Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences with his collaboration with Chet Atkins, &quot;Neck and Neck&quot;, which was also released in 1990. &quot;Poor Boy Blues&quot;, taken from that collaboration, peaked at No. 92.

Knopfler&#x27;s other contributions include writing and playing guitar on John Anderson&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;When It Comes to You&quot; (from his album &quot;Seminole Wind&quot;). In 1993 Mary Chapin Carpenter also released a cover of the Dire Straits song &quot;The Bug&quot;. Randy Travis released another of Knopfler&#x27;s songs, &quot;Are We in Trouble Now&quot;, in 1996. In that same year, Knopfler&#x27;s solo single &quot;Darling Pretty&quot; reached a peak of No. 87.

Knopfler collaborated with George Jones on the 1994 &quot;The Bradley Barn Sessions&quot; album, performing guitar duties on the classic J.P. Richardson composition &quot;White Lightnin&#x27;&quot;. He is featured on Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s album &quot;The Austin Sessions&quot;, (on the track &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How The Story Ends&quot;) released in 1999 by Atlantic Records.

In 2006, Knopfler and Emmylou Harris made a country album together titled &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot;, followed by a live CD-DVD titled &quot;Real Live Roadrunning&quot;. Knopfler also charted two singles on the Canadian country music singles chart. Again in 2006, Knopfler contributed the song &quot;Whoop De Doo&quot; to Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Gulf and Western style album &quot;Take the Weather with You&quot;. In 2013, he wrote and played guitar on the song &quot;Oldest Surfer on the Beach&quot; to Buffett&#x27;s album &quot;Songs From St. Somewhere&quot;.

==Musical style==
Knopfler is left-handed, but plays the guitar right-handed. In its review of Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; in 1985, &quot;Spin&quot; commented, &quot;Mark Knopfler may be the most lyrical of all rock guitarists.&quot; In the same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commended his &quot;evocative&quot; guitar style. According to &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2018, &quot;The bare-boned economy of Knopfler&#x27;s songs and his dizzying guitar fills were a breath of clean air amid the lumbering rock dinosaurs and one-dimensional punk thrashers of the late 70s. He was peerless as craftsman and virtuoso, able to plug into rock&#x27;s classic lineage and bend it to sometimes wild forms. He wrote terrific songs, too: taut mini-dramas of dark depths and dazzling melodic and lyrical flourishes.&quot; Knopfler is also well known for playing fingerstyle exclusively, something he attributed to Chet Atkins.

==Personal life==
Knopfler has been married three times, first to Kathy White, his long-time girlfriend from school days. They separated before Knopfler moved to London to join Brewers Droop in 1973. Knopfler&#x27;s second marriage was in November 1983 to Lourdes Salomone. Knopfler and Salomone have twin sons, who were born in 1987. Their marriage ended in 1993. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1997 in Barbados, Knopfler married British actress and writer Kitty Aldridge, whom he had known for three years. Knopfler and Aldridge have two daughters.

Knopfler is a fan of Newcastle United F.C. &quot;Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)&quot; is used by Newcastle United as an anthem at home games. Knopfler also has a collection of classic cars which he races and exhibits at shows, including a Maserati 300S and an Austin-Healey 100S.

Knopfler was estimated to have a fortune of £75 million in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2018, making him one of the 40 wealthiest people in the British music industry.

In January 2024, more than 120 of Knopfler&#x27;s guitars and amps were sold at auction in London for a total of more than £8 million, 25 per cent of which will be donated to charities. Included in the auction was the 1983 Les Paul used for hits like &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; and &quot;Brothers in Arms.&quot; Knopfler expressed his desire for the instruments to find loving homes and hopes they will be played rather than stored away.

<doc id="199160" wikidata="Q177266" url="?curid=199160" title="Militarism">
<text>Militarism is the belief or the desire of a government or a people that a state should maintain a strong military capability and to use it aggressively to expand national interests and/or values. It may also imply the glorification of the military and of the ideals of a professional military class and the &quot;predominance of the armed forces in the administration or policy of the state&quot; (see also: stratocracy and military junta).

Militarism has been a significant element of the imperialist or expansionist ideologies of many nations throughout history. Notable ancient examples include the Assyrian Empire, the Greek city state of Sparta, the Roman Empire, the Aztec nation, and the Mongol Empire. Examples from modern times include the Ottoman Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia/German Empire/Third Reich, the British Empire, the Habsburg monarchy, the First French Empire, the Zulu Kingdom, the Empire of Japan, the Italian Empire under Benito Mussolini, Israel, North Korea, and the Russian Empire/Soviet Union/Russia.

==By nation==

===Germany===


The roots of German militarism can be found in 18th- and 19th-century Prussia and the subsequent unification of Germany under Prussian leadership. However, Hans Rosenberg sees its origin already in the Teutonic Order and its colonization of Prussia during the late Middle Ages, when mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed militarist Prussian nobility, from which the Junker nobility would later evolve.

During the 17th-century reign of the &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, Brandenburg-Prussia increased its military to 40,000 men and began an effective military administration overseen by the General War Commissariat. In order to bolster his power both in interior and foreign matters, so-called &quot;Soldatenkönig&quot; (&quot;soldier king&quot;) Frederick William I of Prussia started his large-scale military reforms in 1713, thus beginning the country&#x27;s tradition of a high military budget by increasing the annual military spending to 73% of the entire annual budget of Prussia. By the time of his death in 1740, the Prussian Army had grown into a standing army of 83,000 men, one of the largest in Europe, at a time when the entire Prussian populace made up 2.5 million people. Prussian military writer Georg Henirich von Berenhorst would later write in hindsight that ever since the reign of the &quot;soldier king&quot;, Prussia always remained &quot;not a country with an army, but an army with a country&quot; (a quote often misattributed to Voltaire and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau).

After Napoleon Bonaparte defeated Prussia in 1806, one of the conditions of peace was that Prussia should reduce its army to no more than 42,000 men. Since the time of Frederick The Great, however, Prussia practiced the Kruemper System, formed by dismissing a number of trained men at regular intervals and replacing them with raw recruits, thereby passing a large number of men through the ranks. The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely from among the land-owning nobility. The result was that there was gradually built up a large class of professional officers on the one hand, and a much larger class, the rank and file of the army, on the other. These enlisted men had become conditioned to obey implicitly all the commands of the officers, creating a class-based culture of deference.

This system led to several consequences. Since the officer class also furnished most of the officials for the civil administration of the country, the interests of the army came to be considered as identical to the interests of the country as a whole. A second result was that the governing class desired to continue a system which gave them so much power over the common people, contributing to the continuing influence of the Junker noble classes.

Militarism in Germany continued after World War I and the fall of the German monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, in spite of Allied attempts to crush German militarism by means of the Treaty of Versailles, as the Allies saw Prussian and German militarism as one of the major causes of the Great War. During the period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), the 1920 Kapp Putsch, an attempted coup d&#x27;état against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the NSDAP party of Adolf Hitler, while more moderate elements of militarism declined and remained affiliated with the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) instead.

Throughout its entire 14-year existence, the Weimar Republic remained under threat of militaristic nationalism, as many Germans felt the Treaty of Versailles humiliated their militaristic culture. The Weimar years saw large-scale right-wing militarist and paramilitary mass organizations such as &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; as well as militias such as the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, which was banned in 1921. In the same year, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; set up the Black Reichswehr, a secret reserve of trained soldiers networked within its units organised as &quot;labour battalions&quot; () to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles&#x27; 100,000 man limit on the German army.; it was dissolved in 1923. Many members of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and the Black Reichswehr went on to join the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the paramilitary branch of the Nazi party. All of these were responsible for the political violence of so-called &quot;Feme&quot; murders and an overall atmosphere of lingering civil war during the Weimar period. During the Weimar era, mathematician and political writer Emil Julius Gumbel published in-depth analyses of the militarist paramilitary violence characterizing German public life as well as the state&#x27;s lenient to sympathetic reaction to it if the violence was committed by the political right.

Nazi Germany was a strongly militarist state; after its defeat in 1945, militarism in German culture was dramatically reduced as a backlash against the Nazi period, and the Allied Control Council and later the Allied High Commission oversaw a program of attempted fundamental re-education of the German people at large in order to put a stop to German militarism once and for all.

The Federal Republic of Germany today maintains a large, modern military and has one of the highest defence budgets in the world; at 1.3 percent of Germany&#x27;s GDP, it is, in 2019, similar in cash terms to those of the United Kingdom, France and Japan, at around US$50bn.

===India===
The rise of militarism in India dates back to the British Raj with the establishment of several Indian independence movement organizations such as the Indian National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose. The Indian National Army (INA) played a crucial role in pressuring the British Raj after it occupied the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with the help of Imperial Japan, but the movement lost momentum due to lack of support by the Indian National Congress, the Battle of Imphal, and Bose&#x27;s sudden death.

After India gained independence in 1947, tensions with neighbouring Pakistan over the Kashmir dispute and other issues led the Indian government to emphasize military preparedness (see also the political integration of India). After the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India dramatically expanded its military which helped India win the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. India became the third Asian country in the world to possess nuclear weapons, culminating in the tests of 1998. The Kashmiri insurgency and recent events including the Kargil War against Pakistan, assured that the Indian government remained committed to military expansion. The disputed Jammu and Kashmir region is regarded as one of the world’s most militarized places.

In recent years, the Indian government has increased the military expenditure of the 1.4 million-strong military across all branches and embarked on a rapid modernization program.

===Japan===
In parallel with 20th-century German militarism, Japanese militarism began with a series of events by which the military gained prominence in dictating Japan&#x27;s affairs. This was evident in 15th-century Japan&#x27;s &quot;Sengoku&quot; period or &quot;Age of Warring States&quot;, where powerful samurai warlords (&quot;daimyōs&quot;) played a significant role in Japanese politics. Japan&#x27;s militarism is deeply rooted in the ancient samurai tradition, centuries before Japan&#x27;s modernization. Even though a militarist philosophy was intrinsic to the shogunates, a nationalist style of militarism developed after the Meiji Restoration, which restored the Emperor to power and began the Empire of Japan. It is exemplified by the 1882 Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, which called for all members of the armed forces to have an absolute personal loyalty to the Emperor.

In the 20th century (approximately in the 1920s), two factors contributed both to the power of the military and chaos within its ranks. One was the &quot;Military Ministers to be Active-Duty Officers Law&quot;, which required the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to agree to the Ministry of Army position in the Cabinet. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was &quot;gekokujō&quot;, or institutionalized disobedience by junior officers. It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the February 26 Incident, in which junior officers attempted a coup d&#x27;état and killed leading members of the Japanese government. The rebellion enraged Emperor Hirohito and he ordered its suppression, which was successfully carried out by loyal members of the military.

In the 1930s, the Great Depression damaged Japan&#x27;s economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to realize their ambitions of conquering all of Asia. In 1931, the Kwantung Army (a Japanese military force stationed in Manchuria) staged the Mukden Incident, which sparked the Invasion of Manchuria and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Six years later, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident outside Peking sparked the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). Japanese troops streamed into China, conquering Peking, Shanghai, and the national capital of Nanking; the last conquest was followed by the Nanking Massacre. In 1940, Japan entered into an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, two similarly militaristic states in Europe, and advanced out of China and into Southeast Asia. The following year, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor to prevent the intervention of the United States, which had banned oil sales to Japan in response to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the ensuing invasion of Indochina.

In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, beginning the Occupation of Japan and the purging of all militarist influences from Japanese society and politics. In 1947, the new Constitution of Japan supplanted the Meiji Constitution as the fundamental law of the country, replacing the rule of the Emperor with parliamentary government. With this event, the Empire of Japan officially came to an end and the modern State of Japan was founded.

===North Korea===
&quot;Sŏn&#x27;gun&quot; (often transliterated &quot;songun&quot;), North Korea&#x27;s &quot;Military First&quot; policy, regards military power as the highest priority of the country. This has escalated so much in the DPRK that one in five people serves in the armed forces, and the military has become one of the largest in the world.

&quot;Songun&quot; elevates the Korean People&#x27;s Armed Forces within North Korea as an organization and as a state function, granting it the primary position in the North Korean government and society. The principle guides domestic policy and international interactions.
It provides the framework of the government, designating the military as the &quot;supreme repository of power&quot;. It also facilitates the militarization of non-military sectors by emphasizing the unity of the military and the people by spreading military culture among the masses. The North Korean government grants the Korean People&#x27;s Army as the highest priority in the economy and in resource-allocation, and positions it as the model for society to emulate. 
&quot;Songun&quot; is also the ideological concept behind a shift in policies (since the death of Kim Il Sung in 1994) which emphasize the people&#x27;s military over all other aspects of state and the interests of the military comes first before the masses (workers).

===Philippines===

In the pre-colonial era, the Filipino people had their own forces, divided between the islands which each had its own ruler. They were called &quot;Sandig&quot; (), &quot;Kawal&quot; (Knights), and &quot;Tanod&quot;. They also served as the police and watchers on the land, coastlines and seas. In 1521, the Visayan king of Mactan &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot; of Cebu, organized the first recorded military action against the Spanish colonizers, in the Battle of Mactan.

In the 19th century during the Philippine Revolution, Andrés Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, a revolutionary organization against Spain at the Cry of Pugad Lawin. Some notable battles were the Siege of Baler, the Battle of Imus, Battle of Kawit, Battle of Nueva Ecija, the victorious Battle of Alapan and the famous Twin Battles of Binakayan and Dalahican. During Independence, the President General Emilio Aguinaldo established the &quot;Magdalo&quot;, a faction separate from &quot;Katipunan&quot;, and he declared the revolutionary government in the constitution of the First Philippine Republic.

During the Filipino-American War, the General Antonio Luna as a high-ranking general, he ordered a conscription to all citizens, a mandatory form of national service (at any war) for the increase the density and the manpower of the Philippine Army.

During the World War II, the Philippines was one of the participants, as a member of Allied forces, the Philippines with the U.S. forces fought the Imperial Japanese Army (1942–1945), one of the notable battles is the victorious Battle of Manila, which also called &quot;The Liberation&quot;.

During the 1970s the President Ferdinand Marcos declared P.D.1081 or martial law, which also made the Philippines a garrison state. By the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and Integrated National Police (INP), the high school or secondary and college education have a compulsory curriculum concerning the military, and nationalism which is the &quot;Citizens Military Training&quot; (CMT) and &quot;Reserve Officers Training Corps&quot; (ROTC).
But in 1986, when the constitution changed, this form of national service training program became non-compulsory but still part of the basic education.

===Russia===

Russia has also had a long history of militarism continuing on to the present day driven by its desire to protect its western frontier which has no natural buffers between potential invaders from the rest of continental Europe and her heartlands in European Russia. Ever since Peter the Great&#x27;s reforms, Russia became one of Europe&#x27;s great powers in terms of political and military strength. Through the Imperial era, Russia continued on her quest for territorial expansion into Siberia, Caucasus and into Eastern Europe, eventually conquering the majority of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The end of imperial rule in 1917 meant the loss of some territory following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but much of it was quickly reconquered by the Soviet Union later on, including events such as the partition of Poland and reconquest of the Baltic states in the late 1930s and ‘40s. Soviet influence reached its peak after WWII in the Cold War era, during which the Soviet Union occupied virtually all of Eastern Europe in a military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact, with the Soviet Army playing a key role. All this was lost with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia was greatly weakened in what Russia&#x27;s second President Vladimir Putin called the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century. Nevertheless, under Putin&#x27;s leadership, a resurgent modern Russia has maintained a tremendous amount of geopolitical influence in the countries spawned from the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and modern Russia remains Eastern Europe&#x27;s leading, if not dominant, power.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government increased their efforts to introduce &quot;patriotic education&quot; into schools. The Associated Press reported that some parents were shocked by the militaristic nature of the Kremlin-promoted &quot;Important Conversations&quot; lessons, with some comparing them to the &quot;patriotic education&quot; of the former Soviet Union.

By the end of 2023, Vladimir Putin planned to spend almost 40% of public expenditures on defense and security. UK Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Tony Radakin said that &quot;the last time we saw these levels was at the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.&quot;

===Turkey===

Militarism has a long history in Turkey.

The Ottoman Empire lasted for centuries and always relied on its military might, but militarism was not a part of everyday life. Militarism was only introduced into daily life with the advent of modern institutions, particularly schools, which became part of the state apparatus when the Ottoman Empire was succeeded by a new nation state – the Republic of Turkey – in 1923. The founders of the republic were determined to break with the past and modernise the country. There was, however, an inherent contradiction in that their modernist vision was limited by their military roots. The leading reformers were all military men and, in keeping with the military tradition, all believed in the authority and the sacredness of the state. The public also believed in the military. It was the military, after all, who led the nation through the War of Liberation (1919–1923) and saved the motherland.
The first military coup in the history of the republic was on 27 May 1960, which resulted in the hanging of PM Adnan Menderes and 2 ministers, and a new constitution was introduced, creating a Constitutional Court to vet the legislation passed by parliament, and a military-dominated National Security Council to oversee the government affairs similar to the &quot;politburo&quot; in the Soviet Union. The second military coup took place on 12 March 1971, this time only forcing the government to resign and installing a cabinet of technocrats and bureaucrats without dissolving the parliament. The third military coup took place on 12 September 1980, which resulted in the dissolution of parliament and all political parties as well as imposition of a much more authoritarian constitution. There was another military intervention that was called a &quot;post-modern coup&quot; on 28 February 1997 which merely forced the government to resign, and finally an unsuccessful military coup attempt on 15 July 2016.

The constitutional referendums in 2010 and 2017 have changed the composition and role of the National Security Council, and placed the armed forces under the control of civilian government.

===United States===

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries political and military leaders reformed the US federal government to establish a stronger central government than had ever previously existed for the purpose of enabling the nation to pursue an imperial policy in the Pacific and in the Caribbean and economic militarism to support the development of the new industrial economy. This reform was the result of a conflict between Neo-Hamiltonian Republicans and Jeffersonian-Jacksonian Democrats over the proper administration of the state and direction of its foreign policy. The conflict pitted proponents of professionalism, based on business management principles, against those favoring more local control in the hands of laymen and political appointees. The outcome of this struggle, including a more professional federal civil service and a strengthened presidency and executive branch, made a more expansionist foreign policy possible.

After the end of the American Civil War the national army fell into disrepair. Reforms based on various European states including Britain, Germany, and Switzerland were made so that it would become responsive to control from the central government, prepared for future conflicts, and develop refined command and support structures; these reforms led to the development of professional military thinkers and cadre.

During this time the ideas of social Darwinism helped propel American overseas expansion in the Pacific and Caribbean. This required modifications for a more efficient central government due to the added administration requirements (see above).

The enlargement of the U.S. Army for the Spanish–American War was considered essential to the occupation and control of the new territories acquired from Spain in its defeat (Guam, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Cuba). The previous limit by legislation of 24,000 men was expanded to 60,000 regulars in the new army bill on 2 February 1901, with allowance at that time for expansion to 80,000 regulars by presidential discretion at times of national emergency.

U.S. forces were again enlarged immensely for World War I. Officers such as George S. Patton were permanent captains at the start of the war and received temporary promotions to colonel.

Between the first and second world wars, the US Marine Corps engaged in questionable activities in the Banana Wars in Latin America. Retired Major General Smedley Butler, who was at the time of his death the most decorated Marine, spoke strongly against what he considered to be trends toward fascism and militarism. Butler briefed Congress on what he described as a Business Plot for a military coup, for which he had been suggested as leader; the matter was partially corroborated, but the real threat has been disputed. The Latin American expeditions ended with Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy of 1934.

After World War II, there were major cutbacks, such that units responding early in the Korean War under United Nations authority (e.g. Task Force Smith) were unprepared, resulting in catastrophic performance. When Harry S. Truman fired Douglas MacArthur, the tradition of civilian control held and MacArthur left without any hint of military coup.

The Cold War resulted in serious permanent military buildups. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a retired top military commander elected as a civilian president, warned, as he was leaving office, of the development of a military–industrial complex. In the Cold War, there emerged many civilian academics and industrial researchers, such as Henry Kissinger and Herman Kahn, who had significant input into the use of military force. The complexities of nuclear strategy and the debates surrounding them helped produce a new group of &#x27;defense intellectuals&#x27; and think tanks, such as the Rand Corporation (where Kahn, among others, worked).

It has been argued that the United States has shifted to a state of neomilitarism since the end of the Vietnam War. This form of militarism is distinguished by the reliance on a relatively small number of volunteer fighters; heavy reliance on complex technologies; and the rationalization and expansion of government advertising and recruitment programs designed to promote military service. President Joe Biden signed a record $886 billion defense spending bill into law on December 22, 2023.

===Venezuela===

Militarism in Venezuela follows the cult and myth of Simón Bolívar, known as the liberator of Venezuela. For much of the 1800s, Venezuela was ruled by powerful, militarist leaders known as &quot;caudillos&quot;. Between 1892 and 1900 alone, six rebellions occurred and 437 military actions were taken to obtain control of Venezuela. With the military controlling Venezuela for much of its history, the country practiced a &quot;military ethos&quot;, with civilians today still believing that military intervention in the government is positive, especially during times of crisis, with many Venezuelans believing that the military opens democratic opportunities instead of blocking them.

Much of the modern political movement behind the Fifth Republic of Venezuela, ruled by the Bolivarian government established by Hugo Chávez, was built on the following of Bolívar and such militaristic ideals.

<doc id="199161" wikidata="Q115959594" url="?curid=199161" title="Coalition of the willing">
<text>The term coalition of the willing refers to a temporary international partnership created for the purpose of achieving a particular objective, usually of military or political nature.

== Origin ==
The term was coined in the early 1970s by MIT professor Lincoln P. Bloomfield and his colleagues, including Harland Cleveland of the University of Minnesota. In July 1971, Bloomfield described the need for a coalition of willing nations to support important peacekeeping or conflict stabilization goals endorsed by the UN, in a NYT op-ed. The term was picked up by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in a 1973 letter to Bloomfield, acknowledging the latter&#x27;s &quot;proposal for &#x27;coalitions of the willing&#x27;.&quot; On May 9, 1988, Cleveland wrote a letter &#x27;for the record&#x27; to the Editor of Foreign Affairs making clear that Bloomfield was the originator of the phrase, first published in his 1974 book &quot;In Search of American Foreign Policy.&quot; In 2002, Bloomfield published another op-ed, insisting that Cleveland share credit for the phrase.

==Usage==
The term was used by President Bill Clinton in June 1994 in relation to possible operations against North Korea, at the height of the 1994 stand-off with the country over nuclear weapons.

In his letter introducing the 2002 National Security Strategy, President George W. Bush emphasized the important role of &quot;coalitions of the willing.&quot;

Coalition of the willing referred to the US-led Multi-National Force – Iraq, the military command during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and much of the ensuing Iraq War.

It has also been applied to the Australian-led INTERFET operation in East Timor from 1999 until 2000.

In the early 2000s, Hungary’s Ambassador to the U.S. Andras Simonyi formed a charity rock band he named &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; with former Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and U.S. officials, including then-Assistant Secretary of State Lincoln Bloomfield Jr.

Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves referred to the partnership of former president of Cuba Fidel Castro, former prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago Patrick Manning and former president of Venezuela Hugo Chávez for the construction of the Argyle International Airport as “the Coalition of the Willing,&quot; with a display dedicated to it located at the airport. Manning also sought to create a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; in the form of an economic union with member states from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States in 2008.

The People&#x27;s Partnership administration of former prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago Kamla Persad-Bissessar which won the 2010 Trinidad and Tobago general election has been referenced as a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot;

<doc id="199162" wikidata="Q6989196" url="?curid=199162" title="Conducting">
<text>Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. It has been defined as &quot;the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture.&quot; The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score in a way that reflects the specific indications in that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by ensemble members, and &quot;shape&quot; the phrasing where appropriate. Conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, usually with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals such as facial expression and eye contact. A conductor usually supplements their direction with verbal instructions to their musicians in rehearsal.

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Instrumentalists may perform challenging works while conducting - for instance, it is not uncommon to see a pianist perform a concerto while also conducting the orchestra. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance. However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how music should be performed.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (such as in tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands, and other sizable musical ensembles, such as big bands are usually led by conductors.

==Nomenclature==
The principal conductor of an orchestra or opera company is referred to as a &quot;music director,&quot; or &quot;chief conductor&quot;, or by the German words , or (in the feminine, ). Conductors of choirs or choruses are sometimes referred to as &quot;choral director&quot;, &quot;chorus master&quot;, or &quot;choirmaster&quot;, particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of concert bands, military bands, marching bands and other bands may hold the title of &quot;band director&quot;, &quot;bandmaster&quot;, or &quot;drum major&quot;. Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word &quot;maestro&quot; (feminine, &quot;maestra&quot;), which translates as &quot;master&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;.

==History==
===Middle Ages to 18th century===
The beginnings of conducting as a form of beat-keeping can be traced back to ancient times in the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. Through examining historical records- notably hieroglyphics, there is evidence that points to many early societies utilizing visual and aural cuing to maintain a sense of beat, rhythm, and shape. The earliest documented forms of conducting arose out of a variety of different musical needs in varying regions around the world.

An early example of utilizing gesture to influence a performance was cheironomy. Documented as early as the 11th century, the practice entailed a designated leader using subtle motions of their fingers and/or hands to dictate melodic shape and contour. Typically a theme in vocal music, the practice predated many notated forms of rhythm and therefore acted as a way for performers to visually understand when to move together, although it was also used to memorize music.

As notated rhythm and beat as well as more complex rhythmic figures became more prominent in the early baroque era, performers relied on other indications to be able to understand the intent behind their parts. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the role of the Kapellmeister in Germany represented someone who audibly tapped the beat on a hard surface using a staff, rolled sheet of paper, or other object and took many other forms throughout Europe. Having an audible source of beat allowed ensemble members to maintain consistency and execute rhythms with precision before the invention of the metronome many years later.

In instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the concertmaster, who could use their bow, or a keyboard player (often harpsichordist) using their hands, and would direct the tempo/rhythm of the music in patterns similar to those we are familiar with today. Although effective in smaller ensembles, the increasing size of instrumental ensembles in opera and symphonic performances meant the players were increasingly less able to follow along. Solutions to this issue were temporarily addressed by the use of two conductors, with the keyboard player in charge of the singers while the principal violinist or leader was in charge of the orchestra, however this did not prove to be a sustainable effort in the long run. Moving out of the eighteenth century, it was clear that music was growing too complicated and performances too refined, to rely purely on aural skills to stay in time.

===19th century===

By the early 19th century (), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were Louis Spohr, Carl Maria von Weber, Louis-Antoine Jullien and Felix Mendelssohn, all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use today. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include Pierre Boulez, Kurt Masur, James Conlon, Yuri Temirkanov, Leopold Stokowski, Vasily Safonov, Eugene Ormandy (for a period), and Dimitri Mitropoulos.

The composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor&#x27;s role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include François Habeneck, who founded the Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire in 1828, though Berlioz was later alarmed at Habeneck&#x27;s loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also a conductor. Wagner&#x27;s one-time champion Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers.

Bülow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra (&quot;sectional rehearsal&quot;). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the Bavarian State Opera, Meiningen Court Orchestra, and Berlin Philharmonic he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like Richard Strauss, who at age 20 served as his assistant, and Felix Weingartner, who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer Gustav Mahler was also a noted conductor.

===20th century===
Technical standards were brought to new levels by the next generation of conductors, including Arthur Nikisch (1855–1922) who succeeded Bülow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. Nikisch premiered important works by Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who greatly admired his work; Johannes Brahms, after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony, said it was &quot;quite exemplary, it&#x27;s impossible to hear it any better.&quot; Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony: the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was the first conductor to have his art captured on film—alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as Fritz Reiner stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.

Conductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini (1867–1957) and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler (1886–1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting &quot;Aida&quot; in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as James Levine as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini&#x27;s repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner. Furtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo—but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer; and he was a disciple of the theorist Heinrich Schenker, who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler&#x27;s conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.

The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini&#x27;s was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski (1882–1977), Otto Klemperer (1885–1973), Herbert von Karajan (1908–1989) and Leonard Bernstein (1918–1990)—the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame—had widely varied techniques.

Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as music director of the New York Philharmonic (1957–69) and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan&#x27;s technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed, as he often memorized scores; Bernstein&#x27;s technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements; when conducting vocal music, Bernstein would often mouth the words along with the vocalists. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein&#x27;s only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979—performing Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9—he tried to get the orchestra to produce an &quot;ugly&quot; tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).

Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him—he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc—but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.

In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique—particularly with the right hand and the baton—became increasingly standardized. Conductors like Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors&#x27; techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.

===21st century===

Women conductors were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like , Marin Alsop and Simone Young lead orchestras. Alsop was appointed music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2007—the first woman appointed to head a major U.S. orchestra—and also of the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of The Proms. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the Hamburg State Opera and Philharmoniker Hamburg in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called conducting &quot;one of the last glass ceilings in the music industry&quot;. A 2013 article states that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the National Opéra in Paris. &quot;&quot;Bachtrack&quot; reported that in a list of the world&#x27;s 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.&quot; While Mexico has produced several major international conductors, Alondra de la Parra has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession.

Similarly, conductors of East Asian descent have become more prominent within the contemporary orchestral landscape—notably Seiji Ozawa who was thematic director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto. Myung-Whun Chung, who has held major posts in Germany and France, is bringing the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra to international attention. Notable black conductors include Henry Lewis, Dean Dixon, James DePreist, Paul Freeman, and Michael Morgan. According to Charlotte Higgins&#x27; 2004 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians&quot;.

==Technique==


Conducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance; however, in rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians&#x27; attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.

Conducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression (tempo, dynamics, articulation) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the score but may sometimes be spontaneous. A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a baton more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.

===Beat and tempo===

At the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises their hands (or hand if they only use a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the upbeat. The beat of the music is typically indicated with the conductor&#x27;s right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every bar (measure) depending on the time signature, indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.

The downbeat indicates the first beat of the bar, and the upbeat indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the &quot;&quot; (plural: &quot;&quot; or &quot;ictuses&quot;) and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, &quot;ictus&quot; is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a music stand where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the &quot;preparation&quot;, and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the &quot;&quot; (the German word for bar, measure and beat).

If the tempo is slow or slowing, or if the time signature is compound, a conductor will sometimes indicate &quot;subdivisions&quot; of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.

Changes to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a rallentando (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions. While some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for cueing the entrances of individual players or sections and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.

During an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist&#x27;s unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.

There is a difference between the &quot;textbook&quot; definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual performance practice in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud sforzando chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly &quot;after&quot; the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.

===Dynamics===
Dynamics are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the second hand to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a crescendo; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a diminuendo. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances. Dynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one&#x27;s palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.

===Cueing===
The indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called &quot;cueing&quot;. A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by &quot;engaging&quot; the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be an audible &quot;sniff&quot; from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.

===Other musical elements===

Articulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for staccato, to long and fluid for legato. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a &quot;cutoff&quot; or &quot;release&quot;, may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.

Conductors aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players. In some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a piece that the conductor will beat &quot;in two&quot; (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were ), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of their chest.

In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called attacca. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.

== Field conducting ==
When a marching band is performing a field show, there will typically be a drum major conducting the band. This is known as field conducting.

=== Conducting patterns ===
Drum majors may each have a different style of conducting. Some may be smoother, but others are more rigid. The most commonly used pattern is called the &quot;Down-in-out-up&quot; pattern. The pattern is shown by the first beat being straight down and normal. The second beat goes down then after the focal point it goes in a 45-degree angle to the inside. The third beat is when the arm is coming back from the angle to the focal point at the angle and hits the point and goes to the outside at the same 45-degree angle. The last beat, fourth, goes from the outside angle back to the focal point. Then the process repeats. It is typical for drum majors to use smaller, simpler patterns to accommodate faster tempos for endurance and clarity, emphasizing beats 1 and 3 and minimizing beats 2 and 4.

=== Controlling tempo ===
What is &quot;appropriate&quot; conducting has evolved over the decades. During the 1970s and prior it was not uncommon for a stationary drum major to do a high-lift mark time on the podium for an audible and visual tempo; with the arrival of increasingly higher drum major platforms and thus greater visibility this has become both dangerous and unnecessary. Current drum majors use a variety of conducting patterns and styles that suit the needs of their respective marching bands and/or drum corps.

=== Assisting musicality ===
In addition to memorizing the music (between six and nine minutes of music is typical for high school marching bands, college bands and drum corps may have that much or more, up to more than eleven minutes of music) a drum major must memorize dynamics as well as tempo in order to provide proper direction and cues, particularly in area where the drum major has some discretion, such as a ritardando or fermata.

==Roles==
The roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the musical director of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the auditions for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.

Some conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known celebrities, such as Leonard Bernstein, most are only known within the classical music scene.

==Training and education==
Classical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. Music schools and universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor&#x27;s degrees, a small number of master of music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of doctor of musical arts degrees in conducting. In addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of classical music and regarding music theory. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the pipe organ, a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.

Orchestra conductors typically hold a master&#x27;s degree in music, and choir conductors in the U.S. typically hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees (referred to as B.Mus. or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.

Another topic that conducting students study is the languages used in classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.

Master of music degrees (M.mus. or M.M.) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A M.mus. is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting. Doctor of musical arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master&#x27;s degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor&#x27;s degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, and advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a terminal degree and as such qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as youth orchestras, school orchestras and community orchestras.

A small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Some conductors learn on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).

The median salary of conductors in the U.S. in 2021 was $49,130. A 5% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2021 to 2031, an average growth rate.

== Injury prevention ==
The Alexander Technique is a popular alternative therapy based on the notion that poor posture encourages health problems. The Alexander Technique is meant to help performers and musicians identify and release tension in the body. Conductors are often trained with similar techniques, focusing on maintaining relaxation and balance in the upper body, as forcing movements can lead to jarred nerves, muscles, and joints. Many conductors forcefully throw their right arm when conducting beats, which can lead to back pain and neck tension, and especially puts the conductor at risk for rotator cuff injury from repetitive motion.

A review of evidence provided by the UK National Health Service suggests the Alexander Technique aids pain-relief: &quot;long-term back pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more; long-term neck pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more.&quot; Cultivating wholistic body awareness will allow conductors to maintain longevity in their careers with minimal pain and injuries.

<text>Mr Tompkins is the title character in a series of four popular science books by the physicist George Gamow. The books are structured as a series of dreams in which Mr Tompkins enters alternative worlds where the physical constants have radically different values from those they have in the real world. Gamow aims to use these changes to explain modern scientific theories.

Mr Tompkins&#x27; adventures begin when he chooses to spend the afternoon of a bank holiday attending a lecture on the theory of relativity. The lecture proves less comprehensible than he had hoped. He drifts off to sleep and enters a dream world in which the speed of light is a mere . This becomes apparent to him as passing cyclists are subject to a noticeable Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction. Mr Tompkins becomes acquainted with the professor delivering the lectures and ultimately marries the professor&#x27;s daughter, Maud. Later chapters in the books deal with atomic structure (Mr Tompkins spends time as a conduction electron, returning to consciousness when he is annihilated in an encounter with a positron), and thermodynamics (the Professor expounds an analogy between the second law of thermodynamics and the bias towards a gambling casino before being confounded by a local reversal of the second law through the intervention of Maxwell&#x27;s demon who has introduced himself to Maud in one of her dreams). Mr Tompkins&#x27; initials are &#x27;C.G.H.&#x27; which stand for &quot;c&quot; (the speed of light), &quot;G&quot; (the Newtonian constant of gravitation) and &quot;h&quot; (the Planck constant). Following their marriage Maud refers to him as &#x27;Cyril&#x27;.

Later books in the series tackled biology and advanced cosmology.

In 2010 the first volume of a proposed ten-issue comic book series, &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Tompkins&quot;, was created by George Gamow&#x27;s son Igor, and illustrator Scorpio Steele. Here Tompkins learns about relativity from Albert Einstein, radioactivity from Marie Curie and the structure of the atom from Ernest Rutherford. A second volume, in which Tompkins meets Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and James Watson, was published in July 2011.

Main belt asteroid 12448 Mr. Tompkins is named after Tompkins.

The Scientific Background to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry begins by citing &quot;Mr Tompkins Inside Himself&quot;.

The University of Akron produced a film adaptation of this story starring Prof. Alan Neville Gent, which is available on YouTube: here.

<doc id="199169" wikidata="Q9294" url="?curid=199169" title="Ibn Khaldun">
<text>Ibn Khaldun ( ; , , ; 27 May 1332 – 17 March 1406, 732–808 AH) was an Arab sociologist, philosopher, and historian widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest social scientists of the Middle Ages, and considered by a number of scholars to be a major forerunner of historiography, sociology, economics, and demography studies.

His best-known book, the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; or &quot;Prolegomena&quot; (&quot;Introduction&quot;), which he wrote in six months as he states in his autobiography, influenced 17th-century and 19th-century Ottoman historians such as Kâtip Çelebi, Mustafa Naima and Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, who used its theories to analyze the growth and decline of the Ottoman Empire. Ibn Khaldun interacted with Tamerlane, the founder of the Timurid Empire.

He has been called one of the most prominent Muslim and Arab scholars and historians. Recently, Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s works have been compared with those of influential European philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Giambattista Vico, David Hume, G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, and Auguste Comte as well as the economists David Ricardo and Adam Smith, suggesting that their ideas found precedent (although not direct influence) in his. He has also been influential on certain modern Islamic thinkers (e.g. those of the traditionalist school).

== Family ==

Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s life is relatively well-documented, as he wrote an autobiography (, &quot;&quot;; &quot;Presenting Ibn Khaldun and his Journey West and East&quot;) in which numerous documents regarding his life are quoted word-for-word.

Abū Zayd &#x27;Abdu r-Rahman bin Muhammad bin Khaldūn Al-Hadrami, generally known as &quot;Ibn Khaldūn&quot; after a remote ancestor, was born in Tunis in AD 1332 (732 AH) into an upper-class Andalusian family of Arab descent; the family&#x27;s ancestor was a Hadhrami who shared kinship with Wa&#x27;il ibn Hujr, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. His family, which held many high offices in Al-Andalus, had emigrated to Tunisia after the fall of Seville to the Reconquista in AD 1248. Although some of his family members had held political office in the Tunisian Hafsid dynasty, his father and grandfather later withdrew from political life and joined a mystical order. His brother, Yahya Khaldun, was also a historian who wrote a book on the Abdalwadid dynasty and was assassinated by a rival for being the official historiographer of the court.

In his autobiography, Khaldun traces his descent back to the time of Muhammad through an Arab tribe from the south of the Arabian Peninsula, specifically the Hadhramaut, which came to the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century, at the beginning of the Islamic conquest: &quot;And our ancestry is from Hadhramaut, from the Arabs of Arabian Peninsula, via Wa&#x27;il ibn Hujr also known as Hujr ibn &#x27;Adi, from the best of the Arabs, well-known and respected.&quot; (p. 2429, Al-Waraq&#x27;s edition).

Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s insistence and attachment to his claim of Arab ancestry at a time of Berber dynasties domination is a valid reason to believe his claim of Arab descent.

== Education ==
His family&#x27;s high rank enabled Ibn Khaldun to study with prominent teachers in Maghreb. He received a classical Islamic education, studying the Quran, which he memorized by heart, Arabic linguistics; the basis for understanding the Qur&#x27;an, hadith, sharia (law) and fiqh (jurisprudence). He received certification (ijazah) for all of those subjects. The mathematician and philosopher Al-Abili of Tlemcen introduced him to mathematics, logic and philosophy, and he studied especially the works of Averroes, Avicenna, Razi and Tusi. At the age of 17, Ibn Khaldūn lost both his parents to the Black Death, an intercontinental epidemic of the plague that hit Tunis in 1348–1349.

Following family tradition, he strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, that required a high degree of skill in developing and dropping alliances prudently to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time. Ibn Khaldūn&#x27;s autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.

== Political career ==

At the age of 20, he began his political career in the chancellery of the Tunisian ruler Ibn Tafrakin with the position of &quot;Kātib al-&#x27;Alāmah&quot; (seal-bearer), which consisted of writing in fine calligraphy the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, Abū Ziad, the sultan of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn Khaldūn, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to Fez. There, the Marinid sultan, Abū Inan Fares I, appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, but Ibn Khaldūn still schemed against his employer, which, in 1357, got the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of Abū Inan in 1358, Vizier al-Hasān ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him to his rank and offices. Ibn Khaldūn then schemed against Abū Inan&#x27;s successor, Abū Salem Ibrahim III, with Abū Salem&#x27;s exiled uncle, Abū Salem. When Abū Salem came to power, he gave Ibn Khaldūn a ministerial position, the first position to correspond with Ibn Khaldūn&#x27;s ambitions.

The treatment that Ibn Khaldun received after the fall of Abū Salem through Ibn-Amar ʻAbdullah, a friend of Ibn Khaldūn&#x27;s, was not to his liking, as he received no significant official position. At the same time, Amar successfully prevented Ibn Khaldūn, whose political skills he knew well, from allying with the Abd al-Wadids in Tlemcen. Ibn Khaldūn, therefore, decided to move to Granada. He could be sure of a positive welcome there since at Fez, he had helped the Sultan of Granada, the Nasrid Muhammad V, regain power from his temporary exile. In 1364, Muhammad entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to the king of Castile, Pedro the Cruel, to endorse a peace treaty. Ibn Khaldūn successfully carried out this mission and politely declined Pedro&#x27;s offer to remain at his court and have his family&#x27;s Spanish possessions returned to him.

In Granada, Ibn Khaldūn quickly came into competition with Muhammad&#x27;s vizier, Ibn al-Khatib, who viewed the close relationship between Muhammad and Ibn Khaldūn with increasing mistrust. Ibn Khaldūn tried to shape the young Muhammad into his ideal of a wise ruler, an enterprise that Ibn al-Khatib thought foolish and a danger to peace in the country. As a result of al-Khatib&#x27;s influence, Ibn Khaldūn was eventually sent back to North Africa. Al-Khatib himself was later accused by Muhammad of having unorthodox philosophical views and murdered despite an attempt by Ibn Khaldūn to intercede on behalf of his old rival.

In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldūn tells little about his conflict with Ibn al-Khatib and the reasons for his departure. Orientalist Muhsin Mahdi interprets that as showing that Ibn Khaldūn later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad V.

Back in Ifriqiya, the Hafsid sultan of Béjaïa, Abū ʻAbdallāh, who had been his companion in prison, received him with great enthusiasm and made Ibn Khaldūn his prime minister. Ibn Khaldūn carried out a daring mission to collect taxes among the local Berber tribes. After the death of Abū ʻAbdallāh in 1366, Ibn Khaldūn changed sides once again and allied himself with the Sultan of Tlemcen, Abū l-Abbas. A few years later, he was taken prisoner by Abu Faris Abdul Aziz, who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment and occupied himself with scholastic duties until 1370. In that year, he was sent for to Tlemcen by the new sultan. After the death of ʻAbdu l-Azīz, he resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.

Ibn Khaldūn&#x27;s political skills and, above all, his good relationship with the wild Berber tribes were in high demand among the North African rulers, but he had begun to tire of politics and constantly switching allegiances. In 1375, he was sent by Abū Hammu, the Abd al-Wadid Sultan of Tlemcen, on a mission to the Dawadida Arabs tribes of Biskra. After his return to the West, Ibn Khaldūn sought refuge with one of the Berber tribes in the west of Algeria, in the town of Qalat Ibn Salama. He lived there for over three years under their protection, taking advantage of his seclusion to write the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; &quot;Prolegomena&quot;, the introduction to his planned history of the world. In Ibn Salama, however, he lacked the necessary texts to complete the work. Therefore, in 1378, he returned to his native Tunis, which had meanwhile been conquered by Abū l-Abbas, who took Ibn Khaldūn back into his service. There, he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies and completed his history of the world. His relationship with Abū l-Abbas remained strained, as the latter questioned his loyalty. That was brought into sharp contrast after Ibn Khaldūn presented him with a copy of the completed history that omitted the usual panegyric to the ruler. Under pretence of going on the Hajj to Mecca, something for which a Muslim ruler could not simply refuse permission, Ibn Khaldūn was able to leave Tunis and to sail to Alexandria.

== Later life ==
Ibn Khaldun said of Egypt, &quot;He who has not seen it does not know the power of Islam.&quot; While other Islamic regions had to cope with border wars and inner strife, Mamluk Egypt enjoyed prosperity and high culture. In 1384, the Egyptian Sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir Barquq, made Khaldun professor of the &quot;Qamhiyyah Madrasah&quot; and appointed him as the Grand qadi of the Maliki school of &quot;fiqh&quot; (one of four schools, the Maliki school was widespread primarily in Western Africa). His efforts at reform encountered resistance, however, and within a year, he had to resign his judgeship. Also in 1384, a ship carrying Khaldun&#x27;s wife and children sank off of Alexandria.

After his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca in May 1388, Ibn Khaldūn concentrated on teaching at various Cairo madrasas. At the Mamluk court he fell from favor because during revolts against Barquq, he had, apparently under duress, with other Cairo jurists, issued a fatwa against Barquq. Later relations with Barquq returned to normal, and he was once again named the Maliki &quot;qadi&quot;. Altogether, he was called six times to that high office, which, for various reasons, he never held long.

In 1401, under Barquq&#x27;s successor, his son Faraj, Ibn Khaldūn took part in a military campaign against the Mongol conqueror, Timur, who besieged Damascus in 1400. Ibn Khaldūn cast doubt upon the viability of the venture and really wanted to stay in Egypt. His doubts were vindicated, as the young and inexperienced Faraj, concerned about a revolt in Egypt, left his army to its own devices in Syria and hurried home. Ibn Khaldūn remained at the besieged city for seven weeks, being lowered over the city wall by ropes to negotiate with Timur, in a historic series of meetings that he reported extensively in his autobiography. Timur questioned him in detail about conditions in the lands of the Maghreb. At his request, Ibn Khaldūn even wrote a long report about it. As he recognized Timur&#x27;s intentions, he did not hesitate, on his return to Egypt, to compose an equally-extensive report on the history of the Tatars, together with a character study of Timur, sending them to the Merinid rulers in Fez.

Ibn Khaldūn spent the next five years in Cairo completing his autobiography and his history of the world and acting as teacher and judge. Meanwhile, he was alleged to have joined an underground party, &quot;Rijal Hawa Rijal&quot;, whose reform-oriented ideals attracted the attention of local political authorities. The elderly Ibn Khaldun was placed under arrest. He died on 17 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki &quot;qadi&quot; (Judge).

== Works ==
=== &quot;al-Muqaddima&quot; and the rest of &quot;Kitāb al-ʻIbar&quot; ===
* Kitāb al-ʻIbar, (full title: &quot;Kitāb al-ʻIbar wa-Dīwān al-Mubtadaʼ wa-l-Khabar fī Taʼrīkh al-ʻArab wa-l-Barbar wa-Man ʻĀṣarahum min Dhawī ash-Shaʼn al-Akbār&quot; &quot;Book of Lessons, Record of Beginnings and Events in the History of the Arabs and the Berbers and Their Powerful Contemporaries&quot;); begun as a history of the Berbers and expanded to a universal history in seven books.
:Book 1; &quot;Al-Muqaddima&quot; (&#x27;The Introduction&#x27;), a socio-economic-geographical universal history of empires, and the best known of his works.
:Books 2–5; World History up to the author&#x27;s own time.
:Books 6–7; Historiography of the Berbers and the Maghreb. Khaldun departs from the classical style of Arab historians by synthesising multiple, sometimes contradictory, sources without citations. He reproduces some errors originating probably from his 14th-century Fez source, the work &quot;Rawḍ al-Qirṭās&quot; by Ibn Abi Zar, yet &quot;Al-&#x27;Ibar&quot; remains an invaluable source of Berber history.

Concerning the discipline of sociology, he described the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the inevitable loss of power that occurs when warriors conquer a city. According to the Arab scholar Sati&#x27; al-Husri, the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; may be read as a sociological work. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s central concept of &quot;&#x27;aṣabiyyah&quot;, translated as &quot;group cohesiveness&quot; or &quot;solidarity&quot;. This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group&#x27;s downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Some of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s views, particularly those concerning the &quot;Zanj&quot; people of sub-Saharan Africa, have been cited as racist, though they were not uncommon for their time. According to the scholar Abdelmajid Hannoum, Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s description of the distinctions between Berbers and Arabs were misinterpreted by the translator William McGuckin de Slane, who wrongly inserted a &quot;racial ideology that sets Arabs and Berbers apart and in opposition&quot; into his translation of part of&quot;`Ibar&quot; translated under the title Histoire des Berbères.

Perhaps the most frequently cited observation drawn from Ibn Khaldūn&#x27;s work is the notion that when a society becomes a great civilization, its high point is followed by a period of decay. This means that the next cohesive group that conquers the diminished civilization is, by comparison, a group of barbarians. Once the barbarians solidify their control over the conquered society, however, they become attracted to its more refined aspects, such as literacy and arts, and either assimilate into or appropriate such cultural practices. Then, eventually, the former barbarians will be conquered by a new set of barbarians, who will repeat the process.

Georgetown University Professor Ibrahim Oweiss, an economist and historian, argues that Ibn Khaldun was a major forerunner of modern economists and, in particular, originated the labor theory of value long before better known proponents such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, although Khaldun did not refer to it as either a labor theory of value or theory.

Ibn Khaldun also called for the creation of a science to explain society and went on to outline these ideas in his major work, the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;, which states that “Civilization and its well-being, as well as business prosperity, depend on productivity and people’s efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit”.

Ibn Khaldun diverged from norms that Muslim historians followed and rejected their focus on the credibility of the transmitter and focused instead on the validity of the stories and encouraged critical thinking.

Ibn Khaldun also outlines early theories of division of labor, taxes, scarcity, and economic growth.

He argued that poverty was a result of the destruction of morality and human values. He also looked at what factors contribute to wealth, such as consumption, government, and investment. Khaldun also argued that poverty was not necessarily a result of poor financial decision-making but of external consequences and therefore the government should be involved in alleviating poverty. Researchers from Malaysia&#x27;s Insaniah University College and Indonesia&#x27;s Tazkia University College of Islamic Economics created a dynamics model based upon Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s writings to measure poverty in the Muslim nations of South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Ibn Khaldun also believed that the currency of an Islamic monetary system should have value and therefore be made of gold and silver (such as the dirham). He emphasized that the weight and purity of these coins should be strictly followed: the weight of one dinar should be one &quot;mithqal&quot; (the weight of 72 grains of barley, roughly 4.25 grams) and the weight of 7 dinar should be equal to weight of 10 dirhams (7/10 of a &quot;mithqal&quot; or 2.96 grams).

Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s writings regarding the division of labor are often compared to Adam Smith&#x27;s writings on the topic.


Both Ibn Khaldun and Smith shared the idea that the division of labor is fundamental to economic growth, however, the motivations and context for such division differed between them. For Ibn Khaldun, &quot;asabiyyah&quot; or social solidarity was the underlying motive and context behind the division of labor; for Smith it was self-interest and the market economy.

=== Social thought ===

Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s epistemology attempted to reconcile mysticism with theology by dividing science into two different categories, the religious science that regards the sciences of the Qur&#x27;an and the non-religious science. He further classified the non-religious sciences into intellectual sciences such as logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, etc. and auxiliary sciences such as language, literature, poetry, etc. He also suggested that possibly more divisions will appear in the future with different societies. He tried to adapt to all possible societies’ cultural behavior and influence in education, economics and politics. Nonetheless, he didn&#x27;t think that laws were chosen by just one leader or a small group of individual but mostly by the majority of the individuals of a society.

To Ibn Khaldun, the state was a necessity of human society to restrain injustice within the society, but the state means is force, thus itself an injustice. All societies must have a state governing them in order to establish a society. He attempted to standardize the history of societies by identifying ubiquitous phenomena present in all societies. To him, civilization was a phenomenon that will be present as long as humans exist. He characterized the fulfillment of basic needs as the beginning of civilization. At the beginning, people will look for different ways of increasing productivity of basic needs and expansion will occur. Later the society starts becoming more sedentary and focuses more on crafting, arts and the more refined characteristics. By the end of a society, it will weaken, allowing another small group of individuals to come into control. The conquering group is described as an unsatisfied group within the society itself or a group of desert bandits that constantly attack other weaker or weakened societies.

In the Muqaddimah, his most important work, he discusses an introduction of philosophy to history in a general manner, based on observable patterns within a theoretical framework of known historical events of his time. He described the beginnings, development, cultural trends and the fall of all societies, leading to the rise of a new society which would then follow the same trends in a continuous cycle. Also, he recommended the best political approaches to develop a society according to his knowledge of history. He heavily emphasized that a good society would be one in which a tradition of education is deeply rooted in its culture.
Ibn Khaldun (1987) introduced the word &quot;asabiya&quot; (solidarity, group feeling, or group consciousness), to explain tribalism. The concept of asabiya has been translated as &quot;social cohesion,&quot; &quot;group solidarity,&quot; or &quot;tribalism.&quot; This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups (Rashed,2017).

Ibn Khaldun believed that too much bureaucracy, such as taxes and legislations, would lead to the decline of a society, since it would constrain the development of more specialized labor (increase in scholars and development of different services). He believed that bureaucrats cannot understand the world of commerce and do not possess the same motivation as a businessman.

In his work the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun emphasizes human beings&#x27; faculty to think (&quot;fikr&quot;) as what determines human behavior and ubiquitous patterns. This faculty is also what inspires human beings to form into a social structure to co-operate in division of labor and organization. According to Zaid Ahmand in &quot;Epistemology and the Human Dimension in Urban Studies&quot;, the &quot;fikr&quot; faculty is the supporting pillar for all philosophical aspects of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s theory related to human beings’ spiritual, intellectual, physical, social and political tendencies.

Another important concept he emphasizes in his work is the mastery of crafts, habits and skills. This takes place after a society is established and according to Ibn Khaldun the level of achievement of a society can be determined by just analyzing these three concepts. A society in its earliest stages is nomadic and primarily concerned with survival, while a society at a later stage is sedentary, with greater achievement in crafts. A society with a sedentary culture and stable politics would be expected to have greater achievements in crafts and technology.

Ibn Khaldun also emphasized in his epistemology the important aspect that educational tradition plays to ensure the new generations of a civilization continuously improve in the sciences and develop culture. Ibn Khaldun argued that without the strong establishment of an educational tradition, it would be very difficult for the new generations to maintain the achievements of the earlier generations, let alone improve them.

Another way to distinguish the achievement of a society would be the language of a society, since for him the most important element of a society would not be land, but the language spoken. He was surprised that many non-Arabs were really successful in the Arabic society, had good jobs and were well received by the community. &quot;These people were non-Arab by descent, but they grew up among the Arabs who possessed the habit of Arabic,&quot; Ibn Khaldun once recalled, &quot;[b]ecause of this, they were able to master Arabic so well that they cannot be surpassed.&quot; He believed that the reason why non-Arabs were accepted as part of Arab society was due to their mastery of the Arabic language.

Advancements in literary works such as poems and prose were another way to distinguish the achievement of a civilization, but Ibn Khaldun believed that whenever the literary facet of a society reaches its highest levels it ceases to indicate societal achievements anymore, but is an embellishment of life. For logical sciences he established knowledge at its highest level as an increase of scholars and the quality of knowledge. For him the highest level of literary productions would be the manifestation of prose, poems and the artistic enrichment of a society.

===Religious thought===
Ibn Khaldun believes that communication between the tangible and intangible world is the basis of every religion, and the credit for its occurrence is the human spirit, as it is the mediator between God and humans. It is immortal by nature and does not perish, and has characteristics that enable it to communicate with God. However, most souls have lost their hidden ability and are connected to the sensory world only. A small number of them still maintain their full ability to communicate with God. These are the ones God chose and they became prophets, so their souls leave the sensory world to receive from God. Their souls abandon the sensory world in order to receive from God what they should convey to humans. Religions arise only from this connection. He believes that religions that rely on institutions of prediction and reconnaissance are false, but they partly contain some truth. A person’s concentration on a specific thing for a long period makes him forget everything and become attached to what he focused on. Only, this focus makes him see the non-sensory world very quickly and in a very imperfect way, and these are pagan religions.

Ibn Khaldun agrees with Sufism and believes that if a person maintains his good faith and is stripped of the desire to create a new religion and strives to separate himself from the sensory world, he will be able to approach the divine essence and the ideas of scholars will appear to him clearly. But if he strives in this detachment and mysticism out of a desire to excel over others, he will not communicate with God, but with demons. Also, the human spirit is able to see some things of the future through vision, but on the condition that this spirit be completely upright and very pious and pure, otherwise the vision will come from the devils.

=== Minor works ===

From other sources we know of several other works, primarily composed during the time he spent in North Africa and Al-Andalus. His first book, &quot;Lubābu l-Muhassal&quot;, a commentary on the Islamic theology of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, was written at the age of 19 under the supervision of his teacher Al-Abili in Tunis. A work on Sufism, &quot;Shifā&#x27;u l-Sā&#x27;il&quot;, was composed around 1373 in Fes, Morocco. Whilst at the court of Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada, Ibn Khaldūn composed a work on logic, &quot;ʻallaqa li-s-Sulṭān&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== Egypt ===
Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s historical method had very few precedents or followers in his time. While Ibn Khaldun is known to have been a successful lecturer on jurisprudence within religious sciences, only very few of his students were aware of, and influenced by, his Muqaddimah. One such student, Al-Maqrizi, praised the Muqaddimah, although some scholars have found his praise, and that of others, to be generally empty and lacking understanding of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s methods.

Ibn Khaldun also faced primarily criticism from his contemporaries, particularly Ibn Hajar al-`Asqalani. These criticisms included accusations of inadequate historical knowledge, an inaccurate title, disorganization, and a style resembling that of the prolific Arab literature writer, Al-Jahiz. Al-Asqalani also noted that Ibn Khaldun was not well-liked in Egypt because he opposed many respected traditions, including the traditional judicial dress, and suggested that this may have contributed to the reception of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s historical works. The notable exception to this consensus was Ibn al-Azraq, a jurist who lived shortly after Ibn Khaldun and quoted heavily from the first and fourth books of the Kitab al-‘Ibar, in developing a work of mirrors for princes.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s work found some recognition with Ottoman intellectuals in the 17th century. The first references to Ibn Khaldun in Ottoman writings appeared in the middle of the 17th century, with historians such as Kâtip Çelebi naming him as a great influence, while another Turkish Ottoman historian, Mustafa Naima, attempted to use Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s cyclical theory of the rise and fall of empires to describe the Ottoman Empire. Increasing perceptions of the decline of the Ottoman Empire also caused similar ideas to appear independently of Ibn Khaldun in the 16th century, and may explain some of the influence of his works.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, Ibn Khaldun was first brought to the attention of the Western world in 1697, when a biography of him appeared in Barthélemy d&#x27;Herbelot de Molainville&#x27;s &quot;Bibliothèque Orientale&quot;. However, some scholars believe that Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s work may have first been introduced to Europe via Ibn Arabshah&#x27;s biography of Tamerlane, translated to Latin, which covers a meeting between Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane. According to Ibn Arabshah, during this meeting, Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane discussed the Maghrib in depth, as well as Tamerlane&#x27;s genealogy and place in history. Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when Silvestre de Sacy&#x27;s &quot;Chrestomathie Arabe&quot; included his biography together with a translation of parts of the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; as the &quot;Prolegomena&quot;. In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the &quot;Prolegomena&quot;. More details on and partial translations of the &quot;Prolegomena&quot; emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858. Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest. Reynold A. Nicholson praised Ibn Khaldun as a uniquely brilliant Muslim sociologist, but discounted Khaldun&#x27;s influence. Spanish Philosopher José Ortega y Gasset viewed the conflicts of North Africa as a problem that stemmed from a lack of African thought, and praised Ibn Khaldun for making sense of the conflict by simplifying it to the relationship between the nomadic and sedentary modes of life.

=== Modern historians ===
British historian Arnold J. Toynbee has called Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s Muqaddimah &quot;the greatest work of its kind.&quot; Ernest Gellner, once a professor of philosophy and logic at the London School of Economics, considered Khaldun&#x27;s definition of government the best in the history of political theory.

More moderate views on the scope of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s contributions have also emerged.

Arthur Laffer, for whom the Laffer curve is named, acknowledged that Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s ideas, as well as others, precede his own work on that curve.

Economist Paul Krugman described Ibn Khaldun as &quot;a 14th-century Islamic philosopher who basically invented what we would now call the social sciences&quot;.

19th century Scottish theologian and philosopher Robert Flint praised him strongly, &quot;as a theorist of history he had no equal in any age or country until Vico appeared, more than three hundred years later. Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine were not his peers, and all others were unworthy of being even mentioned along with him&quot;. Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s work on evolution of societies also influenced Egon Orowan, who introduced the concept of &quot;socionomy&quot;. While Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s record-keeping is usually passed over in favor of recognizing his contributions to the science of history, Abderrahmane Lakhsassi wrote &quot;No historian of the Maghreb since and particularly of the Berbers can do without his historical contribution.&quot;

=== Public recognition ===
Public recognition of Ibn Khaldun has increased in recent years. In 2004, the Tunisian Community Center launched the first Ibn Khaldun Award to recognize a Tunisian/American high achiever whose work reflects Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s ideas of kinship and solidarity. The Award was named after Ibn Khaldun for the convergence of his ideas with the organization&#x27;s objectives and programs. In 2006, the Atlas Economic Research Foundation launched an annual essay contest for students named in Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s honor. The theme of the contest is &quot;how individuals, think tanks, universities and entrepreneurs can influence government policies to allow the free market to flourish and improve the lives of its citizens based on Islamic teachings and traditions.&quot; In 2006, Spain commemorated the 600th anniversary of the death of Ibn Khaldun by orchestrating an exhibit titled &quot;Encounter of Civilizations: Ibn Khaldun.&quot;

In 2007, İbn Haldun Üniversitesi has opened in Istanbul, Turkey to commemorate his name. The university promotes a policy of trilingualism. The languages in question are English, Modern Turkish, and Arabic and its emphasis is on teaching social sciences.

In 1981 U.S. President Ronald Reagan cited Ibn Khaldun as an influence on his supply-side economic policies, also known as Reaganomics. He paraphrased Ibn Khaldun, who said that &quot;in the beginning of the dynasty, great tax revenues were gained from small assessments,&quot; and that &quot;at the end of the dynasty, small tax revenues were gained from large assessments.&quot; Reagan said his goal is &quot;trying to get down to the small assessments and the great revenues.&quot;

The Iraqi Navy named a frigate after Ibn Khaldun.

<text>Saiph , designation Kappa Orionis (κ Orionis, abbreviated Kappa Ori, κ Ori) and 53 Orionis (53 Ori), is a blue supergiant star and the sixth-brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Of the four bright stars that compose Orion&#x27;s main quadrangle, it is the star at the south-eastern corner. A northern-hemisphere observer facing south would see it at the lower left of Orion, and a southern-hemisphere observer facing north would see it at the upper right. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of from the Sun. It is smaller, less luminous but hotter at its surface than Rigel with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.1. The luminosity of this star changes slightly, varying by 0.04 magnitudes.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Kappa Orionis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation and &quot;53 Orionis&quot; its Flamsteed designation. The traditional name &quot;Saiph&quot; is from the Arabic &quot;saif al jabbar&quot;, , literally &quot;saif of the giant&quot;. This name was originally applied to Eta Orionis. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Saiph&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In the 17th-century catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium&quot; of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated &quot;Rekbah al Jauza al Yemeniat&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Genu Dextrum Gigantis&quot; &quot;right knee of the giant&quot;.

==Properties==
Saiph is a supergiant with a stellar classification of B0.5 Ia. The luminosity class &#x27;Ia&#x27; represents a bright supergiant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. Saiph has a strong stellar wind and is losing mass at the rate of times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the Sun&#x27;s mass every 1.1 million years. Using a combination of parallax as determined by Hipparcos and the spectrum yields a mass 15.50 ± 1.25 times and luminosity 56,881 times that of the Sun. Analysis of the spectra and age of the members of the Orion OB1 association yields a mass 28 times that of the Sun (from an original mass 31.8 times that of the Sun) and an age of 6.2 million years. An analysis of the star&#x27;s spectral energy distribution using the Hipparcos distance give a luminosity of and a radius of . Large stars such as Saiph (and many other stars in Orion) are destined to collapse on themselves and explode as supernovae.

==In non-Western astronomy and culture==
In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Three Stars (asterism)&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Saiph, Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Rigel. Consequently, the Chinese name for Saiph is (, ).

The Wardaman people of northern Australia regard Saiph as the Guman digging stick, used to make a canyon by Black-headed Python.

<text>Giuseppe Zangara (September 7, 1900 – March 20, 1933) was an Italian immigrant and naturalized United States citizen who attempted to assassinate the President-elect of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, on February 15, 1933, 17 days before Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration. During a night speech by Roosevelt in Miami, Florida, Zangara fired five shots with a handgun he had purchased a couple of days before. He missed his target and instead killed Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and injured four bystanders.

Zangara was convicted of murder and executed by electric chair.

== Early life ==
Zangara was born on September 7, 1900, in Ferruzzano, Calabria, Italy. After serving with the Royal Italian Army in the Tyrolean Alps during World War I, he did a variety of menial jobs in his home village before emigrating with his uncle to the United States in 1923. He settled in Paterson, New Jersey, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1929.

== Health issues ==
Zangara had little education and worked as a bricklayer. He suffered severe pain in his abdomen, which doctors told him was chronic and incurable. In 1926 he underwent an appendectomy, but it was no help; if anything, it may have made his pain worse. The doctors who performed his autopsy attributed his abdominal pain to adhesions they found on his gallbladder. In his prison memoir, Zangara himself attributed his pain to being forced to do grueling physical labor on his father&#x27;s farm from an early age. He wrote that his pain began when he was six years old.

Observers at the time and following his execution have discussed his mental state. Arguments have been made that Zangara was mentally ill, incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and ought to have had an insanity defense presented on his behalf while others have contended that he was sane.

==Assassination attempt==
On February 15, 1933, Roosevelt was giving an impromptu speech at night from the back of an open car in the Bayfront Park area of Miami, Florida, where Zangara was working the occasional odd job and living off his savings. Zangara, armed with a .32-caliber US Revolver Company revolver he had bought for $8 () at a local pawn shop, joined the crowd of spectators, but as he was only tall, he was unable to see over other people and had to stand on a wobbly bench, where Mrs. Lillian Cross was already standing for a better view. Zangara got on the bench to get a clear aim at his target from 25 feet away. He placed his gun near Mrs. Cross&#x27;s right shoulder (she was only about 4 inches taller than he and weighed 105 pounds).

Lillian Cross saw Zangara&#x27;s pistol, quickly transferred her purse from right to left hand, and then pushed up and twisted Zangara&#x27;s shooting arm. As he fired shots, Mrs. Cross reported that Zangara continually attempted to force her arm back down but she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t let go.&quot; Five people were hit: Mrs. Joseph H. Gill (seriously wounded in the abdomen); Miss Margaret Kruis of Newark, New Jersey, (minor wound in hand and a scalp wound); New York detective/bodyguard William Sinnott (superficial head wound); Russell Caldwell of Miami (flesh wound on the forehead); and Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing on the running board of the car next to Roosevelt. Mrs. Cross had powder burns on her right cheek. A Secret Service agent, Bob Clark, had a grazed hand, possibly caused by the bullet that struck Cermak. The intended target, Roosevelt, was unharmed.

Roosevelt cradled the mortally wounded Cermak in his arms as the car rushed to the hospital; after arriving there, Cermak spoke to Roosevelt and, before he died 19 days later, allegedly uttered the line that is engraved on his tomb: &quot;I&#x27;m glad it was me, not you.&quot; The &quot;Tribune&quot; reported the quote without attributing it to a witness, and most scholars doubt it was ever said.

== Aftermath ==
Zangara confessed in the Dade County Courthouse jail, stating: &quot;I have the gun in my hand. I kill kings and presidents first and next all capitalists.&quot; He pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 80 years in prison. As he was led out of the courtroom, Zangara told the judge: &quot;Four times 20 is 80. Oh, judge, don&#x27;t be stingy. Give me a hundred years.&quot;

Cermak died of peritonitis 19 days later, on March 6, 1933, two days after Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration. Zangara was promptly indicted for first-degree murder in Cermak&#x27;s death. Because Zangara had intended to commit murder, the fact that his intended target may not have been the man he ultimately killed was not relevant as he would still be guilty of first-degree murder under the doctrine of transferred intent. There were worries that Zangara&#x27;s defense would argue that Cermak&#x27;s death was not a result of his bullet injury. A theory, raised decades later, questioned whether Cermak&#x27;s death was caused by medical malpractice on the part of the doctors treating him. It alleged that they failed to realize that the bullet had actually caused direct damage to his colon and precipitated the perforation. The perforation led to sepsis and his death but Cermak might not have died &quot;but for [the] physicians&#x27; blunders&quot;. This theory was refuted by a later medical analysis of the event.

Zangara pleaded guilty to the additional murder charge and was sentenced to death by Circuit Court Judge Uly Thompson. Zangara said after hearing his sentence: &quot;You give me electric chair. I no afraid of that chair! You one of capitalists. You is crook man too. Put me in electric chair. I no care!&quot; Under Florida law, a convicted murderer could not share cell space with another prisoner before his execution, but another convicted murderer was already awaiting execution at Raiford. Zangara&#x27;s sentence required prison officials to expand their waiting area for prisoners sentenced to death and the &quot;death cell&quot; became &quot;Death Row&quot;.

== Execution ==
After spending only 10 days on death row, Zangara was executed on March 20, 1933, in Old Sparky, the electric chair at Florida State Prison in Raiford. Zangara became enraged when he learned no newsreel cameras would be filming his final moments. His final statement was &quot;Viva l&#x27;Italia! Goodbye to all poor peoples everywhere! ... Push the button! Go ahead, push the button!&quot;

== Conspiracy theory ==
While accounts focus on Cermak and the other victims being random casualties of an attempt to assassinate Roosevelt, a conspiracy theory emerged sometime before 1999, originating in Chicago, asserting that Zangara was a hired killer working for Frank Nitti, who was the head of the Chicago Outfit crime syndicate. John William Tuohy, author of numerous books on organized crime in Chicago, after reviewing Secret Service records, described in detail in a 2002 article his interpretation of how and why Cermak was the real target and the relationship of the shooting to the rampant gang violence in Chicago. The theory is enhanced by numerous researchers, citing their analysis of court testimony, asserting that Cermak had directed an assassination attempt on Nitti less than three months earlier.

The conspiracy theorists suggest that Zangara had been an expert marksman in the Italian Army 16 years earlier, who would presumably hit his target, though sidestepping any issues about Zangara&#x27;s health issues since his time in the war, his short stature requiring him to stand on a jostled chair, his experience being with a rifle rather than with a pistol from a great distance, and his own statements regarding his target.

Raymond Moley, who interviewed Zangara, believed he was not part of any larger conspiracy, and that he had intended to kill Roosevelt.

==In popular culture==
In a 1960 two-part story line titled &quot;The Unhired Assassin&quot; on the TV series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, actor Joe Mantell played the part of Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Zangara. This episode, while depicting Zangara&#x27;s story throughout, focuses mostly on Nitti&#x27;s plan to kill Cermak with an initial (fictionalized) attempt in Chicago that is foiled by Eliot Ness and his agents at the end of part one. In part two, another attempt is made using a contract hitman, an ex-Army rifleman in Florida, which again fails thanks to Ness. Suddenly, Zangara&#x27;s failed, and unrelated, obsession with killing Roosevelt unintentionally achieves Nitti&#x27;s goal. This two-part story was later edited together as a feature-length movie retitled &quot;The Gun of Zangara&quot;. In the 1993 reboot of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, the episode &quot;Radical Solution&quot; has actor David Engel portraying Zangara.

Zangara plays a significant role in the background provided for Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (as well as the subsequent Amazon original series). This alternate history novel, set after an Axis victory in World War II, bases the point of divergence on the premise that Zangara succeeded in assassinating President-elect Roosevelt on February 15, 1933, in Miami. Eric Norden&#x27;s 1973 alternate history novel &quot;The Ultimate Solution&quot; also uses this point of divergence. A similar Zangara-is-successful premise is used in the &quot;GURPS Alternate Earths&quot; role-playing game&#x27;s &quot;Reich 5&quot; alternate universe.

Max Allan Collins&#x27; 1983 novel &quot;True Detective&quot;, first in his Nathan Heller mystery series, features Zangara&#x27;s attempted assassination of Roosevelt, positing it as an actual attempt on Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. The novel won the 1984 Shamus Award for Best P.I. Hardcover from the Private Eye Writers of America.

In the original 1990 Off-Broadway production of &quot;Assassins&quot; by Stephen Sondheim, Zangara was played by Eddie Korbich. In later productions, he was played by Paul Harrhy in London&#x27;s West End (1992 premiere) and Jeffrey Kuhn on Broadway (2004 premiere). Appearing in several songs from the musical, the Zangara character has a major solo in the number &quot;How I Saved Roosevelt&quot;.

In HBO&#x27;s 1998 biopic &quot;Winchell&quot;, moments after the assassination attempt, Walter Winchell leaps onto the running board of Miami&#x27;s Police Chief&#x27;s car, asking for an interview with Zangara, thereby getting at exclusive story for the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;.

The 2011 fantasy noir novel &quot;Spellbound&quot; by Larry Correia features Zangara&#x27;s attempted assassination of Roosevelt. Zangara is magically enhanced in a plot to inflame bigotry and curtail the civil rights of the magically gifted protagonists of the Grimnoir Society. Instead of using a small-caliber handgun, Zangara is made into a living cannon or bomb and kills nearly 200 onlookers, including Cermak, and cripples Roosevelt.

Charlaine Harris&#x27; fantasy Western Gunnie Rose Series is set in a world in which Zangara succeeded in assassinating Roosevelt, and the United States fractured into several different successor states.

<text>The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare. It was built in 1599 at Southwark, close to the south bank of the Thames, by Shakespeare&#x27;s playing company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. It was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613. A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and stayed open until the London theatre closures of 1642. As well as plays by Shakespeare, early works by Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and John Fletcher were first performed here.

A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe&quot;, opened in 1997 approximately from the site of the original theatre.

==Location==
Examination of old leases and parish records has identified the plot of land acquired for building The Globe as extending from the west side of modern-day Southwark Bridge Road eastwards as far as Porter Street and from Park Street southwards as far as the back of Gatehouse Square. Conveniently within the &quot;entertainment ghetto&quot; already established at Southwark, it was being offered for rent by Thomas Brend, who was a neighbour to John Heminges and Henry Condell, actors with the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men.

The precise location of the building remained unknown until a small part of the foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now Museum of London Archaeology) beneath the car park at the rear of Anchor Terrace on Park Street. The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface. As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67–70 Anchor Terrace, a listed building, no further excavations have been permitted.

==History==

The Globe was owned by actors who were also shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. Two of the six Globe shareholders, Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage, owned double shares of the whole, or 25 per cent each; the other four men, Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, and Thomas Pope, owned a single share, or 12.5 per cent. (Originally William Kempe was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority sharers, leaving them with more than the originally planned 10 per cent). These initial proportions changed over time as new sharers were added. Shakespeare&#x27;s share diminished from 1/8 to 1/14 (roughly 7 per cent), over the course of his career.

The Globe was built in 1599 using timber from an earlier theatre, The Theatre, which had been built by Richard Burbage&#x27;s father, James Burbage, in Shoreditch in 1576. The Burbages originally had a 21-year lease of the site on which the theatre was built but owned the building outright. However, the landlord, Giles Allen, claimed that the building had become his with the expiry of the lease. On 28 December 1598, while Allen was celebrating Christmas at his country home, carpenter Peter Street, supported by the players and their friends, dismantled The Theatre beam by beam and transported it to Street&#x27;s waterfront warehouse near Bridewell. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe on some marshy gardens to the south of Maiden Lane, Southwark. While only a hundred yards from the congested shore of the Thames, the piece of land was situated close by an area of farmland and open fields. It was poorly drained and, notwithstanding its distance from the river, was liable to flooding at times of particularly high tide; a &quot;wharf&quot; (bank) of raised earth with timber revetments had to be created to carry the building above the flood level. The new theatre was larger than the building it replaced, with the older timbers being reused as part of the new structure; the Globe was not merely the old Theatre newly set up at Bankside. It was probably completed by the summer of 1599, possibly in time for the opening production of &quot;Henry V&quot; and its famous reference to the performance crammed within a &quot;wooden O&quot;. Dover Wilson, however, defers the opening date until September 1599, taking the &quot;wooden O&quot; reference to be disparaging and thus unlikely to be used in the Globe&#x27;s inaugural staging. He suggests that the account of Thomas Platter, a Swiss tourist, describing a performance of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; witnessed on 21 September 1599, tells of the more likely first production. The first performance for which a firm record remains was Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man out of His Humour&quot;—with its first scene welcoming the &quot;gracious and kind spectators&quot;—at the end of the year.

On 29 June 1613, the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a performance of &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man whose burning breeches were put out with a bottle of ale. It was rebuilt in the following year.

Like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the outbreak of the First English Civil War, when the Long Parliament closed all London theatres by an ordinance dated 2 September 1642. It was pulled down in 1644–45 (the commonly cited document dating the act to 15 April 1644 is not reliable) to make room for tenements.

A modern reconstruction of the theatre, named &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe&quot;, opened in 1997, with a production of &quot;Henry V&quot;. It is an academic approximation of the original design, based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings, and is located approximately from the site of the original theatre.

==Layout==

The Globe&#x27;s detailed dimensions are unknown, but its shape and size can be estimated from scholarly inquiry over the last two centuries. The evidence suggests that it was a three-storey, open-air amphitheatre approximately in diameter that could house up to 3,000 spectators. The Globe is shown as round on Wenceslas Hollar&#x27;s sketch of the building, later incorporated into his etched &quot;Long View of London from Bankside&quot; in 1647. However, in 1988–89 the uncovering of a small part of the Globe&#x27;s foundation suggested that it was a polygon of 20 sides.

At the base of the stage and surrounding it on three sides, there was an area called the &quot;yard&quot;, the name deriving from the old inn-yards, where, for a penny, people (the &quot;groundlings&quot;) would stand on the rush-strewn earthen floor to watch the performance. During the excavation of the Globe in 1989 a layer of nutshells was found, pressed into the dirt flooring so as to form a new surface layer. Vertically around the yard were three levels of more expensive stadium-style seats. A rectangular stage platform thrust out into the middle of the open-air yard. The stage was approximately in width, in depth and was raised about off the ground. On this stage, there was a trapdoor for use by performers to enter from the &quot;cellarage&quot; area beneath the stage.

The back wall of the stage had two or three doors on the main level, with a curtained inner stage in the centre (although not all scholars agree about the existence of this supposed &quot;inner below&quot;), and a balcony above it. The doors entered into the &quot;tiring house&quot; (backstage area) where the actors dressed and awaited their entrances. The floors above may have been used as storage for costumes and props, and management offices. The balcony housed the musicians, and could also be used for scenes requiring an upper space, such as the balcony scene in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Rush matting covered the stage, although this may only have been used if the setting of the play demanded it.

Large columns on either side of the stage supported a roof over the rear portion of the stage. The ceiling under this roof was called the &quot;heavens,&quot; and was painted as a sky with clouds. A trapdoor in the heavens enabled performers to descend using some form of rope and harness. The stage was set in the south-east corner of the building so as to be in shade during afternoon performances in summer.

==Name, motto and flag==
The name of the Globe supposedly alludes to the Latin tag &quot;totus mundus agit histrionem&quot; (&quot;all the world plays the player&quot;), in turn derived from &quot;quod fere totus mundus exerceat histrionem&quot;—&quot;because all the world is a playground&quot;—from Petronius, the satirical Roman author who had wide circulation in England in the Burbages&#x27; time. &quot;Totus mundus agit histrionem&quot; was, according to this explanation, therefore adopted as the theatre&#x27;s motto. It seems likely, however, that the link between the supposed motto from Petronius and the theatre was made only later, originating with the industrious early Shakespeare biographer William Oldys, who claimed as his source a loaned copy of the Harleian Manuscripts to which he once had access. This was repeated in good faith by his literary executor George Steevens, but the tale is now thought &quot;suspicious&quot;, with Oldys perpetrating a &quot;hoax on his credulous public&quot;. The Shakespearean editor Edmond Malone took Oldys&#x27;s conjecture further, by reporting that the motto was on the theatre&#x27;s flag of a globe of the Earth on the shoulders of Hercules.

Another allusion, familiar to the contemporary theatre-goer, would have been to &quot;Teatrum Mundi&quot; (&quot;Theatre of the World&quot;), a meditation by the twelfth-century philosopher John of Salisbury, in his &quot;Policraticus&quot;, book three. This included a discourse on theatrical metaphors from the Bible and from many authors from classical antiquity. Reprinted in 1595, it was in wide circulation and much read. Critic Ernst Curtius has described how it was John of Salisbury&#x27;s commentary, rather than the works of Petronius, that suggested the name. 

There would have been a ready understanding of the classical derivation. Shakespeare&#x27;s complaint in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (act 2, scene 3) likening the child actors of the Blackfriars Theatre stealing the Globe&#x27;s custom as &quot;carrying off Hercules […] and his load too&quot; alludes to the metaphor. An elegy on the death of Globe actor Richard Burbage alludes to the god Atlas on the theatre&#x27;s flag, but in mythology the figures of Atlas and Hercules can be interchangeable, as one of the labours of Hercules was to relieve Atlas of his burden. G. B. Harrison, in his introduction to an edition of &quot;As You Like It&quot; (Penguin Books, 1953), perceives that Jaques is making reference to the Globe Theatre&#x27;s motto in his &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; speech (act 2 scene 7).

<text>Inwood Hill Park is a public park in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. On a high schist ridge that rises above the Hudson River from Dyckman Street to the northern tip of the island, Inwood Hill Park&#x27;s densely folded, glacially scoured topography contains the largest remaining old-growth forest on the island of Manhattan. The area is also known as the Shorakapkok Preserve, &quot;shorakapkok&quot; meaning &#x27;the sitting place&#x27; in the Munsee language used by the Wecquaesgeek tribe who inhabited the area for nearly 700 years. Unlike other Manhattan parks, Inwood Hill Park is largely natural and consists of mostly wooded, non-landscaped hills.

==History==

=== Site ===

Inwood Hill Park has a human history that goes back to the pre-Columbian era. Through the 17th century, the Wecquaesgeek, a Munsee-speaking band of Wappinger people, inhabited the area. There is evidence of a main encampment along the eastern edge of the park, known as the village of Shorakapok. The Wecquaesgeek relied on both the Hudson and Harlem Rivers as sources for food. Artifacts and the remains of old campfires were found in Inwood&#x27;s rock shelters, suggesting their use for shelter and temporary living quarters.

Fort Cockhill, one of many forts built in New York by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, stood in the northwestern extremity of the park. A small, five-sided earthen structure equipped with two cannons, it overlooked the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek at its confluence with the Hudson River. At the time, the area was known from colonial to post–Revolutionary War times as Cox&#x27;s Hill or Tubby Hook Hill.

European colonization introduced numerous farm and garden weeds, such as dandelions and the common plantain; they cleared the forest and established farms, including the planting of orchards and herbs. Both the British and American troops burned the forests of what would become Inwood Hill Park during the Revolutionary War.

Even though the area which is now Inwood Hill Park was the site of one of the last farms in Manhattan – which lasted to at least c. 1890 – by the 19th century, it was largely the location of country retreats for some of the wealthier families of the community and the rest of New York&#x27;s social elite. One such notable who had a summer estate in Inwood was Isidor Straus, co-owner of the Macy&#x27;s department store and a passenger on the ill-fated voyage of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The Lords of the Lord &amp; Taylor department store chain owned two mansions built within the park; both mansions were destroyed by fire in the latter part of the 19th century. Additionally, an orphanage was located high on a bluff in what is now Inwood Hill Park in the nineteenth century. The site today includes a small paved area and park benches; no trace of the building remains. At least three freshwater springs arise in the park, one of which was used for drinking water by the workers who constructed the Henry Hudson Bridge. Some land in the north was formerly known as Cold Spring.

Historically, the area now encompassed by Inwood Hill Park has been largely unaffected by development.

=== Use as park ===

Andrew Haswell Green, an early commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation, first suggested that a park be created in Inwood in 1895 for the newly formed department. His idea did not gain traction quickly, but the archeological finds in the area by individuals such as Reginald Pelham Bolton, the unique geology of the hill, historical associations (both true and merely rumored), the inherent beauty of the landscape, and the views to be seen from it finally brought the city around. Between 1915 and the early 1940s, it purchased parcels of land that make up the park as it is today.

The park was officially opened on May 8, 1926. Squatters who lived in the abandoned estates around the perimeter of the park were removed in the 1930s by Robert Moses and the Works Project Administration (WPA). Moses built the West Side Highway, which cuts directly through the park, and cut many of the historic tulip trees which dated back to the Revolutionary War. The WPA also paved over some trails and illuminated them with lampposts, many of which are now in need of repair. Arson and dumping have damaged the park and its integrity, as have erosion-control measures which were not well conceived.

In 1992, the central, old-growth forest area was designated as Shorakapok Preserve.

On September 15, 1995, the Inwood Hill Nature Center was dedicated and opened to the public. It is located near the park entrance on 218th Street and Indian Road, and is on a peninsula that was formerly connected to the Bronx mainland before the digging of the Harlem River Ship Canal. The center is located on Manhattan&#x27;s only salt-water marsh, and has been designated as an interactive exhibit with ongoing monitoring of the natural area. It is also the focal point to watch the eagles that have been placed in the park to be freed when they are able to adjust to the environment.

=== Great Tulip Tree and Shorakapok Rock ===

The park&#x27;s Shorakapok Preserve was formerly the site of a &quot;Great Tulip Tree&quot;, a &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; considered the largest tree on Manhattan, as well as one of the oldest, and was championed and restored by Parks Commissioner Charles B. Stover. As part of care for the tree, a plaque was put up connecting it to Hudson&#x27;s voyages, a few years after the Hudson–Fulton Celebration, commemorating the 300th anniversary of Hudson&#x27;s work and the 100th anniversary of Fulton&#x27;s. The original plaque also connected the tree to Native American archaeological finds nearby, speculating that some of the Native Americans at Shorakapok could have interacted with Hudson. Hudson actually engaged in a battle from his ship with Native Americans at nearby Nipinichsen, just north of Spuyten Duyvil Creek, on October 2, 1609. The tree survived for centuries until it was felled by a storm in 1933.
Until the 1950s the stump was still to be seen, surrounded by a large iron fence, but as it rotted it was finally removed and a boulder and plaque replaced it. Peter Minuit Post 1247 of the American Legion placed the boulder and the plaque in 1954, commemorating the 300th anniversary of New Amsterdam gaining municipal rights a year earlier. The plaque labels the boulder &quot;Shorakkopoch&quot; (a more recent Parks Department sign nearby calls it &quot;Shorakapok Rock&quot;), and claims that &quot;according to legend&quot; this is where Minuit negotiated the purchase of Manhattan Island from Native Americans. The account does not appear in any historical records, and some historians place any such meeting location in Lower Manhattan. The association of a &quot;treaty tree&quot; in different locations with land acquisition has been noted as a common myth that promotes a narrative of peaceful colonial settlement.

==Geography==
The park covers . The Henry Hudson Parkway and Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Connection railroad line run through it, and at its northern end the Henry Hudson Bridge and the rail-only Spuyten Duyvil Bridge link Manhattan to the Bronx.

The park&#x27;s western boundary is the Hudson River, and the southern boundary is Dyckman Street. From Dyckman to 204th Street the eastern boundary is Payson Avenue, from 204th to 214th Street it is Seaman Avenue, and from 215th Street to the park&#x27;s end at 218th Street the eastern boundary is Indian Road. footpaths criss-cross the park, allowing easy access to Dyckman Street, Fort Tryon Park, Fort Washington Park, and Riverside Park – part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. Some of these trails are former roads leading to what were once summer estates that later were brought under the control of the city in the creation of the park. Bolton Road, which was the main drive to the Bolton estate, is now the primary pedestrian pathway within the park; its entrance marked by a sign located on Payson Avenue.

Inwood Hill Park is geologically diverse, with marble, schist, and limestone all prevalent in the area. The park is next to the seismologically active Dyckman Street Fault which runs parallel along the southern border of the park. As recently as 1989, activity of this fault caused a magnitude 2 earthquake.

==Fauna and flora==
One of the earliest known records of the flora of Inwood was recorded by W. W. Denslow, then a resident of Inwood, around 1863. The Torrey Botanical Society, newly formed in 1867, noted several orchid species growing on the west slopes of a ridge in Inwood, as well as around Spuyten Duyvil, including a small colony of &quot;Tipularia discolor&quot;, that the group scrupulously cared for. Denslow also recorded two uncommon species of &quot;Habenaria&quot; in the salt marshes around Inwood.

The forest of Inwood Hill Park is within a region once designated as an oak-chestnut forest. Due to the demise of the American chestnut due to chestnut blight, the forest composition has altered drastically since 1917 and is now oak-hickory dominated.

The area of the park along the Harlem River includes Muscota Marsh, one of Manhattan&#x27;s last remaining natural salt marshes, the other being Smuggler&#x27;s Cove, which attracts large numbers of waterbirds. These waterfowl can be studied further via educational programs held at the Nature Center at the north end of the property. Mallards, Canada geese and ring-billed gulls are year-round residents, using both the water and the nearby lawns and ball fields. Many wading birds and waterfowl pass through on the spring and fall migrations, and herons and cormorants often spend the summer. The salt marsh is also home to many fish, mollusks, and crustaceans which live among the cordgrass and bulrushes, which can tolerate both salt and fresh water.

The woods support a wide variety of birds, including common species such as blue jays and cardinals, as well as wild turkeys. Birds of prey that breed in the park include red-tailed hawks and owls. A five-year project that began in summer 2002 attempted to reintroduce the bald eagle to Manhattan using hacking boxes in the park and eaglets brought in from the Midwest. In the first summer, three of the four introduced eaglets fledged successfully; three or four fledged each year of the program. The nesting structure was removed in 2009.

Animals found in the park include Eastern and meadow voles, red-bellied salamanders, southern flying squirrels, opossums, white-footed deer mice, and cottontail rabbits, as well as the expected eastern grey squirrels and raccoons. Foxes were also once residents, but the increasing number of coyotes spotted in Central Park and in the Bronx&#x27;s Van Cortlandt Park may account for the foxes&#x27; apparent current absence.

Although the park does not support large wild mammals, the local wildlife does include raccoons and skunks as well as rodents typical to large urban areas. Residents and non-residents alike hunt for fish from the riverbank at the north end of the park.

The park has both native and invasive plant species. While the presence of plant life is obvious, the fauna may not be as revealing.

===Native and non-native species===
Native species from nurseries were added to the park to provide greater vegetation, such as &quot;Abies balsamea&quot;, &quot;Acer rubrum&quot;, &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, &quot;Aesculus&quot;, and &quot;Betula lenta&quot;. Non-native species were also introduced to the park, affecting the native species. Some of the non-native species present were &quot;Rubus phoenicolasius&quot; (once rare and now the most prevalent &quot;Rubus&quot; species in the park), paper mulberry (L) Vent., &quot;Morus alba&quot; L, and &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; (Thund.) Steudel. In the 1930s, a total of 83 species were found, of which 32 were non-native species.

Nearly all of the orchid species reported by Denslow in Manhattan and what is now the Bronx had disappeared by the turn of the 20th century. The only species of orchid still found in Inwood Hill Park is &quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot;, an introduced and invasive species which is native to Europe.

==Usage==

The park contains three playgrounds, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis and basketball courts. The Inwood Hill Nature Center at the north end of the park is both a location for educational programs and the local headquarters of the Urban Park Rangers. Inwood Hill Park&#x27;s ball-fields are heavily used by local and other city leagues during the baseball season. This usage places extreme pressure on the park, which, as a result, has required more active management in recent years.

Inwood Hill Park also has facilities for barbecuing, a dogs run, and kayak and canoe launches. The park highlights specific activities that contribute to the park usage such as the hiking trail and the Hudson River Bike Trail. Inwood Hill Park is also a popular area for rock climbing, with over 50 documented bouldering routes across many boulders throughout the park.

The lack of green space in the eastern part of Inwood and the Bronx nearby creates an enormous demand for picnicking with barbecues and table/chair setups, activity that is either illegal or tightly controlled in most other city parks; however, Inwood Hill Park has managed this by permitting such setups on the manicured, maintained peninsula portion of the park.

New York Road Runners hosts a weekly 2.75-mile Open Run.

== Economic impact ==

Urban parks have a significant economic impact on surrounding communities. The development and evolution of Inwood Hill Park&#x27;s flora and fauna are intrinsically linked to the financial stability of New York City and its residents. Fiscal investments of the state have a significant impact on the health and species diversity of flora and fauna in New York city parks. During the New York fiscal crisis in 1975, the New York state government decided it would be prudent to cut funding for the maintenance of New York parks and redistribute the money to other areas of public and private services. Consequently, many public workers in New York City parks were laid off. 
The Protected Native Plants Program was created in 1989 to provide regulatory protection for native New York state plants and was subsequently updated in 2012 in accordance with new data provided by the New York Natural Heritage Program.

In contrast to more visited parks such as Central Park, which receive a substantial amount of funding from donations from the surrounding community, a majority of Inwood Hill Park&#x27;s funding is provided by a combination of grants and property taxes, common methods of funding parks in low-income areas. Partnerships for Parks, a nonprofit organization, has partnered with the city of New York to maintain and manage parks and promote their use.

The Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act passed as a ballot initiative in the November 2022 New York state general election. As part of this approved initiative, New York plans to set aside $4.2 billion in order to enhance, allocate and redevelop the natural landscape and environment of the state. Of these funds, $650 million will be allocated to parks, open spaces, and agricultural lands. This will involve the purchase of land for conservation, restoration/beautification of parks, and the expansion of the proportion of state-owned land. It is expected that the Bond Act will result in the creation of approximately 84,000 jobs. A six- to nine-month training program designed to provide employees with an understanding of the environment will be provided by the Parks Opportunities Program, and will include training on soil composition, tree types, and plant and animal species.

==In popular culture==
The park is a central location in the 2013 science fiction novel &quot;The Orion Project&quot;, due to its being a low-population area of a brightly lit city.

In probability theory and statistics, the Bernoulli distribution, named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability formula_7 and the value 0 with probability formula_8. Less formally, it can be thought of as a model for the set of possible outcomes of any single experiment that asks a yes–no question. Such questions lead to outcomes that are Boolean-valued: a single bit whose value is success/yes/true/one with probability &quot;p&quot; and failure/no/false/zero with probability &quot;q&quot;. It can be used to represent a (possibly biased) coin toss where 1 and 0 would represent &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;, respectively, and &quot;p&quot; would be the probability of the coin landing on heads (or vice versa where 1 would represent tails and &quot;p&quot; would be the probability of tails). In particular, unfair coins would have formula_9

The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution where a single trial is conducted (so &quot;n&quot; would be 1 for such a binomial distribution). It is also a special case of the two-point distribution, for which the possible outcomes need not be 0 and 1.

==Properties==
If formula_10 is a random variable with a Bernoulli distribution, then:

:formula_11

The probability mass function formula_12 of this distribution, over possible outcomes &quot;k&quot;, is

:formula_13

This can also be expressed as

:formula_14

or as

:formula_15

The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution with formula_16

The kurtosis goes to infinity for high and low values of formula_17 but for formula_18 the two-point distributions including the Bernoulli distribution have a lower excess kurtosis, namely −2, than any other probability distribution.

The Bernoulli distributions for formula_19 form an exponential family.

The maximum likelihood estimator of formula_7 based on a random sample is the sample mean.

==Mean==
The expected value of a Bernoulli random variable formula_10 is

:formula_22

This is because for a Bernoulli distributed random variable formula_10 with formula_24 and formula_25 we find

:formula_26

== Variance ==
The variance of a Bernoulli distributed formula_10 is

:formula_28

We first find

:formula_29 
:formula_30

From this follows

:formula_31 
:formula_32

With this result it is easy to prove that, for any Bernoulli distribution, its variance will have a value inside formula_33.

==Skewness==
The skewness is formula_34. When we take the standardized Bernoulli distributed random variable formula_35 we find that this random variable attains formula_36 with probability formula_7 and attains formula_38 with probability formula_39. Thus we get

:formula_40

==Higher moments and cumulants==
The raw moments are all equal because formula_41 and formula_42.

:formula_43

The central moment of order formula_44 is given by
:formula_45
The first six central moments are
:formula_46
The higher central moments can be expressed more compactly in terms of formula_47 and formula_48
:formula_49
The first six cumulants are
:formula_50

==Entropy and Fisher&#x27;s Information==

===Entropy===
Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a probability distribution. For a Bernoulli random variable formula_10 with success probability formula_7 and failure probability formula_53, the entropy formula_54 is defined as:

:formula_55

The entropy is maximized when formula_56, indicating the highest level of uncertainty when both outcomes are equally likely. The entropy is zero when formula_57 or formula_58, where one outcome is certain.

===Fisher&#x27;s Information===
Fisher information measures the amount of information that an observable random variable formula_10 carries about an unknown parameter formula_7 upon which the probability of formula_10 depends. For the Bernoulli distribution, the Fisher information with respect to the parameter formula_7 is given by:

:formula_63

Proof:

*The Likelihood Function for a Bernoulli random variableformula_10 is:

:formula_65
This represents the probability of observing formula_10 given the parameter formula_7.

*The Log-Likelihood Function is:

:formula_68

*The Score Function (the first derivative of the log-likelihood w.r.t. formula_7 is:

:formula_70

*The second derivative of the log-likelihood function is:

:formula_71

*Fisher information is calculated as the negative expected value of the second derivative of the log-likelihood:

:formula_72

It is maximized when formula_56, reflecting maximum uncertainty and thus maximum information about the parameter formula_7.

==Related distributions==
*If formula_75 are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, all Bernoulli trials with success probability &quot;p&quot;, then their sum is distributed according to a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;:
*:formula_76 (binomial distribution).

:The Bernoulli distribution is simply formula_77, also written as formula_78

*The categorical distribution is the generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for variables with any constant number of discrete values.
*The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution.
*The geometric distribution models the number of independent and identical Bernoulli trials needed to get one success.
*If formula_79, then formula_80 has a Rademacher distribution.

<text>Beniamino Gigli ( , ; 20 March 1890 – 30 November 1957) was an Italian opera singer (lyric tenor). He is widely regarded as one of the greatest tenors of his generation.

==Early life==
Gigli was born in Recanati, in the Marche, the son of a shoemaker who loved opera. His parents did not, however, view music as a secure career. Beniamino&#x27;s brother Lorenzo became a well-known painter.

==Career==
In 1914, he won first prize in an international singing competition in Parma. His operatic debut came on 15 October 1914, when he played Enzo in Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; in Rovigo, following which he was in great demand.

Gigli made many important debuts in quick succession, and always in &quot;Mefistofele&quot;: Teatro Massimo in Palermo (31 March 1915), Teatro di San Carlo in Naples (26 December 1915), Teatro Costanzi di Roma (26 December 1916), La Scala, Milan (19 November 1918), Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires (28 June 1919) and finally the Metropolitan Opera, New York City (26 November 1920). Two other great Italian tenors present on the roster of Met singers during the 1920s also happened to be Gigli&#x27;s chief contemporary rivals for tenor supremacy in the Italian repertory — namely, Giovanni Martinelli and Giacomo Lauri-Volpi.

Some of the roles with which Gigli became particularly associated during this period included Edgardo in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot; and the title role in Umberto Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, both of which he would later record in full.

Gigli rose to true international prominence after the death of the great Italian tenor Enrico Caruso in 1921. Such was his popularity with audiences he was often called &quot;Caruso Secondo&quot;, though he much preferred to be known as &quot;Gigli Primo&quot;. In fact, the comparison was not valid as Caruso had a bigger, darker, more heroic voice than Gigli&#x27;s sizable yet honey-toned lyric instrument.

Gigli left the Met in 1932, ostensibly after refusing to take a pay cut. Giulio Gatti-Casazza, the Met&#x27;s then general manager, was furious at his company&#x27;s most popular male singer; he told the press that Gigli was the only singer not to accept the pay cut. There were in fact several others, Lily Pons and Rosa Ponselle among them; and it is well documented that Gatti-Casazza gave himself a large pay increase in 1931, so that after the pay cut in 1932 his salary remained the same as it had been originally. Furthermore, Gatti was careful to hide Gigli&#x27;s counter offer from the press, in which the singer offered to sing five or six concerts gratis, which in dollars saved was worth more than Gatti&#x27;s imposed pay cut.

After leaving the Met, Gigli returned again to Italy, and sang in houses there, elsewhere in Europe, and in South America. He was criticised for being a favourite singer of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, having recorded the Fascist anthem &quot;Giovinezza&quot; in 1937 (it is noticeably excluded from his &quot;Edizione Integrale&quot;, released by EMI). Toward the end of World War II, he was able to give few performances. However, he immediately returned to the stage when the war ended in 1945, and the audience acclaim was greater and more clamorous than ever.

In addition to his stage performances, Gigli appeared as an actor in over twenty films from 1935 to 1953. Some notable appearances include 1936&#x27;s Johannes Riemann-directed musical drama &quot;Ave Maria&quot; opposite actress Käthe von Nagy and Giuseppe Fatigati&#x27;s 1943 drama &quot;I Pagliacci&quot; (English release title: &quot;Laugh Pagliacci&quot;), opposite Italian actress Alida Valli.

In the last few years of his life, Gigli gave concert performances more often than he appeared on stage. Before his retirement in 1955, Gigli undertook an exhausting world tour of farewell concerts, including performances at the Metropolitan Opera. This impaired his health in the two years that remained to him, during which time he helped prepare his memoirs (based primarily on an earlier memoir, fleshed out by a series of interviews). Gigli was initiated to Freemasonry.

==Death==
He died of pneumonia in Rome in 1957.

==Personal life==
Like many artists, Gigli was a man of contradictions. On one hand, he gave more fund-raising concerts and raised more money than any other singer in history, with close to one thousand benefit concerts. He was deeply devoted to Padre Pio, his confessor, to whom he donated a large amount of money. Also, Gigli sang an unusual amount of sacred music (especially in the 1950s), atypical of a leading operatic tenor. Additionally, he was throughout his life deeply devoted to the sacred music of Don Lorenzo Perosi.

On the other hand, Gigli&#x27;s relationships with women were often tainted by scandal.

He said in his memoirs he married six months earlier than he actually did; this was to conceal the fact that his wife Costanza was pregnant before reaching the altar. Gigli had two children with Costanza: Enzo and Rina. (The latter was a well-known soprano in her own right.)

Later, Gigli is well known to have had a second family with Lucia Vigarani, producing three children.

Gigli is rumoured to have had at least three other children with as many different women. Gigli&#x27;s exact number of offspring is unknown.

One known son is Phillip (Phil) J. Hildebrandt of Detroit, born in February 1934 in New York and still living. He is the son of Gloria Doyle, who was an opera singer at The Metropolitan Opera. Phil Hildebrandt&#x27;s children (Gigli&#x27;s American-born grandchildren) are comedian William (Bill) Hildebrandt (1953-2021) and Lori Jean Hildebrandt, both of Detroit, Michigan.

==Vocal style==
Early in his career, Gigli was known for a beautiful, soft and honey-like lyric voice, with an incredible mezza-voice, allowing him to sing light, lyrical roles. As he grew older, his voice developed some dramatic qualities, enabling him to sing heavier roles like Ràdames in &quot;Aida&quot; and Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;. Some critics say that he was overemotional during his performances, often resolving to sobbing and, in some cases, exaggerations.

==Legacy==

Many of Gigli&#x27;s recordings, including complete operas with Maria Caniglia, Rina Gigli, Licia Albanese and Toti dal Monte, have been reissued on CD. Gigli recordings date back to the 1920s.

<text>Finland Proper or Southwest Finland (; ; , literally &quot;Duchy of Southern Finland&quot;) is a historical province in southwestern Finland, administered by its historic capital of Turku (). It borders Satakunta, Tavastia, and Uusimaa. It is also bounded by the Baltic Sea facing Åland. There was also a modern region by the name Finland Proper.

Southwest Finnish dialects are spoken in Southwest Finland.

== Administration ==
Southwest Finland was within the boundaries of the administrative province of Turku and Pori from 1917 to 1997 and that of Western Finland from 1997 to 2009, when the provinces of Finland were abolished.

== History ==
The province, which had been a part of Sweden from the 13th century, separated when Finland was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1809. The provinces have no administrative function today but live on as a historical legacy in both countries. Originally &quot;Finland&quot; referred only to this region but later replaced the traditional Österland (&quot;Eastern land&quot;) in meaning.

== Heraldry ==
Arms granted at the burial of Gustav I of Sweden in 1560. The arms is crowned by a ducal coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish comital coronet. Blazon: &quot;Gules, a crowned jousting helmet in front of two lances in saltire, all Or. On each lance is attached a forked hanging flag azure, charged with a Scandinavian cross Or.&quot;</text><links>

<doc id="199218" wikidata="Q1325487" url="?curid=199218" title="Satakunta (historical province)">
<text>Satakunta () is a historical province of Finland consisting of the regions of Satakunta and a majority of Pirkanmaa, as well as consisting of the municipalities of Soini and Ähtäri of South Ostrobothnia, Keuruu and Multia of Central Finland, as well as Loimaa and Oripää of Southwest Finland. The historical province is bordered by the historical provinces of Tavastia, Ostrobothnia and Finland Proper. The total area of the historical province is about 24,300 km2 (9,388/sq mi).
== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms of Satakunta is one of the oldest coat of arms of a historical region of Finland. The coat of arms originates from the coat of arms being granted by King Gustav Vasa to his son John III in 1557, following John III having become the duke of Finland Proper and Satakunta. 

The symbolism of the bear on the coat of arms refers to the wild nature in Satakunta. In the 19th century, the coat of arms began to be used by tax collectors in Satakunta, through which it began to become an established symbol as the coat of arms Satakunta.

== Subdivisions ==
Satakunta is further divided based on the hundreds that were used in the 15th century for Satakunta, in which Satakunta is divided into Upper Satakunta and Lower Satakunta. Most of Upper Satakunta belongs to the region of Pirkanmaa today, whilst the region of Satakunta is mostly made up of Lower Satakunta. 

The administrative centers of Lower Satakunta were Teljä and , Teljä had a marketplace on the bank of the Kokemäenjoki, and Käräjämäki was known for profitable fishing. Upper Satakunta had its administrative center in , which is currently in Tohloppi, Tampere. The terms &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower Satakunta&quot; are still used by organizations, educational institutions and companies, however not by government-affiliated organizations.

<text>Tavastia (; ; ; also called &quot;Yam&quot; (Ямь) or &quot;Yem&quot; (Емь) in Russian sources) is a historical province in the south of Finland. It borders Finland Proper, Satakunta, Ostrobothnia, Savonia and Uusimaa.

== Administration ==
From 1997 to 2010 Tavastia was divided between the administrative provinces of Southern Finland and Western Finland. However, these provinces have been abolished, and Tavastia is now divided among five regions of Finland: mainly Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), Päijänne Tavastia and Central Finland with smaller parts in Pirkanmaa and Kymenlaakso. Tavastia is the Latin name for the Tavastia Proper. Today the area is called Häme region and it is located in the southwestern section of the historical Tavastia province.

== History ==

The Tavastians are mentioned for the first time in a Viking Age runestone, which is located in present-day Gävle, Sweden (Gs 13). At that time, Tavastia extended &#x27;from salt sea to salt sea,&#x27; encompassing the inhabited Southwest Finland of the Finns in its curve. Numerous prehistoric weapons, like Ulfberht swords, and hillforts have been unearthed in the Tavastia region, indicative of its rich historical significance. The worldview of the Tavastians has been shaped by Finnish mythology.

The prehistoric era of Tavastia can be said to end with the Second Swedish Crusade in 1239 or 1249, when it became part of Sweden. After the successful campaign into Tavastia, the Swedes advanced further east until they were stopped by a Novgorodian army led by Prince Alexander Yaroslavich, who defeated the Swedes during the Battle of the Neva in July 1240 and received the sobriquet &quot;Nevsky&quot; for his victory in the battle. The construction of the Häme Castle began in the 1260s, on the orders of Birger Jarl. It was to be the centre of the three Slottslänen - &quot;castle fiefs, castle counties&quot;, sg. Slottslän - the other two being the castle of Turku () in Finland Proper and Viipuri () castle in Karelia. After the peace Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323 the castle lost some of its importance as a defence against the East but remained an administrative centre. When Finland was ceded to Russia in September 1809, the province ceased to be a part of Sweden. The provinces have no administrative function today but live on as a historical legacy in both Finland and Sweden.

The province has been inhabited since the Stone Age. Northern Tavastia was for a long time a wilderness inhabited by Sami hunter-gatherers and frequented also by Finnish hunters. Only during the late Middle Ages was agriculture slowly introduced to the northern parts of the province. In the 19th century, the growth of the forest industry started to bring new wealth to the area. The waterways of Näsijärvi and Vanajavesi provided easy transport for timber. The most notable centres of the paper industry were, and still are, Mänttä and Valkeakoski. The most notable industrial center in historical Tavastia, however, is Tampere, where a number of large textile mills and metal factories have been operating since the early 19th century.

== Geography ==
Western Tavastia extends over both sides of the great Kokemäenjoki drainage basin. In Eastern Tavastia, the regions of Päijänne Tavastia and Central Finland are located around the shores of Lake Päijänne. The Southern borders of the province roughly follow the Salpausselkä ridge. The Southern parts of the province consist of plains intermixed with fields and forests. Towards the north, the land gradually rises and becomes more hilly. At the same time, the proportion of cultivated land decreases, and forest and heath become increasingly dominant. The northern boundary of Tavastia is in Central Finland. As this area was settled only at the time of the replacement of the old provincial system with the county system, the ancient provincial boundary is uncertain in this area. The same applies to the northwestern border with Satakunta, which is located in Pirkanmaa.

As a result of the original pattern of settlement, the inhabited areas are located around the waterways, fields encircling especially the largest lakes. The lakes are navigable but the rapids of Kymijoki and Kokemäenjoki restrict navigation to the sea. Similarly, the lakes form three separate navigable areas. Lake Näsijärvi can be navigated for over 100 kilometers north of Tampere, while the lakes Pyhäjärvi, Vanajavesi and Roine have been connected by canals since the 19th century, forming another significant waterway. On the other hand, Lake Päijänne, the second largest lake in Finland, connects Lahti and Päijänne Tavastia to Central Finland and Jyväskylä.

== Heraldry ==
Arms granted at the burial of Gustav I of Sweden in 1560. The arms are crowned by a ducal coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish count&#x27;s coronet. Blazon: &quot;Gules, a lynx passant or, ear tufts sable; in chief three mullets of six, in base four roses, all argent&quot;.

Originally from Antwerp, a branch of the family relocated to Basel in 1620.
While their origin in Antwerp is certain, proposed earlier connections with the Dutch family of Italian ancestry called &quot;Bornouilla&quot; (&quot;Bernoullie&quot;), or with the Castilian family &quot;de Bernuy&quot; (&quot;Bernoille&quot;, &quot;Bernouille&quot;), are uncertain.

The first known member of the family was Leon Bernoulli (d. 1561), a doctor in Antwerp, at that time part of the Spanish Netherlands. His son, Jacob, emigrated to Frankfurt am Main in 1570 to escape from the Spanish persecution of the Protestants. Jacob&#x27;s grandson, a spice trader, also named Jacob, moved to Basel, Switzerland in 1620, and was granted citizenship in 1622. His son, (Nicolaus, 1623–1708), Leon&#x27;s great-great-grandson, married Margarethe Schönauer.

===Notable academic members===
Margarethe and Niklaus had four sons, of whom Johann and Hieronymus became the progenitors of the &quot;greater&quot; and the &quot;lesser&quot; branches of the family, respectively. The four sons of Margarethe and Niklaus were:
* Jacob Bernoulli (1654–1705; also known as James or Jacques), mathematician after whom Bernoulli numbers are named, and author of the early probability text &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot;
* Nicolaus Bernoulli (1662–1716), painter and alderman of Basel
* Johann Bernoulli (1667–1748; also known as Jean), mathematician and early adopter of infinitesimal calculus
* Hieronymus Bernoulli (1669–1760), m. Catharina Ebneter

In addition to Jacob and Johann, the Bernoulli family of mathematicians is generally taken to include:
* Nicolaus I Bernoulli (1687–1759), son of Nicolaus, mathematician, worked on curves, differential equations, and probability; originator of the St. Petersburg paradox
* Nicolaus II Bernoulli (1695–1726), son of Johann
* Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), son of Johann, developer of Bernoulli&#x27;s principle and originator of the concept of expected utility for resolving the St. Petersburg paradox
* Johann II Bernoulli (1710–1790; also known as Jean), son of Johann, mathematician and physicist
* Johann III Bernoulli (1744–1807; also known as Jean), son of Johann II, astronomer, geographer and mathematician
* Jakob II Bernoulli (1759–1789; also known as Jacques), son of Johann II, physicist and mathematician

Several more recent prominent scholars are also descended from the family, including:
* (1831–1913), art historian and archaeologist; noted for his &quot;Römische Ikonographie&quot; (1882 onwards) on Roman Imperial portraits 
*Ludwig Bernoully (1873–1928), German architect in Frankfurt
* Hans Bernoulli (1876–1959), architect and designer of the Bernoullihäuser in Zurich and Grenchen SO
* Elisabeth Bernoulli (1873–1935), suffragette and campaigner against alcoholism

The surname survives in Switzerland, with 11 entries in the white pages for the city of Basel as of 2024.

<doc id="199227" wikidata="Q688468" url="?curid=199227" title="Minoritenkirche (Vienna)">
<text>The Minoritenkirche (&#x27;, related to the monastic [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual]] monks), formally calledItalienische Nationalkirche Maria Schnee(&#x27;, related to the Italian Congregation who was the owner of this church), was built in French Gothic style in the &quot;Altstadt&quot; or First District of Vienna, Austria.

The site on which the church is built was given to followers of Francis of Assisi in 1224. The foundation stone was laid by King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1276. Duke Albrecht II later supported the building process, especially the main portal. The Gothic Ludwig choir was built between 1316 and 1328, and used as a mausoleum in the 14th and 15th centuries. Construction of the church was completed in 1350.

The top of its belltower was damaged during the first Austro-Turkish war, rebuilt, then again destroyed again during the second Austro-Turkish war; the top was then replaced by a flat roof.

When Joseph II gave the church to the Italians as a present, they transferred the name &quot;Maria Schnee&quot; (&quot;Mary of the Snows&quot;) from their nearby chapel which was subsequently destroyed.

Following disagreements between the church owner (the Italian Congregation Mary of the Snows) and the Archdiocese of Vienna, the Italian community was moved to the Church of the Holy Trinity of the Friars Minor in the Alservorstadt. After two years of uncertainty, in 2021 the Italian Congregation donated the Minoritenkirche to the Society of Saint Pius X, which operates it to this day.

== History ==
The church is located in the Innere Stadt of Vienna, northwest of the Hofburg, at the Minoritenplatz. The Minoriten were Franciscan friars (Latin: &quot;fratres minores&quot;). They were appointed to Vienna in 1224.

After the city fire of 1275, the foundation-stone for the new church was laid by Ottokar Přemysl. It was one of the first Gothic churches in the east-Austrian area. After Ottokar&#x27;s death in the battle on the Marchfeld, he was laid out here for thirty weeks.

A crucial break came in 1782, when the Minorite church was closed in the course of the religious politics of Joseph II. The church thereupon was renamed the &quot;Italian National Church of Mary of the Snow&quot; (Santa Maria Maggiore) – a name which still exists today. In the course of the evacuation of their church, the Franciscan friars minor brought the cross provided with a picture of Christ hanging over the high altar of their church in Wimpassing, so that, when it came back to Vienna some centuries later, it was called the &quot;Wimpassinger cross.&quot; Today a copy of it hangs in the Stephansdom cathedral.

In 2019, a split occurred between the owner of the church (the Italian Congregation Mary of the Snows, led by Mrs Daniela Panella Jirout) and Father Thomas Manalil , vicar of the parish, leading to the latter&#x27;s resignation. Despite repeated requests by the Congregation, the Archdiocese of Vienna did not appoint a new vicar. After two years of uncertainty, on 25 May 2021 the Congregation donated the Minoritenkirche to the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), a traditionalist Catholic clerical fraternity which is currently not in full communion with the Holy See. The SSPX started to operate the church on 3 June 2022. Since then, the Tridentine Mass is offered daily on working days and twice on Sunday.

== Exterior ==

The whole building follows the pattern of French Cathedral architecture. The building masters are unknown; however, it is commonly attributed to Jacobus Parisiensis, Fra Giacomo of Paris, who was the confessor of Duke Albrecht II. The portal follows a French pattern, rare for Austria. The tympanum is divided by circle impacts into three fields, whereby in the middle field, Christ on a branch cross is displayed. On the left, is Mary with Mary Magdalene and other female figures; on the right, John the Evangelist, Saint Longinus the soldier, and other male figures. The outermost male and female figures could represent Duke Albrecht II and his wife Johanna of Pfirt, particularly since the male figure seems to wear a Duke hat. The figures are very elegant and fine-linked represented: probably a French influence, and, at the same time, an important style characteristic of the Minoritenwerkstatt, which date back until approximately 1360.

In the course of the new dedication, numerous changes were made by Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg, which were aimed particularly at the removal of baroque on the inside. Nevertheless, it was not in the final result &quot;Regotisierung,&quot; as this was called more frequently, since also parts of the Gothic building style of the Church were eliminated, in particular, the long choir.

In 1529, the spire was destroyed for the first time but rebuilt in 1633. During the second Turkish siege of 1683, it once again was destroyed. The destroyed spire was replaced by a flat roof.

In the following centuries, the church remained to a large extent unchanged, only that in different wars the tower suffered damage several times. Around 1900, the last major changes took place, in particular, the construction of the choir-like sacristy. In the course of the building of underground subways, into the late 1980s, the foundation walls of the long choir were found.

== Interior ==

There were important changes under the first Habsburgs. Blanche of France, Duchess of Austria, the wife Rudolf III, left a chapel for her grandfather, Louis IX of France (&quot;Heiliger Ludwig von Frankreich&quot; in German) on the northern side of the church, which was completed in 1328. It had a separate entrance and no connection to the nave. This was changed circa 1340, as the Ludwig chapel was combined with the two naves of the church forming a church hall with two choirs and three naves. Into the church therefore new columns were added and a new portal was constructed in the west.

The Chapel of Sf Anthony of Padua holds a Baroque altar made of polychrome marble and a glass window in the style of the 17th century.

The walls of the church are covered with frescoes of the coats of arms of Austrian aristocratic families who either contributed to the construction of the church or are buried here.

=== High altar ===

The Neo-Gothic high altar was made by Ferdinand Hohenberg. On the altarpiece is an image by Ignaz Unterberger of the Virgin Mary similar to the one venerated in Our Lady of the Snows in Rome. Flanking it are four statues: Saints Stephen of Hungary and John the Baptist to the left, and Saints John the Evangelist and Leopold the Glorious to the right.

=== Mosaic of The Last Supper ===

There is a life-sized copy of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; on the church&#x27;s northern wall. It is a mosaic made by the Roman mosaic artist Giacomo Raffaelli, commissioned by Napoleon I in 1809, but still unfinished upon his abdication. Francis II of Austria bought it, wanting to install it in the Belvedere in Vienna. As it was too large for the building, it was donated by Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria to the Italian Congregation and set up on the north wall of the church, where it remains to this day. The mosaic is 9.18 x 4.47 m and weighs approximately 20 tons.

=== Monument for Pietro Metastasio ===
This monument, made by Lucardi, was erected in memory of the Poet Laureate Metastasio in 1855. In the central relief, Pope Pius VI is depicted blessing the dying poet. Behind him are the composer Salieri followed by W.A. Mozart, while J. Haydn is looking at the Pope.

=== Madonna of Rossellino ===
This Madonna was executed by the Italian artist Antonio Gamberelli, nicknamed Antonio Rossellino, in Carrara marble (15th century).

<doc id="199229" wikidata="Q947090" url="?curid=199229" title="Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance was a Grammy Award recognizing superior vocal performance by a male in the pop category, the first of which was presented in 1959. It was discontinued after the 2011 Grammy season. The award went to the artist. Singles or tracks only are eligible.

The awards have quite a convoluted history:
*From 1959 to 1960 there was an award called Best Vocal Performance, Male, which was for work in the pop field
*In 1961 the award was separated into Best Vocal Performance Single Record Or Track and Best Vocal Performance Album, Male
*From 1962 to 1963 the awards from the previous year were combined into Best Solo Vocal Performance, Male
*From 1964 to 1968 the award was called Best Vocal Performance, Male

<doc id="199230" wikidata="Q1341125" url="?curid=199230" title="Uusimaa (historical province)">
<text>Uusimaa (Swedish: &quot;Nyland&quot;) is a historical province in the south of Finland. It borders Finland Proper, Tavastia, Savonia, and Karelia. The English translation would be &quot;new land&quot;. From the Middle Ages to 1809, most of the present-day Finland was a part of Sweden. Uusimaa (Nyland) was thus also included among the historical Swedish provinces.

==History==
Along with the rest of southern and western Finland, Uusimaa was ruled by the Kingdom of Sweden from the 12th or 13th century onwards. Coastal Uusimaa had earlier been semi-deserted, but was soon populated by Swedish settlers.

All the provinces of Finland were ceded to Russia in September 1809, after the 1808-1809 Finnish War. Uusimaa became Uudenmaan lääni in the old lääni (province) system until 1997, when it was merged into the new administrative province of Southern Finland. In 2010 the administrative provinces were abolished and Uusimaa was divided between two new regions of Finland, Uusimaa and Eastern Uusimaa. However, this arrangement lasted for only one year, and in 2011 Eastern Uusimaa was merged into Uusimaa, which now forms a single administrative unit once again.

==Culture==
Historically, coastal Uusimaa was a Swedish-speaking area. However, the capital of Finland, Helsinki, and most of the other towns in Uusimaa now have Finnish-speaking majorities.

==Heraldry==

The arms of Uusimaa were granted at the burial of Gustav I of Sweden in 1560. The arms are crowned by a count&#x27;s coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish baronial coronet. Blazon: &quot;Azure, between two bars wavy Argent, a boat Or with rudder.&quot;

<doc id="199236" wikidata="Q853706" url="?curid=199236" title="Savonia (historical province)">
<text>Savonia (; ) is a historical province in the east of Finland. It borders Tavastia, Ostrobothnia and Karelia. Savonia is now divided into two provinces: North Savonia and South Savonia. The largest cities in Savonia by population are Kuopio, Mikkeli, Savonlinna, Varkaus and Iisalmi.

==Administration==

In the 19th century, Savonia was divided between Kuopio Province and Mikkeli Province. From 1997 to 2010, it lay within the administrative province of Eastern Finland. The provinces have no administrative function today but survive as ceremonial units. Since 2010, Savonia has been divided between the regions of North Savonia and South Savonia.

==History==
The province of Savo represents the original homeland of the Savonians, one of the subgroups that later became assimilated to form the Finns. It was the heartland of the east Finnish or Savonian dialects.

The people of Savonia traditionally pursued slash-and-burn agriculture, which settlers successfully imported into Ostrobothnia and Kainuu, Värmland in southwestern Sweden, and eastern Norway. Savonian settlers also migrated to Finnish Karelia, Ingria (see: Ingrian Finns) and to southern Sweden, parts of northern Sweden, and Norway (see: Forest Finns).

Savonia, which had been a part of Sweden from the late-13th century, was separated from Sweden when Finland was ceded to Russia in September 1809.

==Culture==
Traditionally, the Savonian people have often been considered as &quot;sneaky&quot;. Recent research has shown that this reputation is largely due to misunderstandings caused by Savonians&#x27; traditional lack of social directness.

==Heraldry==
The arms of Savonia are crowned by a count&#x27;s coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish baronial coronet. Blazon: &quot;Sable, a drawn hand bow in and arrow aimed toward dexter chief, or; bow string, arrowhead and feathered tail, argent.&quot; The traditional colors of the province are black and gold.

<doc id="199237" wikidata="Q6230" url="?curid=199237" title="Lippe (district)">
<text>Lippe () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Herford, Minden-Lübbecke, Höxter, Paderborn, Gütersloh, and district-free Bielefeld, which forms the region Ostwestfalen-Lippe.

The district of Lippe is named after the Lords of Lippe, who originally lived on the river Lippe and founded Lippstadt there, and their Principality of Lippe. It was a state within the Holy Roman Empire and retained statehood until 1947, when it became a district of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==History==
The Lippe district nearly covers the same area as the historic county of Lippe. The first mention of this country was in 1123; it grew in power slowly in the following centuries. In 1528 it became a county, in 1789 it was elevated to a principality.
Unlike many other countries of the Holy Roman Empire in the area, Lippe kept its independence in the Napoleonic era, and thus wasn&#x27;t incorporated into Prussia afterwards. It was one of the smaller member states of the German empire.

After the death of Prince Woldemar in 1895, the two lines of the House of Lippe fought over the regency for over a decade.

The last prince of Lippe was forced to abdicate during the November Revolution of 1918 following the Collapse of the Imperial German Army, whilst Germany as a whole became the Weimar Republic. The district became a &quot;Freistaat&quot; one of the constituent parts of the new republic. In 1932 the Free State of Lippe was subdivided into two districts, Detmold and Lemgo. These continued to exist when in 1947 Lippe lost its status as a state of Germany and by order of the British military government was incorporated into the new federal state North Rhine-Westphalia; in 1949 this change was approved by the parliament. In 1969/70 the 168 cities and municipalities were merged to 16; and as the second part of the administrative reform in 1973 the two districts Lemgo and Detmold were merged to the district Lippe.

==Geography==
The Lippe district covers the northern part of the Teutoburg Forest, which also contain the highest elevation of the district, the 496 meter high &quot;Köterberg&quot; near Lügde. The lowest elevation is at the Weser river with 45.5 m. The main river is the Werre, and at the northern border of the district the Weser. The Lippe River, which shares the district&#x27;s name, does not flow through Lippe, but has its headwaters right across the district line in Bad Lippspringe, Kreis Paderborn. The small territories of Lippstadt, Lipperode, and Cappel that belonged to Lippe until the mid 19th century, do lie in the valley of the river.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the traditional symbol of the state of Lippe, the rose, as the district covers nearly the same area as the historic country. In the middle of the rose 16 stamens symbolize the 16 cities and municipalities of the district. The coat of arms was granted in 1973.

Despite the relatively small size of Lippe, the Lippish rose is also one of only three symbols included in the coat of arms of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Towns and municipalities==

==Culinary art==
The most famous dish served in Lippe is the pickert. In the past it was known as a meal for poor people. The main ingredients are potatoes, flour and raisins.

<doc id="199243" wikidata="Q1914" url="?curid=199243" title="Republic of Karelia">
<text>The Republic of Karelia, Karjala or Karelia (; ) is a republic of Russia situated in the northwest of the country. The republic is a part of the Northwestern Federal District, and covers an area of , with a population of 533,121 residents. Its capital is Petrozavodsk.

The modern Karelian Republic was founded as an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR, by the Resolution of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) on 27 June 1923 and by the Decree of the VTsIK and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of 25 July 1923, from the Karelian Labour Commune. From 1940 to 1956, it was known as the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union. In 1956, it was once again made an autonomous republic and remained part of Russia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Karelia&quot; derives from the name of the ethnic group—Karelians. The name &quot;Karjala&quot; has unknown origins, however, it is theorised that it may come from the Proto-Finnish word &quot;karja&quot;, meaning &quot;herd&quot;, which was borrowed from the Proto-Germanic &quot;harjaz&quot; (&quot;army&quot;); the ending &quot;-la&quot; means &quot;earth&quot;.

==Geography==
The republic is in the northwestern part of Russia, between the White Sea and Lake Ladoga. The White Sea has a shoreline of . It has an area of . It shares internal borders with Murmansk Oblast (north), Arkhangelsk Oblast (east/south-east), Vologda Oblast (south-east/south), and Leningrad Oblast (south/south-west), and it also borders Finland (Kainuu, Lapland, North Karelia, Northern Ostrobothnia, and South Karelia); the borders measure 723 km. The main bodies of water next to Karelia are the White Sea (an inlet of the Barents Sea) to the north-east and Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga both shared with neighboring Oblasts to the south. Its highest point is the Nuorunen peak at .

===Geology===

As a part of the Fennoscandian Shield&#x27;s ancient Karelian craton, most of the Republic of Karelia&#x27;s surficial geology is Archaean or Paleoproterozoic, dated up to 3.4 billion years in the Vodlozero block. This area is the largest contiguous Archaean outcrop in Europe and one of the largest in the world.

Since deglaciation, the rate of post-glacial rebound in the Republic of Karelia has varied. Since the White Sea connected to the World&#x27;s oceans uplift along the southern coast of Kandalaksha Gulf has totaled 90 m. In the interval 9,500–5,000 years ago the uplift rate was 9–13 mm/yr. Before the Atlantic period, uplift rate had decreased to 5–5.5 mm/yr, to then rise briefly before arriving at the present uplift rate is 4 mm/yr.

===Rivers===
There are about 27,000 rivers in Karelia. Major rivers include:
* Vodla River (&quot;Vodlajoki&quot;, 149 km)
* Kem River (&quot;Kemijoki&quot;, 191 km)
* Kovda River (&quot;Koutajoki&quot;)
* Shuya River (&quot;Šuojogi&quot;)
* Suna River (&quot;Suunujoki&quot;) with Kivach Falls (&quot;Kivatšun vesiputous&quot;)
* Vyg River (&quot;Uikujoki&quot;)

===Lakes===
There are 60,000 lakes in Karelia. The republic&#x27;s lakes and swamps contain about 2,000 km3 of high-quality fresh water. Lake Ladoga (Finnish: &quot;Laatokka&quot;) and Lake Onega (&quot;Ääninen&quot;) are the largest lakes in Europe. Other lakes include:
* Nyukozero (&quot;Nuokkijärvi&quot;)
* Pyaozero (&quot;Pääjärvi&quot;)
* Segozero (&quot;Seesjärvi&quot;)
* Syamozero (&quot;Säämäjärvi&quot;)
* Topozero (&quot;Tuoppajärvi&quot;)
* Vygozero (&quot;Uikujärvi&quot;)

The lakes Ladoga and Onega are located in the south of the republic.

==History==
=== Middle ages ===

The Karelian people and culture developed during the Viking Age in the region to the west of Lake Ladoga. Karelians were first mentioned in Swedish sagas around the 10th century. Russians first mentioned Karelians in 1143, they called Karelians &quot;&quot;Korela&quot;.&quot;

Sweden&#x27;s interest in Karelia began a centuries-long struggle with Novgorod (later Russia) that resulted in numerous border changes following the many wars fought between the two, the most famous of which is the Pillage of Sigtuna of 1187. In 1137 the oldest documented settlement was established, the modern-day city of Olonets (Aunus). Karelians converted to Orthodox Christianity in 1227. The Karelians&#x27; alliance with Novgorod developed into domination by the latter in the 13th century, when Karelia became a part of Novgorod under the name of Obonezhie pyatina as an autonomy. Later Karelia had anti-Novgorod revolts in the 13th and 14th centuries.
Later Karelia became a part of Muscovy when Novgorod was annexed in the second half of the 15th century.

=== Modern era ===
During the Great Northern War (1700–1721) the modern-day capital of Karelia, the city of Petrozavodsk was founded as a cannon factory by Peter the Great.

=== 19th century ===
On 9(21) September 1801 Olonets Governorate was created by order of Alexander I.

After Russian emperor Alexander I became the Grand Duke of Finland following the Finnish War, he transferred Old Finland to the newly formed Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812. This move was regarded as a means of securing support of the Finnish nobility for the Russian emperor.

=== Early 20th century ===

In 1906, the Union of White Sea Karelians (Vienan karjalaisten liitto) was created. The Union&#x27;s main goal was to improve the life of the common Karelians and additionally develop their own national identity. The union was temporarily dissolved in 1911 after series of repressions done by the local government.

In 1917, the Murmansk Railroad was built, leading to the Karelian lands becoming more strategically important. This led much of intelligentsia to believe that the Russian tourism and Immigration into the region would rise, leading to further assimilation of the Karelians to the Russian culture.

During the Finnish and the Russian Civil Wars the local peasantry rebelled against the new Soviet State due its &quot;Prodrazverstka&quot; policy, causing several squards of the &quot;Whiteguard&quot; to cross into the Karelian lands, where then was organized a government that later swiftly declared independence from the Russian Soviet Federative Republic, creating the Uhtua Republic. Later in 1920 Finnish forces occupied Olonets, creating another puppet government, which then merged with the other Karelian state into the United Karelian Government. The regions were reclaimed by the Red Army later the same year, the Tartu peace was signed and the Karelian United Government was dissolved.

As many other ethnically non-Russian states within RSFSR, the Karelia would receive autonomy within RSFSR, establishing the Karelian Labour Commune on 8 June 1920, which enjoyed a large de-facto autonomy approved by Lenin in early 1921.

In 1921, an uprising was started by the &quot;Forest Guerrillas&quot; in an attempt to gain control over Karelia yet again, but it was defeated by the Soviets shortly after.

During the years of its existence, the Commune was actively educating the people, opening the schools and libraries as of the Likbez policy were open and maintained, the Commune was later expanded in 1923 by transferring the Kolezhemskaya, Lapinskaya, Navodnitskaya and many other posads from Arkhangelsk Governorate.

In 1923, the Karelian Labour Commune became the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic due its de-facto large autonomy, with the government of the region directly managing the local economy without having to pay its taxes to the RSFSR&#x27;s state budget. The formal increase of the autonomy was first vetoed by People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities of the RSFSR, but it was later accepted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

=== Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ===
After the Likbez policy was fulfilled, the Republic now shifted its goal from educating the people to expanding the production and electrifying the Republic according to the GOELRO plan. The first steps were the creation of Mevezegorsky and Pudozsky tree-cutting factories, the Kondopoga Paper Factory, and the launch of the Kem and the Uhta hydroelectrostations.

In the 1930s, the goal yet again shifted, now to improving the cultural and physical development and well-being of the locals by creation of many free clinics and hospitals, &quot;Houses of Physical Culture&quot;, Theaters etc.

Many of the Finns who fled to Karelia were detained and most likely shot during The Great Purge of 1937, with the Karelian ethnic Finns&#x27; population dropping to 21%. Karelia has one of the biggest burial sites of Stalinist purges in Russia, Sandarmokh, where possibly thousands of victims were executed.

=== Winter War ===

During the Winter War, a Soviet puppet government was created in occupied territories. The Finnish Democratic Republic was to incorporate most of Finland&#x27;s pre-war territories plus some western parts of the KASSR. Some members of the FDP government were also members of the KASSR government.
After the Moscow Peace Treaty territories of the Karelian Isthmus were transferred to the newly created Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. After the evacuation of Finnish Karelia, the new territories were left unpopulated, so migrants from Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and other Soviet republics moved in. To this day, this area has one of the lowest percentages of Karelian and Finnish populations in the Republic.

=== World War II ===
After the beginning of World War II, mass rallies were held on the territory of the republic, at which the inhabitants of Karelia declared their readiness to stand up for the defense of the Soviet Union. Workers of the Onega Tractor Plant wrote “We will work only in such a way as to fully meet the needs of our Red Army. We will double, triple our forces and crush, destroy the German fascists&quot;.

On 24 June 1941, after the German army crossed Zapadnaya Dvina, Finnish president Risto Ryti announced declaration of war on the Soviet Union. The Finnish army crossed the Soviet border on 1 July.

Soon after the evacuation of border regions began, On 3 July, a republican evacuation commission was created. At its first meeting, it was decided to evacuate children under 14 out of Petrozavodsk. The same decision also refers to the evacuation of 150 families of leading party and Soviet workers in Karelia. Those residents who could work had to remain in the harvest and defense work.

By September the Finnish army already reached Petrozavodsk and captured Olonets. Petrozavodsk offensive began on 20 September. To protect the city, the 7th Army under the command of General K.A. Meretskov was directly subordinated to the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander.

On 30 September, the position of the defenders of the city deteriorated sharply. The Finnish army managed to break through Soviet defenses and cut the highway to Kondopoga in the area of the Sulazhgorsky brick factory. In the south Finns came close to the city outskirts. On 1 October, due to the threat of encirclement, an order was received from the command to withdraw the main units defending the city.

The fighting near Petrozavodsk allowed the authorities to evacuate most of the civilian population and a significant part of the production capacities. In total, more than 500 thousand people were evacuated from the republic to the east. Petrozavodsk University was temporarily relocated to Syktyvkar.

After the capture of Petrozavodsk, the capital of Soviet Karelia was transferred first to Medvezhyegorsk, then to Belomorsk. Less than 90 thousand people remained in the occupied territory, half of which are representatives of the Finno-Ugric peoples: Karelians, Vepsians, and Finns. The Finnish administration has officially recognized them as a &quot;kindred&quot; population. The rest received the status of &quot;unrelated&quot; people. Most of them have been put into concentration camps, along with communists and people who could not speak Finnish or Karelian.

Former prisoners of the camps recalled that the staff often treated them more harshly than was supposed to according to the instructions. According to them, the Finns, in the presence of children, shot prisoners and beat women, children, and the elderly. One of the prisoners told the Finnish historian Helga Seppel that before leaving Petrozavodsk, the invaders shot several young people for unknown reasons.

During the occupation, Petrozavodsk was renamed to Äänislinna.

Only a few territories of the KFSSR managed to escape the Finnish occupation: the Belomorsky, Loukhsky, Kemsky, Pudozhsky regions, as well as part of the Medvezhiegorsky, Tungudsky and Ukhta regions. By 1942, about 70 thousand people lived here.

After the end of the Siege of Leningrad Soviet army was ordered to liberate Karelia.

On 21 June 1944 Svir-Petrozavodsk operation started. On 27 June the Finnish army left Petrozavodsk. By August the Soviet army reached pre-war borders.

Then the Soviet army got pushed back again and had to end the war with the help of pressure from its allies in the Moscow Armistice.

=== Post-war ===

After the end of World War II, the Karelian Isthmus was incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast and the city of Alakurtti was transferred to Murmansk Oblast.

After normalization of diplomatic relations between USSR and Finland the status of the Karelo-Finnish SSR was changed back to the Karelian ASSR in 1956. After this Karelian, Veps, and Finnish languages began a decline in usage due to the lack of support from the state and lack of education.

The transformation of the KFSSR into the Karelian ASSR was supposed to show that the USSR did not have aggressive goals against Finland.

In 1978, a Korean Air Lines Boeing 707-321B was shot down over Murmansk Oblast and landed near Louhi.

=== Present-day ===

*In August 1990 KASSR declared its sovereignty as an autonomous part of the Russian Federation, and later changed its name to the Republic of Karelia in 1991.
*In 2004 Veps National Volost was transferred to Prionezhsky District.
*In 2006 an ethnic conflict and later riot started in Kondopoga after a fight between locals and Caucasian immigrants led to 2 deaths. This caused an exodus of Muslims from Karelia.
*In 2011 a plane crashed near the village of Besovets killing 47 people.

<doc id="199249" wikidata="Q1543380" url="?curid=199249" title="Live birth (human)">
<text>In human reproduction, a live birth occurs when a fetus exits the mother showing any definite sign of life such as voluntary movement, heartbeat, or pulsation of the umbilical cord, for however brief a time and regardless of whether the umbilical cord or placenta are intact. After the fetus is expelled from the maternal body it is called a neonate. Whether the birth is vaginal or by caesarean section, and whether the neonate is ultimately viable, is irrelevant.

The definition of the term &quot;live birth&quot; was created by the World Health Organization in 1950, and is chiefly used for public health and statistical purposes. However, the term &quot;live birth&quot; was in common use long before 1950.

In the United States, the term &quot;born alive&quot; is defined by federal law known as the born alive rule. Live births are recorded on a U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, also known as a birth certificate. The United States recorded 3,605,201 live births in 2020 which is a 4% decrease from 2019 and the 6th consecutive year of decline in births.

Not all pregnancies result in live births. A woman may choose to end her pregnancy by abortion. Miscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion and pregnancy loss, is the natural death of an embryo or fetus before it is able to survive independently. Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation, after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth. The death of the fetus or neonate at the end of the pregnancy, during labour and delivery, or just after birth is counted as perinatal mortality.

== Statistical significance ==

== Factors affecting viability ==

=== Gestational age ===
Measured in weeks, gestational age is a term used to describe how far along a pregnancy is starting from the first day of the woman&#x27;s last menstrual cycle to the current date. A baby born &quot;at term&quot; is between the gestational age of 37 weeks to 41 weeks. A preterm baby is born before the gestational age of 37 weeks. A pregnancy that lasts 41 weeks up to 42 weeks is called late-term and a pregnancy longer than 42 weeks is called post-term. The general consensus is that a fetus is viable at 24 weeks, however, a live birth may occur earlier in gestation with the assistance from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) resources. Gestational age is the main determinant of whether a baby will be able to live and survive outside of the uterus. 

=== Other factors ===
While gestational age is the most significant predictor of fetal viability, the condition of the neonate at birth also significantly indicates how well it tolerates life outside of the mother. Factors measured at birth include birth weight, head circumference, and body length. An Apgar score is given at the time of birth to report the status of the newborn infant and the response to resuscitation if needed.

== Recovery ==
The maternal recovery period directly following the events of human childbirth, regardless of whether it is a live birth, is called the postpartum period. 

== Special cases ==
There is one case report of a woman having a live birth derived from a frozen embryo obtained before she began cancer treatment.

<doc id="199252" wikidata="Q1246061" url="?curid=199252" title="Deserts and xeric shrublands">
<text>Deserts and xeric shrublands are a biome defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Deserts and xeric (Ancient Greek &#x27;dry&#x27;) shrublands form the largest terrestrial biome, covering 19% of Earth&#x27;s land surface area. Ecoregions in this habitat type vary greatly in the amount of annual rainfall they receive, usually less than annually except in the margins. Generally evaporation exceeds rainfall in these ecoregions. Temperature variability is also diverse in these lands. Many deserts, such as the Sahara, are hot year-round, but others, such as East Asia&#x27;s Gobi Desert, become quite cold during the winter.

Temperature extremes are a characteristic of most deserts. High daytime temperatures give way to cold nights because there is no insulation provided by humidity and cloud cover. The diversity of climatic conditions, though quite harsh, supports a rich array of habitats. Many of these habitats are ephemeral in nature, reflecting the paucity and seasonality of available water. Woody-stemmed shrubs and plants characterize vegetation in these regions. Above all, these plants have evolved to minimize water loss. Animal biodiversity is equally well adapted and quite diverse.

== Degradation ==

===Desertification===
The conversion of productive drylands to desert conditions, known as desertification, can occur from a variety of causes. One is human intervention, including intensive agricultural tillage or overgrazing in areas that cannot support such exploitation. Climatic shifts such as global warming or the Milankovitch cycle (which drives glacials and interglacials) also affect the pattern of deserts on Earth.

=== Woody plant encroachment ===
Xeric shrublands can experience woody plant encroachment, which is the thickening of bushes and shrubs at the expense of grasses. This process is often caused by unsustainable land management practices, such as overgrazing and fire suppression, but can also be a consequence of climate change. As a result, the shrublands&#x27; core ecosystem services are affected, including its biodiversity, productivity, and groundwater recharge. Woody plant encroachment can be an expression of land degradation.

==Ecoregions==
The World Wide Fund for Nature highlights a number of desert ecoregions that have a high degree of biodiversity and endemism:
* The Nama Karoo of Namibia has the world&#x27;s richest desert fauna.
* The Chihuahuan desert and Central Mexican matorral are the richest deserts in the Neotropics.
* The Carnarvon xeric shrublands of Australia are a regional center for endemism.
* The Sonoran and Baja deserts of Mexico are unusual desert communities dominated by giant columnar cacti.
* Madagascar spiny forests
* Atacama Desert

<doc id="199254" wikidata="Q643535" url="?curid=199254" title="Ostrobothnia (historical province)">
<text>Ostrobothnia (, , &quot;botten&quot; deriving from Old Norse &quot;botn&quot;, meaning &#x27;bay&#x27;, and Latinized &quot;bothnia&quot;; , or alternatively &#x27;Northland&#x27;) is a historical province comprising a large western and northern part of modern Finland (which was then the eastern half of Sweden). It is bounded by Karelia, Savonia, Tavastia and Satakunta in the south, the Bothnian Sea, Bothnian Bay and Swedish Westrobothnia in the west, Laponia in the north and Russia in the east.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;pohja&quot; means either &quot;north&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot;, and &quot;maa&quot; is &quot;land&quot;. There are two possible explanations for the dual meaning of &quot;pohja&quot;. The first is based on the ancient Scandinavian belief that the north was the bottom of the world, where the Sun disappeared each night. The second explanation points to the fact that houses were constructed with their backs to the north, the coldest direction, which may have given rise to the association.

== Government ==
Ostrobothnia corresponds to the following modern regions: Ostrobothnia, Northern Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia, Southern Ostrobothnia and Kainuu, and the southern part of Lapland, which is known as Peräpohjola. It is governed by the regional state administrative agencies of Länsi- ja Sisä-Suomi and Pohjois-Suomi; the former includes areas outside Ostrobothnia (Central Finland and Häme).

== History ==

The Susiluola Cave near Kristinestad in Ostrobothnia has been suggested to have been inhabited by Neanderthals, possibly dating back 120,000 years to the Last Interglacial. If confirmed, it would represent the earliest known human settlement in Fennoscandia. However, the interpretation of the findings is disputed, and the claim remains controversial within the scientific community.

Modern humans arrived 9,000 years ago, as soon as the ice sheet disappeared and enough land had risen above sea level. A complex hunter-gatherer society emerged along the coast. Among the visible remains from this time are the Neolithic stone enclosures unique to Ostrobothnia known locally as Giant&#x27;s Churches (). They are a rare example of monumental architecture built by hunter-gatherers in northern Europe.

During the Bronze and Iron Ages an agrarian society eventually replaced earlier structures in southern Ostrobothnia, whereas traditional economies survived much longer in the northern and inland locations. During the early Middle Ages settlers from Sweden inhabited the coastal strip of southern and central Ostrobothnia, eventually forming administrative units under Swedish rule. The Swedish crown established Korsholm as the administrative centre. At the same time, large parts of inland Ostrobothnia were colonized by Finnish settlers from Savonia. By the 16th century, Finnish settlement and agriculture had reached the northern part of the east coast of the Gulf of Bothnia (north of Kalajoki). This led to severe clashes with the Orthodox Christian Karelians, who were supported by their suzerain, Russia. Throughout the late 16th century, both parties engaged in constant raids against enemy civilian populations, even though formal peace existed for much of the time. For instance, in the winter of 1590, men of Ii and Liminka raided the Pechenga Monastery on the Arctic Sea, while the Karelians raided Ii and Liminka, burning almost all dwellings. The war slowly ebbed due to the Treaty of Tyavzino in 1595.

During the late stages of the war, the Swedish crown stationed regular troops in the province to help defend the population. This was in marked contrast to the earlier practice of making the province responsible for its own defence. After the war, the Ostrobothnians revolted against the troops&#x27; continued presence, leading to the Cudgel War, the last peasant uprising in Finnish history. The peasants suffered devastating losses and the province was no longer a semi-independent, unregulated frontier.

Katarina Asplund (1690–1758), a Finnish pietist, was a leading figure within the pietism movement in Ostrobothnia, and was often in conflict with the authorities on charges of blasphemy.

The first towns in Ostrobothnia were established in the 17th century, obtaining prominence through the import of pine tar, which was essential for the maintenance of the wooden ships of the period. During the Great Northern War the province was occupied from 1714–1721 by Russian troops, along with the rest of Finland. In Ostrobothnia the troops engaged in the creation of a wide strip of no-man&#x27;s land between occupied Finland and Sweden proper. Northern Ostrobothnia suffered most heavily, losing a fourth of its population due to the ravages of war.

In 1809 all of Finland, including Ostrobothnia, was separated from Sweden, though the regions of Norrbotten and Västerbotten remained on the Swedish side.

== Geography ==
Historical Ostrobothnia was separated from southern Finland by Suomenselkä, a drainage divide which directs the flow of water north to the Merenkurkku or Perämeri and south to the Gulf of Finland or Selkämeri. To the east, it was bordered by Russian Karelia on the Maanselkä watershed, which divides the estuaries of the Oulujoki and Iijoki from the estuaries of rivers flowing to the White Sea. The northern borders are poorly defined, partly because permanently fixed habitations were a relatively new phenomenon at the time of the introduction of the county system, which replaced the older provincial divisions. On the coast, the border ran somewhere between the Torniojoki and Iijoki, without any formal definition inland, though the watershed between the Kemijoki, Iijoki and Olhavajoki estuaries serves as an approximate definition.

The stereotypical topographic feature of historical Ostrbothnia was the coastal plain north of Suomenselkä, in the modern regions of Ostrobothnia, Southern Ostrobothnia and Central Ostrobothnia. It is glacial (Weichselian glaciation) seabed, flat with a few hills, and characterized by rivers formed at the end of the glaciation period which run southeast to northwest. Post-glacial rebound is still causing the ground level to rise at a rate of about 9 mm per annum. Due to the flat terrain, this causes the Gulf of Bothnia to recede several kilometers each century, impacting navigation and the harbours of coastal cities in the region. The bedrock in the area, where exposed, features southeast-northwest oriented lines carved by rocks pushed by the advancing ice mass during the glaciation. When the ice melted, huge boulders (glacial erratics) and sand pits were also left behind.

On the coast of modern Northern Ostrobothnia, the topography remains flat, but instead of the fields of modern Central and Southern Ostrobothnia, the land is largely covered with marsh. Inland the landscape is dominated by coniferous forests and hills, with an occasional village or small town. The most important geographical feature of inland Ostrobothnia is the 887 km2 lake Oulujärvi. Most activity in the region of Kainuu is centered around this lake, which is connected to the sea via the Oulujoki. North of Kainuu, Koillismaa forms one of the most rural and poorest sub-regions in Finland.

== Heraldry ==

The coat of arms is crowned by a count&#x27;s coronet, though in Finnish tradition it more closely resembles a Swedish baron&#x27;s coronet. The blazon is azure, with six ermines courant argent, tail-tips sable.

<doc id="199256" wikidata="Q843007" url="?curid=199256" title="Ruby slippers">
<text>The ruby slippers are a pair of magical shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Because of their iconic stature, they are among the most valuable items of film memorabilia. Several pairs were made for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one pair was stolen from a museum in 2005 and recovered in 2018.

In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s original 1900 novel, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, on which the film is based, Dorothy wears Silver Shoes. However, the color of the shoes was changed to red to take advantage of the new Technicolor film process used in big-budget Hollywood films of the era. Film screenwriter Noel Langley is credited with the idea.

==The slippers==
===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939)===
In the MGM film, an adolescent farm girl named Dorothy Gale (played by Judy Garland), her dog Toto, and their Kansas farmhouse are swept into the air by a tornado and transported to the Land of Oz. The house falls on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East, freeing the Munchkins from her tyranny. Glinda, the Good Witch of the North arrives via a magic bubble and shows Dorothy the dead woman&#x27;s feet sticking out from under the house with the ruby slippers on them. When the Wicked Witch of the West comes to claim her dead sister&#x27;s shoes, Glinda magically transfers them to Dorothy&#x27;s feet. Glinda tells Dorothy never to take them off, as the slippers must be very powerful, or the Wicked Witch would not want them so badly. Throughout the rest of the film, the Wicked Witch schemes to obtain the shoes. She tries to take the slippers when she captures Dorothy, but receives a painful shock. She then realizes that the slippers will only come off if the wearer is dead, so she decides to kill Dorothy. Before she does, however, Dorothy accidentally splashes her with a bucket of water, causing her to melt away. In the end, Glinda reveals that Dorothy can return home by simply closing her eyes, clicking the slippers&#x27; heels together three times, and repeating the sentence, &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home.&quot;
The slippers were designed by Gilbert Adrian, MGM&#x27;s chief costume designer. Initially, two pairs were made in different styles. The so-called &quot;Arabian test pair&quot; was &quot;a wildly jeweled, Arabian motif, with curling toes and heels.&quot; This pair was used in costume tests, but was rejected as unsuitable for Dorothy&#x27;s Kansas farmgirl image. The second design was approved with one modification. The red bugle beads used to simulate rubies proved too heavy, so they were mostly replaced with sequins, about 2,300 for each shoe.

At least six or seven pairs of the final design are believed to have been made. According to producer Mervyn LeRoy, &quot;We must have had five or ten pairs of those shoes&quot;. The wardrobe woman who worked on the film claimed &quot;six identical pairs&quot; had been made. Four pairs used in the movie have been accounted for. Rhys Thomas speculates that they were likely made by Joe Napoli of the Western Costume Company, and not all at once, but as the need arose. According to Rhys Thomas in his &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, &quot;all the ruby slippers are between Size 5 and 6, varying between B and D widths.&quot;

The four surviving pairs were made from white silk pumps from the Innes Shoe Company in Los Angeles. Many movie studios used plain white silk shoes at the time because they were inexpensive and easy to dye. It is likely that most of the shoes worn by female characters in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; were plain Innes shoes with varying heel heights dyed to match each costume. There is an embossed gold or silver stamp or an embroidered cloth label bearing the name of the company inside each right shoe.

The shoes were dyed red, and burgundy sequined organza overlays were attached to each shoe&#x27;s upper and heel. The film&#x27;s early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most modern red sequins; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen. Two weeks before the start of shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows. Each of the Art Deco-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe. Three pairs of the surviving slippers had orange felt glued to their soles to deaden the sound of Garland dancing on the Yellow Brick Road.

One pair, known as &quot;the People&#x27;s Shoes,&quot; is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. However, the shoes do not belong together; their actual mates are the mismatched pair (left sized 5C, right 5BC) stolen in 2005 and recovered in 2018.

Another pair, the close-up or insert shoes, which is in the best shape of all, appears to be better made, has no orange felt on the soles, and has &quot;#7 Judy Garland&quot; written in the lining. According to the Library of Congress, &quot;it is widely believed that they were used primarily for close-ups and possibly the climactic scene where Dorothy taps her heels together.&quot; Circular scuff marks on the soles support the theory that they were the ones Garland had on when she clicked her heels together. The lack of felt indicates these were likely also the shoes taken from the feet of the dead Wicked Witch of the East (since the soles are visible in the film), hence their nickname: the &quot;Witch&#x27;s Shoes&quot;.

The last known pair may have been made for Bobbie Koshay, Garland&#x27;s stunt double. This is most likely the size 6B pair (owned first by Roberta Bauman, then Anthony Landini, and currently by David Elkouby) whose lining says &quot;Double&quot; instead of &quot;Judy Garland&quot;. However, some believe this pair may have been the second pair created, therefore explaining the &quot;Double&quot; in the lining, but still worn by Garland and Koshay. Several pairs of Garland&#x27;s own shoes are size 6. Also, Garland can be seen wearing this pair in photos taken after the film&#x27;s primary shooting was finished in 1939.

In the film sequence where trees pelt the Scarecrow with their apples, Garland can be briefly glimpsed wearing black shoes instead of the slippers.

===Subsequent history===
For many years, movie studios were careless with old props, costumes, scripts, and other materials, unaware of or indifferent to their increasing value as memorabilia. Often, workers would keep them as souvenirs without permission, aware that their employers did not particularly care. One of the more notorious of these was costumer Kent Warner, who amassed a large private collection and supplemented his income with sales. He found the slippers in February or March 1970 while helping to set up a mammoth auction of MGM props and wardrobe. They had been stored and forgotten in the basement of MGM&#x27;s wardrobe department. One pair became the centerpiece of the auction. Warner kept the best pair for himself, size 5B, and apparently sold the rest.
The slippers in the MGM auction (size 5C) were bought for $15,000 by a lawyer acting for an unidentified client. This is believed to be the pair on permanent exhibition in the Popular Culture wing of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., though the donor insisted on anonymity. Dr. Brent Glass, the director of the museum, appeared on the January 23, 2008, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; with the slippers and informed Oprah Winfrey that &quot;they were worn by Judy Garland during her dance routines on the Yellow Brick Road because there&#x27;s felt on the bottom of these slippers.&quot; However, according to Rhys Thomas, all but one pair had an orange felt on the soles. This pair is undergoing rapid deterioration from aging, and the museum is raising money to fund research on preservation.

Another pair was initially owned by a Tennessee woman named Roberta Bauman (1922–2009), who got them by placing second in a National Four Star Club &quot;Name the Best Movies of 1939&quot; contest. In 1988, auction house Christie&#x27;s sold them for $150,000 plus $15,000 buyer&#x27;s premium to Anthony Landini. Landini worked with The Walt Disney Company to start showing them at the Disney/MGM Studios&#x27; Florida Theme Park in the queue for The Great Movie Ride, whose facade and queue area are themed after Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. They were visible at the ride&#x27;s debut in 1989. Landini auctioned his pair of slippers, again at Christie&#x27;s East, on May 24, 2000, for $666,000 (including the buyer&#x27;s premium). They were sold to David Elkouby and his partners, who own memorabilia shops in Hollywood. Elkouby and Co. has yet to display the shoes.

The pair Warner kept, the &quot;Witch&#x27;s Shoes,&quot; was in the best condition. Warner sold the shoes in 1981 to an unknown buyer through Christie&#x27;s East for $12,000. Two weeks after Landini bought his slippers, this pair resurfaced and was offered privately through Christie&#x27;s to the under-bidder of the Bauman shoes, Philip Samuels of St. Louis, Missouri. Samuels bought them for the same price Landini had paid, $165,000. He has used his shoes to fund children&#x27;s charities, and has lent them to the Smithsonian when their slippers are cleaned, repaired, or (previously) on tour. Auction house Profiles in History announced this pair would highlight its December 15–17, 2011 Icons of Hollywood auction. In an interview, Joe Maddalena, head of Profiles in History, estimated that they would go for two to three million dollars. They were offered with a starting reserve price of two million dollars on December 16, 2011, but did not sell. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio and other benefactors, including director Steven Spielberg, made it possible for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to acquire the pair for an undisclosed price in February 2012 for their forthcoming museum.

Kent Warner sold one pair to Michael Shaw in 1970. These were stolen from an exhibit at the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, on the night of August 27–28, 2005. In 2015, the Associated Press reported that an anonymous donor had offered a $1 million reward for information about the stolen slippers. On September 4, 2018, the FBI announced the stolen pair had been recovered after a 13-year search. On March 16, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted a Minnesota man on one count of theft. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served in January 2024. On December 7, 2024, this pair was sold at auction for $28 million by Heritage Auctions (ultimately $32.5 million after auction house&#x27;s fees are included), making it the most &quot;valuable movie memorabilia ever sold at auction,&quot; according to Heritage Auctions. Over 800 people bid on the item, including the Judy Garland Museum, attempting to buy the slippers back from Shaw, who had repossessed the pair after it had been recovered by the FBI.

The very elaborate curled-toe &quot;Arabian&quot; pair was owned by actress and memorabilia preservationist Debbie Reynolds. She acknowledged she got them from Kent Warner. These slippers were sold for $510,000 (not including the buyer&#x27;s premium) in the June 2011 auction as part of the actress&#x27;s collection.

==Reproductions==
===&quot;Return to Oz&quot;===
The ruby slippers play an integral role in the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, for which Disney had to obtain rights from MGM to use reproductions in the film. Unlike the originals, the hand-made British French-heeled shoes for &quot;Return to Oz&quot; were covered in hundreds of dark red crystals. The stones were soaked in sulfuric acid to remove the silver backing, and two types of glue were used to affix them to the shoes (a spray glue and an optical glue). No matter what was tried, the stones kept falling off during filming. Stagehands were specifically hired to sweep up loose &quot;rubies&quot; that fell off the slippers after a scene was shot. Being little girls, actresses Fairuza Balk (who played Dorothy) and Emma Ridley (who played Princess Ozma), could not keep from playing, skipping, and tapping their heels, so eventually, they were required to take off the slippers between takes. Effects were later added in post-production to give the slippers their magical glow. A simple red grosgrain ribbon, with additional stones, was used for the bows. Seven pairs were made for the filming: two pairs, size three for Ridley, three pairs (size unknown) for Balk, and two men&#x27;s size 11 for the Nome King, played by Nicol Williamson.

In 1985, Walt Disney Productions gave away a pair of slippers to promote the film. They were won by a British family, who sold them to prominent Oz collector Willard Carroll in a 2001 eBay auction.

===Western Costume Company===
The Western Costume Company in Hollywood claims to have made Garland&#x27;s original slippers. While it is likely that Western would have been contracted to make some of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;&#x27;s many costumes, no records of the original slippers exist to either validate or disprove their claim. Western produced the only authorized reproductions in 1989 to commemorate the movie&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Hand-cast on Judy Garland&#x27;s original foot mold and completely sequined and jeweled, the reproduction slippers were nearly identical to the originals. Western planned a limited edition of 500 pairs at $5000 each, but halted the project after selling only 16 pairs. One of these pairs fetched $35,000 (including buyer&#x27;s premium) at a November 25, 2013, auction.

===Other film reproductions===
&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is a 1993 science-fiction/adventure homage to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; featuring red-accented &#x27;Thwomp &quot;Air&quot; Stompers&#x27; that allow the wearer to fly upon clicking the heels together. An imitation pair of ruby slippers appeared in the 2002 movie &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;. Another pair appeared in an Oz sequence in the cult comedy &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;. Reproductions were also featured in &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;, in which character Kahmunrah tosses them away after discovering the rubies are fake.

==Tribute versions==
In honor of the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Harry Winston jewelry company created a size-four pair of slippers using &quot;about 25 carats of diamonds and 1,500 carats of rubies&quot;. Valued at $3 million, they are reportedly the most expensive pair of shoes in the world.

During the fall 2008 New York Fashion Week, the Swarovski company held a charity contest to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the film, with nineteen designers redesigning the ruby slippers, including Gwen Stefani, Diane von Fürstenberg, and Moschino. The &quot;Arabian&quot; design was displayed with the designer entries.

In 2019, Ikon Design Studio released an officially licensed pair of ruby slippers. The replica slippers came in Judy Garland&#x27;s size of 5B and had her name written inside the shoe. The production was limited to 250 numbered pairs worldwide, including an acrylic display case and a numbered plaque.

In 2023, a limited edition of 1500 replica pairs were created by Paragon FX Group for the 100th anniversary of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment currently hold the copyright to the 1939 film.

==Television==
In the 1990–1991 animated TV series &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (produced by DiC Animation City), the ruby slippers&#x27; powers are significantly enhanced. Not only do they retain their movie-inspired ability to repel the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s touch, as well as the capability to teleport their user (and an unspecified number of companions) to any location desired, but they also demonstrate numerous other attributes and capabilities as well. Among them are the ability to:
* cloud/block the view of the Witch&#x27;s crystal ball, but only as long as they remain glowing
* negate, dispel, or reverse hexes or magical energy used against their wearer by the Witch
* levitate an object and control its trajectory through the air
* immediately adjust their size/shape to fit their wearer

In this series, Dorothy remains inexperienced and unfamiliar with the shoes&#x27; magic, calling upon their power only as a last resort, often resulting in a deus ex machina scenario. The Cowardly Lion and Truckle, the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s chief Flying Monkey, also briefly wear them.

In the 2002 &quot;Charmed&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, Piper returns home using the ruby slippers after going to the Fairytale Castle to vanquish the Wicked Witch.

The slippers briefly appear in the 2012 season 4 episode &quot;Fractures&quot; of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; in the Dark Vault, seemingly having a life of their own, accompanied by a witch&#x27;s cackle and a few notes of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. They are supposedly an &quot;Artifact&quot; – a potentially dangerous and malicious object that grants the wearer dangerous powers – since many artifacts are based on works of fact and fiction.

The season 9 episode &quot;Slumber Party&quot; of the series &quot;Supernatural&quot; features Dorothy and the Wicked Witch. Here portrayed as a hard-as-nails fighter, Dorothy realizes the shoes are the only thing that can kill the seemingly invincible witch. At one point, she admits she never really wore the iconic shoes, having considered it &quot;tacky&quot; to wear the shoes of a dead witch. Near the end of the episode, Charlie Bradbury uses the shoes to kill the Wicked Witch and foil her plot to bring her armies to Earth and take over the world.

==Books==
&quot;The Ruby Slippers of Oz&quot; (Tale Weaver Publishing, 1989) by Rhys Thomas is a history of the famous shoes and Kent Warner&#x27;s part in it.

In &quot;At The Auction of the Ruby Slippers&quot;, a short story in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s 1994 anthology &quot;East, West&quot;, various members of a destitute world attend an auction to bid for the ruby slippers of Dorothy Gale in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in the hope their transformative powers will help them achieve personal and political ends.

According to the revisionist version of the Oz history chronicled in Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;&quot;, the slippers were given to Nessarose, the future Wicked Witch of the East, by her father. They were constructed with handmade glass beads and reflected many different colors in the lighting, giving them an almost chameleon effect. After being enchanted by Elphaba&#x27;s old best friend and roommate, Glinda (the Good Witch of the North), they become items of power that allow the armless and handicapped Nessarose to magically stand and walk independently without any additional support. In the musical adaptation &quot;Wicked&quot;, it is Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who enchants the shoes, giving crippled Nessarose the ability to walk without a wheelchair.

==Music==
The progressive band Electric Light Orchestra used a frame from the 1939 film on the cover of their fourth studio album, &quot;Eldorado&quot;, released in 1974. The cover, designed by John Kehe, is a mirrored still frame of Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers. This still was also used for the picture sleeve of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get It Out of My Head&quot;, the single release from the &quot;Eldorado&quot; album.

==Video games==
In &quot;Wizard101&quot;, the slippers are a wearable item given after completing the sidequest &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot;. Once worn, they give +1 resistance to damage from Death spells.

In &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, they are a pair of level 70 epic cloth shoes dropped by the Wizard of Oz-themed &quot;opera event&quot; in the Karazhan raid instance. The shoes function similarly to the hearthstone that all characters start with, allowing them to teleport from their current location to the inn where the hearthstone is set. The caption under the statistic lines is &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home.&quot;

The slippers are part of the twelve &quot;Foundation Elements&quot; in the 2015 toys-to-life video game &quot;LEGO Dimensions&quot;.

<text>A designer is a person who plans the form or structure of something before it is made, by preparing drawings or plans. In practice, anyone who creates tangible or intangible objects, products, processes, laws, games, graphics, services, or experiences can be called a designer.

==Overview==
A Designer is someone who conceptualizes &amp; creates new concepts/ideas/products for consumption by the general public. It is different from an artist who creates art for a select few to understand or appreciate. However, both domains require some understanding of aesthetics. The design of clothing, furniture, and other common artifacts were left mostly to tradition or artisans specializing in hand making them.

With the increasing complexity in industrial design of today&#x27;s society, and due to the needs of mass production where more time is usually associated with more cost, the production methods became more complex and with them, the way designs and their production are created. The classical areas are now subdivided into smaller and more specialized domains of design (landscape design, urban design, interior design, industrial design, furniture design, fashion design, and much more) according to the product designed or perhaps its means of production. Despite various specializations within the design industry, all of them have similarities in terms of the approach, skills, and methods of working.

Using design methods and design thinking to resolve problems and create new solutions are the most important aspects of being a designer. Part of a designer&#x27;s job is to get to know the audience they intend on serving.

In education, the methods of teaching or the program and theories followed vary according to schools and field of study. In industry, a design team for large projects is usually composed of a number of different types of designers and specialists. The relationships between team members will vary according to the proposed product, the processes of production or the research followed during the idea development, but normally they give an opportunity to everyone in the team to take a part in the creation process.

<doc id="199278" wikidata="Q918126" url="?curid=199278" title="British Guiana">
<text>British Guiana was a British colony, part of the mainland British West Indies. It was located on the northern coast of South America. Since 1966 it has been known as the independent nation of Guyana.

The first known Europeans to encounter Guiana were Sir Walter Raleigh, an English explorer, and his crew.
Raleigh published a book entitled &quot;The Discovery of Guiana&quot;, but this mainly relates to the Guayana region of Venezuela.

The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle there, starting in the early 17th century. They founded the colonies of Essequibo and Berbice, adding Demerara in the mid-18th century. 
In 1796, Great Britain took over these three colonies during hostilities with the French, who had occupied the Netherlands. Britain returned control of the territory to the Batavian Republic in 1802, but captured the colonies a year later during the Napoleonic Wars. The Netherlands officially ceded the colonies to the United Kingdom in 1815.

The British consolidated the territories into a single colony in 1831. The colony&#x27;s capital was at Georgetown (known as Stabroek prior to 1812).
Since the late 19th century, the economy has become more diversified but has still relied on resource exploitation. Guyana became independent of the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966.

==Establishment==

The English made at least two unsuccessful attempts in the 17th century to colonise the lands that would later be known as British Guiana. By that time, the Dutch had established two colonies in the area: Essequibo, administered by the Dutch West India Company, and Berbice, administered by the Berbice Association. The Dutch West India Company founded a third colony, Demerara, in the mid-18th century. 

During the French Revolutionary Wars of the late 18th century, when the Netherlands were occupied by the French, and Great Britain and France were at war, Britain took over the colony in 1796. A British expeditionary force was dispatched from its colony of Barbados to seize the colonies from the French-dominated Batavian Republic. The colonies surrendered without a struggle. Initially very little changed, as the British agreed to allow the long-established laws of the colonies to remain in force.

In 1802 Britain returned the colonies to the Batavian Republic under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. But, after resuming hostilities with France in the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Britain seized the colonies again less than a year later. The Netherlands officially ceded the three colonies to the United Kingdom in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. 

The UK continued separate administration of the individual colonies until 1822, when the administration of Essequibo and Demerara was combined. In 1831, the administration Essequibo-Demerara and Berbice was combined, and the united colony became known as British Guiana. During World War II the United States Navy established NAF British Guiana and NAF Paramaribo in British Guiana.

==Economy and politics==
The economy was based on cultivation and processing of sugarcane as a commodity crop, dependent on extensive labor by enslaved workers of mostly sub-Saharan African descent. Although the UK and the United States abolished the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, the domestic slave trade flourished until Britain emancipated all the enslaved in its colonies in the 1830s. The wealth they generated had largely flowed to a group of absentee slave owners living in Britain, especially in Glasgow and Liverpool.

The economy of British Guiana was completely based on sugarcane production until the 1880s, when falling cane sugar prices stimulated a shift toward rice farming, mining and forestry. But the production of sugarcane remained a significant part of the economy (in 1959 sugar still accounted for nearly 50% of exports). Under the Dutch, settlement and economic activity was concentrated around sugarcane plantations lying inland from the coast. 

Under the British, cane planting expanded to richer coastal lands, with greater coastline protection. Until the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, sugar planters depended almost exclusively on slave labour to produce sugar. Georgetown was the site of a significant slave rebellion in 1823.
In the 1880s gold and diamond deposits were discovered in British Guiana, including what was thought to be the world&#x27;s largest diamond in 1922. They did not generate significant revenue. 

Bauxite deposits proved more promising and would remain an important part of the economy. The colony did not develop any significant manufacturing industry, other than sugar factories, rice mills, sawmills, and certain small-scale industries (including a brewery, a soap factory, a biscuit factory and an oxygen-acetylene plant, among others).

The London-based Booker Group of companies (Booker Brothers, McConnell &amp; Co., Ltd) dominated the economy of British Guiana. The Bookers had owned sugar plantations in the colony since the early 19th century; by the end of the century they owned a majority of them. By 1950 they owned all but three. With the increasing success and wealth of the Booker Group, they expanded internationally and diversified by investing in rum, pharmaceuticals, publishing, advertising, retail stores, timber, and petroleum, among other industries. The Booker Group became the largest employer in the colony, leading some to refer to it as &quot;Booker&#x27;s Guiana&quot;.

Indentured workers were recruited from India from 1850 to 1920, and were largely locked in place. A minority achieved mobility. Some secretly fled; others waited until their contracts expired. Indian migration within the colonies involved three phases: desertion from the plantations; movement settlements and later to urban areas; and intra-regional migration from one Caribbean island to another. The traditional rigid Indian caste system largely collapsed in the colonies.

Guianese served in all British forces during the Second World War, and enjoyed veterans&#x27; benefits afterwards. The colony made a small but important financial contribution to the war effort. It also served as a refuge for Jews displaced from continental Europe, where the Nazis and Fascists worked to destroy them in the Holocaust.

==Railways==

British colonists built the first railway system in British Guiana: of , from Georgetown to Rosignol, and of line between Vreeden Hoop and Parika; it opened in 1848. Several narrow-gauge lines were built to serve the sugar industry and others were built to serve the later bauxite and other mines.

In 1948, when the railway in Bermuda was closed down, the locomotives, rolling stock, track, sleepers and virtually all the associated paraphernalia of a railway were shipped to British Guiana to renovate the aged system.

The lines ceased to operate in 1972. The large Central Station is still standing in Georgetown. Some of the inland mines still operate narrow-gauge lines.

==Administration==
The British long continued the forms of Dutch colonial government in British Guiana. A Court of Policy exercised both legislative and executive functions under the direction of the colonial Governor (which existed from 1831 to 1966). A group known as the Financial Representatives sat with the Court of Policy in a Combined Court to set tax policies. A majority of the members of the Courts was appointed by the Governor; the rest were selected by a College of Kiezers (Electors). The Kiezers were elected, with the restrictive franchise based on property holdings and limited to the larger landowners of the colony. The Courts were dominated in the early centuries by the sugar planters and their representatives.

In 1891 the College of Kiezers was abolished in favour of direct election of the elective membership of the Courts. Membership of the Court of Policy became half elected and half appointed, and all of the Financial Representatives became elective positions. The executive functions of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new Executive Council under the control of the Governor. Property qualifications were significantly relaxed for voters and for candidates to the Courts.

In 1928 the British Government abolished the Dutch-influenced constitution and replaced it with a Crown colony constitution. A Legislative Council with an appointed majority was established, and the administrative powers of the Governor were strengthened. These constitutional changes were not popular among the Guyanese, who viewed them as a step backward. The franchise was extended to women.

In 1938 the West India Royal Commission (&quot;The Moyne Commission&quot;) was appointed to investigate the economic and social condition of all the British colonies in the Caribbean region after a number of civil and labour disturbances. Among other changes, the Commission recommended some constitutional reforms. As a result, in 1943 a majority of the Legislative Council seats became elective, the property qualifications for voters and for candidates for the Council were lowered, and the bar on women and clergy serving on the Council was abolished. The Governor retained control of the Executive Council, which had the power to veto or pass laws against the wishes of the Legislative Council.

The next round of constitutional reforms came in 1953. A bicameral
legislature, consisting of a lower House of Assembly and an upper State Council, was established. The voting membership of the House of Assembly was entirely elective. The membership of the State Council was appointed by the Governor and the House of Assembly and possessed limited revisionary powers. A Court of Policy became the executive body, consisting of the Governor and other colonial officials. Universal adult suffrage was instituted, and the property qualifications for office abolished.

The election of 27 April 1953 under the new system provoked a serious constitutional crisis. The People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) won 18 of the 24 seats in the House of Assembly. This result alarmed the British Government, which was surprised by the strong showing of the PPP. It considered the PPP as too friendly with communist organisations.

As a result of its fears of communist influence in the colony, the British Government suspended the constitution, declared a state of emergency, and militarily occupied British Guiana on 9 October 1953. Under the direction of the British Colonial Office, the Governor assumed direct rule of the colony under an Interim Government, which continued until 1957. On 12 August 1957, elections were held and the PPP won nine of fourteen elective seats in a new legislature.

A constitutional convention convened in London in March 1960 reached agreement on another new legislature, to consist of an elected House of Assembly (35 seats) and a nominated Senate (13 seats). In the ensuing election of 21 August 1961, the PPP won 20 seats in the House of Assembly, entitling it as the majority party to appoint eight senators. Upon the 1961 election, British Guiana also became self-governing, except as to defence and external matters. The leader of the majority party became prime minister, who then named a Council of Ministers, replacing the former Executive Council.

From 1962 to 1964, riots, strikes and other disturbances stemming from racial, social and economic conflicts delayed full independence for British Guiana. The leaders of the political parties reported to the British Colonial Secretary that they were unable to reach agreement on the remaining details of forming an independent government. The British Colonial Office intervened by imposing its own independence plan, in part requiring another election under a new proportional representation system. Britain expected that this system would reduce the number of seats won by the PPP and prevent it from obtaining a majority.

The December 1964 elections for the new legislature gave the PPP 45.8% (24 seats), the People&#x27;s National Congress (PNC) 40.5% (22 seats) and the United Force (UF) 12.4% (7 seats). The UF agreed to form a coalition government with the PNC, and accordingly, the PNC leader became the new prime minister. In November 1965 an independence conference in London quickly reached agreement on an independent constitution; it set the date for independence as 26 May 1966. On that date, at 12 midnight, British Guiana became the new nation of Guyana.

==Territorial disputes==
===Western boundary with Venezuela===

In 1840, the British Government assigned the German-born explorer Robert Hermann Schomburgk to survey and mark out the western boundary of British Guiana with newly independent Venezuela. Venezuela did not accept the Schomburgk Line, which placed the entire Cuyuni River basin within the colony. Venezuela claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River as its territory (see map in this section).

The dispute continued on and off for half a century, culminating in the Venezuela Crisis of 1895, in which Venezuela sought to use the United States&#x27; Monroe Doctrine to win support for its position. US President Grover Cleveland used diplomatic pressure to get the British to agree to arbitration of the issue, ultimately agreeing terms for the arbitration that suited Britain. An arbitration tribunal convened in Paris in 1898, and issued its award in 1899. The tribunal awarded about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. A commission surveyed a new border according to the award, and the parties accepted the boundary in 1905.

There the matter rested until 1962, when Venezuela renewed its 19th-century claim, alleging that the arbitral award was invalid. After his death, Severo Mallet-Prevost, legal counsel for Venezuela and a named partner in the New York law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle published a letter alleging that the judges on the tribunal acted improperly as a result of a back-room deal between Russia and Great Britain. The British Government rejected this claim, asserting the validity of the 1899 award. The British Guiana Government, then under the leadership of the PPP, also strongly rejected this claim. Efforts by all parties to resolve the matter on the eve of Guyana&#x27;s independence in 1966 failed; as of today, the dispute remains unresolved.

===Eastern boundary with Suriname===

Robert Schomburgk&#x27;s 1840 commission also included a survey of the colony&#x27;s eastern boundary with the Dutch colony of Surinam, now the independent nation of Suriname. The 1899 arbitration award settling the British Guiana–Venezuela border made reference to the border with Suriname as continuing to the source of the Courantyne River, which it named as the Kutari River. The Netherlands raised a diplomatic protest, claiming that the New River, and not the Kutari, was to be regarded as the source of the Courantyne and the boundary. The British government in 1900 replied that the issue was already settled by the longstanding acceptance of the Kutari as the boundary.

In 1962, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, on behalf of its then-constituent country of Suriname, finally made formal claim to the &quot;New River Triangle&quot;, the triangular-shaped region between the New and Kutari rivers that was in dispute. The then Surinamese colonial government and, after 1975, the independent Surinamese government, maintained the Dutch position, while the British Guiana Government, and later the independent Guyanese government, maintained the British position.

==Stamps and postal history of British Guiana==

British Guiana is famous among philatelists for its early postage stamps, which were first issued in 1850. These stamps include some of the rarest, most expensive stamps in the world, such as the unique British Guiana 1c magenta from 1856, which was sold in 2014 for US$9.5 million.

<doc id="199286" wikidata="Q935283" url="?curid=199286" title="Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance was a Grammy Award recognizing superior vocal performance by a female in the pop category, the first of which was presented in 1959. It was discontinued after the 2011 Grammy season. The award went to the artist. Singles or tracks only are eligible.

The award has had quite a convoluted history:
*From 1959 to 1960 there was an award called Best Vocal Performance, Female, which was for work in the pop field
*In 1961 the award was separated into Best Vocal Performance Single Record Or Track and Best Vocal Performance Album, Female
*From 1962 to 1963 the awards from the previous year were combined into Best Solo Vocal Performance, Female
*From 1964 to 1968 the award was called Best Vocal Performance, Female
*In 1969, the awards were combined and streamlined as the award for Best Contemporary-Pop Vocal Performance, Female
*From 1970 to 1971 the award was known as Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female
*From 1972 to 1994 the award was known as Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female
*From 1995 to 2011 it was known as Best Female Pop Vocal Performance

The award was discontinued in 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all solo performances in the pop category (male, female, and instrumental) were shifted to the newly formed Best Pop Solo Performance category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.
