<text>Walter Lippmann (September 23, 1889 – December 14, 1974) was an American writer, reporter, and political commentator. With a career spanning 60 years, he is famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of the Cold War, coining the term &quot;stereotype&quot; in the modern psychological meaning, as well as critiquing media and democracy in his newspaper column and several books, most notably his 1922 &quot;Public Opinion&quot;.

Lippmann also played a notable role as research director of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s post-World War I board of inquiry. His views on the role of journalism in a democracy were contrasted with the contemporaneous writings of John Dewey in what has been retrospectively named the Lippmann–Dewey debate. Lippmann won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for his syndicated newspaper column &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot; and one for his 1961 interview of Nikita Khrushchev.

He has also been highly praised with titles ranging from &quot;most influential&quot; journalist of the 20th century to &quot;Father of Modern Journalism&quot;. Michael Schudson writes that James W. Carey considered Walter Lippmann&#x27;s book &quot;Public Opinion&quot; as &quot;the founding book of modern journalism&quot; and also &quot;the founding book in American media studies&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lippmann was born on New York&#x27;s Upper East Side as the only child of Jewish parents of German origin. According to his biographer Ronald Steel, he grew up in a &quot;gilded Jewish ghetto&quot;. His father Jacob Lippmann was a rentier who had become wealthy through his father&#x27;s textile business and his father-in-law&#x27;s real estate speculation. His mother, Daisy Baum, cultivated contacts in the highest circles, and the family regularly spent its summer holidays in Europe. The family had a Reform Jewish orientation; averse to &quot;orientalism&quot;, they attended Temple Emanu-El. Walter had his Reform Jewish confirmation instead of the traditional Bar Mitzvah at the age of 14. Lippmann was emotionally distanced from both parents, but had closer ties to his maternal grandmother. The political orientation of the family was Republican.

From 1896 Lippmann attended the Sachs School for Boys, followed by the Sachs Collegiate Institute, an elite and strictly secular private school in the German Gymnasium tradition, attended primarily by children of German-Jewish families and run by the classical philologist Julius Sachs, a son-in-law of Marcus Goldmann from the Goldman-Sachs family. Classes included 11 hours of ancient Greek and 5 hours of Latin per week.

Shortly before his 17th birthday, he entered Harvard University where he wrote for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; and studied under George Santayana, William James, and Graham Wallas, concentrating upon philosophy and languages (he spoke German and French). He took only one course in history and one in government. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa society, though important social clubs rejected Jews as members.

Lippmann became a member, alongside Sinclair Lewis, of the New York Socialist Party. In 1911, Lippmann served as secretary to George R. Lunn, the first Socialist mayor of Schenectady, New York, during Lunn&#x27;s first term. Lippmann resigned his post after four months, finding Lunn&#x27;s programs to be worthwhile in and of themselves, but inadequate as socialism.

==Career==

Lippmann was a journalist, a media critic and an amateur philosopher who tried to reconcile the tensions between liberty and democracy in a complex and modern world, as in his 1920 book &quot;Liberty and the News&quot;. In 1913, Lippmann, Herbert Croly, and Walter Weyl became the founding editors of &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

During World War I, Lippmann was commissioned a captain in the Army on June 28, 1918, and was assigned to the intelligence section of the AEF headquarters in France. He was assigned to the staff of Edward M. House in October and attached to the American Commission to negotiate peace in December. He returned to the United States in February 1919 and was immediately discharged.

Through his connection to House, Lippmann became an adviser to Wilson and assisted in the drafting of Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points speech. He sharply criticized George Creel, whom the President appointed to head wartime propaganda efforts at the Committee on Public Information. While he was prepared to curb his liberal instincts because of the war, saying he had &quot;no doctrinaire belief in free speech,&quot; he nonetheless advised Wilson that censorship should &quot;never be entrusted to anyone who is not himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of suppression.&quot;

Lippmann examined the coverage of newspapers and saw many inaccuracies and other problems. He and Charles Merz, in a 1920 study entitled &quot;A Test of the News&quot;, stated that &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; coverage of the Bolshevik Revolution was biased and inaccurate. In addition to his newspaper column &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot;, he wrote several books.

Lippmann was the first to bring the phrase &quot;Cold War&quot; to a common currency, in his 1947 book by the same name.

It was Lippmann who first identified the tendency of journalists to generalize about other people based on fixed ideas. He argued that people, including journalists, are more apt to believe &quot;the pictures in their heads&quot; than to come to judgment by critical thinking. Humans condense ideas into symbols, he wrote, and journalism, a force quickly becoming the mass media, is an ineffective method of educating the public. Even if journalists did better jobs of informing the public about important issues, Lippmann believed &quot;the mass of the reading public is not interested in learning and assimilating the results of accurate investigation.&quot; Citizens, he wrote, were too self-centered to care about public policy except as pertaining to pressing local issues.

=== Political thought ===
Lippmann saw nationalist separatism, imperialist competition, and failed states as key causes of war. He envisioned the eventual decline of the nation-state and its replacement with large inclusive and democratic political units.

As solution to the problem of failed states, he proposed the creation of regional authorities to provide political control, as well as education of public opinion to build support for these regional governments. He called for the creation of international organizations for each crisis region in the world: &quot;there should be in existence permanent international commissions to deal with those spots of the earth where world crises originate.&quot;

He saw the creation of the United States in 1789 as a model for a proposed World State or supranational government, as it was possible to create a constitution to bring order to an otherwise anarchic area. Commerce and regular interactions between people from different nations would alleviate the adverse aspects of nationalism.

==Later life==
After the fall of the British colony Singapore in February 1942, Lippmann authored an influential &quot;Washington Post&quot; column that criticized empire and called on western nations to &quot;identify their cause with the freedom and security of the peoples of the East&quot; and purge themselves of &quot;white man&#x27;s imperialism&quot;.

Following the removal from office of Secretary of Commerce (and former Vice President of the United States) Henry A. Wallace in September 1946, Lippmann became the leading public advocate of the need to respect a Soviet sphere of influence in Europe, as opposed to the containment strategy being advocated at the time by George F. Kennan.

Lippmann was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1947 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949.

Lippmann was an informal adviser to several presidents. On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson presented Lippmann with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He later feuded with Johnson over his handling of the Vietnam War of which Lippmann had become highly critical.

He won a special Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1958, as a nationally syndicated columnist, citing &quot;the wisdom, perception and high sense of responsibility with which he has commented for many years on national and international affairs.&quot; Four years later he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting citing &quot;his 1961 interview with Soviet Premier Khrushchev, as illustrative of Lippmann&#x27;s long and distinguished contribution to American journalism.&quot;

Lippmann retired from his syndicated column in 1967.

Lippmann died in New York City due to cardiac arrest in 1974.

==Journalism==
Though a journalist himself, Lippmann did not assume that news and truth are synonymous. For Lippmann, the &quot;function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them in relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act.&quot; A journalist&#x27;s version of the truth is subjective and limited to how they construct their reality. The news, therefore, is &quot;imperfectly recorded&quot; and too fragile to bear the charge as &quot;an organ of direct democracy.&quot;

To Lippmann, democratic ideals had deteriorated: voters were largely ignorant about issues and policies and lacked the competence to participate in public life and cared little for participating in the political process. In &quot;Public Opinion&quot; (1922), Lippmann noted that modern realities threatened the stability that the government had achieved during the patronage era of the 19th century. He wrote that a &quot;governing class&quot; must rise to face the new challenges.

The basic problem of democracy, he wrote, was the accuracy of news and protection of sources. He argued that distorted information was inherent in the human mind. People make up their minds before they define the facts, while the ideal would be to gather and analyze the facts before reaching conclusions. By seeing first, he argued, it is possible to sanitize polluted information. Lippmann argued that interpretation as stereotypes (a word which he coined in that specific meaning) subjected us to partial truths. Lippmann called the notion of a public competent to direct public affairs a &quot;false ideal.&quot; He compared the political savvy of an average man to a theater-goer walking into a play in the middle of the third act and leaving before the last curtain.

John Dewey in his book &quot;The Public and Its Problems&quot;, published in 1927, agreed about the irrationality of public opinion, but he rejected Lippmann&#x27;s call for a technocratic elite. Dewey believed that in a democracy, the public is also part of the public discourse. The Lippmann-Dewey Debate started to be widely discussed by the late 1980s in American communication studies circles. Lippmann also figured prominently in the work &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky who cited Lippmann&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;manufacture of consent&quot; which referred &quot;to the management of public opinion, which [Lippmann] felt was necessary for democracy to flourish, since he felt that public opinion was an irrational force.&quot;

===Remarks about Franklin D. Roosevelt===
In 1932, Lippmann famously dismissed future President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s qualifications and demeanor, writing: &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt is no crusader. He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be President.&quot; Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s later accomplishments, Lippmann stood by his words, saying: &quot;That I will maintain to my dying day was true of the Franklin Roosevelt of 1932.&quot; He believed his judgment was an accurate summation of Roosevelt&#x27;s 1932 campaign, saying it was &quot;180 degrees opposite to the New Deal. The fact is that the New Deal was wholly improvised after Roosevelt was elected.&quot;

==Influence on mass culture==

Lippmann was an early and influential commentator on mass culture, notable not for criticizing or rejecting mass culture entirely but discussing how it could be worked with by a government licensed &quot;propaganda machine&quot; to keep democracy functioning. In his first book on the subject, &quot;Public Opinion&quot; (1922), Lippmann said that mass man functioned as a &quot;bewildered herd&quot; who must be governed by &quot;a specialized class whose interests reach beyond the locality.&quot; The elite class of intellectuals and experts were to be a machinery of knowledge to circumvent the primary defect of democracy, the impossible ideal of the &quot;omnicompetent citizen&quot;.

Later, in &quot;The Phantom Public&quot; (1925), Lippmann recognized that the class of experts were also, in most respects, outsiders to any particular problem, and hence not capable of effective action. Philosopher John Dewey (1859–1952) agreed with Lippmann&#x27;s assertions that the modern world was becoming too complex for every citizen to grasp all its aspects, but Dewey, unlike Lippmann, believed that the public (a composite of many &quot;publics&quot; within society) could form a &quot;Great Community&quot; that could become educated about issues, come to judgments and arrive at solutions to societal problems.

In 1943, George Seldes described Lippmann as one of the two most influential columnists in the United States.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Lippmann became even more skeptical of the &quot;guiding&quot; class. In &quot;The Public Philosophy&quot; (1955), which took almost twenty years to complete, he presented a sophisticated argument that intellectual elites were undermining the framework of democracy. The book was very poorly received in liberal circles.

==Legacy==
The Walter Lippmann House at Harvard University, which houses the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, is named after him.

===Almond–Lippmann consensus===
Similarities between the views of Lippmann and Gabriel Almond produced what became known as the Almond–Lippmann consensus, which is based on three assumptions:

# Public opinion is volatile, shifting erratically in response to the most recent developments. Mass beliefs early in the 20th century were &quot;too pacifist in peace and too bellicose in war, too neutralist or appeasing in negotiations or too intransigent&quot;
# Public opinion is incoherent, lacking an organised or a consistent structure to such an extent that the views of US citizens could best be described as &quot;nonattitudes&quot;
# Public opinion is irrelevant to the policy-making process. Political leaders ignore public opinion because most Americans can neither &quot;understand nor influence the very events upon which their lives and happiness are known to depend.&quot;

===Liberal/neoliberal debate===

French philosopher Louis Rougier convened a meeting of primarily French and German liberal intellectuals in Paris in August 1938 to discuss the ideas put forward by Lippmann in his work &quot;The Good Society&quot; (1937). They named the meeting after Lippmann, calling it the Colloque Walter Lippmann. The meeting is often considered the precursor to the first meeting of the Mont Pèlerin Society, convened by Friedrich von Hayek in 1947. At both meetings discussions centered around what a new liberalism, or &quot;neoliberalism&quot;, should look like.

== Private life ==
Lippmann was married twice, the first time from 1917 to 1937 to Faye Albertson (1893–1975). Faye was the daughter of Ralph Albertson, a pastor of the Congregational Church. He was one of the pioneers of Christian socialism and the social gospel movement in the spirit of George Herron. During his studies at Harvard, Walter often visited the Albertsons&#x27; estate in West Newbury, Massachusetts, where they had founded a socialist cooperative, the (Cyrus Field) Willard Cooperative Colony.

Lippmann was divorced by Faye Albertson to be able to marry Helen Byrne Armstrong in 1938 (died 16 February 1974), daughter of James Byrne. She divorced her husband Hamilton Fish Armstrong, the editor of &quot;Foreign Affairs.&quot; He was the only close friend in Lippmann&#x27;s life. The friendship and involvement in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; ended when a hotel in Europe accidentally forwarded Lippmann&#x27;s love letters to Mr. Armstrong.

<doc id="202161" wikidata="Q464267" url="?curid=202161" title="Emperor Horikawa">
<text>was the 73rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Horikawa&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1087 through 1107.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Taruhito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (善仁親王). He was also known as Yoshihito&quot;-tennō&quot;.

Horikawa was the son of Emperor Shirakawa. His mother was Fujiwara no Kenshi (藤原賢子), adopted daughter of Fujiwara Morozane (藤原師実). His wet nurse was a different namesake Fujiwara no Kenshi (藤原兼子).

===Empresses, consorts, and issue===
*Empress (&quot;Chūgū&quot;): Imperial Princess Tokushi (篤子内親王), Emperor Go-Sanjo’s daughter
*Consort (&quot;Nyōgo&quot;): Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原苡子; 1076-1103), Fujiwara no Sanesue’s daughter
** Imperial Prince Munehito (宗仁親王) later Emperor Toba
*Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi&quot;): Princess Jinshi (仁子女王; d.1126), Prince Yasusuke’s daughter
** Imperial Princess Soshi (悰子内親王, 1099–1162)
*Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi&quot;): Fujiwara Muneko (藤原宗子; d.1129), Fujiwara Takamune’s daughter
** Kangyō (寛暁; 1103–1159)
*Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi&quot;): Fujiwara Tokitsune’s daughter
** Imperial Prince Priest Saiun (最雲法親王; 1105–1162) head priest of the Tendai sect
* Mother Unknown
** Imperial Princess Kishi (喜子内親王)
** Imperial Princess Kaishi (懐子内親王)

==Rule==
After becoming crown prince, he acceded to the throne upon the abdication of his father Emperor Shirakawa on January 3, 1087 (Ōtoku 3). His father&#x27;s &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara Morozane became regent, and Horikawa&#x27;s reign was overshadowed by the cloistered rule of his father. Horikawa filled his reign with scholarship, poetry, and music.

When Horikawa&#x27;s empress-consort Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原苡子) died in 1103, his son the Imperial Prince Munehito was taken to be raised by the retired Emperor Shirakawa. This son later succeeded Horikawa to the throne and was later known as Emperor Toba.

Horikawa died at the age of 28 on August 9, 1107 (Kajō 2). He is among the seven emperors entombed near Ryōan-ji in Kyoto. He is traditionally venerated at the &quot;Nochi no Yenkyō-ji no misasagi&quot; memorial Shinto shrine; this site has been designated as Horikawa&#x27;s mausoleum by the Imperial Household Agency.

===Eras===
The years of Horikawa&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Ōtoku&quot; (1084–1087)
* &quot;Kanji&quot; (1087–1094)
* &quot;Kahō&quot; (1094–1096)

* &quot;Chōji&quot; (1104–1106)
* &quot;Kajō&quot; (1106–1108)

===Kugyō===
During Horikawa&#x27;s reign, the high-ranking &quot;kugyō&quot; of the imperial court included: 
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;/&quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; Fujiwara Morozane (1043–1101)

<text>The All-American Rejects (often abbreviated as AAR) are an American rock band formed in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1999. The band consists of lead vocalist and bassist Tyson Ritter, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Nick Wheeler, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Mike Kennerty, and drummer Chris Gaylor. Wheeler and Ritter serve as the band&#x27;s songwriters; Wheeler is the primary composer and Ritter is the primary lyricist. Although Kennerty and Gaylor are not founding members, they have appeared in all of the band&#x27;s music videos and on all studio releases except for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut.

The group achieved mainstream success with their debut self-titled studio album &quot;The All-American Rejects&quot;, released in 2002 on the DreamWorks Records label. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned the successful single &quot;Swing, Swing&quot;. The band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Move Along&quot; brought the group further mainstream success in 2005, producing the hit singles &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;, &quot;Move Along&quot;, and &quot;It Ends Tonight&quot;, all of which charted in the top fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, while &quot;Move Along&quot; was certified triple platinum in 2024 by the RIAA. Their third studio album &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot; was released in 2008 and was later certified platinum in 2024 by the RIAA. Its lead single &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; became The All-American Rejects&#x27; most successful song to date, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and the top 5 in many other countries. &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; was certified 9× multi-platinum for sales of over 9 million shipments in the United States by the RIAA in 2024. &quot;Kids in the Street&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released on March 26, 2012, and debuted at number 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On October 30, 2015, the group released a new single named &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot;.

The All-American Rejects have sold over 12 million albums worldwide. They were ranked No. 73 on the &quot;Hot 100 Artists of the 2000s&quot; and No. 183 on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Artists of the Decade&quot; list. The band has continued to tour, and released the singles &quot;Sweat&quot; on July 7, 2017, and &quot;Send Her to Heaven&quot; on their new label Epitaph on July 16, 2019.

==History==
===1999–2004: Formation and &quot;The All-American Rejects&quot;===

The band formed in Stillwater, Oklahoma in 1999 while members Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter were still in high school. It was here that Ritter offered himself for bass duties. Eventually Wheeler and Ritter decided to form the All-American Rejects. When asked where the name of the band came from, Mike Kennerty says, &quot;It was a random name that sounded cool. I feel like we have grown into it over the years.&quot;

In 2000, while still in high school, the group made a demo simply labeled &quot;The All-American Rejects&quot;, with Nick Wheeler (drums), Tyson Ritter (vocals, bass), and Jesse Tabish (guitar, vocals). The demo CD was engineered, mixed and mastered by Wheeler. It was also managed by Alisa Ben at Half-A-Cup Entertainment. The demo is now commonly referred to as &quot;The Blue Disc&quot; or &quot;The Blue Album&quot;. The CD consisted of twelve songs, a few of which would be included on the &quot;Same Girl, New Songs&quot; demo made in 2001. Jesse Tabish later split from the group and later became a member of the folk band Other Lives. Ritter and Wheeler put together the &quot;Same Girl, New Songs&quot; EP, which was soon sent to independent Doghouse Records, where an intern saved the disc from the trash, and revealed it to the label owner. The All-American Rejects were soon signed to a recording contract.

In 2001, with producer Tim O&#x27;Heir, the band recorded their self-titled debut studio album, &quot;The All-American Rejects&quot;. The album and its first single, &quot;Swing, Swing&quot;, were released towards the end of 2002. The group began looking for additional members for a live act. Edmond, Oklahoma resident Mike Kennerty joined on as rhythm guitarist soon before the album was released. Soon after, the band was having problems with drummer Tim Campbell. Campbell was later replaced by drummer Chris Gaylor, who knew and played in another band with Kennerty.

The group was then signed by DreamWorks Records. The band hit the road for eight shows in January, and DreamWorks issued a broader-scale distribution of the debut LP. The album peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album chart. The single &quot;Swing, Swing&quot; was also re-issued, which peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at No. 60 as well as No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single &quot;The Last Song&quot; was also released spring 2003, and climbed to No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Early in 2003, the band went on tour as an opening act for CKY. While several differing stories have occurred concerning the tour, they were kicked off the tour shortly after it began.

In Spring 2003, the All-American Rejects set out on their first headlining tour, called the &quot;Too Bad For Hell Tour&quot;. In later 2003, the All-American Rejects released, &quot;Live from Oklahoma... The Too Bad for Hell DVD!&quot;, their first live DVD – which was later certified Gold by the RIAA. During this time, they performed on the Vans Warped Tour. They would later be part of the lineup again in summer 2005. In November, the All-American Rejects joined the bands Motion City Soundtrack and Limbeck for six shows in the United Kingdom, the first date on the 16th, and the last on the 22nd.

===2005–06: &quot;Move Along&quot;===

In July 2005, the All-American Rejects released their second studio album, &quot;Move Along&quot;, produced by Howard Benson. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;, was released that summer to radio stations.
At the end of 2005, the All-American Rejects embarked on &quot;The Rise of the Fall Tour&quot; along with The Academy Is... and Rooney. Then, on December 13, &quot;The Bite Back EP&quot; was released on the iTunes Music Store, and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005, the band performed The Cars&#x27; &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; with Fall Out Boy on MTV.

In 2006, the second single and title track from &quot;Move Along&quot;, was released. Within the first weeks after premiering their video, it had been on the &quot;Total Request Live&quot; countdown, hitting number-one four days in a row. The single did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until almost six months after its release, in June. On March 15, 2006, the All-American Rejects began a tour of the United States that wrapped up on May 13, 2006. On May 25, the All-American Rejects performed at the first ever VH1 Rock Honors, covering &quot;Photograph&quot; by Def Leppard. In July the band sent a promotional single from &quot;Move Along&quot;, &quot;Top of the World,&quot; to modern rock radio. A music video was created for it from clips of the All-American Rejects on tour and in concert.

&quot;Move Along&quot; was also used to help promote the Lego Bionicle &quot;Inika&quot; toy sets in the summer of 2006. The group also participated in a promotion for the sets called &quot;Free the Band&quot;. The overall priority of the promotion was that the Rejects got kidnapped by the villainous Piraka whilst sailing on a yacht and people had to assist the Inika on finding and rescuing the band via the website &#x27;freetheband.com&#x27;. A competition could also be entered where the winners would receive Bionicle and All-American Rejects merchandise alike.

In September 2006, a third headlining single, &quot;It Ends Tonight&quot;, was released from &quot;Move Along&quot;. The video debuted at No. 10 on the VH1 Top 20 countdown. The video also peaked at No. 2 on &quot;TRL&quot;. Later in the year the All-American Rejects launched the &quot;Tournado&quot; tour in support of &quot;Move Along&quot;. The tour kicked off at Hartford, Connecticut on October 27, and wrapped up at Champaign, Illinois on December 20.

That New Year&#x27;s Eve, the All-American Rejects performed on a special on Las Vegas&#x27; Fremont Street, which also included the bands OK Go, Five for Fighting, Rock Star Supernova, and Chicago.

On December 21, 2024, the album hit 1 Billion streams on Spotify.

===2007–09: &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot;===

The All-American Rejects began writing material for their third studio album in December 2006. The band also collaborated with composer Danny Elfman on &quot;The Future Has Arrived&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack of Disney film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;. The song was created in conjunction with the film&#x27;s musical score.

On July 17, 2007, the All-American Rejects released their second live DVD, titled &quot;Tournado&quot;, with content from the 2006 headlining tour of the same name. Also during the summer, they covered &quot;Jack&#x27;s Lament&quot; from &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, which was featured on &quot;Nightmare Revisited&quot;. The finished album version of the song &quot;I Wanna&quot; appeared in the movie, &quot;The House Bunny&quot;, which was released to theaters on August 22, 2008. Vocalist/bassist Tyson Ritter played a role in the film, and offered up &quot;I Wanna&quot; for the soundtrack.

On September 30, 2008, the first single from &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot;, &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; was released. The All-American Rejects were inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, and were awarded with &quot;Rising Star&quot;. &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; peaked at No. 1 on Pop charts on billboard.com and also peaked No. 1 on iTunes charts and No. 5 most downloaded song of the 2009 year, and the No. 1 most played song of the year 2009.

The music video for &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; was released November fifth and reached number one on VH1&#x27;s Top 20 Countdown. On the sixth, in support of &quot;Gives You Hell&quot;, the band started the &quot;Gives You Hell Tour&quot;, which hit many small venues and clubs. Then, on the eighteenth &quot;Mona Lisa (When the World Comes Down)&quot;, another song from the band&#x27;s upcoming album, was released digitally on iTunes. In the first week of December, the album version of &quot;Real World&quot; was made available for download on Rock Band for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

Three years after the &quot;Move Along&quot; album was issued, the group released their third studio album, &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot; (produced by Eric Valentine), on December 16, 2008. After the &quot;Gives You Hell Tour&quot; wrapped up, the band embarked on a world tour until coming back to the states to start the &quot;I Wanna Rock Tour&quot;, which hit many major venues in the United States.

In May 2009, the All-American Rejects released a second single in the United States, entitled &quot;The Wind Blows&quot;, which achieved moderate success. &quot;I Wanna&quot; was released internationally on July 8 to Australia and the United Kingdom. Another song from &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot;, In July, &quot;Real World&quot; was released as a promotional single in the United States, followed by &quot;I Wanna&quot; as a headliner. In late summer the All-American Rejects joined Weezer, Fall Out Boy and Taking Back Sunday for the second half of the &quot;Blink-182 Reunion Tour&quot;. On August 15, the All-American Rejects made history, performing alongside Hoobastank, Raygun, Boys Like Girls, Pixie Lott and Kasabian as one of the live acts at Asia&#x27;s very first MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia concert. This performance gained them recognition in Malaysia. &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot; soon sold over 15,000 digital and physical copies in the country. On August 21 the &quot;I Wanna&quot; single was issued to Austria and Germany.

In October 2009, the All-American Rejects were forced to cancel shows due to an injury to frontman Tyson Ritter. He performed from a wheelchair with his leg in a brace on September 27 during a show in Tampa, Florida, amid reports suggesting the singer had undergone knee surgery to remove a tumor that had been there for many months. Ritter&#x27;s leg became infected, and he remained hospitalized for five days. Ritter made a full recovery in time to return to kick off the &quot;Battle Of The Bands Tour&quot; with Taking Back Sunday, with the first date at MSU in Michigan. At the end of 2009, Ritter suffered from alcohol abuse after ending a six-year relationship. Ritter&#x27;s way of coping with this issue was to write and record music for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Kids In The Street&quot;.

The All-American Rejects announced that they will be performing their last show in support of &quot;When the World Comes Down&quot; at Hollywood, California on December 14. Since the date soon sold out, the band added a second date at the venue for the next day. However, the group played one more show at the &quot;Jingle Bell Bash&quot; in Seattle, Washington on December 19.

===2010–13: &quot;Kids in the Street&quot;===

In February 2010, the All-American Rejects performed live at the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games at the Whistler Medals Plaza. They also had DirecTV performances at Super Bowl XLIV and a special set aired in February. The band also wrote and recorded the song &quot;The Poison&quot; for the &quot;Almost Alice&quot; compilation, a collection of songs representing the 2010 Tim Burton film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. From June 25 to July 18, the All-American Rejects toured the United States and Canada as part of the Warped Tour 2010 festival.

Later that year, the band announced that they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released in early 2012. Songwriters Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter went on numerous writing retreats into secluded parts of the United States; a tradition of writing used on their previously released albums. Recording for the album wrapped up in June 2011, with mixing commencing the following August and concluding early September. On November 14, 2011, Ritter announced that ex Taking Back Sunday bassist Matt Rubano had joined the band as their bass player for live performances, but stated that Ritter is still the bass player recording-wise.

On December 3, 2011, the group announced that the album would be titled &quot;Kids in the Street&quot; and released the song &quot;Someday&#x27;s Gone&quot; from the album as a free download from their official website, a music video for the track that was filmed over the previous weekend also premiered the same day. The band later announced the track listing for the album on December 16, 2011, and that its first single would be titled &quot;Beekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, it premiered in an episode of American teen drama &quot;90210&quot; featuring the band performing the track on January 31, 2012, as well as being released the same day. The album spawned two further singles; &quot;Kids in the Street&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat Slowing Down&quot;, both of which achieved little success in the US.

The All-American Rejects later embarked on their &quot;Shaking Off the Rust&quot; tour, which began in San Luis Obispo, California, United States on January 18, 2012, and continued through the year – some of which they performed as a support act for Blink-182&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Tour in the UK – and ended on July 27, 2013. The band performed at Sepang International Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on September 27, 2013, alongside The Wanted and Five for Fighting as part of the Arthur&#x27;s Day celebrations promoted by the Guinness brewing company. On November 5, 2013, Ritter released a solo song titled &quot;Air&quot; in order to &quot;tide fans over until the next Rejects record&quot;, which Ritter claimed &quot;it&#x27;s time to start fishing for hooks for&quot;, while in an interview with &quot;Variance&quot; magazine.

===2013–present: Other projects and future===
The band headlined the &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; festival tour in the UK on the Bank Holiday weekend of May 2014, alongside other bands such as Goldfinger, Letlive, We the Kings and Zebrahead. Following occasional performances of touring for 18 months and a concert with &quot;Musikfest&quot;, Wheeler announced in an interview with the former that the band plans to begin recording for their fifth studio album in the fall of 2013. He went on to describe the intended creative process as &quot;in the moment&quot;, saying they plan to write as well as record new material in the studio rather than write in advance.

The group performed at Universal Studios Orlando annual Mardi Gras event, Wabash College, and Manhattan College in the spring of 2015. A new song by the band titled &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; is featured in the trailer for the 2015 film &quot;Miss You Already&quot;, in which Ritter also stars. The song and its music video were released on October 30, 2015. On July 21, 2016, Tyson Ritter announced a new single from the band, entitled &quot;DGAF&quot;. The song was performed live for the first time that night, which also marked the start of the band&#x27;s tour with Blink-182. The band performed at Emo Nite LA&#x27;s 2nd anniversary at the Echoplex in Los Angeles, CA in December 2016.

On April 1, 2017, Tyson Ritter announced a new single from the band due out that summer, entitled &quot;Sweat&quot;. On June 13 the band officially announced the song via social media. They released their two-song EP, &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; on July 7, 2017. The All-American Rejects have written and recorded about 10 new songs as of June 2017. The band toured in the summer and fall of 2017, playing both new singles. Although the band is keeping quiet about the songs and album name, Ritter said in an interview with grammy.com that the next two songs to be released would be &quot;Send Her To Heaven&quot; (a song played on the 2017 summer/fall tour) and &quot;Demons&quot;. &quot;Sweat&quot; charted at number 21 on the Hot Rock Songs chart, number 10 on Digital Rock songs chart, and later charted at 29 on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart, in the month of October.

On February 8, 2018, Tyson Ritter said that the band was no longer signed to Interscope Records, saying that the band intended to release music &quot;without all the politics that come into play when signed to a major label&quot;, citing the process of the label paying top 40 stations to play their music as not for them, and not what music is about.

It was later announced on July 10, 2019, that Epitaph Records had signed the band. On the following July 16, The All-American Rejects released the 3-track single &quot;Send Her to Heaven&quot;, followed by its music video. The band later released the single &quot;Me Vs. The World&quot; on November 20, 2020, stating that all of its proceeds would be donated to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund which aims to support employees in the music industry who have been out of work since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On August 21, 2020, the band released a 14 song collection to Spotify titled &#x27;Rejects Faves&#x27; that contains band-picked favorites from their four studio albums.

On November 30, 2020, when asked if the band would be releasing new material in an interview with RADIO.COM, Tyson Ritter stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not likely that the band is going to make another record anytime soon if ever, it&#x27;s given birth to these other projects that I&#x27;ve started.&quot; He also quoted Joni Mitchell, adding that &quot;as an artist or as a songwriter you need to know when to stop.&quot;

On January 18, 2022, The All-American Rejects were announced as part of the When We Were Young Festival with headliners Paramore and My Chemical Romance. The festival took place in October 2022 and had three dates. The band were set to return for the 2024 event, but backed out on October 11th due to &quot;management change.&quot;

On August 30, 2024, the band teased a new song to be released the following September 13, but did not reveal the title. It was then revealed to be a cover of &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot; by Harvey Danger.

==Equipment==
Using mainly Fender and Gibson guitars, the All-American Rejects use numerous models. The band uses Sennheiser microphones, Dean Markley Custom Lights guitar strings, and Dunlop Picks.

Lead vocalist/bassist Tyson Ritter uses two models of Fender; one is a Black Precision Bass, and the other model is the then-discontinued Jaguar Bass. Ritter also uses Gibson models, including the Gibson Thunderbird and the Epiphone Flying V.

Lead guitarist Nick Wheeler, primarily uses Gibson guitars. Wheeler&#x27;s main guitar is the Gibson Firebird. He primarily uses a Vintage Sunburst Firebird V. Wheeler owns a rare cherry Firebird VII, which he no longer uses for live shows, as well as a custom Firebird, which is painted in blue glitter. He owns eight Firebirds overall. He also uses a Classic Gibson Firebird. Wheeler frequently uses a Gibson ES-335. This guitar is notably used live for the intro of &quot;Top of the World&quot;, taking the place of the classical guitar originally used in the &quot;Top of the World&quot; recording. It is also commonly used in the songs &quot;It Ends Tonight&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot;, &quot;Stab My Back&quot;, &quot;My Paper Heart&quot;, &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; and &quot;Dance Inside&quot;. Another guitar that Wheeler favors is the Gibson EDS-1275 doubleneck guitar, which he uses live on &quot;The Wind Blows&quot;, &quot;Back to Me&quot;, and &quot;Bleed Into Your Mind&quot;. He has also been known to occasionally use the Gibson Flying V, namely for the performing &quot;The Last Song&quot; live.

Rhythm guitarist Mike Kennerty has used the Gibson SG since joining the band, and also uses Washburn Guitars. Another guitar that Kennerty favors is the PRS Guitars Mira X which came out in early 2009.

Chris Gaylor, drummer for the band, uses Remo heads for his drums. Gaylor used to endorse Tama drums, but now he endorses C&amp;C drums. He has a set with a Rootbeer Sparkle wood finish, as well as an acrylic kit. Gaylor&#x27;s most-current set-up contains seven drums. He uses a 12×7 rack tom, 14×10, 16×12, and 18×14 floor toms, a 14×6.5 Nickel-Over-Brass snare, a 12×7 effects snare, and a 24×16 bass drum. Gaylor uses Tama hardware.

Also, Gaylor uses Vater Universal drumsticks, and his cymbals are Sabian. His hi-hats are Sabian 14-inch HHX Evolution. His 3 crashes he uses are an 18-inch HHXplosion crash, a 19-inch AAXplosion crash, and a 20-inch HHX stage crash. Gaylor also uses 22-inch HH Power Bell ride cymbal. Gaylor also includes an LP cowbell in his set. He also uses an Alesis ADAT HD24 for recording purposes.

<text>Sir Ebenezer Howard (29 January 1850 – 1 May 1928) was an English urban planner and founder of the garden city movement, known for his publication &quot;To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform&quot; (1898), the description of a utopian city in which people live harmoniously together with nature. The publication resulted in the founding of the garden city movement, and the building of the first garden city, Letchworth Garden City, commenced in 1903.

The second true Garden City was Welwyn Garden City (1920) and the movement influenced the development of several model suburbs in other countries, such as Forest Hills Gardens designed by F. L. Olmsted Jr. in 1909, Radburn, New Jersey (1923), Pinelands, Cape Town, and the four Suburban Resettlement Program towns of the 1930s, Greenbelt, Maryland, Greenhills, Ohio, Greenbrook, New Jersey, and Greendale, Wisconsin.

Howard aimed to reduce the alienation of humans and society from nature, and hence advocated garden cities and Georgism. Howard is believed by many to be one of the great guides to the town planning movement, with many of his garden city principles being used in modern town planning.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Fore Street, City of London, the son of Ebenezer Howard (18171900), a baker, and Ann (née Tow, 18161900). He was sent to schools in Suffolk and Hertfordshire. Howard left school at 15 and began working as a stenographer in London. Howard subsequently had several clerical jobs, including one with Dr Parker of the City Temple.

In 1871, at the age of 21, influenced partly by a farming uncle, Howard emigrated with two friends to America. He went to Nebraska, and after his farming efforts failed, discovered he did not wish to be a farmer. He then relocated to Chicago and worked as a reporter for the courts and newspapers. Howard arrived in Chicago just after the great fire of 1871, which destroyed most of the central business district, and witnessed the regeneration of the city and the growth of its suburbs. In the US he became acquainted with, and admired, poets Walt Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Howard began to ponder ways to improve the quality of life.

==Later life==
By 1876, he was back in England, where he found a job with Hansard company, which produces the official record of Parliament, and he spent the rest of his life in this occupation. Howard&#x27;s time in parliament exposed him to ideas about social reform, and helped inspire his ideas for the Garden City. In August 1879, he married Eliza Ann Bills. Sociologist Brett Clark describes Howard as a &quot;humble and practical&quot; inventor who used his spare time to create outlines of new cities. It was the social milieu of the 1800s which led Howard to consider the social problems of the time and try to find alternatives. Howard mingled with free thinkers, anarchists and socialists, whose revolutionary and reforming ideas greatly influenced him.

Howard&#x27;s parents died on consecutive days in 1900, after he had published the first edition of his book, but before work had started on the first garden city: his mother died on 23 November 1900 from pneumonia and his father died on 24 November 1900 from gastritis.

Howard&#x27;s wife, Eliza Ann Bills (1853–1904), died in November 1904, shortly after work on the first garden city at Letchworth had begun. Howard married again in 1907 to Edith Annie Hayward (1864–1941), who became Edith, Lady Howard when Howard was knighted in 1927, and with whom he is buried in Letchworth Cemetery.

==Influences and ideas==

Howard read widely, including Edward Bellamy&#x27;s 1888 utopian novel, &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, and Henry George&#x27;s economic treatise, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, and thought much about social issues. He disliked the way modern cities were being developed and thought people should live in places that should combine the best aspects of both cities and the countryside.

== Publications ==
The only publication he wrote in his life was titled &quot;To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform&quot;, which was significantly revised in 1902 as &quot;Garden Cities of To-morrow&quot;. Garden Cities of To-morrow was based on ideas of social and urban reform. Garden Cities were to avoid the downfalls of industrial cities of the time such as urban poverty, overcrowding, low wages, dirty alleys with no drainage, poorly ventilated houses, toxic substances, dust, carbon gases, infectious disease and lack of interaction with nature. This book offered a vision of towns free of slums and enjoying the benefits of both town (such as opportunity, amusement and good wages) and country (such as beauty, fresh air and low rents). He illustrated the idea with his famous &quot;Three Magnets&quot; diagram (pictured), which addressed the question &#x27;Where will the people go?&#x27;, the choices being &#x27;Town&#x27;, &#x27;Country&#x27; or &#x27;Town-Country&#x27;.

Garden Cities of Tomorrow proposed that society be reorganised with networks of garden cities that would break the strong hold of capitalism and lead to cooperative socialism. It proposed the creation of new suburban towns of limited size, planned in advance, and surrounded by a permanent belt of agricultural land.

These Garden cities were used as the model for many suburbs. Howard believed that such Garden Cities were the perfect blend of city and nature. Howard believed that a new civilisation could be found by marrying the town and the country. The towns would be largely independent, managed by the citizens who had an economic interest in them, and financed by ground rents on the Georgist model. The land on which they were to be built was to be owned by a group of trustees and leased to the citizens.

While many believe the diagrams and designs in Howard&#x27;s Garden Cities of Tomorrow to be a physical plan for the perfect garden city, Howard notes these to be merely suggestive as each city should be planned to be organised as per the needs of the people and their environment. Howard never intended for garden cities to be circular like his diagrams.

==Action==
In 1899, he founded the Garden Cities Association, known now as the Town and Country Planning Association.

By his association with Henry Harvey Vivian and the co-partnership housing movement, his ideas attracted enough attention and funding to begin Letchworth Garden City, a suburban garden city north of London. In 1901, under the guidance of Henry Vivian, a new co-partnership housing development venture was started in the London Borough of Ealing that was to become the Brentham Garden Suburb, now a conservation area. A second garden city, Welwyn Garden City, was started after World War I.

His acquaintance with German architects Hermann Muthesius and Bruno Taut resulted in the application of humane design principles in many large housing projects built in the Weimar Republic. Hermann Muthesius also played an important role in the creation of Germany&#x27;s first garden city of Hellerau in 1909, the only German garden city where Howard&#x27;s ideas were thoroughly adopted.

The creation of Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City were influential for the development of &quot;New Towns&quot; after World War II by the British government. This produced more than 30 communities, the first being Stevenage, Hertfordshire (about halfway between Letchworth and Welwyn), and the last (and largest) being Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Howard&#x27;s ideas also influenced other planners such as Frederick Law Olmsted II and Clarence Perry. Walt Disney used elements of Howard&#x27;s concepts in his original design for EPCOT (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow).

In 1913, Howard founded the &#x27;Garden Cities and Town Planning Association&#x27; – presently the International Federation for Housing and Planning.

==Other==
Howard was an enthusiastic speaker of Esperanto, often using the language for his speeches.

==Death==

Howard died on 1 May 1928 (aged 78) and is buried in a modest grave in Letchworth Cemetery with his second wife, Edith Annie, Lady Howard.

==Letchworth Garden City==

Letchworth was developed and owned by a company called First Garden City, Ltd. which was formed in 1903, based on the ideas of Howard. After Howard&#x27;s book was published he worked to gain financial support to bring his ideas into reality, Howard ran lectures on Garden Cities and began the Garden City Association. The Garden City Association collected money from supporters, his supporters tended to be people who were impressed by the social justice element of the Garden City. The Letchworth estate which was agricultural land, was purchased from 15 individual owners. The Letchworth estate lies on a train line and is only from London, making commuting possible.

The original land on which Letchworth was built cost the First Garden City, Ltd. £160,378 and covered . However, more land was purchased and the property increased to . The Letchworth garden city was to sustain a population of between 30,000 and 35,000 people, and would be laid out as Howard explained in his book. There would be a central town, agricultural belt, shops, factories, residences, civic centres and open spaces, this division of land for specific purposes is now referred to as zoning and is an important practice within town planning.

Howard constructed Letchworth as an example of how the Garden City could be achieved, and hoped that in its success many other towns would be built emulating the same ideals. Some criticisms of Letchworth exist, claims that it is too spacious and there are few architecturally impressive designs. However, it can be argued the space is what makes Letchworth pleasant, and the architecture, while not highly impressive and uniform, has consistency of colour and is satisfying to the needs of the people.

==Welwyn Garden City==

Welwyn Garden City was an area of woodlands and open fields before the garden city was constructed. Welwyn Garden City was Howard&#x27;s second Garden City after Letchworth. Howard purchased the land with £5000 borrowed from friends. Welwyn Garden City is only from London, and captured the charm of the countryside and managed to stay unspoiled by urbanisation. The architecture in Welwyn has been described as pleasant, and the residential cottages with their wide roads and open spaces make Welwyn Garden City a refreshing picture when compared to London of the time.

After 10 years of existence, Welwyn Garden City had a population of 10,000, with well-established residential, industrial and commercial zones. In 1930, the health of Welwyn Garden City inhabitants was considered greater than those living in London, as Welwyn Garden City recorded lower death rates and infant mortality rates. The increased health in Welwyn Garden City was understood to be due to the principles of the Garden City.

It could be argued that Welwyn Garden City fell short of Howard&#x27;s ideals, Howard wanted investors to invest for the sake of philanthropy, but investors wanted returns and local democracy failed with an exclusive government group formed. Finally, Welwyn Garden City was marketed as a middle class commuter suburb, entirely disrespecting the garden city ideals of a self-reliant city.

==Honours==
Howard was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1924 and a Knight Bachelor in 1927.

== Howard Medal ==
The Howard medal was introduced after Howard’s death, and takes the form of a Bronze medal with the motif of an ideal city. The medal remains one of the most prestigious awards in the sector.

In almost 90 years, the medal has been awarded 11 times and the names are a stellar cast of Garden City giants beginning with Raymond Unwin in 1938 and ending with Colin Ward and Sir Peter Hall in 1999. It includes Barry Parker, Lewis Mumford, Clarence Stein, Richard Reiss, Patrick Abercrombie and Frederic Osborn but only one woman, Elizabeth Buchanan Mitchell in 1955.

==Family members==

Actress, dancer and TV personality Una Stubbs was Howard&#x27;s great-granddaughter. Other direct descendants include his cricket manager grandson Geoffrey Howard, great-granddaughter poet and publisher Joy Bernadine Howard, and his great-great-grandson (Una Stubbs&#x27;s son), television and film score composer Christian Henson.

<doc id="202174" wikidata="Q1051872" url="?curid=202174" title="Caveolae">
<text>In biology, caveolae (Latin for &quot;little caves&quot;; singular, caveola), which are a special type of lipid raft, are small (50–100 nanometer) invaginations of the plasma membrane in the cells of many vertebrates. They are the most abundant surface feature of many vertebrate cell types, especially endothelial cells, adipocytes and embryonic notochord cells. They were originally discovered by E. Yamada in 1955.

These flask-shaped structures are rich in proteins as well as lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids and have several functions in signal transduction. They are also believed to play a role in , mechanosensation, endocytosis, oncogenesis, and the uptake of pathogenic bacteria and certain viruses.

==Caveolins==

Formation and maintenance of caveolae was initially thought to be primarily due to caveolin, a 21 kD protein. There are three homologous genes of caveolin expressed in mammalian cells: Cav1, Cav2 and Cav3. These proteins have a common topology: cytoplasmic N-terminus with scaffolding domain, long hairpin transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic C-terminus. Caveolins are synthesized as monomers and transported to the Golgi apparatus. During their subsequent transport through the secretory pathway, caveolins associate with lipid rafts and form oligomers (14-16 molecules). These oligomerized caveolins form the caveolae. The presence of caveolin leads to a local change in morphology of the membrane.

== Cavins ==
Cavin proteins emerged in the late 2000s to be the main structural components controlling caveola formation. The cavin protein family consists of Cavin1 (also known as PTRF), Cavin2 (also known as SDPR), Cavin3 (also known as SRBC) and Cavin4 (also known as MURC). Cavin1 has been shown to be the main regulator of caveola formation in multiple tissues, with the sole expression of Cavin1 sufficient for morphological caveola formation in cells lacking caveolae but abundant in Cav1. Cavin4, analogous to Cav3, is muscle-specific.

==Caveolar endocytosis==
Caveolae are one source of clathrin-independent raft-dependent endocytosis. The ability of caveolins to oligomerize due to their oligomerization domains is necessary for formation of caveolar endocytic vesicles. The oligomerization leads to formation of caveolin-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane. Increased levels of cholesterol and insertion of the scaffolding domains of caveolins into the plasma membrane leads to the expansion of the caveolar invagination and the formation of endocytic vesicles. Fission of the vesicle from the plasma membrane is then mediated by GTPase dynamin II, which is localized at the neck of the budding vesicle. The released caveolar vesicle can fuse with early endosome or caveosome. The caveosome is an endosomal compartment with neutral pH which does not have early endosomal markers. However, it contains molecules internalized by the caveolar endocytosis.

This type of endocytosis is used, for example, for transcytosis of albumin in endothelial cells or for internalization of the insulin receptor in primary adipocytes.

==Other roles of caveolae==
* Caveolae have been shown to be required for the protection of cells from mechanical stress in multiple tissue types such as the skeletal muscles, endothelial cells and notochord cells.
* Caveolae can be used for entry to the cell by some pathogens and so they avoid degradation in lysosomes. However, some bacteria do not use typical caveolae but only caveolin-rich areas of the plasma membrane. The pathogens exploiting this endocytic pathway include viruses such as SV40 and polyoma virus and bacteria such as some strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Porphyromonas gingivalis&quot;.
* Caveolae have a role in cell signaling, too. Caveolins associate with some signaling molecules (e.g. eNOS) through their scaffolding domain and so they can regulate their signaling. Caveolae are also involved in regulation of channels and in calcium signaling.
* Caveolae also participate in lipid regulation. High levels of caveolin Cav1 are expressed in adipocytes. Caveolin associates with cholesterol, fatty acids and lipid droplets and is involved in their regulation.
* Caveolae can also serve as mechanosensors in various cell types. In endothelial cells, caveolae are involved in flow sensation. Chronic exposure to the flow stimulus leads to increased levels of caveolin Cav1 in plasma membrane, its phosphorylation, activation of eNOS signaling enzyme and to remodeling of blood vessels. In smooth-muscle cells, caveolin Cav1 has a role in stretch sensing which triggers cell-cycle progression.

==Inhibitors==
Some known inhibitors of the caveolae pathway are filipin III, genistein and nystatin.

==Events of Shirakawa&#x27;s life ==
He was the first emperor to ostensibly retire to a monastery, but in fact continue to exert considerable influence over his successor. This process would become known as cloistered rule.

When he was very young, his relations with his father were very cold but loving and in 1068, when his father was enthroned, he was proclaimed a &quot;shinnō&quot; (Imperial Prince), becoming Imperial Prince Sadahito. In 1069, he became Crown Prince and in due course, he became emperor at the age of 19.

* January 18, 1073 (&quot;Enkyū 4, on the 8th day of the 12th month&quot;): In the 5th year of Emperor Go-Sanjō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (桓武天皇六年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Shirakawa is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

A &quot;kampaku&quot; was put in place, but Shirakawa attempted to rule directly, like his father. He attempted to regulate the &quot;shōen&quot; (manor) system, working to weaken the influence of the &quot;sekkan&quot; lines.

* 1074 (&quot;Jōhō 1, 1st month&quot;): &quot;Dainagon&quot; Minamoto- no Takakune asked to be relieved of his duties because of his age. He was 71, and he wanted to retire to Uji. In his retirement, he was visited by many friends with whom he pursued research into the history of Japan. He brought this work together in a book.
* 1074 (&quot;Jōhō 1, 7th day of the 2nd month&quot;): The former &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara Yorimichi died at the age of 83. In this same period, his sister, the widow of Emperor Ichijo, died at the age of 86.
* 1074 (&quot;Jōhō 1, 3rd day of the 10th month&quot;): Empress Jōtōmon-in died at the age of 86.
* 1077 (&quot;Jōryaku 1, 1st month&quot;): Shirakawa went to the Kamo Shrines; and he visited Kiyomizu-dera and other Buddhist temples.
* 1077 (&quot;Jōryaku 1, 2nd month&quot;): &quot;Udaijin&quot; Minamoto no Morofusa died of an ulcer at the age of 70.
* 1077 (&quot;Jōryaku 1&quot;): The emperor caused Hosshō-ji (dedicated to the &quot;Superiority of Buddhist Law&quot;) to be built at Shirakawa in fulfillment of a sacred vow. This temple became only the first of a series of &quot;sacred vow&quot; temples to be created by Imperial decree. Hosshō-ji&#x27;s nine-storied pagoda would become the most elaborate Imperial-sponsored temple structure ever erected up to this time.
* 1079 (&quot;Jōryaku 3, i10th month&quot;): The emperor visited the Fushimi Inari-taisha at the foot of Mount Fushimi and the Yasaka Shrine.
* May 26, 1081 (&quot;Eihō 1, 15th day of the 4th month&quot;): The Buddhist Temple of Miidera was set on fire by the monks of a rival sect on Mt. Hiei.
* 1081 (&quot;Eihō 1, 4th day of the 6th month&quot;): Miidera was burned again by monks from Mt. Hiei.
* 1083 (&quot;Eihō 3, 10th month&quot;): At Hosshō-ji, construction begins on a nine-story pagoda.
* 1084 (&quot;Ōtoku 1, 9th month&quot;): The empress Kenshi, the emperor&#x27;s principal consort, died. Shirakawa was afflicted with great grief, and for a time, he turned over the administration of the government to his ministers.
* 1087 (&quot;Ōtoku 3, 9th month&quot;): Shirakawa announced his intention to abdicate in favor of his son.
* January 3, 1087 (&quot;Ōtoku 3, 26th day of the 11th month&quot;): Shirakawa formally abdicated, and he took the title &quot;Daijō-tennō.&quot; Shirakawa had personally occupied the throne for 14 years; and for the next 43 years, he would exercise broad powers in what will come to be known as cloistered rule.

Go-Sanjō had wished for Shirakawa&#x27;s younger half-brother to succeed him to the throne. In 1085, this half-brother died of an illness; and Shirakawa&#x27;s own son, Taruhito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (善仁親王) became Crown Prince.

On the same day that Taruhito was proclaimed as his heir, Shirakawa abdicated;, and Taruhito became Emperor Horikawa. The now-retired Emperor Shirakawa was the first to attempt what became customary cloistered rule. He exercised power, ruling indirectly from the Shirakawa-in (lit. &quot;White River Mansion/Temple&quot;); nevertheless, nominal &quot;sesshō&quot; and &quot;kampaku&quot; offices continued to exist for a long time.

* 1087 (&quot;Kanji 1, 5th month&quot;): &quot;Daijō-tennō&quot; Shirakawa retired himself to Uji.
* 1088 (&quot;Kanji 2, in the 1st month&quot;): The emperor paid a visit to his father&#x27;s home.
* 1088 (&quot;Kanji 2, 10th month&quot;): Shirakawa visited the temples at Mt. Hiei.
* 1088 (&quot;Kanji 2, 14th day of the 12th&quot;): The &quot;sesshō&quot; Fujiwara Morozane was given additional honors with the further title of &quot;daijō-daijin&quot;. In this context, it matters a great deal that the mother of Emperor Horikawa, formerly the daughter of &quot;udaijin&quot; Minamoto no Akifusa, was also formerly the adopted child of Morozane.
* 1089 (&quot;Kanji 3, 5th month&quot;): Shirakawa made a second visit to Mt. Hiei; and this time, he stayed seven days.
* 1090 (&quot;Kanji 4, 12th month&quot;): Fujiwara Morozane was relieved of his responsibilities as &quot;sesshō&quot; and he was simultaneously named &quot;kampaku.&quot;
* 1094 (&quot;Kanji 8, 8th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Morozane resigned from his position as &quot;kampaku.&quot;
* 1095 (&quot;Kahō 2, i4th month&quot;): Emperor Horikawa paid visits to the Shinto Iwashimizu Shrine and to the Shinto Kamo Shrines.
* 1095 (&quot;Kahō 2, 8th month&quot;): The emperor was stricken with intermittent fevers; and he ordered prayers to be offered for his return to good health. After Horikawa recovered his health, he was generous and appreciative to the Buddhist priests who had prayed for his recovery.
* 1095 (&quot;Kahō 2, 11th month&quot;): The Buddhist priests of Mt. Hiei came down from their mountain to protest a dispute with Minamoto Yoshitsuna and other government officials which had led to military action and bloodshed. The priests carried a portable shrine as far as the central hall of Enryaku-ji, where a curse was laid on &quot;daijō-daijin&quot; Fujiwara Moromichi.
* 1096 (&quot;Kahō 3, 9th day of the 11th month&quot;): Former-Emperor Shirakawa entered the Buddhist priesthood at the age of 44 and received the Dharma name Yūkan (融観).
In 1096, on the occasion of his daughter&#x27;s death, Shirakawa entered a monastery under the name of Yūkan (融観); and thus, he became a &quot;hō-ō&quot; (法皇), which is the title accorded to a former emperor who has become a monk.

After the death of Emperor Horikawa, Shirakawa&#x27;s grandson became Emperor Toba. Shirakawa was still alive when Toba abdicated in turn to his son, who became Emperor Sutoku. By the time of his death in 1129, he had ruled as cloistered Emperor for 41 years and through the reigns of three emperors who were effectively little more than figureheads.

This emperor&#x27;s posthumous name comes from &quot;Shirakawa-in&quot; (白河院), the name of the residence from which he conducted his cloistered rule after abdicating the throne. Another name was Rokujō no Mikado (六条帝, Mikado being an old name for the Emperor of Japan).

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Shirakawa&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Norimichi, 997–1075.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Morozane, 1042–1101.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Morozane.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Moromichi, 1062–1099.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Minamoto no Takakuni.

==Eras of Shirakawa&#x27;s reign ==
The years of Shirakawa&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Enkyū&quot; (1069–1074)
* &quot;Jōhō&quot; (1074–1077)
* &quot;Jōryaku&quot; (1077–1081)
* &quot;Eihō&quot; (1081–1084)
* &quot;Ōtoku&quot; (1084–1087)

<text>&quot;Els Segadors&quot; (, ; &quot;The Reapers&quot;) is the official national anthem of Catalonia, nationality and autonomous community of Spain.

==History==
The original song dates in the oral tradition to 1640, based on the events of June 1640 known as &quot;Corpus de Sang&quot; (&quot;Corpus of Blood&quot;) during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) between Spain, England, France and Austria, the event that started the Reapers&#x27; War or , also known as the Catalan Revolt or Catalan Revolution, where Catalans fought against the Count-Duke of Olivares, the chief minister of King Philip IV of Spain, and eventually led to an open war and the establishment of a Catalan Republic under French protection. 

The song describes the events, an uprising of peasants due to the large and burdensome presence of the Spanish Royal army in the Principality of Catalonia, as they were required to lodge and provision the troops, thus leading to a large tension and discomfort and the outbreak of episodes such as religious sacrileges, destruction of personal properties, and rape of women by the soldiers. The second part of the song tells the arrival of the rebel reapers in Barcelona, who kill various guards, the royal officers and the viceroy of Catalonia, Dalmau de Queralt, ending with the exhortation to Catalans to take the arms, as they are at war.

In the 19th century, the text was compiled in the &quot;Romancillero Catalán&quot;, a book of folk traditions written by Manuel Milà i Fontanals. The music was standardized by Francesc Alió in 1892. Its modern lyrics were written by Emili Guanyavents, who won a competition convened by the political party Unió Catalanista in 1899, simplifying the text to three verses. At the time, the change of lyrics caused some controversy among conservative elements, as Guanyavents, coming from sectors close to anarchism, gave them a revolutionary tone.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;Els Segadors&quot; became one of the most relevant symbols of Catalanism and Catalonia itself, increasing its popularity during the Second Spanish Republic and the Civil War. Despite an early attempt of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalan autonomous government) in 1931 to replace it with another song, &quot;El Cant del Poble&quot;, &quot;Els Segadors&quot; remained highly popular, often treated by Catalan government and population as the national anthem. The dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939–1975) banned the public use of Catalan national symbolism as part of the broad anti-Catalanist policies, among them &quot;Els Segadors&quot;. Tolerated songs, such as the &quot;Virolai&quot; or &quot;La Santa Espina&quot;, were often played in its place to express Catalan identity.

After decades being use de facto, often alongside the &quot;Cant de la Senyera&quot;, the Catalan government officially adopted &quot;Els Segadors&quot; as the national anthem of Catalonia on 25 February 1993, by law of the Catatalan parliament. The official version was made in 1994. The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006 confirms this decision by its article 8.4, in which is explicitly defined as a national symbol of Catalonia, alongide the National Day and the flag.

=== Original lyrics: pre-1899 ===


== Recordings and variations ==
An arrangement of &quot;Els Segadors&quot; appears on &quot;Ballad of the Fallen&quot; by Charlie Haden (1983).
Contemporary Catalan composer Jordi Savall made a version of the folk song, using the original narrative (which dates back to the 17th century) combined with the modern lyrics and refrain, which were added later. The song has also been recorded and interpreted by major artists, included on albums such as &quot;Traditional Catalan Songs&quot; (Victoria de los Ángeles).

In October 2017, in the aftermath of the Catalan independence referendum, the American band A Sound of Thunder released a heavy metal variation of the anthem, using a mix of English and Catalan lyrics.

<text>Count Arvid Bernhard Horn af Ekebyholm (6 April 166418 April 1742) was a Swedish general, diplomat and politician, a member of the noble Horn family. He served twice as president of the privy council chancellery (1710–1719 and 1720–1738) and was one of the leading figures of the Swedish Age of Liberty.

== Soldier and diplomat ==
Arvid Bernhard Horn was born at Vuorentaka Manor in Halikko (now Salo, Finland). He was the son of Gustaf Horn af Kanckas (1627–1673) and his wife Anna Helena von Gertten (1640–1709). After completing his studies at the Royal Academy of Turku, he entered the Royal Swedish Army and served for several years in the Netherlands, in Hungary under Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663–1736), and in Flanders under Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck (1690–1695).

Horn stood high in the favour of King Charles XII of Sweden and was one of his foremost generals in the earlier part of the Great Northern War, being the captain lieutenant over the Drabant Corps since 1696. In 1704 he was entrusted with his first diplomatic mission, the deposition of Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and the election of King Stanislaus I, King of Poland. This mission. he accomplished with distinguished ability but absolute unscrupulousness. Shortly afterwards he was besieged by Augustus in Warsaw and compelled to surrender.

== Politician ==
In 1705 Horn was made a privy councillor and in 1706 a count. In 1708, he was given oversight of Charles XII&#x27;s nephew, Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1700–1739), who was under the guardianship of his grandmother Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp (1636–1715) following the death of his mother Hedvig Sophia of Sweden (1681–1708).

In 1710 Horn succeeded Nils Gyldenstolpe as president of the privy council chancellery. Transferred to the central point of the administration, he had ample opportunity of regarding with other eyes the situation of the kingdom, and in consequence of his remonstrances he fell rapidly in the favour of Charles XII. Both in 1710 and 1713 Horn was in favour of summoning the Estates, but when in 1714 the diet adopted an anti-monarchical attitude, he gravely warned and ultimately dissolved it. In Charles XII&#x27;s later years Horn had little to do with the administration. After the death of Charles XII, in 1718 it was Horn who persuaded Princess Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden (1688–1741) to be elected Queen of Sweden after she had agreed to renounce the powers of absolute monarchy established by her father, King Charles XI. However, he later protested against the queen&#x27;s autocratic behaviour and resigned from the privy council.

== President of the privy council ==
Horn was elected lantmarskalk, for the Caps Party (&quot;Mössorna&quot;) at the Riksdag of 1720, and contributed, on the resignation of Ulrika Eleonora, to the election of Frederick of Hesse as king of Sweden, whose first act was to restore to him to the privy council and as president of its chancellery, in effect as prime minister. For the next eighteen years he so absolutely controlled both the foreign and the domestic affairs of Sweden that the period between 1720 and 1738 has well been called the Horn period.

Horn&#x27;s strong hand kept the inevitable strife of the parliamentary factions within due limits, and it was entirely owing to his provident care that Sweden so rapidly recovered from the wretched condition in which the wars of Charles XII had plunged her. In his foreign policy Horn was extremely wary and cautious, yet without compromising either the independence or the self-respect of his country. He was, however, the promoter of a new principle of administration which in later days proved very dangerous to Sweden under ministers less capable than he was.

This was to increase the influence of the Riksdag of the Estates and its secret committees in the solution of purely diplomatic questions, which should have been left entirely to the executive, thus weakening the central government and at the same time facilitating the interference of foreign Powers in Sweden&#x27;s domestic affairs. Not till 1731 was there any appearance of opposition to Horn&#x27;s &quot;system&quot;; but Horn, piqued by the growing coolness of the king, the same year offered his resignation, which was not accepted.

In 1734, however, the opposition denounced his neutrality on the occasion of the War of the Polish Succession, when Stanislaus I of Poland again appeared upon the scene as a candidate for the Polish throne; but Horn still was able to prevent a rupture with Russia. Henceforth he was accused of want of patriotism, and in 1738 was compelled at last to retire before the triumphant young Hats Party (&quot;Hattarna&quot;).

For the remainder of his life, Horn lived in retirement at his estate at Ekebyholm Manor (&quot;Ekebyholms slott&quot;) at Norrtälje.

<text>Austin Lane Crothers (May 17, 1860 – May 25, 1912), was an American politician and a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 46th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1908 to 1912.

==Early life and career==
Crothers was born on May 17, 1860, near Conowingo in Cecil County, Maryland, the eighth son of Margaret Aurelia (née Porter) and Alpheus Crothers. He was raised on his father&#x27;s farm, spending much of his life there. Educated at West Nottingham Academy, he spent several years in the work force, first as a store clerk, then as a public school teacher. He was inspired to become a lawyer, and graduated from the University of Maryland Law School in 1890. He practiced law in Elkton until becoming the State&#x27;s Attorney for Cecil County, a post he held from 1891 to 1895.

In 1897, Austin Crothers was elected to the Maryland State Senate as a Democrat, replacing his brother Charles C. Crothers. During the session of 1900, he became his party&#x27;s leader in the Senate after becoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He was re-nominated for the 1901 election, but was defeated by the Republican Henry M. McCullough. Crothers continued to act as party leader in Cecil County, but still failed another re-election attempt in 1905.

In 1906, Governor Edwin Warfield appointed Crothers to succeed the late Judge Edwin H. Brown as an associate judge for the Second Judicial Circuit, which included Cecil County. However, he refused to run for a second term, and instead ran for governor in 1907. Despite being a relative unknown, Crothers was elected into office.

He is also the British Guy in Oversimplified videos.

==Governor of Maryland==
Crothers&#x27; tenure as governor was notable for its reform aspects. He created the State Roads Commission in 1908 to improve Maryland&#x27;s road system; he pushed through a Corrupt Practices Act to create more accountability for campaign funds; and he supported the direct election of U.S. Senators (though that actually passed into law after his term). Crothers also pushed for the creation of the Public Service Commission and the State Bank Commissioner. He supported pure food laws, better care for the mentally ill, and increased taxes for collateral inheritance and automobile licenses. A number of reforms designed at helping workers were also carried out. 

He tried to reform the Baltimore Board of Police Commissioners, initiating an extensive investigation that led to charges against them. Crothers removed the three supposedly corrupt members and tried to fill their posts with chosen replacements while the originals awaited trial. However, the Maryland Court of Appeals determined that the governor did not have such power, neither to remove them or replace them before their time in court. Crothers still tried to bring the charges against them, but nothing came of it.

Crothers also supported the 1910 Digges Amendment to the Maryland Constitution, which would have used property qualifications to disenfranchise African Americans. He also barely refrained (following a public outcry) from supporting a bill which would have effectively passed the bill&#x27;s requirements into law even before the people ratified it. The Amendment was rejected by the people of Maryland.

Crothers&#x27;s actions led to some problems with Maryland&#x27;s other politicians, including members of his own party, near the end of his time as governor. Crothers was sick when he left office in 1912, and eventually died at the home of his nephew, Omar D. Crothers, in Elkton on May 25 of that year. He was buried at West Nottingham Cemetery.

<text>James Wilson Marshall (October 8, 1810 – August 10, 1885) was an American carpenter and sawmill operator, who on January 24, 1848, reported the finding of gold at Coloma, California, a small settlement on the American River about 36 miles northeast of Sacramento. His discovery was the impetus for the California gold rush. The mill property was owned by Johann (John) Sutter who employed Marshall to build his mill. The wave of gold seekers turned everyone&#x27;s attention away from the mill which eventually fell into disrepair and was never used as intended. Neither Marshall nor Sutter ever profited from the gold find.

==Biography==

James Wilson Marshall, of English descent, was born to Philip Marshall and Sarah Wilson (married 1808) at the family homestead in Hopewell Township, New Jersey (then part of Hunterdon County, New Jersey, currently part of Mercer County) on October 8, 1810. The family homestead was known as the Round Mountain Farm and is still known as Marshalls Corner. He was the oldest of four children, and the only male. In 1816, the Marshall family relocated to nearby Lambertville, where Philip constructed a still-surviving house on approximately five acres of land.

James left New Jersey in 1834 and headed west. After spending time in Indiana and Illinois, he settled in Missouri (in an area created by the Platte Purchase) in 1844, and began farming along the Missouri River. It was there that he contracted malaria, a common affliction in the area. On the advice of his doctor, Marshall left Missouri in the hopes of improving his health. He joined an emigrant train heading west and arrived in Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley in the spring of 1845. He left Oregon in June 1845 and headed south along the Siskiyou Trail into California, eventually reaching Sutter&#x27;s Fort, California, an agricultural settlement, in mid-July. John Sutter, the founder of Sutter&#x27;s Fort, was also the &quot;alcalde&quot; of the area, as California was still a Mexican possession in 1845. Sutter hired Marshall to assist with work at the sawmill, and around the fort (carpentry, primarily). He also helped Marshall to buy two leagues of land on the north side of Butte Creek (a tributary of the Sacramento River) and provided him with cattle. It was here that Marshall began his second stint as a farmer.

Soon after this, the Mexican–American War began in May 1846. Marshall volunteered and served under Captain John C. Frémont&#x27;s California Battalion during the Bear Flag Revolt. When he left the battalion and returned to his ranch in early 1847, he found that all his cattle had either strayed or been stolen. With his sole source of income gone, Marshall lost his land.
Marshall soon entered into a partnership with Sutter for the construction of a sawmill. Marshall was to oversee the construction and operation of the mill, and would in return receive a portion of the lumber. After scouting nearby areas for a suitable location, he eventually decided upon Coloma, located roughly upstream of Sutter&#x27;s Fort on the American River. He proposed his plan to Sutter, and construction began in late August. His crew consisted mainly of local Native Americans and veterans of the Mormon Battalion on their way to Salt Lake City, Utah.

Construction continued into January 1848, when it was discovered that the tailrace portion of the mill (the ditch that drained water away from the waterwheel) was too narrow and shallow for the volume of water needed to operate the saw. Marshall decided to use the natural force of the river to excavate and enlarge the tailrace. This could only be done at night, so as not to endanger the lives of the men working on the mill during the day. Every morning Marshall examined the results of the previous night&#x27;s excavation.

==Gold discovery==
On the morning of January 24, 1848, Marshall was examining the channel below the mill when he noticed some shiny flecks in the channel bed. As later recounted by Marshall:

The metal was confirmed to be gold after members of Marshall&#x27;s crew performed tests on the metal—boiling it in lye soap and hammering it to test its malleability. Marshall, still concerned with the completion of the sawmill, permitted his crew to search for gold during their free time.

By the time Marshall returned to Sutter&#x27;s Fort, four days later, the war had ended and California was about to fall under American possession subsequent to the signing of the Treaty Of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848. Marshall shared his discovery with Sutter, who performed further tests on the gold and told Marshall that it was &quot;of the finest quality, of at least 23 karat [96% pure]&quot;.
News of the discovery soon reached around the world. The immediate impact on Marshall was negative. His sawmill failed when all the able-bodied men in the area abandoned everything to search for gold. Before long, arriving hordes of prospectors forced him off his land. Marshall soon left the area.

Marshall returned to Coloma in 1857 and found some success in the 1860s with a vineyard that he started. That venture ended in failure towards the end of the decade, due mostly to higher taxes and increased competition. He returned to prospecting in the hopes of finding success.

He became a partner in a gold mine near Kelsey, California but the mine yielded nothing and left Marshall practically bankrupt. The California State Legislature awarded him a two-year pension in 1872 in recognition of his role in an important era in California history. It was renewed in 1874 and 1876 but lapsed in 1878. Marshall, penniless, eventually ended up in a small cabin.

Marshall died in Kelsey on August 10, 1885. In 1886, the members of the Native Sons of the Golden West, Placerville Parlor #9 felt that the &quot;Discoverer of Gold&quot; deserved a monument to mark his final resting place. In May 1890, five years after Marshall&#x27;s death, Placerville Parlor #9 of the Native Sons of the Golden West successfully advocated the idea of a monument to the State Legislature, which appropriated a total of $9,000 (~$ in ) for the construction of a monument and tomb which can be seen today, the first such monument erected in California. A statue of Marshall stands on top of the monument, pointing to the spot where he made his discovery in 1848. The monument was rededicated October 8, 2010, by the Native Sons of the Golden West, Georgetown Parlor #91 in honor of the 200th Anniversary of James W. Marshall&#x27;s birth.

<doc id="202209" wikidata="Q311589" url="?curid=202209" title="Ken Akamatsu">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist and politician who has served since 2022 as a member of the House of Councillors. He made his professional manga debut in 1993, and is best known as the author of &quot;Love Hina&quot; (1998–2001) and &quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot; (2003–2012), both serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;; a sequel to &quot;Negima!&quot;, &quot;UQ Holder!&quot;, was serialized from 2013 to 2022. In 2011, Akamatsu founded J-Comi (now Manga Library Z), a free digital distributor of out-of-print manga.

Akamatsu has been a managing director of the Japan Cartoonists Association since 2018, and is a vocal advocate for protecting freedom of expression in manga and anime from expansions in censorship and copyright law. In the 2022 Japanese House of Councillors election, he won a seat as a candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party in the national proportional representation block on a free expression platform, becoming the first manga creator in the National Diet. On November 13, 2024, he was appointed Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Reconstruction as part of the Second Ishiba Cabinet. 

==Early life==

Ken Akamatsu was born in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, on July 5, 1968. His father, a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, was often transferred, and the family lived in Yamagata, the Kita ward of Tokyo, Kumamoto, Higashikurume, and Kawasaki. Akamatsu attended private Kaijō High School in Shinjuku, Tokyo, and entered Chuo University&#x27;s Department of Japanese Literature. He has cited &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; as his introduction to anime and manga. While in college, he was active as a &quot;doujinshi&quot; creator and sold works at Comiket under the pen name .

== Professional manga ==
In 1993, Akamatsu won the 50th Shōnen Magazine Newcomer Award for his debut work &quot;Hito Natsu no Kids Game&quot;, published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Magazine Fresh&quot;. The following year, he began serializing &quot;A.I. Love You&quot; (1994–1997) in the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;. &quot;Love Hina&quot;, published in the magazine from 1998 to 2001, established his popularity, and in 2001 earned him the 25th Kodansha Manga Award (in the &quot;shōnen&quot; category). His next work, &quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot;, was serialized from 2003 to 2012, also in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;. Akamatsu&#x27;s latest manga serial is &quot;UQ Holder!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Negima!&quot; which debuted in the magazine in 2013; it was later transferred to &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine&quot; and concluded in 2022. The volumes of &quot;UQ Holder!&quot; became the first to carry a &quot;Doujin Mark&quot; indicating explicit author permission for use as a source for fan-made works, the result of a publishing initiative led by Akamatsu.

In 2010, Akamatsu launched a beta test of J-Comi (now Manga Library Z), a free manga download site for out-of-print titles. As the first release, he posted all 14 volumes of &quot;Love Hina&quot; with six pages of advertising and no digital rights management (DRM) for one month. Manga publishers Kodansha and Shueisha began collaborating with the site after the test, and the site formally launched in 2011. The site gained notoriety later that year when it posted Seiji Matsuyama&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;My Wife Is an Elementary Student&quot;) manga, which Tokyo Vice Governor Naoki Inose had cited as an example of a work that should be restricted for physical sale under Tokyo&#x27;s recently revised Healthy Development of Youths Ordinance.

As of 2022, Akamatsu&#x27;s manga have a cumulative circulation of over 50 million worldwide. His &quot;Love Hina&quot;, &quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot;, and &quot;UQ Holder!&quot; have been adapted as anime series; &quot;Negima!&quot; has also been adapted as a live-action television series.

== Advocacy and politics ==
Akamatsu is a vocal advocate for protection of freedom of expression in anime and manga, and has been an opponent of government attempts to expand censorship and copyright law.

In 2011, he warned that proposed changes to copyright law under the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would &quot;destroy&quot; Japan&#x27;s derivative &quot;doujin&quot; scene; he continued to voice his concerns in following years. In 2013, as spokesman of the Japan Cartoonists Association (JCA), he joined other creators in opposing the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partners&#x27; proposed amendment to Japan&#x27;s child pornography laws, the draft version of which included wholly-fictional depictions such as &quot;lolicon&quot; manga in its definitions. Akamatsu visited the National Diet and the LDP headquarters to express his concern, and the final bill passed in 2014 without a ban on explicit anime and manga. He was appointed a managing director of the JCA in 2018. In 2019, Akamatsu and the JCA expressed concern on a government subcommittee&#x27;s plan to expand copyright law, under which downloading or taking screenshots of anime images and illustrations illegally posted to blogs and Twitter would have been made illegal, as would copying and pasting song lyrics. In 2020, Akamatsu was invited to advise legislators in the Diet on the future of manga, stating that &quot;[c]ompared to other countries, Japan&#x27;s forte is its freedom of creativity&quot; and that &quot;a situation where Japanese works are regulated by foreign standards&quot; should be avoided.

In December 2021, Akamatsu announced a candidacy in the 2022 election for the national proportional representation block of the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet, under the LDP banner. He stated that his major goal was to protect creative freedom of expression, and during the election campaign criticized &quot;external pressure&quot; (both foreign and domestic) to regulate Japan&#x27;s &quot;freedom of expression, especially for manga, anime, and games&quot;, elaborating that such regulations need to be &quot;approached with rationality&quot;. On July 10, 2022, Akamatsu won a seat after campaigning in person in all 47 prefectures, becoming the first manga creator in the National Diet. An early initiative of his was a task force on a proposed legal framework for preservation of past and present Japanese video games in a playable state. Since his election, Akamatsu has been pursuing &quot;manga diplomacy&quot;, and he argued that capitalizing on intellectual property is Japan&#x27;s path to victory.

==Personal life ==
Akamatsu is married to Kanon Akamatsu, a professional cosplayer and former idol; they have two daughters.

<doc id="202211" wikidata="Q2264249" url="?curid=202211" title="Night in the Ruts">
<text>Night in the Ruts is the sixth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on November 16, 1979, by Columbia Records. Guitarist Joe Perry left the band midway through the album&#x27;s recording.

The album was initially produced at the band&#x27;s Wherehouse rehearsal space by Jack Douglas, who&#x27;d produced Aerosmith&#x27;s previous four albums, but later Columbia Records brought in Gary Lyons to replace Douglas as producer.

==Background==
Recording of the album began in the spring of 1979, but right from the beginning there were delays. Hampered by rampant drug use, vocalist Steven Tyler had difficulty completing lyrics and vocals. Bassist Tom Hamilton recalled: &quot;We worked on the album, but we couldn&#x27;t finish it. It was supposed to come out in June and be called &quot;Off Your Rocker&quot;, but there were no lyrics. It was a big crisis.&quot; The band members were also in dire financial straits, with guitarist Joe Perry owing the band $80,000 for room service, which he planned to repay by recording a solo album. The relationship between Aerosmith and Jack Douglas also became frosty and unstable when the producer divorced his wife, whom the band had liked. This, combined with weak sales of &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, led to Columbia stepping in, with Douglas reflecting in the band memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;The label finally put a lot of pressure on them. It was: &quot;Look at these sales numbers. Come up with another hit or there&#x27;s going to be trouble.&#x27; David [Krebs, Aerosmith&#x27;s manager] thought I no longer exercised control over the band, which was true. No one did.&quot;

With the album still unfinished, the band was sent on tour to generate revenue, as they had burned through the budget allotment. This premature outing during the summer months pushed the album&#x27;s release to later in the year. &quot;Our management booked a tour,&quot; Hamilton noted, &quot;leaving us just enough time to make the record, based on how long it&#x27;d taken us in the past, but we actually needed much more time. So we had to go on tour before the vocals were finished, and it was dragging on and on. Everyone was super-frustrated by it. It&#x27;s ironic, because we were out on the road, playing stadiums to huge amounts of people, and yet the band was getting ready to die.&quot;

Substance abuse among the members gradually worsened, and they started fighting among themselves. This often led to missed and sloppy live performances, culminating in a fight involving the members and their wives. The situation came to a head on July 28, 1979, at the World Series of Rock in Cleveland, Ohio when Perry left the band halfway through the tour after a heated argument with Tyler. Prior to Perry&#x27;s departure, he had completed guitar parts for &quot;No Surprize&quot;, &quot;Chiquita&quot;, &quot;Cheese Cake&quot;, “Reefer Headed Woman”, &quot;Three Mile Smile&quot;, and &quot;Bone to Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)&quot;. Guitar parts for the remaining songs were recorded by Brad Whitford, Richie Supa, Neil Thompson, and Jimmy Crespo. (The last became Perry&#x27;s official replacement from 1979 to 1984.) Perry&#x27;s last session with the band was on May 30, 1979. He stated:
In his 2014 autobiography &quot;Rocks&quot;, Perry elaborated on his frustrations:
==Recording and composition==

Aerosmith spent the summer at Mediasound Studios in New York trying to finish off the album with producer Gary Lyons. The band caught a second wind when Tyler came up with lyrics for a song he had been composing with Perry that &quot;told the story of the band,&quot; which became &quot;No Surprize,&quot; a song that Tyler has cited as his favorite. In the band&#x27;s 1997 memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, Tyler shared his thoughts on several of the album&#x27;s tracks:
* &quot;No Surprize&quot; - &quot;For two months, I&#x27;d been totally blocked, writing lyrics for this track we had done with Joe. &#x27;My name is nah nah nah, I come from Yonkers High, and I get drunk at night.&#x27; One night I had such a revelation to write the story of the band, how Aerosmith got started... I was so excited to be back on track.&quot;
* &quot;Reefer Headed Woman&quot; - &quot;&#x27;Reefer Head Woman&#x27; was a 1940s blues record. I had the lyrics in a notebook that got stolen, and I had to call Dr. Demento from the Record Plant, where we finished the album, and the Doctor read the lyrics to me over the phone.&quot;
* &quot;Bone to Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)&quot; - I had to explain to the press that a Coney Island whitefish is a used rubber.&quot;
* &quot;Mia&quot; - &quot;It was a lullaby I wrote on the piano for my daughter, but the tolling bell notes at the end of the song and the end of the album sounded more like the death knell of Aerosmith for people who knew what was going on.&quot;

Also included on the album was a cover of &quot;Think About It,&quot; a Yardbirds B-side from 1968 that Aerosmith had occasionally played live through the 70s. Promo videos for &quot;No Surprize&quot; and &quot;Chiquita&quot; were filmed (featuring Jimmy Crespo). &quot;Chiquita&quot; is available on the band&#x27;s &quot;Video Scrapbook&quot; VHS and laserdisc release.

The album title is a spoonerism for the phrase &quot;right in the nuts,&quot; which is alluded to on the album&#x27;s rear cover artwork.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
The album was panned by contemporary critics and despite some early success, it quickly fell down the charts. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Fricke described the album&#x27;s best tracks &quot;like inspired outtakes from &quot;Rocks&quot; and &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;&quot;, showing Aerosmith&#x27;s return to their basic sound; however, he found &quot;the deviations from this norm... disastrous, if not in concept then in execution,&quot; as in the cover of Shangri-Las ballad &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; &quot;wavering inconsistently between hard rock and the Spectorian grandeur of the original&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau considered the opening song &quot;No Surprize&quot; the only &quot;promising&quot; track on the album. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;they&#x27;re playing here from mere force of habit and not even a rocked-up version of &#x27;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&#x27; can disguise the fact that this is humorless, spiritless drivel.&quot;

Critic Greg Prato of AllMusic offered a more charitable commentary in a historical context, calling it &quot;a surprisingly coherent and inspired album. Although it&#x27;s not up to par with such classics as &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; or &quot;Rocks&quot; (although it could have been if the band weren&#x27;t in such a state of turmoil at the time), it was definitely leaner and more focused than the [band&#x27;s previous] studio release, &quot;Draw the Line&quot;.&quot; In his &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot;, Martin Popoff found the album &quot;a solid record&quot; and a &quot;triumph amidst adversity&quot; which, even with the &quot;band at its least energetic, coherent and cohesive&quot;, exudes &quot;the canny genius of years spent welding modern flash rock to the blues.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Tyler has expressed great satisfaction with &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, calling it his favorite album and cryptically enthusing to Stephen Davis in 1997, &quot;Heroin. Shooting coke. Eating opium and it was just... I love that album&quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;. It&#x27;s like a fuckin&#x27; solar eclipse.&quot; Perry also insisted to &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1997, &quot;We were still fucked up, but the record sounds more cohesive than &quot;Draw the Line&quot;. &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; was a rockin&#x27; record.&quot;

<doc id="202214" wikidata="Q5275651" url="?curid=202214" title="Digges Amendment">
<text>The Digges Amendment was an amendment to the Maryland Constitution, proposed in 1910, to curtail the Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and disenfranchise black voters in the state with the use of a property requirement. It was an initiative by predominately white conservative Democratic Party members in the state.

The amendment was drafted by Democratic state delegate (lower house) Walter Digges and co-sponsored by state senator (upper house) William J. Frere, both from Charles County, Maryland. The proposal was passed by the Democratic-dominated Maryland General Assembly and approved by Governor Austin Lane Crothers but was not ratified by the required general election voter referendum. 

The Digges Amendment, if ratified, would have granted the right to vote for all white male citizens over the age of 21. All other men had to prove ownership and taxes on a minimum of $500 worth of property for two previous consecutive years. Along with the introduction of this amendment and before the general election referendum of 1911, the Maryland General Assembly also attempted to pass a temporary voter registration law that would limit the votes from black-majority counties. This law was vetoed by the Governor due to popular opposition, as African Americans were politically active and fought this law. All male Marylanders continued to have the chance to vote in the election.

In Maryland&#x27;s unrestricted general election of 1911, the Digges Amendment was defeated with 46,220 votes for and 83,920 votes against the proposal. Nationally Maryland citizens achieved the most notable rejection of a black-disfranchising amendment. The power of black men at the ballot box and economically helped them resist this disfranchising effort.

==History==
After a brief period of Republican control in Maryland from 1896 to 1900 during the tenure of governor Lloyd Lowndes Jr., when the party was supported by many African Americans, Democrats regained control of the government on a white supremacist platform. They responded to the election of African-American Republican politicians in municipal and state offices. Black men comprised 20% of the electorate, while immigrant men comprised 15% of the voting population, and both opposed these measures. The legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants. The Democrats made three separate attempts to amend the Maryland Constitution so as to disenfranchise the black votes: the Poe Amendment of 1905, the Strauss Amendment of 1908-1909 and the Digges Amendment of 1910-1911. All three of the proposals were subsequently defeated by voter referendums.

Maryland did not ratify the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870. Digges and Frere, both from the Republican stronghold of Charles County, argued that the amendment provisions did not apply at the state level. The Digges plan was opposed by Southern leaders, who were concerned that such extreme and blatant challenge to the Fifteen Amendment would undermine their own legal attempts underway to circumvent the enfranchisement of black votes. Beginning with Mississippi in 1890, most Southern states had passed new constitutions and other laws that made voter registration more difficult and effectively disenfranchised most blacks.

The Democratic gubernatorial nominee Arthur Pue Gorman Jr. lost to Republican Phillips Lee Goldsborough by a close margin in the 1911 Maryland gubernatorial election. Goldsborough became the second Republican governor of Maryland since the end of Reconstruction.

<doc id="202216" wikidata="Q374015" url="?curid=202216" title="Emperor Murakami">
<text>was the 62nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Murakami&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 946 to his death in 967.

==Biography==
Before he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Nariakira&quot;-shinnō&quot; (成明親王).

Nariakira&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the 14th son of Emperor Daigo, and the younger brother of Emperor Suzaku by another mother.

Murakami had ten Empresses and Imperial consorts and 19 Imperial sons and daughters.

==Events of Murakami&#x27;s reign==
In 944, he was appointed crown prince and ascended the throne two years later.

* 16 May 946 (&quot;Tengyō 9, 13th day of the 4th month&quot;): In the 16th year of the reign of Emperor Suzaku (朱雀天皇十六年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (the &quot;senso&quot;) was received by his younger brother, Nariakira-shinnō.
* 31 May 946 (&quot;Tengyō 9, 28th day of the 4th month&quot;): Shortly thereafter, Emperor Murakami, who was 21 years old, acceded to the throne (the &quot;sokui&quot;).

Murakami&#x27;s maternal uncle Fujiwara no Tadahira remained as the &quot;Sessho&quot; regent until 949. After the death of Tadahira, there was no regent and although contemporaries praised Murakami as the emperor who governed the state directly, in reality the Fujiwara clan seized power and ruled Japan. The brothers Fujiwara no Saneyori and Fujiwara no Morosuke became the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Japan.

* 23 October 949 (&quot;Tenryaku 3, 29th day of the 9th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Yōzei died at the age of 82.
* 951 (&quot;Tenryaku 5&quot;): The emperor ordered the compilation of &quot;Gosen Wakashū&quot;; this work was undertaken by the Five Men of the Pear Chamber under his patronage.
* 6 September 952 (&quot;Tenryaku 6, 15th day of the 8th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Suzaku died at the age of 30.
* 16 October 960 (&quot;Tentoku 4, 23rd day of the 9th month&quot;): The Imperial palace burned down, the first time it had been ravaged by fire since the capital was removed from Nara to Heian-kyō in 794.

Murakami was a central figure in Heian period culture. He was also a skilled flute and koto (Japanese harp) player.

* 5 July 967 (&quot;Kōhō 4, 25th day of the 5th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Murakami died at the age of 42.

The actual site of Murakami&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Murakami&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Murakami no misasagi&quot;

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Murakami&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadahira (藤原忠平), 880–949.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadahira (藤原忠平).
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Ono-no Miya Fujiwara no Saneyori (藤原実頼), 900–970.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Saneyori (藤原実頼).
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Morosuke (藤原師輔), 908–960.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Akitada　(藤原顕忠).
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, 　(源高明).
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

<text>was the 64th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

En&#x27;yū&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 969 through 984.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Morihira&quot;-shinnō&quot;.

Morihira&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the fifth son of Emperor Murakami by the empress consort &quot;Anshi&quot;, the daughter of Fujiwara no Morosuke, therefore the brother of Emperor Reizei.

In 967, Morihira&quot;-shinnō&quot; was appointed as the crown prince, bypassing his elder brother by the same mother, since his brother had no support from the Fujiwara clan.

En&#x27;yū had five Empresses or Imperial consorts and one Imperial son.

==Events of En&#x27;yū&#x27;s life==

* 27 September 969 (&quot;Anna 2, 13th day of the 8th month&quot;): In the 3rd year of Emperor Reizei&#x27;s reign (冷泉天皇三年), he abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a younger brother.
* 5 November 969 (&quot;Anna 2, 23rd day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor En&#x27;yu is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).
* 8 June 976 (&quot;Ten&#x27;en 2, 11th day of the 5th month&quot;): The Imperial Palace burned down; and the Sacred Mirror was blackened to such an extent that it reflected no light.
* 31 December 980 (&quot;Tengen 3, 22nd day of the 11th month&quot;): The Imperial Palace burned down; and the Sacred Mirror was half destroyed.
* 5 December 982 (&quot;Tengen 5, 17th day of the 11th month&quot;): The Imperial Palace burned down; and the Sacred Mirror was reduced to a lump of melted metal which was collected and presented to the emperor.

In his reign there was a severe struggle between the Fujiwara clan over who would be appointed &quot;kampaku&quot;. Emperor En&#x27;yū followed his mother&#x27;s advice and favored Fujiwara no Kanemichi, his maternal uncle. He had only one son, later the emperor Emperor Ichijō by Senshi, a daughter of his uncle Fujiwara no Kaneie, who was another brother of his mother. He made the daughter of Kanemichi the empress consort, though she bore no children. Senshi and her father Kaneie were angry at this elevation of their rival and were absent from the court for a long time, staying at the mansion of Kaneie with the child.

Imperial processions to the Hachiman and Hirano Shrines were first made during the reign of Emperor En&#x27;yū.

* 24 September 984 (&quot;Eikan 2, 27th of the 8th month&quot;): The emperor abdicated at age 26.
* 16 September 985 (&quot;Kanna 1, 29th of the 8th month&quot;): The former-Emperor En&#x27;yū took the tonsure, becoming a Buddhist priest and taking the name of Kongō Hō.
* 1 March 991 (&quot;Shōryaku 2, 12th of the 2nd month&quot;): En&#x27;yū, now known as Kongō Hō, died at age 32.

The actual site of En&#x27;yū&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as En&#x27;yū&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Nochi no Mukarami no misasagi&quot;.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During En&#x27;yū&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ōno-no-miya Fujiwara no Saneyori (藤原実頼), 900–970.

* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Minamoto no Nobumitsu (源延光) (Gon-no-Dainagon, 権大納言)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara no Tamemitsu (藤原為光)

<text>Sushun (Manchu: &quot;Uksun Sušun&quot;; 26 November 1816 – November 1861), courtesy name Yuting, was a Manchu noble and politician of the Qing dynasty. He was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty, as the sixth son of Ulgungga. Ulgungga was distantly related to the Qing dynasty emperors and was the 12th heir to the Prince Zheng line, one of the &quot;iron-cap&quot; princely peerages of the Qing dynasty. Since the line of Prince Zheng was in charge of the Bordered Blue Banner, Sushun was a member of this banner. Sushun was a supporter of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang but also characterized by his firm
policy against the West.

Although Sushun was born into nobility, the size of his family meant that he received little attention during childhood, and little expectation from the family. He was neither well versed in literature nor exceptionally able in martial arts. Sushun became a military general during the late years of the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s reign. Following the death of Wenqing, one of the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s closest aides, Sushun was increasingly consulted by the emperor on many important policy matters. His first position in the court was as a member of the Imperial Guard and he subsequently served in a number of senior positions in the government, including a term as the president of the Lifan Yuan. During the Second Opium War, he was one of the chief architects of Qing foreign policy and he repudiated many of the treaties that were concluded in the late 1850s, in particular the territorial concessions in the Sino-Russian Treaty of Aigun. In 1859 Sushun instituted draconian monetary reforms.

Following the death of the Xianfeng Emperor in 1861, Sushun, his elder brother Duanhua, and Zaiyuan, along with five other prominent people in the Qing imperial court, were appointed regents to oversee administrative affairs during the young Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s minority. However, without obtaining the seals of the two empress dowagers (Ci&#x27;an and Cixi), the regency could not carry out any important policy decisions, which led to increased political friction in the imperial court. In November 1861, a triumvirate consisting of Prince Gong (the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s brother) and the two empress dowagers staged the Xinyou Coup, establishing themselves as the only rightful regents of the Tongzhi Emperor. All the members of the eight-men council were arrested and Sushun was beheaded in public in 1861 on charges of treason.

<text>Baron Gustaf Bonde (4 February 1620 – 25 May 1667) was a Swedish statesman. He was a persistent advocate of a pacifist policy at a time when war on the slightest provocation was the watchword of every Swedish politician.

Even the popular Polish adventure of Charles X of Sweden was strenuously opposed by Bonde, though when once it was decided upon he materially assisted the king to find the means for carrying it on. He was also in favour of strict economy coupled with the recovery of the royal domains which had fallen into the hands of the nobles, though his natural partiality for his fellow-peers came out clearly enough when in 1655 he was appointed a member of Charles X&#x27;s land-recovery commission. In 1660 he succeeded Herman Fleming as Lord High Treasurer, and was one of the council of regency appointed to govern Sweden during the minority of Charles XI of Sweden.

In 1661 he presented to the Privy Council a plan which aimed at rendering Sweden altogether independent of foreign subsidies, by a policy of peace, economy and trade-development, and by further recovery of alienated estates. His budget in the following year, framed on the same principles, subsequently served as an invaluable guide to Charles XI. Bonde&#x27;s extraordinary tenacity of purpose enabled him for some years to carry out his programme, despite the opposition of the majority of the senate and his co-regents, who preferred the more adventurous methods of the chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, ultimately so ruinous to Sweden. But the ambition of the oligarchs, and the fear and jealousy of innumerable monopolists who rose in arms against his policy of economy, proved at last too strong for Bonde, while the costly and useless expedition against Bremen in 1665, undertaken contrary to his advice, completed the ruin of the finances.

In his later years Bonde&#x27;s powers of resistance were weakened by sickness and mortification at the triumph of reckless extravagance, and he practically retired from the government some time before his death.

<doc id="202240" wikidata="Q25368" url="?curid=202240" title="Bivalvia">
<text>Bivalvia () or bivalves, in previous centuries referred to as the Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda, is a class of aquatic molluscs (marine and freshwater) that have laterally compressed soft bodies enclosed by a calcified exoskeleton consisting of a hinged pair of half-shells known as valves. As a group, bivalves have no head and lack some typical molluscan organs such as the radula and the odontophore. Their gills have evolved into ctenidia, specialised organs for feeding and breathing.

Common bivalves include clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, as well as a number of families that live in freshwater. Majority of the class are benthic filter feeders that bury themselves in sediment, where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some bivalves, such as scallops and file shells, can swim. Shipworms bore into wood, clay, or stone and live inside these substances.

The shell of a bivalve is composed of calcium carbonate, and consists of two, usually similar, parts called valves. These valves are for feeding and for disposal of waste. These are joined together along one edge (the hinge line) by a flexible ligament that, usually in conjunction with interlocking &quot;teeth&quot; on each of the valves, forms the hinge. This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves detaching. The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with the hinge lying in the sagittal plane. Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length, but the majority of species do not exceed 10 cm (4 in).

Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal and riparian human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.

Bivalves appear in the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of known living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine bivalves (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.

== Etymology ==
The taxonomic term Bivalvia was first used by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758 to refer to animals having shells composed of two valves. More recently, the class was known as Pelecypoda, meaning &quot;axe-foot&quot; (based on the shape of the foot of the animal when extended).

The name &quot;bivalve&quot; is derived from the Latin , meaning &#x27;two&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;leaves of a door&#x27;. (&quot;Leaf&quot; is an older word for the main, movable part of a door. We normally consider this the door itself.) Paired shells have evolved independently several times among animals that are not bivalves; other animals with paired valves include certain gastropods (small sea snails in the family Juliidae), members of the phylum Brachiopoda and the minute crustaceans known as ostracods and conchostracans.

== Anatomy ==

Bivalves have bilaterally symmetrical and laterally flattened bodies, with a blade-shaped foot, vestigial head and no radula. At the dorsal or back region of the shell is the hinge point or line, which contain the umbo and beak and the lower, curved margin is the ventral or underside region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer&#x27;s left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right. Many bivalves such as clams, which appear upright, are evolutionarily lying on their side.

=== Mantle and shell ===

The shell is composed of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, as is the case in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, as is the case in the order Pteriida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a thin layer composed of horny conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted by the outer mantle and is easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.

In all molluscs, the mantle forms a thin membrane that covers the animal&#x27;s body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the valves, and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, byssus threads (where present), and teeth. The posterior mantle edge may have two elongated extensions known as siphons, through one of which water is inhaled, and the other expelled. The siphons retract into a cavity, known as the pallial sinus.

The shell grows larger when more material is secreted by the mantle edge, and the valves themselves thicken as more material is secreted from the general mantle surface. Calcareous matter comes from both its diet and the surrounding seawater. Concentric rings on the exterior of a valve are commonly used to age bivalves. For some groups, a more precise method for determining the age of a shell is by cutting a cross section through it and examining the incremental growth bands.

The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.

=== Muscles and ligaments===
The main muscular system in bivalves is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles. These muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. The valves are also joined dorsally by the hinge ligament, which is an extension of the periostracum. The ligament is responsible for opening the shell, and works against the adductor muscles when the animal opens and closes. Retractor muscles connect the mantle to the edge of the shell, along a line known as the pallial line. These muscles pull the mantle though the valves.

In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In species that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull. Paired pedal protractor and retractor muscles operate the animal&#x27;s foot.

=== Nervous system ===
The sedentary habits of the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network and a series of paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are on either side of the oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.

==== Senses ====
The sensory organs of bivalves are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey. Many bivalves have no eyes, but a few members of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.

=== Circulation and respiration ===
Bivalves have an open circulatory system that bathes the organs in blood (hemolymph). The heart has three chambers: two auricles receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, and then to the rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal. The hemolymph usually lacks any respiratory pigment. In the carnivorous genus &quot;Poromya&quot;, the hemolymph has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin pigment.

The paired gills are located posteriorly and consist of hollow tube-like filaments with thin walls for gas exchange. The respiratory demands of bivalves are low, due to their relative inactivity. Some freshwater species, when exposed to the air, can gape the shell slightly and gas exchange can take place. Oysters, including the Pacific oyster (&quot;Magallana gigas&quot;), are recognized as having varying metabolic responses to environmental stress, with changes in respiration rate being frequently observed.

=== Digestive system ===

==== Modes of feeding ====
Most bivalves are filter feeders, using their gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. Protobranchs feed in a different way, scraping detritus from the seabed, and this may be the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the bottom with a pair of tentacles at the edge of the mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.

In more advanced bivalves, water is drawn into the shell from the posterior ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. There may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in a steady stream of mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.

A few bivalves, such as the granular poromya (&quot;Poromya granulata&quot;), are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in prey. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.

The unusual genus, &quot;Entovalva&quot;, is endosymbiotic, being found only in the oesophagus of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host&#x27;s throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.

==== Digestive tract ====
The digestive tract of typical bivalves consists of an oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. Protobranch stomachs have a mere sac attached to them while filter-feeding bivalves have elongated rod of solidified mucus referred to as the &quot;crystalline style&quot; projected into the stomach from an associated sac. Cilia in the sac cause the style to rotate, winding in a stream of food-containing mucus from the mouth, and churning the stomach contents. This constant motion propels food particles into a sorting region at the rear of the stomach, which distributes smaller particles into the digestive glands, and heavier particles into the intestine. Waste material is consolidated in the rectum and voided as pellets into the exhalent water stream through an anal pore. Feeding and digestion are synchronized with diurnal and tidal cycles.

Carnivorous bivalves generally have reduced crystalline styles and the stomach has thick, muscular walls, extensive cuticular linings and diminished sorting areas and gastric chamber sections.

=== Excretory system ===
The excretory organs of bivalves are a pair of nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the pericardium, and a bladder to store urine. They also have pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a nephridiopore near the front of the upper part of the mantle cavity and excreted.

=== Reproduction and development ===
The sexes are usually separate in bivalves but some hermaphroditism is known. The gonads either open into the nephridia or through a separate pore into a chamber over the gills. The ripe gonads of males and females release sperm and eggs into the water column. Spawning may take place continually or be triggered by environmental factors such as day length, water temperature, or the presence of sperm in the water. Some species are &quot;dribble spawners&quot;, releasing gametes during protracted period that can extend for weeks. Others are mass spawners and release their gametes in batches or all at once.

Fertilization is usually external. Typically, a short stage lasts a few hours or days before the eggs hatch into trochophore larvae. These later develop into veliger larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into adults. In some species, such as those in the genus &quot;Lasaea&quot;, females draw water containing sperm in through their inhalant siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female. These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity, eventually releasing them into the water column as veliger larvae or as crawl-away juveniles.

Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in the water column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In temperate regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (&quot;Macoma balthica&quot;) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.

Freshwater bivalves have different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female&#x27;s gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female&#x27;s shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into adults on the substrate.

Some of the species in the freshwater mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female&#x27;s mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach for a closer look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish&#x27;s gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs.

== Comparison with brachiopods ==

Brachiopods are shelled marine organisms that superficially resemble bivalves in that they are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because they occupy similar ecological niches. The differences between the two groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.

Both groups have a shell consisting of two valves, but the organization of the shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Some brachiopod shells are made of calcium phosphate but most are calcium carbonate in the form of the biomineral calcite, whereas bivalve shells are always composed entirely of calcium carbonate, often in the form of the biomineral aragonite.

== Evolutionary history ==
The Cambrian explosion took place around 540 to 520 million years ago (Mya). In this geologically brief period, most major animal phyla diverged including some of the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time, and left their fossilized remains behind in the rocks.

Possible early bivalves include &quot;Pojetaia&quot; and &quot;Fordilla&quot;; these probably lie in the stem rather than crown group. &quot;Watsonella&quot; and &quot;Anabarella&quot; are perceived to be (earlier) close relatives of these taxa. Only five genera of supposed Cambrian &quot;bivalves&quot; exist, the others being &quot;Tuarangia&quot;, &quot;Camya&quot; and &quot;Arhouriella&quot; and potentially &quot;Buluniella&quot;.

Bivalve fossils can be formed when the sediment in which the shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the Early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.
By the middle of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most abundant filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the Permian–Triassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.

For a long time, bivalves were thought to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.

== Diversity of extant bivalves ==

The adult maximum size of living species of bivalve ranges from in &quot;Condylonucula maya&quot;, a nut clam, to a length of in &quot;Kuphus polythalamia&quot;, an elongated, burrowing shipworm. However, the species generally regarded as the largest living bivalve is the giant clam &quot;Tridacna gigas&quot;, which can grow to a length of and a weight of more than 200 kg (441 lb). The largest known extinct bivalve is a species of &quot;Platyceramus&quot; whose fossils measure up to in length.

In his 2010 treatise, &quot;Compendium of Bivalves&quot;, Markus Huber gives the total number of living bivalve species as about 9,200 combined in 106 families. Huber states that the number of 20,000 living species, often encountered in literature, could not be verified and presents the following table to illustrate the known diversity:

== Distribution ==

The bivalves are a highly successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species are found in the intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often a very large number of bivalves and other invertebrates are living beneath the surface of the sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (&quot;Cerastoderma edule&quot;) per acre of beach.

Bivalves inhabit the tropics, as well as temperate and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, &quot;Adamussium colbecki&quot;, lives under the sea ice at the other end of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, &quot;Bathymodiolus thermophilus&quot;, and the giant white clam, &quot;Calyptogena magnifica&quot;, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. Some species are found in the hadal zone, like Vesicomya sergeevi, which occurs at depths of 7600–9530 meters. The saddle oyster, &quot;Enigmonia aenigmatica&quot;, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.

Some freshwater bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, &quot;Villosa arkansasensis&quot;, is known only from the streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it is in danger of extinction. In contrast, a few species of freshwater bivalves, including the golden mussel (&quot;Limnoperna fortunei&quot;), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.

== Behaviour ==

Most bivalves adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often spending their whole lives in the area in which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also out of the reach of many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.

Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach themselves to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of collagen and elastin proteins. Some species, including the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten&#x27;s paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters, the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops layer upon layer of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.

Bivalves filter large amounts of water to feed and breathe but they are not permanently open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.

Although many non-sessile bivalves use their muscular foot to move around, or to dig, members of the freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (&quot;Sphaerium corneum&quot;), for example, climbs around on water weeds at the edges of lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.

=== Predators and defence ===
The thick shell and rounded shape of bivalves make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, a number of different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus divergens&quot;) is one of the main predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth. Further changes in shell development due to environmental stress has also been suggested to cause increased mortality in oysters due to reduced shell strength. 

Invertebrate predators include crustaceans, starfish and octopuses. Crustaceans crack the shells with their pincers and starfish use their water vascular system to force the valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve&#x27;s body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks (Buccinidae) and murex snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells. A dog whelk (&quot;Nucella&quot;) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The dog whelk then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body contents of the victim, which is typically a blue mussel.

Razor shells can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific razor clam (&quot;Siliqua patula&quot;) is laid on the surface of the beach, it can bury itself completely in seven seconds and the Atlantic jackknife clam, &quot;Ensis directus&quot;, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.

In many bivalves that have siphons, they can be retracted back into the safety of the shell. If the siphons inadvertently get attacked by a predator, in some cases, they snap off. The animal can regenerate them later, a process that starts when the cells close to the damaged site become activated and remodel the tissue back to its pre-existing form and size. In some other cases, it does not snap off. If the siphon is exposed, it is the key for a predatory fish to obtain the entire body. This tactic has been observed against bivalves with an infaunal lifestyle.

File shells such as &quot;Limaria fragilis&quot; can produce a noxious secretion when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude some distance from the shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a process known as autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.

== Mariculture ==


Oysters, mussels, clams, scallops and other bivalve species are grown with food materials that occur naturally in their culture environment in the sea and lagoons. One-third of the world&#x27;s farmed food fish harvested in 2010 was achieved without the use of feed, through the production of bivalves and filter-feeding carps. European flat oysters (&quot;Ostrea edulis&quot;) were first farmed by the Romans in shallow ponds and similar techniques are still in use. Seed oysters are either raised in a hatchery or harvested from the wild. Hatchery production provides some control of the broodstock but remains problematic because disease-resistant strains of this oyster have not yet been developed. Wild spats are harvested either by broadcasting empty mussel shells on the seabed or by the use of long, small-mesh nets filled with mussel shells supported on steel frames. The oyster larvae preferentially settle out on the mussel shells. Juvenile oysters are then grown on in nursery trays and are transferred to open waters when they reach in length.

Many juveniles are further reared off the seabed in suspended rafts, on floating trays or cemented to ropes. Here they are largely free from bottom-dwelling predators such as starfish and crabs but more labour is required to tend them. They can be harvested by hand when they reach a suitable size. Other juveniles are laid directly on the seabed at the rate of per hectare. They grow on for about two years before being harvested by dredging. Survival rates are low at about 5%.

The Pacific oyster (&quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot;) is cultivated by similar methods but in larger volumes and in many more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan where it has been cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in &quot;upwelling culture&quot; in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in plastic trays, in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.

Similar techniques are used in different parts of the world to cultivate other species including the Sydney rock oyster (&quot;Saccostrea commercialis&quot;), the northern quahog (&quot;Mercenaria mercenaria&quot;), the blue mussel (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;), the Mediterranean mussel (&quot;Mytilus galloprovincialis&quot;), the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (&quot;Perna canaliculus&quot;), the grooved carpet shell (&quot;Ruditapes decussatus&quot;), the Japanese carpet shell (&quot;Venerupis philippinarum&quot;), the pullet carpet shell (&quot;Venerupis pullastra&quot;) and the Yesso scallop (&quot;Patinopecten yessoensis&quot;).

Production of bivalve molluscs by mariculture in 2010 was 12,913,199 tons, up from 8,320,724 tons in 2000. Culture of clams, cockles and ark shells more than doubled over this time period from 2,354,730 to 4,885,179 tons. Culture of mussels over the same period grew from 1,307,243 to 1,812,371 tons, of oysters from 3,610,867 to 4,488,544 tons and of scallops from 1,047,884 to 1,727,105 tons.

== Use as food ==

Bivalves have been an important source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.

It has been known for more than a century that consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as &quot;Vibrio spp.&quot; or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals&#x27; tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.

=== Viral and bacterial infections ===
In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, described an outbreak of typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness was not easy to demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the &quot;Norwalk&quot; virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.

Since the 1970s, outbreaks of oyster-vectored diseases have occurs throughout the world. The mortality rate of one disease causing bacteria &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot;, was high at 50%. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the &quot;Norwalk&quot; virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (&quot;Anadara subcrenata&quot;) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths. In the United States and the European Union, since the early 1990s regulations have been in place that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering restaurants.

=== Paralytic shellfish poisoning ===
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is primarily caused by the consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, the muscles of the chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80 μg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.

=== Amnesic shellfish poisoning ===
Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) was first reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It is caused by the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot;. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20 μg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services provided by marine bivalves in relation to nutrient extraction from the coastal environment have gained increased attention to mitigate adverse effects of excess nutrient loading from human activities, such as agriculture and sewage discharge. These activities damage coastal ecosystems and require action from local, regional, and national environmental management. Marine bivalves filter particles like phytoplankton, thereby transforming particulate organic matter into bivalve tissue or larger faecal pellets that are transferred to the benthos. Nutrient extraction from the coastal environment takes place through two different pathways: (i) harvest/removal of the bivalves – thereby returning nutrients back to land; or (ii) through increased denitrification in proximity to dense bivalve aggregations, leading to loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere. Active use of marine bivalves for nutrient extraction may include a number of secondary effects on the ecosystem, such as filtration of particulate material. This leads to partial transformation of particulate-bound nutrients into dissolved nutrients via bivalve excretion or enhanced mineralization of faecal material.

When they live in polluted waters, bivalve molluscs have a tendency to accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.

There are limitations to the use of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water&#x27;s high nutritional content.

A study of nine different bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters concluded that the mussel, &quot;Trichomya hirsuta&quot;, most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment. In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. In the Persian Gulf, the Atlantic pearl-oyster (&quot;Pinctada radiata&quot;) is considered to be a useful bioindicator of heavy metals.

Crushed shells, available as a by-product of the seafood canning industry, can be used to remove pollutants from water. It has been found that, as long as the water is maintained at an alkaline pH, crushed shells will remove cadmium, lead and other heavy metals from contaminated waters by swapping the calcium in their constituent aragonite for the heavy metal, and retaining these pollutants in a solid form. The rock oyster (&quot;Saccostrea cucullata&quot;) has been shown to reduce the levels of copper and cadmium in contaminated waters in the Persian Gulf. The live animals acted as biofilters, selectively removing these metals, and the dead shells also had the ability to reduce their concentration.

== Other uses ==

Conchology is the scientific study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes. There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution, which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.


Shells are used decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into concrete or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls and can be used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.

The indigenous peoples of the Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (&quot;Busycotypus canaliculatus&quot;) and the quahog (&quot;Mercenaria mercenaria&quot;) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.

Buttons have traditionally been made from a variety of freshwater and marine shells. At first they were used decoratively rather than as fasteners and the earliest known example dates back five thousand years and was found at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.

Sea silk is a fine fabric woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, particularly the pen shell (&quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell.

Crushed shells are added as a calcareous supplement to the diet of laying poultry. Oyster shell and cockle shell are often used for this purpose and are obtained as a by-product from other industries.

=== Pearls and mother-of-pearl ===
Mother-of-pearl or nacre is the naturally occurring lustrous layer that lines some mollusc shells. It is used to make pearl buttons and in artisan craftwork to make organic jewellery. It has traditionally been inlaid into furniture and boxes, particularly in China. It has been used to decorate musical instruments, watches, pistols, fans and other products. The import and export of goods made with nacre are controlled in many countries under the International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

A pearl is created in the mantle of a mollusc when an irritant particle is surrounded by layers of nacre. Although most bivalves can create pearls, oysters in the family Pteriidae and freshwater mussels in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae are the main source of commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre. Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be pried open before a single pearl can be found. Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an irritant substance has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl. A &quot;mabe&quot; (irregular) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant, usually made of plastic, under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother-of-pearl interior of the shell. A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus. This produces a superior, spherical pearl. The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl. Pearl oyster farming and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

=== Symbolism ===
The scallop is the symbol of St James and is called &quot;Coquille Saint-Jacques&quot; in French. It is an emblem carried by pilgrims on their way to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The shell became associated with the pilgrimage and came to be used as a symbol showing hostelries along the route and later as a sign of hospitality, food and lodging elsewhere.

Roman myth has it that Venus, the goddess of love, was born in the sea and emerged accompanied by fish and dolphins, with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a scallop shell. The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in their gardens, praying to her to provide water and verdant growth. From this, the scallop and other bivalve shells came to be used as a symbol for fertility. Its depiction is used in architecture, furniture and fabric design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell, the global oil and gas company.

== Bivalvian taxonomies ==

For the past two centuries no consensus has existed on bivalve phylogeny from the many classifications developed. In earlier taxonomic systems, experts used a single characteristic feature for their classifications, choosing among shell morphology, hinge type or gill type. Conflicting naming schemes proliferated due to these taxonomies based on single organ systems. One of the most widely accepted systems was that put forward by Norman D. Newell in Part N of the &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot;, which employed a classification system based on general shell shape, microstructures and hinge configuration. Because features such as hinge morphology, dentition, mineralogy, shell morphology and shell composition change slowly over time, these characteristics can be used to define major taxonomic groups.

Since the year 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical analyses of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics have resulted in the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter &amp; Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification.

=== Practical taxonomy of R.C. Moore ===

R.C. Moore, in Moore, Lalicker, and Fischer, 1952, &quot;Invertebrate Fossils&quot;, gives a practical and useful classification of pelecypods (Bivalvia) even if somewhat antiquated, based on shell structure, gill type, and hinge teeth configuration. Subclasses and orders given are:

: Subclass:Prionodesmacea
:: Order
:: Paleoconcha
:: Taxodonta: Many teeth (e.g. order Nuculida)
:: Schizodonta: Big bifurcating teeth (e.g. &quot;Trigonia&quot; spp.)
:: Isodonta: Equal teeth (e.g. &quot;Spondylus&quot; spp.)
:: Dysodonta: Absent teeth and ligaments joins the valves.

: Subclass:Teleodesmacea
:: Order
:: Heterodonta: Different teeth (e.g. family Cardiidae). [ Lower Ordovician – Recent]
:: Pachydonta: Large, different, deformed teeth (e.g. rudist spp.). [ Late Jurassic – Upper Cretaceous]
:: Desmodonta: Hinge-teeth absent or irregular with ligaments (e.g. family Anatinidae).

Prionodesmacea have a prismatic and nacreous shell structure, separated mantle lobes, poorly developed siphons, and hinge teeth that are lacking or unspecialized. Gills range from protobranch to eulamellibranch. Teleodesmacea on the other hand have a porcelanous and partly nacreous shell structure; Mantle lobes that are generally connected, well developed siphons, and specialized hinge teeth. In most, gills are eulamellibranch.

=== 1935 taxonomy ===
In his 1935 work &quot;Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde&quot; (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele introduced a mollusc taxonomy based upon the 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele&#x27;s system divided the bivalves into three orders. &quot;Taxodonta&quot; consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, with a series of small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. &quot;Anisomyaria&quot; consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. &quot;Eulamellibranchiata&quot; consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: &quot;Schizodonta&quot;, &quot;Heterodonta&quot;, &quot;Adapedonta&quot; and &quot;Anomalodesmata&quot;.

=== Taxonomy based upon hinge tooth morphology ===
The systematic layout presented here follows Newell&#x27;s 1965 classification based on hinge tooth morphology (all taxa marked † are extinct) :

The monophyly of the subclass Anomalodesmata is disputed. The standard view now is that it resides within the subclass Heterodonta.

=== Taxonomy based upon gill morphology ===
An alternative systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This distinguishes between Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia. The first corresponds to Newell&#x27;s Palaeotaxodonta and Cryptodonta, the second to his Pteriomorphia, with the last corresponding to all other groups. In addition, Franc separated the Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are carnivorous, having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills.

=== 2010 taxonomy ===

In May 2010, a new taxonomy of the Bivalvia was published in the journal &quot;Malacologia&quot;. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.

Proposed classification of Class Bivalvia (under the redaction of Rüdiger Bieler, Joseph G. Carter and Eugene V. Coan) (all taxa marked † are extinct) :

<doc id="202262" wikidata="Q158861" url="?curid=202262" title="Chulalongkorn">
<text>Chulalongkorn (20 September 1853 – 23 October 1910), posthumously honoured as King Chulalongkorn the Great, was the fifth king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama V. Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reign from 1868 until his death in 1910 was characterised by the modernisation of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French empires. As Siam was surrounded by European colonies, Chulalongkorn, through his policies and acts, ensured the independence of Siam.

Chulalongkorn was born as the son of Mongkut, the fourth king of Siam. In 1868, he travelled with his father and Westerners invited by Mongkut to observe the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868 in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. However, Chulalongkorn and his father both contracted malaria which resulted in his father&#x27;s death. The 1893 Franco-Siamese crisis and Haw wars took place during his reign. All his reforms were dedicated to ensuring Siam&#x27;s independence given the increasing encroachment of Western powers, so that Chulalongkorn earned the epithet Phra Piya Maharat or known as the Great Beloved King.

==Early life==

King Chulalongkorn was born on 20 September 1853 to King Mongkut and Queen Debsirindra and given the name Chulalongkorn. In 1861, he was designated &quot;Krommamuen Pikhanesuan Surasangkat&quot;. His father gave him a broad education, including instruction from Western tutors such as Anna Leonowens. Chulalongkorn, along with his siblings, were educated by Leonowens from her arrival in August 1862 through to her departure in 1867. During this time, Chulalongkorn became friends with Leonowens&#x27; son Louis Leonowens who was two years younger than Chulalongkorn. His friendship with Louis would continue his adulthood where he assisted Louis&#x27; business in Siam.

In 1866, he became a novice monk for six months at Wat Bawonniwet according to royal tradition. Upon his return to his secular life in 1867, he was designated &quot;Krommakhun Phinit Prachanat&quot; (.)

In 1867, King Mongkut led an expedition to the Malay Peninsula south of the city of Hua Hin, to verify his calculations of the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868. Both Mongkut and his son fell ill of malaria. Mongkut died on 1 October 1868. Assuming the 15-year-old Chulalongkorn to be dying as well, King Mongkut on his deathbed wrote, &quot;My brother, my son, my grandson, whoever you all the senior officials think will be able to save our country will succeed my throne, choose at your own will.&quot; 

As Mongkut had not designated who would succeed him, the choice fell to a council to decide. The council led by Prince Deves, Mongkut&#x27;s eldest half-brother, then choose Chulalongkorn as Mongkut&#x27;s successor. However, Chulalongkorn was only 15 and so the council choose Si Suriyawongse to become the regent until Chulalongkorn came of age.

===Regency===
The young Chulalongkorn was an enthusiastic reformer. He visited Singapore and Java in 1870 and British India in 1872 to study the administration of British colonies. He toured the administrative centres of Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, and back to Calcutta in early 1872. This journey was a source of his later ideas for the modernization of Siam. He was crowned king in his own right as Rama V on 16 November 1873.

Sri Suriwongse then arranged for the Front Palace of King Pinklao (who was his uncle) to be bequeathed to King Pinklao&#x27;s son, Prince Yodyingyot (who was Chulalongkorn&#x27;s cousin).

As regent, Sri Suriwongse wielded great influence. Sri Suriwongse continued the works of King Mongkut. He supervised the digging of several important khlongs, such as Padung Krungkasem and Damneun Saduak, and the paving of roads such as Charoen Krung and Silom. He was also a patron of Thai literature and performing arts.

==Early reign==

At the end of his regency, Sri Suriwongse was raised to Somdet Chao Phraya, the highest title a noble could attain. Si Suriyawongse was the most powerful noble of the 19th century. His family, the House of Bunnag, was a powerful aristocratic dynasty of Persian descent. It dominated Siamese politics since the reign of Rama I. Chulalongkorn then married four of his half-sisters, all daughters of Mongkut: Savang Vadhana, Saovabha Phongsri, and Sunanda Kumariratana (Mongkut with Concubine Piam), and Sukhumala Marasri (Mongkut with Concubine Samli).

Chulalongkorn&#x27;s first reform was to establish the &quot;Auditory Office&quot; (Th: หอรัษฎากรพิพัฒน์) on 4 June 1873, solely responsible for tax collection, to counter the influence of the Bunnag family who had been in control of wealth collection since early Rattanakosin. As tax collectors had been under the aegis of various nobles and thus a source of their wealth, this reform caused great consternation among the nobility, especially the Front Palace. Chulalongkorn appointed Chaturonrasmi to be an executive of the organization, which he closely oversaw. From the time of King Mongkut, the Front Palace had been the equivalent of a &quot;second king&quot;, with one-third of national revenue allocated to it. Prince Yodyingyot of the Front Palace was known to be on friendly terms with many Britons, at a time when Siamese relations with the British Empire were tense.

In 1874, Chulalongkorn established the Council of State as a legislative body and a privy council as his personal advisory board based on the British privy council. Council members were appointed by the monarch.

===Front Palace crisis===
On the night of 28 December 1874, a fire broke out near the gunpowder storehouse and gasworks in the main palace. Front Palace troops quickly arrived, fully armed, &quot;to assist in putting out the fire&quot;. They were denied entrance and the fire was extinguished. The incident demonstrated the considerable power wielded by aristocrats and royal relatives, leaving the king little power. Reducing the power held by the nobility became one of his main motives in reforming Siam&#x27;s feudal politics.

When Prince Yodyingyot died in 1885, Chulalongkorn took the opportunity to abolish the titular Front Palace and created the title of &quot;Crown Prince of Siam&quot; in line with Western custom. Chulalongkorn&#x27;s son, Prince Vajirunhis, was appointed the first Crown Prince of Siam, though he never reigned. In 1895, when the prince died of typhoid at age 16, he was succeeded by his half-brother Vajiravudh, who was then at boarding school in England.

===Haw insurgency===
In the northern Laotian lands bordering China, the insurgents of the Taiping Rebellion had taken refuge since the reign of King Mongkut. These Chinese were called &quot;Haw&quot; and became bandits, pillaging the villages. In 1875, Chulalongkorn sent troops from Bangkok to crush the Haw who had ravaged as far as Vientiane. However, they met strong Chinese resistance and retreated to Isan in 1885. New, modernized forces were sent again and were divided into two groups approaching the Haw from Chiang Kam and Pichai. The Haw scattered and some fled to Vietnam. The Siamese armies proceeded to eliminate the remaining Haw. The city of Nong Khai maintains memorials for the Siamese dead.

===Third Anglo-Burmese War===

In Burma, while the British Army fought the Burmese Konbaung Dynasty, Siam remained neutral. Britain had agreements with the Siamese government, which stated that if the British were in conflict with Burma, Siam would send food supplies to the British Army. Chulalongkorn honored the agreement. The British expected he would send an army to help defeat the Burmese, but he did not do so.

===Military and political reforms===
Freed of the Front Palace and Chinese rebellions, Chulalongkorn initiated modernization and centralization reforms. He established the Royal Military Academy in 1887 to train officers in Western fashion. His upgraded forces provided the king much more power to centralize the country.

The government of Siam had remained largely unchanged since the 15th century. The central government was headed by the &quot;Samuha Nayok&quot; (i.e., prime minister), who controlled the northern parts of Siam, and the &quot;Samuha Kalahom&quot; (i.e., grand commander), who controlled southern Siam in both civil and military affairs. The Samuha Nayok presided over the &quot;Chatu Sadombh&quot; (i.e., Four Pillars). The responsibilities of each pillar overlapped and were ambiguous. In 1888, Chulalongkorn moved to institute a government of ministries. Ministers were, at the outset, members of the royal family. Ministries were established in 1892, with all ministries having equal status.

The Council of State proved unable to veto legal drafts or to give Chulalongkorn advice because the members regarded Chulalongkorn as an absolute monarch, far above their station. Chulalongkorn dissolved the council altogether and transferred advisory duties to the cabinet in 1894.

Chulalongkorn abolished the traditional Nakorn Bala methods of torture in the judiciary process, which were seen as inhumane and barbaric to Western eyes, and introduced a Western judicial code. His Belgian advisor, Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, played a great role in the development of modern Siamese law and its judicial system.

===Pressures for reform===

Chulalongkorn was the first Siamese king to send royal princes to Europe to be educated. In 19th century Europe, nationalism flourished and there were calls for more liberty. The princes were influenced by the liberal notions of democracy and elections they encountered in republics like France and constitutional monarchies like the United Kingdom.

In 1884 (year 103 of the Rattakosin Era), Siamese officials in Europe warned Chulalongkorn of possible threats to Siamese independence from the European powers. They advised that Siam should be reformed like Meiji Japan and that Siam should become a constitutional monarchy. Chulalongkorn demurred, stating that the time was not ripe and that he himself was making reforms.

Throughout Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reign, writers with radical ideas had their works published for the first time. The most notable ones included Thianwan Wannapho, who had been imprisoned for 17 years and from prison produced many works criticizing traditional Siamese society.

==Conflict with French Indochina==

In 1863, King Norodom of Cambodia was forced to put his country under French protection. The cession of Cambodia was officially formulated in 1867. However, Inner Cambodia (as called in Siam) consisting of Battambang, Siem Reap, and Srisopon, remained a Siamese possession. This was the first of many territorial cessions.

In 1887, French Indochina was formed from Vietnamese and Cambodian lands. In 1888, French troops invaded northern Laos to subjugate the Heo insurgents. However, the French troops never left, and the French demanded more Laotian lands. In 1893 Auguste Pavie, the French vice-consul of Luang Prabang, requested the cession of all Laotian lands east of the Mekong River. Siam resented the demand, leading to the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893.

The French gunboat &quot;Le Lutin&quot; entered the Chao Phraya and anchored near the French consulate ready to attack. Fighting was observed in Laos. &quot;Inconstant&quot; and &quot;Comete&quot; were attacked in Chao Phraya, and the French sent an ultimatum: an indemnity of three million francs, as well as the cession of and withdrawal from Laos. Siam did not accept the ultimatum. French troops then blockaded the Gulf of Siam and occupied Chantaburi and Trat. Chulalongkorn sent Rolin-Jacquemyns to negotiate. The issue was eventually settled with the cession of Laos in 1893, but the French troops in Chantaburi and Trat refused to leave.

The cession of vast Laotian lands had a major impact on Chulalongkorn&#x27;s spirit. Prince Vajirunhis died in 1894. Prince Vajiravudh was made crown prince to replace him. Chulalongkorn realised the importance of maintaining the navy and established the Royal Thai Naval Academy in 1898.

Despite Siamese concessions, French armies continued the occupation of Chantaburi and Trat for another 10 years. An agreement was reached in 1904 that French troops would leave Chantaburi but hold the coast land from Trat to Koh Kong. In 1906, the final agreement was reached. Trat was returned to Siam but the French kept Koh Kong and received Inner Cambodia.

Seeing the seriousness of foreign affairs, Chulalongkorn visited Europe in 1897. He was the first Siamese monarch to do so, and he desired European recognition of Siam as a fully independent power. He appointed his queen, Saovabha Phongsri, as regent in Siam during his travel to Europe. During a visit to Spain and Portugal, on 26 October, he condemned and ordered his servant to be executed for a breach of etiquette committed in Lisbon, according to the telegram news from Saragossa.

==Reforms==

Siam had been composed of a network of cities according to the Mandala system codified by King Trailokanat in 1454, with local rulers owing tribute to Bangkok. Each city retained a substantial degree of autonomy, as Siam was not a &quot;state&quot; but a &quot;network&quot; of city-states. With the rise of European colonialism, the Western concept of state and territorial division was introduced. It had to define explicitly which lands were &quot;Siamese&quot; and which lands were &quot;foreign&quot;. The conflict with the French in 1893 was an example.

===Sukhaphiban districts===
Sukhaphiban () sanitary districts were the first sub-autonomous entities established in Thailand. The first such was created in Bangkok, by royal decree of King Chulalongkorn in 1897. During his European tour earlier that year, he had learned about the sanitary districts of England, and wanted to try out this local administrative unit in his capital.

===Monthon system===

With his experiences during the travel to British colonies and the suggestion of Prince Damrong, Chulalongkorn established the hierarchical system of monthons in 1897, composed of province, city, &quot;amphoe&quot;, &quot;tambon&quot;, and &quot;muban&quot; (village) in descending order. (Though an entire monthon, the Eastern Province, Inner Cambodia, was ceded to the French in 1906). Each monthon was overseen by an intendant of the Ministry of Interior. This had a major impact, as it ended the power of all local dynasties. Central authority now spread all over the country through the administration of intendants. For example, the Lanna states in the north (including the Kingdom of Chiangmai, Principalities of Lampang, Lamphun, Nan, and Prae, tributaries to Bangkok) were made into two monthons, neglecting the existence of the Lanna kings.

Local rulers did not cede power willingly. Three rebellions sprang up in 1901: the Ngiao rebellion in Phrae, the 1901–1902 Holy Man&#x27;s Rebellion in Isan, and the Rebellion of Seven Sultans in the south. All these rebellions were crushed in 1902 with the city rulers stripped of their power and imprisoned.

===Abolition of corvée and slavery===

Ayutthaya King Ramathibodi II established a system of corvée in 1518 after which the lives of Siamese commoners and slaves were closely regulated by the government. All Siamese common men ( ไพร่) were subject to the Siamese corvée system. Each man at the time of his majority had to register with a government bureau, department, or leading member of the royalty called () as a () or under a nobleman&#x27;s dominion ( or ) as a (). owed service to sovereign or master for three months of the year. () were those who could make payment in kind (cattle) in lieu of service. Those conscripted into military service were called ().

Chulalongkorn was best known for his abolition of Siamese slavery (ทาส.) He associated the abolition of slavery in the United States with the bloodshed of the American Civil War. Chulalongkorn, to prevent such a bloodbath in Siam, provided several steps towards the abolition of slavery, not an extreme turning point from servitude to total freedom. Those who found themselves unable to live on their own sold themselves into slavery by rich noblemen. Likewise, when a debt was defaulted, the borrower would become a slave of the lender. If the debt was redeemed, the slave regained freedom.

However, those whose parents were household slaves (ทาสในเรือนเบี้ย) were bound to be slaves forever because their redemption price was extremely high.

Because of economic conditions, people sold themselves into slavery in great numbers and in turn they produced a large number of household slaves. In 1867 they accounted for one-third of Siamese population. In 1874, Chulalongkorn enacted a law that lowered the redemption price of household slaves born in 1867 (his ascension year) and freed all of them when they had reached 21.

The newly freed slaves would have time to settle themselves as farmers or merchants so they would not become unemployed. In 1905, the &quot;Slave Abolition Act&quot; ended Siamese slavery in all forms. The reverse of 100 baht banknotes in circulation since the 2005 centennial depict Chulalongkorn in navy uniform abolishing the slave tradition.

The traditional corvée system declined after the Bowring Treaty, which gave rise to a new class of employed labourers not regulated by the government, while many noblemen continued to hold sway over large numbers of . Chulalongkorn needed more effective control of manpower to undo the power of nobility. After the establishment of the monthon system, Chulalongkorn instituted a census to count all men available to the government. The &quot;Employment Act&quot; of 1900 required that all workers be paid, not forced to work.

===Establishment of a modern army and modern land ownership===

Chulalongkorn had established a defence ministry in 1887. The ending of the corvée system necessitated the beginning of military conscription, thus the &quot;Conscription Act&quot; of 1905 in Siam. This was followed in 1907 by the first act providing for invoking martial law, which seven years later was changed to its modern form by his son and successor, King Vajiravudh.

The Royal Thai Survey Department, a Special Services Group of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, engaged in cadastral survey, which is the survey of specific land parcels to define ownership for land registration, and for equitable taxation. Land title deeds are issued using the Torrens title system, though it was not until the year 1901 that the first–fruits of this survey were obtained.

===Abolition of prostration===
In 1873, the &quot;Royal Siamese Government Gazette&quot; published an announcement on the abolition of . In it, King Chulalongkorn declared, &quot;The practice of prostration in Siam is severely oppressive. The subordinates have been forced to prostrate in order to elevate the dignity of the &quot;phu yai&quot;. I do not see how the practice of prostration will render any benefit to Siam. The subordinates find the performance of prostration a harsh physical practice. They have to go down on their knees for a long time until their business with the &quot;phu yai&quot; ends. They will then be allowed to stand up and retreat. This kind of practice is the source of oppression. Therefore, I want to abolish it.&quot; The &quot;Gazette&quot; directed that, &quot;From now on, Siamese are permitted to stand up before the dignitaries. To display an act of respect, the Siamese may take a bow instead. Taking a bow will be regarded as a new form of paying respect.&quot;

===Civic works===
The construction of railways in Siam had a political motivation: to connect all of the country so as to better maintain control of it.

In 1901, the first railway was opened from Bangkok to Korat. In the same year, the first power plant of Siam produced electricity and electric lights first illuminated roadways.

In 1906 King Chulalongkorn adopted a Semang orphan boy named Khanung.

In 1907 he founded the royal rice varieties competition, at first only for the Tung Luang and Rangsit Canal districts. The next year it was held at Wat Suthat and since then has been held at various locations around the kingdom, by Chulalongkorn and his descendants.

===Relations with the British Empire===

Siamese authorities had exercised substantial control over Malay sultanates since Ayutthaya times. The sultans sought British support as a counterweight to Siamese influence. In 1909, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 was agreed. Four sultanates (Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis) were brought under British influence in exchange for Siamese legal rights and a loan to construct railways in southern Siam.

==Death and legacy==
Chulalongkorn had visited Europe twice, in 1897 and 1907. In 1897, he travelled widely through Europe, learning all he could on many subjects to benefit the Siamese people. He travelled and visited many European royal families. He spent much time in Britain and was inspired, among other things, to improve the health of his people by creating public health, or sanitary districts. In Sweden he studied the Forestry system. In 1907, he visited his son&#x27;s school in Britain and consulted with European doctors in pursuit of a cure for his kidney disease.

King Chulalongkorn died on 23 October 1910 of kidney disease at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall in the Dusit Palace, and was succeeded by his son Vajiravudh (King Rama VI).

The royal Equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn was finished in 1908 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the king&#x27;s reign. It was cast in bronze by a Parisian metallurgist.

Chulalongkorn University, founded in 1917 as the first university in Thailand, was named in his honour. On the campus stand the statues of Rama V and his son, Rama VI. King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, operated by the Thai Red Cross Society is named after him and is one of Thailand&#x27;s largest hospitals.

In 1997, a memorial pavilion was raised in honour of King Chulalongkorn in Ragunda, Sweden. This was done to commemorate King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s visit to Sweden in 1897 when he also visited the World&#x27;s Fair in Brussels. During the time when Swedish–Norwegian king Oscar II travelled to Norway for a council, Chulalongkorn went up north to study forestry. Beginning in Härnösand and travelling via Sollefteå and Ragunda he mounted a boat in the small village of Utanede in order to take him back through Sundsvall to Stockholm. His passage through Utanede left a mark on the village as one street was named after the king. The pavilion is erected next to that road.

The old 100 baht banknote of Series 14, circulated from 1994 to 2004, bears the statues of Rama V and Rama VI on its reverse. In 2005, the 100 baht banknote was revised to depict King Chulalongkorn in naval uniform and, in the background, abolishing slavery.
The 1,000 baht banknote of Series 16, issued in 2015, depicts the King Chulalongkorn monument, Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall, and the abolition of slavery.

Chulalongkorn was one of twenty &quot;Most Influential Asians of the Century&quot; for the 20th Century by Time Asia Magazine in 1999.

<text>Keiko is a feminine Japanese given name. Keikō (景行), with a long &quot;o&quot;, is the name posthumously given to Emperor Keikō.

==Possible meanings==
As with many Japanese names, Keiko can be written using a number of different kanji. Some of the most common ways of writing Keiko (and the most representative meanings of the respective kanji) are:
* 子 — &quot;lucky child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;respectful child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;sunlight/view/scenic child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;katsura tree child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;blessed child&quot; 
* 子 — &quot;happy child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;open (one&#x27;s eyes)/express/spring (season) child&quot;
* 子 — &quot;silicon child&quot;

The suffix &quot;ko&quot; () implies the name is female and the name is almost never given to males. Much less commonly, Keiko can also be written as 子, 子, or 子.

<text>was the 67th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Sanjō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1011 through 1016.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Iyasada&quot;-shinnō&quot;. He was also known as Sukesada&quot;-shinnō&quot;, and as Okisada&quot;-shinnō&quot; (居貞親王).

Iyasada was the second son of Emperor Reizei. He was the half-brother of Emperor Kazan, who was Reizei&#x27;s first-born son. Ieyasada&#x27;s mother was Fujiwara no Chōshi (藤原超子) (?-982), who was the daughter of the &quot;sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara no Kaneie. Chōshi was posthumously elevated to the rank of empress mother (Zō-Kōtaigō, 贈皇太后).

In ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the &quot;Gempeitōkitsu&quot; (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (源氏) are also known as Genji, and of these, the Sanjō Genji (三条源氏) are descended from the 67th emperor Sanjō.

==Events of Sanjō&#x27;s life==
After his mother died when he was seven, his maternal grandfather Fujiwara no Kaneie raised him at Kaneie&#x27;s mansion.

* August 23, 986 (&quot;Kanna 2, 16th day of the 7th month&quot;): Iyasada&quot;-shinnō&quot; was appointed as heir and crown prince at age 11. This followed the convention that two imperial lineages took the throne in turn, although Emperor Ichijō was in fact Iyasada&#x27;s junior. He thus gained the nickname &quot;Sakasa-no moke-no kimi&quot; (the imperial heir in reverse). When Emperor Kanzan abandoned the world for holy orders, this grandson of Kaneie ascended to the throne as Emperor Ichijō.
* July 16, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 13th day of the 6th month&quot;): In the 25th year of Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s reign (一条天皇二十五年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Sanjō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) at age 36.
* August 29, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 22nd day of the 6th month&quot;): &quot;Daijō-tennō&quot; Emperor Ichijō died at the age of 32.
* August 30, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 23rd day of the 8th month&quot;): Fujiwara Michinaga is granted the extraordinary privilege of travelling to and from the court by ox-drawn cart.
* November 28, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 24th day of the 10th month&quot;): &quot;Daijō-tennō&quot; Reizei, who was Emperor Sanjō&#x27;s father, died at age 62.
* 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8&quot;): Prince Atsunari, the second son of former-Emperor Ichijo, is proclaimed Crown Prince. Sanjō&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Atsuakira, had been the officially designated heir; but pressure from Michinaga forced the young prince abandon his position.

Kaneie died in the early part of Ichijō&#x27;s reign. His three uncles, sons of Kaneie, made their daughters consorts of Ichijo and each aimed to seize power as the grandfather of a future emperor. These courtiers therefore sought to exclude Okisada from the Imperial succession, though each of them married their daughter to him. Later Ichijō had two sons by Fujiwara no Shōshi, the daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga, and Michinaga expected his grandson to ascend to the throne as soon as possible. Michinaga became the &quot;kampaku&quot; (regent) of Japan during the reign of Ichijō and expected to hold this position in Sanjō&#x27;s government as well.
* 1012 (&quot;Chōwa 1&quot;): The era name was changed to mark Emperor Sanjō&#x27;s accession; and in the 8th month, he married a daughter of &quot;kampaku&quot; Michinaga.
* 1013 (&quot;Chōwa 2, 3rd month&quot;): Sanjō sent an offering of grain to the gods of the 21 principal temples of Japan.
* 1013 (&quot;Chōwa 2, 9th month&quot;): Sanjō visited the home of Michinaga.
* 1013 (&quot;Chōwa 2, 11th month&quot;): Sanjō visited the Shrine of Iwashimizu Hachiman, and successive emperors would emulate his example visiting this shrine annually.
* 1013 (&quot;Chōwa 2, 12th month&quot;): Sanjō visited the Shrines of Kamo, and successive emperors would emulate his example visiting this shrine annually.
* 1013 (&quot;Chōwa 2, 12th month&quot;): Fujiwara no Masanobu, an officer of the &quot;chūgo&quot; guard, was killed by Fujiwara no Korekane; and Michinaga ordered the assassin imprisoned.
* March 12, 1014 (&quot;Chōwa 3, 9th day of the 2nd month&quot;): The Imperial Palace is destroyed by fire.
* 1014 (&quot;Chōwa 3, 5th month&quot;): Sanjō visited the home of Michinaga where he enjoyed himself with horse riding and archery.
* 1015 (&quot;Chōwa 4, 9th month&quot;): The reconstruction of the palace is completed.
* 1015 (&quot;Chōwa 4, 10th month&quot;): Michinaga&#x27;s 50th birthday is celebrated.
* 1015 (&quot;Chōwa 4, 11th month&quot;): The palace is again reduced to cinders after a devastating fire.
* 1016 (&quot;Chōwa 5, 1st month&quot;): Sanjō grew increasingly blind; he abdicated at the age of 40, having reigned for six years in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Chōwa.&quot; He took the title &quot;Daijō-tennō.&quot;
* March 10, 1016 (&quot;Chōwa 5, 29th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 6th year of Emperor Sanjō&#x27;s reign (三条天皇6年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Ichijō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’&#x27;) at age 9.
* May 21, 1017 (&quot;Chōwa 6, 23rd day of the 4th month&quot;): The era name was changed to &quot;Kannin&quot; to mark the beginning of Emperor Go-Ichijō&#x27;s reign.
* May 27, 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 29th day of the 4th month&quot;): Sanjō entered the Buddhist priesthood.
* June 5, 1017 (&quot;Kannin 1, 9th day of the 5th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Sanjō died at age 42. He was given the posthumous name of Sanjō-in (三条院) after the palace where he spent his life after abdication. During the Meiji Era, the &quot;in&quot; was dropped and replaced with &quot;tennō&quot; (Emperor).

The actual site of Sanjō&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Sanjō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kitayama no misasagi&quot;.

Michinaga gifted Atsuakira a status equal to the retired emperor, with the title of Ko-ichijo-in. Although no son of Sanjō ascended to the throne, a future emperor (Emperor Go-Sanjō) was child of Princess Teishi, Sanjō&#x27;s daughter, and thus his blood remained in the imperial bloodline.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Sanjō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長), 1016–1017.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Michinaga.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Akimitsu (藤原顕光)
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Kinsue (藤原公季)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Sanjō&#x27;s reign==

<doc id="202278" wikidata="Q1329805" url="?curid=202278" title="Jitō">
<text>were medieval territory stewards in Japan, especially in the Kamakura and Muromachi shogunates. Appointed by the shōgun, &quot;jitō&quot; managed manors, including national holdings governed by the &quot;kokushi&quot; or provincial governor. There were also deputy jitōs called &quot;jitōdai&quot;.

== History ==
The term &quot;jitō&quot; (literally meaning &quot;land head&quot;) began to be used in the late Heian period as an adjectival word. For example, a jitō person (地頭人) meant an influential local. Later, the term was sometimes used for persons who managed each local manor. Modern historians cannot clarify the character of the early &quot;jitō&quot; appointed by Minamoto no Yoritomo, as the conditions of these precursors are not well known.

&quot;Jitō&quot; were officially established when Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed to oversee their ennoblement by the Imperial court following his successful usurpation of power. Yoritomo appointed many &quot;jitō&quot; nationwide, mainly in the Kantō region. During the Kamakura period, the &quot;jitō&quot; were chosen amongst the ranks of &quot;gokenin&quot; (the shogun&#x27;s vassals) who handled military affairs. &quot;Jitō&quot; handled the taxation and administration of the manor to which they were appointed, and directly administered the lands and the farmers of the manor.

After the Jōkyū War in 1221, the shogunate appointed many &quot;jitō&quot; in Western Japan to the land that the people of the losing side and imperial court had possessed. At that time, many prominent &quot;gokenin&quot;, including the Mori clan and the Ōtomo clan, moved from the east to the west.

The role of &quot;jitō&quot; was officially abolished in the late of 16th century by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the &quot;three great unifiers of Japan&quot;. 

The elimination of the &quot;jitō&quot; caste removed Imperial recognition and support from dozens of small warlords and weakened the intense rivalries that had fueled centuries of civil conflict, thus enabling the more easily controlled and reliable &quot;daimyo&quot; to consolidate ownership of the land. This, in turn, laid the foundations for the last major feudal era of Japan, the Edo period.

<text>Preadolescence is a stage of human development following middle childhood and preceding adolescence. It commonly ends with the beginning of puberty. Preadolescence is commonly defined as ages 9–12 ending with the major onset of puberty. It may also be defined as simply the 2-year period before the major onset of puberty. Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and anxieties.

==Terminology==

A term used to refer to the preadolescent stage in everyday speech is tween and its perhaps older variants tweenie, tweeny, tweenager, and tweener. It&#x27;s a blend (portmanteau) of the words &quot;teen&quot; and &quot;between&quot; in the sense of &quot;between childhood and adolescence&quot; and refers to 9- to 12-year-olds. Sometimes the terms &quot;tweenie&quot; and &quot;tweenager&quot; are used to differentiate between older (10 to 15) and younger (7 to 11) age groups, respectively.

While known as &quot;preadolescent&quot; in psychology, the terms &quot;preteen&quot; or &quot;tween&quot; are common in everyday use. A preteen or preteenager is a person below 13 years of age. Generally, the term is restricted to those close to reaching age 13, especially ages 9 to 12. &quot;Tween&quot; is an American neologism and marketing term for &quot;preteen&quot;, which is a blend of &quot;between&quot; and &quot;teen&quot;. People within this age range are variously described as tweens, preadolescents, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, middle schoolers, or tweenagers.

A junior high school can sometimes be confused with a middle school. Though serving a similar purpose in bridging a gap between elementary school and high school, a junior high school typically serves 7th to 9th grade students, whereas a middle school serves 6th to 8th grade students. Therefore, middle schools serve a slightly younger demographic, more befitting of preadolescents, while junior high schools typically serve young adolescents.

==Prepubescence, puberty, and age range==
Being prepubescent is not the same thing as being preadolescent. Instead, &quot;prepubescent&quot; (and sometimes &quot;child&quot;) is a term for boys and girls who have not developed secondary sex characteristics, while &quot;preadolescent&quot; is generally defined as those ranging from age 9 to 12 years.
Preadolescence may also be defined as the period from 10 to 13 years. 

The point at which a child becomes an adolescent is defined by the major onset of puberty. However, in some individuals (particularly females), puberty begins in the preadolescence years. Studies indicate that the onset of puberty has been one year earlier with each generation since the 1950s.

One can also distinguish middle childhood and preadolescence – middle childhood from approximately 5–8 years, as opposed to the time children are generally considered to reach preadolescence. There is no exact agreement as to when preadolescence starts and ends.

===Hormonal development and the development of secondary sex characteristics===
Early puberty begins as the result of the initiation of the pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion by the hypothalamus; the exact mechanism of this initiation is currently unknown and remains under investigation. Pulsatile GnRH secretion results in the pulsatile secretions of gonadotropins Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which act on the gonads (ovaries in females or testicles in males) to cause increase secretion of sex steroids. In females, the predominant sex steroid released is estrogen and in males, the predominant sex steroid released is testosterone. These sex hormones then lead to the development of secondary sex characteristics.

The stages of puberty can be described with the Tanner scale, also known as the Sexual Maturity Rating, which incorporates measurements and characteristics of primary and secondary sex characteristics. For example, genital and breast development, as well as pubic hair growth. Pubertal development is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Tanner staging ranges from 1 through 5 (with 5 being the most developed).

With regards to pubic hair development, the scale goes as follows: Stage 1-no hair; 2-downy hair; 3-scant terminal hair; 4-terminal hair overlying the pubic triangle; 5-terminal hair extending to the thigh. With regards to male genitalia development, the scale goes as follows: 1-testes at the same size and proportion of early childhood; 2-enlargement of the scrotum/change in texture of scrotal skin; 3-growth of the penis length-wise; 4-growth of the penis in terms of length and circumference; 5-adult-sized genitalia.

With regards to female breast development, the scale is as follows: 1-no palpable gland tissue; 2-palpable breast bud under areola; 3-breast tissue palpable outside of areola; 4-areola elevated above breast contour; 5-areolar mound recedes into single breast contour. The average age in which both males and females reach Tanner stage 5 of pubertal development is around 15–16.

== Neurological development ==
There are significant neurological changes that are expressed during preadolescence. White matter refers to the region of the nervous system corresponding to neuronal axons, which form fibers that convey information across different regions of the brain. In contrast, grey matter refers to the region of the nervous system corresponding to neuronal cell bodies, which process and relay neuronal signals. White matter volume increases at a relatively linear rate of about 12% from ages 4 through 22, specifically focused in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Increases in white matter volume may be correlated to improvements of fine motor performance, auditory processing, as well as sensory information transfer between language areas of the brain. In contrast, cortical gray matter increases in early life, peaks in preadolescence, and declines through adulthood, with the exception of occipital lobe gray matter. For example, parietal lobe gray matter peaks at age 10 in girls and 12 in boys, while frontal lobe gray matter peaks at age 11 in girls and 12 in boys. Such changes might reflect overproduction of synapses in the preadolescent years; in subsequent years, there seems to be pruning dependent on environmental context, corresponding to increased synchronicity of neuron firing. A key caveat from these imaging studies, however, is that there exists significant variability in the timing and characteristics of neurological change in preadolescents. Neurological changes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, appear to be highly dependent on environmental input. Toxins, hormones, and lifestyle factors including stress and nutrition impact neurological maturation, demonstrating the importance of early lifestyle health interventions in preadolescence with regards to neurological and psychological development.

==Psychological and social development==
Of the &#x27;two major socializing agents in children&#x27;s lives: the family environment...and formal educational institutions,&#x27; it is &#x27;the family in its function a primary socializer of the child&#x27; that predominates in the first five years of life: middle childhood by contrast is characterized by &#x27;a child&#x27;s readiness for school...being self-assured and interested; knowing what kind of behavior is expected...being able to wait, to follow directions, and getting along with other children.&#x27;

Preadolescent children have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: &#x27;the most &quot;sensible&quot; stage of development...the child is a much &quot;less emotional being&quot; now.&#x27; They will often have developed a sense of &#x27; &quot;intentionality&quot;. The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence&#x27;; and will have a more developed sense of looking into the future and seeing effects of their actions (as opposed to early childhood where children often do not worry about their future). This can include more realistic job expectations (&quot;I want to be an engineer when I grow up&quot;, as opposed to &quot;I want to be a wizard&quot;). Middle children generally show more investment &#x27;in &quot;control over external reality&quot; through the acquisition of knowledge and competence&#x27;: where they do have worries, these may be more a fear of kidnappings, rapes, and scary media events, as opposed to fantasy things (e.g., witches, monsters, ghosts).

Preadolescents may well view human relationships differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of authority figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of self-identity, and to have increased feelings of independence: &#x27;may feel an individual, no longer &quot;just one of the family. A different view on morality can emerge; and the middle child will also show more &quot;cooperativeness&quot;. The ability to balance one&#x27;s own needs with those of others in group activities&#x27;. Many preadolescents will often start to question their home life and surroundings around this time and they may also start to form opinions that may differ from their upbringing in regards to issues such as politics, religion, sexuality, and gender roles. 

They may choose their own activities, though they are still susceptible to pressure from others around them. Many preadolescents play organized sports, but necessary free play (self-directed, freely chosen, independent play) may get overlooked. Early sports specialization (choosing a single sport to play intensively or year-round) before puberty has a high risk of injuries. Youth sports organizations recommend a minimum of five hours of free play per week for preadolescent athletes.

Greater responsibility within the family can also appear, as middle children become responsible for younger siblings and relatives, as with babysitting; while preadolescents may start caring about what they look like and what they are wearing.

Prior to adolescence, children may have a dependence on their family as their main agent of socialization. This helps the child establish their attitudes, viewpoints, social norms, and societal roles.

Among these changes is the shift from elementary to middle (or junior high) school. In this unfamiliar environment, the child may find the pressure to rapidly adapt and fit in. Children start to spend less time with family and more time with friends. At this time, socialization by the school and peer environment can become more predominant, as the preadolescent starts to learn more about how they would wish to hold themselves during interpersonal relationships.

While children find this need to fit in, preadolescents have a conflicting desire to establish their own individualism. As the child grows into the transitionary period of preadolescence, the child often starts to develop a sense of autonomy as the child is exposed to a larger world around them full of sudden and unfamiliar changes. Compounded with a sense of self-consciousness, the preadolescent starts to explore their own self-identity and their role in society further.

=== Development of sexual orientation ===
During preadolescence (early adolescence), individuals may become more preoccupied with body image and privacy, corresponding to physical changes seen during adrenarche and puberty. Early adolescents may become aware of their sexuality for the first time, and experience attraction towards others. Homosexual and heterosexual experimentation is not uncommon, although it is important to note that many teens who eventually identify as LGBT do not always do so during adolescence. On average, gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals report experiencing same-sex attraction in early adolescence, at age 12. About 4 in 10 gay men, and 2 in 10 lesbian women report experiencing same-sex attraction before age 10. For individuals who begin to experience same-sex attraction, familial support and acceptance consistently predicts positive outcomes. Parents and guardians can support preadolescents, regardless of sexual orientation, by having honest conversations about sex. Specifically, parents can talk and listen in a way that invites preadolescents to have an open discussion about sexual orientation.

===Home from home===
Where development has been optimal, preadolescents &#x27;come to school for something to be added to their lives; they want to learn lessons...which can lead to their eventually working in a job like their parents.&#x27; When earlier developmental stages have gone astray, however, then, on the principle that &#x27;if you miss a stage, you can always go through it later,&#x27; some middle children &#x27;come to school for another purpose...[not] to learn but to find a home from home...a stable emotional situation in which they can exercise their own emotional liability, a group of which they can gradually become a part.&#x27;

===Divorce===
Children at the threshold of adolescence in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very &quot;eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed parent often to their own detriment&quot;.

===Media===
Preadolescents may well be more exposed to popular culture than younger children and have interests based on internet trends, television shows and movies (no longer just cartoons), fashion, technology, music and social media. Preadolescents generally prefer certain brands, and are a heavily targeted market of many advertisers. Their tendency to buy brand-name items may be due to a desire to fit in, although the desire is not as strong as it is with teenagers.

Some scholars suggest that &#x27;pre-adolescents ... reported frequent encounters with sexual material in the media, valued the information received from it, and used it as a learning resource ... and evaluated such content through what they perceived to be sexual morality.&#x27; However, other research has suggested that sexual media influences on preadolescent and adolescent sexual behavior is minimal.

==Freud==
Freud called this stage the &quot;latency&quot; period to indicate that sexual feelings and interest went underground. Erik H. Erikson noted that latency period children in middle childhood can then direct more of their energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships. Nevertheless, recent research contradicts these notions—suggesting that sexual development, interest, and behavior among latent period children does not cease. Instead, the apparent lack of sexual interest is due to children not sharing their sexual interests/emotions with adults.

<doc id="202287" wikidata="Q472692" url="?curid=202287" title="Per Brahe the Younger">
<text>Count Per Brahe the Younger (18 February 1602 – 12 September 1680) was a Swedish soldier, statesman, and author. He served as Privy Councillor from 1630, Lord High Steward from 1640, as well as Governor-General of Finland in 1637–1640 and 1648–1654.

Brahe fought in Prussia during the Polish War (1626–1629) and in Germany in 1630. However, his military activity later yielded to his political activity, and he held posts of Privy Councillor and Lord High Steward of Sweden. During the minority of Queen Christina (1632–1644) and after the death of King Charles X in 1660, he was one of the regents of Sweden.

During his time as Governor-General of Finland, he made large administrative reforms, introduced a postal system, improved and developed commerce and agriculture, and promoted education. He was the founder of the Royal Academy of Turku and the town of Raahe (), along with ten other new towns in Finland.

==Life==
Brahe was born in Rydboholm Castle (now in Österåker Municipality) in Uppland. He was the son of &quot;riksråd&quot; Count Abraham Pedersson Brahe of Visingsborg (1569–1630) and Elsa Gyllenstierna of Lundholm, and as such the brother of Margareta Brahe and Nils Brahe, and the cousin of Ebba Brahe. He was the grandson of Per Brahe the Elder (1520–1590), one of Gustavus Vasa&#x27;s Privy Councillors, created count of Visingsborg by King Eric XIV, known also as the continuator of Peder Svart&#x27;s chronicle of Gustavus (sometimes the &quot;Chronicles of Per Brahe&quot;), and author of Oeconomia in 1585, a manual for young noblemen. Per Brahe the younger, after completing his education by several years&#x27; travel abroad, became in 1626 chamberlain to Gustavus Adolphus, whose lasting friendship he gained.

He fought with distinction in Prussia during the last three years of the Polish War (1626–1629) and also, as colonel of a regiment of horse, in 1630 in Germany. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632 his military yielded to his political activity. He had been elected president or Lantmarskalk in the Riksdag of 1629, and in the following year was created a Privy Councillor. In 1635 he conducted the negotiations for an armistice with Poland (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf).

In 1637–1640 and again in 1648–1654 he was Governor-General in Finland, to which country he rendered inestimable services by his wise and provident rule. He reformed the whole administration, introduced a postal system, founded ten new towns, improved and developed commerce and agriculture, and very greatly promoted education. In 1640 he opened the Royal Academy of Turku, of which he was the founder, and first chancellor. Still today the expression &quot;Kreivin aikaan&quot;, or &quot;at Count&#x27;s Time&quot; in the Finnish language means &quot;at the correct/good time&quot;. The base of his statue in Turku bears the inscription &quot;I was well pleased with the land and the land with me.&quot;

After the death of King Charles X in 1660, Brahe, as Lord High Steward, became one of the regents of Sweden for the second time (he had held a similar office during the minority of Queen Christina, 1632–1644), and during the difficult year 1660 he had entire control of both foreign and domestic affairs. He died on 2 September 1680 at his castle Bogesund in Uppland. He also held the castles Visingsborg at Visingsö and Brahehus on the mainland by Gränna, where during his lifetime he had held more than regal pomp.

==Legacy==
The Finnish town of Raahe (), which he founded in the year of 1649 in Ostrobothnia, is named after him, as is the asteroid , discovered by Liisi Oterma at the Turku Observatory in 1942. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 (). Other Finnish towns he founded with Raahe include Hamina, Jakobstad, Kajaani, Kristinestad, Kuopio and Lappeenranta.

<text>Count Nils Brahe (14 October 1604 – 21 November 1632) was a Swedish soldier and younger brother of Per Brahe and Margareta Brahe. He served with distinction under King Gustavus Adolphus, who regarded him as the best general in the Swedish army after Lennart Torstenson.

==Life==
Brahe was born at Rydboholm Castle (now in Österåker Municipality) in Uppland. He was the son of &quot;riksråd&quot; Count Abraham Pedersson Brahe of Visingsborg (1569-1630) and Elsa Gyllenstierna of Lundholm, and as such the brother of Margareta Brahe and Per Brahe, and the cousin of Ebba Brahe. 

He took part in the Polish-Swedish Wars, in which he first participated in the siege and capture of Riga 1621, and later served with distinction in Poland (1626–1627) and assisted in the defence of Stralsund in 1628. On 16 April 1628 he married baroness Anna Margareta Bielke at the Stockholm castle, at double wedding, when also his elder brother count Peder Brahe married Kristina Katarina Stenbock.

In 1630 he accompanied Gustavus into Germany, in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and in 1631 was appointed colonel of &quot;the yellow regiment,&quot; the king&#x27;s world-renowned life-guards, at the head of which he captured the castle of Würzburg on 8 October 1631. Brahe took part in the long duel between Gustavus and Wallenstein around Nuremberg as general of infantry, and commanded the left wing during the Battle of Lützen on 6 November 1632, where he was the only Swedish general officer present. At the very beginning of the fight he received a gunshot wound to his left knee so severe that he had to retire from the battle. After the fighting ended Brahe travelled to Naumburg to recuperate but his condition deteriorated over the next few weeks and he finally died on 21 November 1632, at the age of 28.
Brahe was buried in the church at Östra Ryd.

<doc id="202295" wikidata="Q900" url="?curid=202295" title="Kazan">
<text>Kazan is the largest city and capital of Tatarstan, Russia. The city lies at the confluence of the Volga and the Kazanka Rivers, covering an area of , with a population of over 1.3 million residents, and up to nearly 2 million residents in the greater metropolitan area. Kazan is the fifth-largest city in Russia, being the most populous city on the Volga, as well as within the Volga Federal District.

Historically, Kazan was the capital of the Khanate of Kazan, and was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century, at which point the city became a part of the Tsardom of Russia. The city was seized (and largely destroyed) during Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion (1773–1775), but was later rebuilt during the reign of Catherine the Great. In the following centuries, Kazan grew to become a major industrial, cultural and religious centre of Russia. In 1920, after the Russian SFSR became a part of the Soviet Union, Kazan became the capital of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tatar ASSR). Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazan remained the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan.

Kazan is renowned for its vibrant mix of Tatar and Russian cultures. In 2023, 4 million tourists visited Kazan, and Kazan Kremlin, a World Heritage Site, recorded more than 4.5 million visits. In April 2009, the Russian Patent Office granted Kazan the right to refer to itself as the &quot;Third Capital of Russia&quot;. In 2009, Kazan was chosen as the &quot;sports capital of Russia&quot;. Kazan hosted the 2013 Summer Universiade, and was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Kazan hosted the BRICS Games from 12 to 23 June 2024. Athletes competed in 27 sports.

==Etymology==
The term kazan means &#x27;boiler&#x27; or &#x27;cauldron&#x27; (Russian: каза́н/Tatar: казан) in the Tatar and Turkic languages. The origin of the city and its name is often described as follows: a sorcerer advised the Bulgars to build a city where, without any fire, a boiler dug into the ground would boil water. As a result, a similar place was founded on the shore of Lake Kaban. One legend claims that the city was named after the river Kazanka, which was named after the son of a Bulgar governor who dropped a copper cauldron into it.

An older mention of the name of Kazan is associated with a pot that was drowned in the river, as evidenced by the text:Kazan Tatars got their name from the main city of Kazan - and it is so called from the Tatar word Kazan, the cauldron, which was omitted by the servant of the founder of this city, Khan Altyn Bek, not on purpose, when he scooped water for his master to wash, in the river now called Kazanka. In other respects, according to their own legends, they were not of a special tribe, but descended from the fighters who remained here [in Kazan] on the settlement of different generations and from foreigners attracted to Kazan, but especially Nogai Tatars, who all through their union into a single society formed a special people.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

According to the official version adopted today, the city was founded more than 1,000 years ago. The estimated date of the urban settlement on the site of Kazan is 1004–1005 AD. The reason for this dating was found during excavations in the Kazan Kremlin – a Czech coin, dated by the Board of St. Wenceslaus (presumably, coinage 929–930 years) and the earliest Czech coin, the remains of masonry and wooden city fence, handicrafts and utensils (Hungarian type lining, women&#x27;s beads, etc.), as well as other artifacts with less obvious dating. According to official statements, experts from 20 cities of Russia and 22 countries of the world were involved in the study of findings related to the age of Kazan.

Kazan was a border post between Volga Bulgaria and two Finno-Ugric peoples—the Mari and Udmurt. Another question is where the citadel was built originally. Archaeological explorations have produced evidence of urban settlement in three parts of the modern city: in the Kremlin; in Bişbalta at the site of the modern Zilantaw monastery; and near the Kaban lake. The oldest of these seems to be the Kremlin.

After the Mongols ravaged the Bolğar and Bilär territories in the 13th century, the surviving Bulgars recovered in numbers and a small number of Kipchaks were assimilated from which they adopted their language (the so-called Bulgarism), or Kipchaks and Bulgars mixed to create a modern Kazan-Tatar population. Some Tatars also went to Lithuania, brought by Vytautas the great. Kazan became the center of the Principality, which was dependent on The Golden Horde. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Kazan was growing, becoming an important trade and political center within the Golden Horde. The growth of the city was also promoted by the successful geographical location at the intersection of major trade routes connecting East and West. During the same period, the minting of currency began with the indication of the place of minting—&quot;Bulgar al-Jadid&quot;, that is, a New Bulgar.

In 1438, the Bulgar fortress Kazan (ISKE-Kazan) was captured by the ousted Golden Horde Khan Ulugh Muhammad, who killed the local Prince Swan and moved the fortress to a modern place (according to Russian Chronicles). The city became the capital of the Khanate of Kazan. The city Bazaar, Taş Ayaq (stone foot) has become the most important shopping center in the region, especially for furniture. Handicraft production also flourished, as the city gained a reputation for its leather and gold products, as well as the wealth of its palaces and mosques. 
Kazan had trade relations with Moscow, Crimea, Turkey, and other regions.

===Russian Tsardom period===
As a result of the siege of Kazan in 1552, Tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered the city. During the subsequent governorship of Alexander Gorbaty-Shuysky, most of the Kazan&#x27;s Tatar residents were forcibly Christianized or deported, and Mosques and palaces were ruined. The surviving Tatar population was moved to a place away from the city and this place was forcibly settled by Russian farmers and soldiers. Tatars in the Russian service were settled in the Tatar Bistäse settlement near the city&#x27;s wall. Later Tatar merchants and handicraft masters also settled there. During this period, Kazan was largely destroyed as a result of several great fires. After one of them in 1579, the icon &quot;Our Lady of Kazan&quot; was discovered in the city.

In the early 17th century, at the beginning of the Time of Troubles in Russia, the Tsardom of Kazan declared independence under the leadership of voyvoda Nikanor Shulgin with the help of the Russian population, but this independence was suppressed by Kuzma Minin in 1612.

===Russian Empire period===

In 1708, the Tsardom of Kazan was abolished, and Kazan became the seat of Kazan Governorate. After Peter the Great&#x27;s visit, the city became a center of shipbuilding for the Caspian fleet. The major Russian poet Gavrila Derzhavin was born in Kazan in 1743, the son of a poor country squire of Tatar ancestry though himself having a thoroughly Russian identity.

Before the building of modern dams, low-lying areas were regularly flooded in April and May. Kazan suffered major fires in 1595, 1672, 1694, 1742, 1749, 1757, 1774, 1815, and 1842.

Kazan was largely destroyed in 1774 as a result of Pugachev&#x27;s rebellion, an uprising by border troops and peasants led by the Don Cossack ataman (Captain) Yemelyan Pugachev, but the city, formerly largely of timber construction, was soon afterwards rebuilt, using stone and according to a grid pattern plan, during the reign of Catherine the Great. Catherine also decreed that mosques could again be built in Kazan, the first being Marjani Mosque.

At the beginning of the 19th century Kazan State University and printing press were founded by Alexander I. It became an important center for Oriental Studies in Russia. The Qur&#x27;an was first printed in Kazan in 1801. Kazan became an industrial center and peasants migrated there to join its industrial workforce. In 1875, a horse tramway appeared; 1899 saw the installation of a tramway. After the Russian Revolution of 1905, Tatars were allowed to revive Kazan as a Tatar cultural center. The first Tatar theater and the first Tatar newspaper appeared.

===Soviet period===
In 1917, Kazan became one of the revolution centers. In 1918, Kazan was the capital of the Idel-Ural State, which was suppressed by the Bolshevik government. In the Kazan Operation of August 1918, it was briefly occupied by Czechoslovak Legions. In 1920, Kazan became the center of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. After the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) until 1933, the German and the Russian army together operated the Kama tank school in Kazan.

During World War II, many industrial plants and factories to the west were relocated in Kazan, making the city a center of the military industry, producing tanks and planes. After the war Kazan consolidated as an industrial and scientific center. In 1979, the city&#x27;s population reached one million.

===Modern period===
In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazan again became the center of Tatar culture and identity, and separatist tendencies intensified. With the return of capitalism, Kazan became one of the most important centers of the Russian Federation. The city went from 10th to 8th position in population ranking of Russian cities. In the early 2000s, the city earned the right to host both the 2013 Summer Universiade and 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Millennium of Kazan
Since 2000, the city has been undergoing a total renovation. The historical center including the Kremlin was rebuilt, however a large number of the city&#x27;s historical districts were completely demolished in the renovation. Kazan celebrated its millennium in 2005, after a city-organized historical commission settled on 1005 as the official year of the city&#x27;s founding. During the millennium celebrations, one of the largest mosque in Russia, Qolsharif, was dedicated in the Kazan Kremlin, the holiest copy of Our Lady of Kazan was returned to the city, the Millennium Bridge was inaugurated that year, and the Kazan Metro began operation. The government of the Russian Federation released the Medal &quot;In Commemoration of the 1000th Anniversary of Kazan&quot;.

In 2010, for the preparations to the 2013 Universiade, Kazan began even more renovation by modernizing its airport, fixing the streets, enhancing public transport, and adopting Russian, English, and Tatar languages in all transportation, large stores, and shopping centers.

In 2021, a teenager killed nine people in a school mass shooting and bombing.

In December 2024, Russian leader Vladimir Putin threatened to bring more &quot;destruction&quot; to Ukraine in retaliation for a Ukrainian drone attack on Kazan during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Heraldry==
The historical symbol of Kazan is the mythical dragon-like creature Zilant, often mentioned in legends. For example, when numerous snakes and reptiles severely hampered the development of the city, the hunters went in search of the King of snakes and defeated him, according to another version, the residents of the city bought off the giant snake with gold, after which all the snakes left the city. Another legend says that the giant dragon-like serpent always guarded the Khan&#x27;s treasures, and that it still protects the hidden wealth before the capture of the city in the secret caves. Historically, it is true that snakes were once numerous in the Kazan region, but then their number has decreased dramatically. The first official coat of arms of Kazan was approved on 18 October 1781 and was described as &quot;black snake under the crown of gold, Kazan, red wings, white field&quot;. In 1926, the country introduced a ban on such heraldry. In the 1980s, the coat of arms of Kazan began to reappear, and in the 1990s Kazan Zilant in various styles began to appear in print media. Modern graphics of the emblem and flag appeared in 2005—in a silver field on the green earth a black dragon with red wings and tongue, with gold paws, claws and eyes, topped with a gold crown. The shield is crowned with a Kazan cap. According to the traditions of heraldry, the dragon symbolizes power, wisdom and invincibility, the earth—life and wealth, the crown-development, and the cap above the shield-the capital of the city.

Most of the tram lines are laid along the axis of the main streets, most of them on a dedicated track, fenced with side stones. The tram in the city center was largely removed in the 2000s due to the fight against traffic jams on narrow streets; some routes turned out to be unprofitable after the optimization of the transport scheme in 2006–2007.

In 2009–2020, the reconstruction of tram tracks on the main highways was carried out, as well as the construction of four new tram lines, which made it possible to launch circular tram routes No. 5/5a with an accelerated mode of movement in 2012-2020 along the sections of the Big Kazan Ring.

All trams are equipped with autoinformators, announcements in which are in three languages (Russian, Tatar, English), for this reason announcements are played for a very long time (up to one and a half minutes).

The city set its two hottest days on record during the 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. Temperatures reached in the hottest days during that time.

==Central Kazan==

===Kremlin===

The city has a citadel (Russian: кремль, tr. kreml&#x27;, or sometimes Tatar: &quot;kirman&quot;), which was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000. Major monuments in the Kremlin are the five-domed, six-columned Annunciation Cathedral (1561–62) and the mysterious, formerly leaning Söyembikä Tower, named after the last queen of Kazan and regarded as the city&#x27;s most conspicuous landmark.

Also of interest are the towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later reconstructed; the Qol-Şarif Mosque, which has been rebuilt inside the citadel; remains of the Saviour Monastery (a 16th-century cathedral demolished by the Bolsheviks) with the Spasskaya Tower; and the Governor&#x27;s House (1843–53), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of Tatarstan.

Next door, the ornate baroque Sts-Peter-and-Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on Qawi Nacmi Street and Marcani Mosque on Qayum Nasiri Street date back to the 18th century.

====Towers====

The Spasskaya Tower was built in two floors by 16th century Pskov architects Ivan Shiryai and Postnik Yakovlev. From the inside, the northern side of the fortress to the Spasskaya Tower adjoined the gate to Spasskaya Church, which has now merged with the tower. The typical Pskovian architectural elements of the facade face the main street of the Kremlin. At the end of the 17th century, instead of three tiers, the tower was built with two brick eight-sided tiers with a brick roof, getting its present, familiar appearance. Until 1917, the tower was crowned with the double-headed coat of arms of the Russian state. In the 18th century, a ringing clock was installed in the upper tier, and even earlier a large bell was moved from a small belfry (now lost, located on the castle wall on the left side of the tower). Until the middle of the 19th century, there was a moat with a stone bridge in front of the tower.

The South-Western Tower was built simultaneously with the Spasskaya tower by Pskov masters and is a classic example of the Pskov style of defensive structures.

The name of the Transfiguration Tower comes from the Transfiguration Monastery of the Savior, which was fenced from the north-west. The tower was also built by Pskov architects Postnik and Barma, but it was significantly rebuilt later, as it has strong traces of the architectural influence of the Moscow defensive architecture. The territory from the Transfiguration Tower to the Spasskaya pass was added to the old Khan&#x27;s fortress by Pskov masters.

There are unnamed round brick towers, presumably built by Moscow architects in the 17th century.

The Tainitskaya Tower was built in its present form in the 1550s by Postnik Yakovlev. It was named after a secret source from which it was possible to take water during a siege. The entrance to the tower is in the form of a &quot;knee&quot;, which increased the defense of the Kremlin. It replaced a tower from the time of the khanate, Nur Ali (in Russian transcription Muraleeva). The 22-year-old Tsar Ivan the Terrible entered the conquered city through the Nur Ali tower.

The North-Eastern Round Tower was demolished after the Pugachev&#x27;s assault.

The Consistor Tower was built in brick by Moscow architects in the 17th century, its name was given in the 18th century from the Spiritual Consistory located near the tower in the Kremlin. Near the tower, archaeological excavations revealed the so-called Tezitsky (Arabic for &quot;merchant&quot;) Moat, which went from the Consistor Tower to the Transfiguration. Archaeologist N. Kalinin and a number of scientists believed that the moat was the southern border of the Khan&#x27;s fortress.

The Southeast Round Tower is an example of Pskov architecture of the 16th century.

===Bistä, or Posad===
Central Kazan is divided into two districts by the Bolaq canal and Lake Qaban. The first district (Qazan Bistäse or Kazanskiy Posad), historically Russian, is situated on the hill, the second (İske Tatar Bistäse or Staro-Tatarskaya Sloboda), historically Tatar, is situated between the Bolaq and the Volga. Mosques, such as &quot;Nurullah&quot;, &quot;Soltan&quot;, &quot;Bornay&quot;, &quot;Äcem&quot;, &quot;Märcani&quot;, &quot;İske Taş&quot;, &quot;Zäñgär&quot; are in the Tatar district.

Churches, such as &quot;Blagoveschenskaya&quot;, &quot;Varvarinskaya&quot;, &quot;Nikol&#x27;skaya&quot;, &quot;Tikhvinskaya&quot;, are mostly in the Russian part of the city.

The main city-centre streets are &quot;Bauman&quot;, &quot;Kremlyovskaya&quot;, &quot;Dzerzhinsky&quot;, &quot;Tuqay&quot;, &quot;Puşkin&quot;, &quot;Butlerov&quot;, &quot;Gorkiy&quot;, &quot;Karl Marx&quot; and &quot;Märcani&quot;.

===Wooden Kazan===
In the beginning of the 1900s most of Central Kazan was covered by wooden buildings, usually consisting of two floors. There was a historical environment of Kazan citizens, but not the best place to live in. During the Republican program &quot;The liquidation of ramshackle apartments&quot; most of them (unlike other Russian cities), especially in Central Kazan, where the land is not cheap, were destroyed and their population was moved to new areas at the suburb of the city (Azino, Azino-2, Quartal 39). Nearly 100,000 citizens resettled by this programme.

===Other major buildings===
Another significant building in central Kazan is the former &quot;Smolentzev and Shmelev&quot; tea house and hotel, now the Shalyapin Palace Hotel. It is located at 7/80 Universitetskaya Street, at the corner of Universitetskaya and Bauman. A major landmark of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture, it consists of two portions. The original portion, built for a merchant named Usmanov in the 1860s, was bought by the inter-related families of Efim Smolentzev and Pavel and Nikolai Shmelev in 1899. They operated a store selling, among other things, tea. In 1910, the Smolentevs and Shmelevs constructed another portion, designed by architect Vasili Trifonov, and operated a hotel there. After the Russian Revolution, the building became the Hotel Soviet. Following extensive renovations in the early 2000s, it reopened as the Shalyapin Palace Hotel.

<doc id="202296" wikidata="Q374125" url="?curid=202296" title="Emperor Reizei">
<text>was the 63rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Reizei&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 967 through 969, ending with his abdication and retirement.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Norihira&quot;-shinnō&quot; (憲平親王).

Norihira&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the second son of Emperor Murakami. His mother, Empress Yasuko, was a daughter of minister of the right Fujiwara no Morosuke. Soon after his birth he was appointed as crown prince, displacing the Emperor&#x27;s first-born son with the daughter of Fujiwara no Motokata. This decision was supposedly made under the influence of Morosuke and his brother Fujiwara no Saneyori who had seized power in the court. Motokata soon died, in despair at having lost the prospect of being grandfather to the next emperor. The malevolent influence of Motokata&#x27;s was blamed for Norihira&quot;-shinnō&quot;&#x27;s mental illness, which resulted in Saneyori acting as regent for the duration of his short reign.

From ancient times, there have been four noble clans, the &quot;Gempeitōkitsu&quot; (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (源氏) are also known as Genji, and of these, the Reizei Genji (冷泉源氏) are descended from 63rd emperor Reizei.

==Events of Reizei&#x27;s reign==
Questions about mental illness made Norihira&quot;-shinnō&quot;&#x27;s succession somewhat problematic.

In 967 his father Murakami died and Reizei ascended to the throne at the age of eighteen.

* July 5, 967 (&quot;Kōhō 4, 25th day of the 5th month&quot;): In the 16th year of Emperor Murakami&#x27;s reign (村上天皇十六年), he died; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his second son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Reizei is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).
* 969 (&quot;Anna 2&quot;): Reizei abdicated; and he took the honorific title of Reizei-in Jōkō. His reign lasted for just two years; and he lived another 44 years in retirement.
* November 21, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 24th day of the 10th month&quot;): &quot;Daijō-tennō&quot; Reizei-in Jōkō died at age 62.

The actual site of Reizei&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Reizei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Sakuramoto no misasagi&quot;

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Toba&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ōno-no-miya Fujiwara no Saneyori (藤原実頼), 900–970.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Saneyori.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Takaakira (源高明) (relegated in 969 by Anna Incident)
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Morotada (藤原師尹)
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Morotada (藤原師尹), 920–969.
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara no Arihira (藤原在衡)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Minamoto no Kaneakira (源兼明)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara no Koretada (藤原伊尹)

==Eras of Reizei&#x27;s reign==
The years of Reizei&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one :
* &quot;Kōhō&quot; (964–968)
* &quot;Anna&quot; (968–970)

* 941 (&quot;Tengyō 4&quot;): Fujiwara no Sumitomo staged a rebellion, having made a secret agreement with Taira no Masakado, but his army was defeated by Tachibana Tōyasu.

<doc id="202299" wikidata="Q329753" url="?curid=202299" title="Emperor Daigo">
<text>was the 60th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Daigo&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 897 through 930. He is named after his place of burial.

==Genealogy==

Daigo was the eldest son of his predecessor, Emperor Uda. His mother was Fujiwara no Taneko (or Inshi), daughter of the minister of the center, Fujiwara no Takafuji. He succeeded the throne at the young age after his father, the Emperor Uda, abdicated in 897. His mother died before his ascension, so he was raised by another Uda consort, Fujiwara no Onshi, daughter of the former &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara no Mototsune.

Daigo&#x27;s grandfather, Emperor Kōkō, had demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence; in addition, they were given the family name Minamoto. As such, Daigo was not born as a royalty and was named Minamoto no Korezane (源維城) until 887, when Daigo&#x27;s father, Minamoto no Sadami (formerly Prince Sadami), was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince and the heir to the throne. Afterwards, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was changed to or &quot;Ono-tei&quot; before his ascension of the Chrysanthemum Throne.

Daigo had 21 empresses, imperial consorts, and concubines; he had 36 imperial sons and daughters.

==Events of Daigo&#x27;s life==
The era name was changed in 898 to mark the beginning of Emperor Daigo&#x27;s reign. The highlight of Daigo&#x27;s 34-year reign was that he ruled by himself without the regency of the Fujiwara clan, though he himself was part Fujiwara.

* August 4, 897 (&quot;Kanpyō 9, 3rd day of the 7th month &quot;): In the 10th year of Uda&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (宇多天皇十年), Emperor Uda abdicated; and his eldest son received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;).
* August 14, 897 (&quot;Kanpyō 9, 13th day of the 7th month&quot;): Emperor Daigo formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* December 7, 899 (&quot;Shōtai 2, 1st day of the 11th month&quot;): The sun entered into the winter solstice, and all the great officials of the empire presented themselves in Daigo&#x27;s court.
* February 2, 900 (&quot;Shōtai 3, 3rd day of the 1st month&quot;): Daigo went to visit his father in the place Uda had chosen to live after the abdication.
* 900 (&quot;Shōtai 3, 10th month&quot;): The former Emperor Uda traveled to in what is now Wakayama prefecture to the south of Osaka. He visited the temples on the slopes of the mountain.
* January 23, 901 (&quot;Engi 1, 1st day of the 1st month&quot;): There was an eclipse of the sun.
* 901 (&quot;Engi 1, 1st month&quot;): The Sugawara Michizane &quot;incident&quot; developed, but more details cannot be known because Daigo ordered that diaries and records from this period be burned.
* 906 (&quot;Engi 5, 4th month&quot;): Ki-no Tsurayuki presented the emperor with the compilation of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, a collection of waka poetry.
* 909 (&quot;Engi 9, 4th month &quot;): The &quot;sadaijin&quot; Fujiwara no Tokihira died at the age of 39. He was honored with the posthumous title of regent.
* 929 (&quot;Enchō 7, 8th month&quot;): Floods devastated the country and many perished.
* July 21, 930 (&quot;Enchō 8, 26th day of the 6th month&quot;): A huge black storm cloud traveled from the slopes of Mt. Atago to Heian-kyō accompanied by frightful thunder. Lightning struck the Imperial Palace. Both Senior Counselor Fuijwara-no Kiyotsura (also known as Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki) and Middle Controller of the Right Taira-no Mareyo and many other subaltern officers were killed and their bodies were consumed in the subsequent fires. The deaths were construed as an act of revenge by the unsettled spirit of the late Sugawara Michizane.
* October 16, 930 (&quot;Enchō 8, 22nd day of the 9th month&quot;): In the 34th year of Daigo&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (醍醐天皇34年), the emperor fell ill and, fearing that he might not survive, Daigo abdicated. At this point, the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was said to have been received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Suzaku is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* October 23, 930 (&quot;Enchō 8, 29th day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor Daigo entered the Buddhist priesthood in the very early morning hours. As a monk, he took the Buddhist name Hō-kongō and, shortly thereafter, he died at the age of 46. This monk was buried in the precincts of Daigo-ji, which is why the former-emperor&#x27;s posthumous name became Daigo&quot;-tennō&quot;.

Daigo also ordered construction of several halls in the Daigo-ji, such as the Yakushi hall.

The actual site of Daigo&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Daigo&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Nochi no Yamashina no misasagi&quot; in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Daigo&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara no Tokihira (藤原時平), 909.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Tokihira 871–909.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadahira (藤原忠平), 880–949.

* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Hikaru (源光), 845–913.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadahira.

<doc id="202300" wikidata="Q958662" url="?curid=202300" title="Emperor Kōnin">
<text>was the 49th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Kōnin&#x27;s reign lasted from 770 to 781.

==Traditional narrative==
The personal name of Emperor Kōnin (&quot;imina&quot;) was . As a son of Imperial Prince Shiki and a grandson of Emperor Tenji, his formal style was Prince Shirakabe. Initially, he was not in line for succession, as Emperor Tenmu and his branch held the throne.

He married Imperial Princess Inoe, a daughter of Emperor Shōmu, producing a daughter and a son. After his sister-in-law Empress Shōtoku died, he was named her heir. The high courtiers claimed the empress had left her will in a letter in which she had appointed him as her successor. Prior to this, he had been considered a gentle man without political ambition.

Kōnin had five wives and seven Imperial sons and daughters.

Emperor Kōnin is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nara, Nara, as the location of Kōnin&#x27;s mausoleum.

===Events of Kōnin&#x27;s life===

* September 8, 769 (): In the 5th year of Empress Shōtoku&#x27;s reign, she died; she is said to have written a letter designating Senior Counselor Prince Shirakabe as her heir and crown prince.
* August 28, 770 (): Exactly one (Japanese era-based) year later, the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by Kōnin, who was the 62-year-old grandson of Emperor Tenji.
* October 23, 770 (): Emperor Kōnin was said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) in a formal ceremony, following the plans of the nobles and ministers to have him placed on the throne. The era name was also changed on this date, to Hōki.
* 781 (): The emperor abdicated in favor of his son Yamabe, who became Emperor Kanmu. Emperor Kōnin&#x27;s reign had lasted for 11 years.
* 781 (): Kōnin died at the age of 73.

===Eras of Kōnin&#x27;s reign===
The years of Kammu&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (&quot;nengō&quot;).
* &quot;Hōki&quot; (770–781)
* &quot;Ten&#x27;ō&quot; (781–782)

==Legacy==
Kōnin attempted to reconstruct the state finance and administrative organizations, which had been corrupted under the reign of Empress Kōken.

== Political conflict around his successors ==
Soon after his enthronement in 770 (Hōki 1), he promoted his wife Imperial Princess Inoe (or Inoue or Ikami, the exact pronunciation of her name is unknown) to the empress and appointed her son Imperial Prince Osabe to the crown prince in the next year. As a grandson of Emperor Shōmu by his mother, Osabe was one of few descendants of Emperor Tenmu, the line of Tenmu however didn&#x27;t succeed to the throne finally. In 772 Osabe was deprived of his crown prince rank and Imperial Prince Yamabe, an issue by another woman, later Emperor Kanmu was named heir.
According to the , the replacement happened as follows: in the third month of Hōki 3 (772), Inoe was accused of cursing her husband and Emperor Kōnin stripped her of the rank of Empress. In the fifth month of this year his son Osabe was deprived his crown prince status. In Hōki 4 (773), both were alleged to have murdered Imperial Princess Naniwa, a sister of Kōnin by cursing. This allegation made those two stripped of the rank of royals. Those two were together enclosed in a house in Yamato Province and died two years later in the same day, on the 27th day of the fourth month of Hōki 6 (on the Julian Calendar, on May 29, 775).

In 772, soon after Osabe&#x27;s deprivation of heir right, Prince Yamabe was named heir. His mother Takano no Niigasa, née Yamato no Niigasa, was a descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje. Since her clan had then no political power, his appointment had not been likely to happen without the deprivation of Osabe, the noblest male issue of Konin as the son of an Imperial Princess and Empress.

Today it is pointed out the accusations to Inoe and Osabe were likely to be plotted for depriving her son of the throne, and they were likely to be assassinated, by Fujiwara no Momokawa.

The late years of Kōnin&#x27;s reign and the early years of Kanmu&#x27;s reign suffered disasters. The people took those disasters as vengeance of noble victims of political conflicts, including late Inoe and Osabe. In 800 during the reign of Kanmu, Princess Inoe who had deceased in 775 was restored to the rank of Empress of Kōnin. Several shrines and temples were also founded for redemption, including Kamigoryō Shrine (:ja:上御霊神社). He favored Kim Am a man from the Kingdom of Silla.

<doc id="202304" wikidata="Q3140595" url="?curid=202304" title="Protests against the Iraq War">
<text>Beginning in late 2002 and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion.

These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally.

According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between January 3 and April 12, 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.

In the United States, even though pro-war demonstrators have been quoted as referring to anti-war protests as a &quot;vocal minority&quot;, Gallup Polls updated September 14, 2007, state, &quot;Since the summer of 2005, opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters. A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake.&quot;

From the protests before and during the Iraq War, this was one of the biggest global peace protests to occur in the early 21st century, since the 20th century protest of the Vietnam War. Throughout several rallies spanning throughout 2002 until 2011, an unspecified number of people were arrested. Despite the fact that the United States had already withdrawn the troops from Iraq by December 2011, another anti-war protest led by veterans of the Iraq War took place in May 2012 at Chicago during the NATO Summit at the Hyatt Regency, regarding the War in Afghanistan.

== Scope and impact in the United States ==

A March 2003 Gallup poll conducted during the first few days of the war showed that 5% of the population had protested or made a public opposition against the war compared to 21% who attended a rally or made a public display to support the war. An ABC news poll showed that 2% had attended an anti-war protest and 1% attended a pro-war rally. The protests made 20% more opposed to the war and 7% more supportive. A Fox News poll showed that while 63% had an unfavorable view of the protesters, just 23% had a favorable view. According to Pew Research, 40% said in March 2003 that they had heard &quot;too much&quot; from people opposed to the war against 17% who said &quot;too little&quot;.

Some observers have noted that the protests against the Iraq War were relatively small-scale and infrequent compared to protests against the Vietnam War. One of the most often cited factors for this is the lack of conscription.

== Prior to the Iraq War ==
These protests are said to be the biggest global peace protests before a war actually started; the peace movement is compared with the movement caused by the Vietnam War.

=== September 2002 ===
On September 12, 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Outside the United Nations building, over 1,000 people attended a protest organized by Voter March and No Blood for Oil.

On September 24, Tony Blair released a document describing Britain&#x27;s case for war in Iraq. Three days later, an anti-war rally in London drew a crowd of at least 150,000.

On September 29, roughly 5,000 anti-war protesters converged on Washington, D.C., on the day after an anti-International Monetary Fund protest.

=== October 2002 ===
On October 2, the day President Bush signed into law Congress&#x27; joint resolution authorizing the war, a small-scale protest was held in Chicago, attended by a crowd of roughly 1,000 who listened to speeches by Jesse Jackson and then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. Obama&#x27;s statement, &quot;I am not opposed to all wars. I&#x27;m opposed to dumb wars,&quot; was barely noted at the time, but became famous during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries when the Obama camp used it to demonstrate his courage and good judgment on the war.

On October 7, Bush delivered a major speech justifying the invasion of Iraq at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. Outside, approximately 3,000 people gathered to protest the coming war. Later, a few hundred protesters blocking the Museum Center exits were dispersed by mounted police, and six people were arrested.

On October 26, protests took place in various cities across the world. Over 100,000 people took part in a protest in Washington. 50,000 people took part in a demonstration in San Francisco. Both protests were called by the ANSWER Coalition.

On October 31, around 150 protests took place across the United Kingdom, including Critical Mass bike rides, occupations, and mass demonstrations in Brighton, Manchester, Glasgow and London. Protests also took place in the US.

=== November 2002 ===
On November 9, demonstrations were held against the war at the end of the first European Social Forum in Florence, Italy. According to the organizers, 1,000,000 people were in attendance. Local authorities put attendance at 500,000.

On Saturday, November 16, in Canada an anti-war demonstration of about 2,000 people occurred at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto.

On November 17, a large anti-war coalition held a peace march in Vancouver marching from Peace Flame Park as part of a Cross-Canada Day of Action. In Vancouver, about 3,000 people gathered in the rain. Washington must take any complaints against foreign governments to the United Nations, they said. Many accused the White House of targeting Saddam Hussein in order to try to take control of valuable oil reserves.
About 1,000 marched through a shower of ice pellets in Montreal, and about 500 showed up in a blur of white snow on Parliament Hill. Rallies were held in several other cities, including Halifax, Winnipeg and Edmonton.

===January 2003===
On January 16, 2003, protests were held worldwide in opposition to a war with Iraq, including in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina, and the United States, where Americans attended a rally in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Park Police, which oversees activities on the National Mall, stopped providing estimates of crowd size after being threatened with lawsuits by the organizers of the Million Man March, but said that protest organizers only had a permit for 30,000 demonstrators.
On January 18, anti-war demonstrations, focusing particularly but not exclusively on the expected war with Iraq, took place in villages, towns, and cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Dublin, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, Gothenburg, Florence, Oslo, Rotterdam, Istanbul and Cairo. In New Zealand, thousands rallied in Dunedin and Christchurch, while in Auckland protesters rallied at the Devonport naval base on January 28, opposing the deployment of the frigate HMNZS Te Mana to the Gulf.

NION and ANSWER jointly organized protests in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Other protests took place all over the United States, including various smaller places such as Lincoln, Nebraska.

Upwards of 50,000 people demonstrated in San Francisco. The day started with a waterfront rally at 11 am, followed by a march down Market Street to the civic center.

In Seattle, a surprise turnout on a sunny Saturday saw over 45,000 people (Organizer and observers reports) march from the Seattle Center (after several speeches) to King Street Station-the local media all came up with nonsensical crowd numbers, from 200 up to 1,500 people. People were still vacating the starting point at the Seattle Center while the front of the march was piling up at King Street Station, the terminal point of the march; Over 5 miles of solid people-as was evidenced by one aerial photo courtesy KING-TV, showed the true scope of the march. Most of the media downplayed the numbers by taking photos at the front of the parade, on flat ground-which usually showed just a few hundred people. For some reason there was no speaker awaiting to what would have been a crowd of possibly 50,000 people-it simply ended...casual shoppers and walkers joining the crowd-the largest march of any kind in Seattle&#x27;s history at the time (surpassed by the Women&#x27;s March in Seattle in 2017).

In Washington, &quot;at least tens of thousands&quot;, people demonstrated through the city, ending with a rally at The Mall. Among the speakers was Rev. Jesse Jackson who told the crowd that &quot;We are here because we choose coexistence over coannihilation.&quot;

The protests were planned to coincide with the January 15, birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.

=== February 2003 ===

On February 15, millions of people protested, in approximately 800 cities around the world. Listed by the 2004 &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the largest protest in human history, protests occurred among others in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Syria, India, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and even McMurdo Station in Antarctica. Perhaps the largest demonstration this day occurred in London, with up to one million protestors gathering in Hyde Park; speakers included the Reverend Jesse Jackson, London mayor Ken Livingstone, and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. A large demonstration, also attended by perhaps around a million, took place in Madrid.

=== March 2003 ===
Such prominent figures of demonstrations against Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s as Pete Seeger, Tom Hayden, Joan Baez, Norman Siegel, William Sloane Coffin took part in the protests against the invasion in Iraq in the USA.

On March 8, three separate marches converged on Manchester Town Hall, UK. Official estimates put the number of participants at 10,000 (although this was disputed by organisers), making it the biggest political demonstration in the city since the Peterloo Massacre in 1819.
On March 15, Spanish and Italian cities showed some of the largest turnouts against their governments&#x27; pro-war stance, with more than 400,000 protesters in Milan, more than 300,000 in Barcelona forming a mile-long human chain, and more than 120,000 in Madrid. Marches also took place in Seville, Aranjuez, Palencia, and in the Canary Islands.

Many of the protests were said to be smaller than those in the same cities a month ago; exceptions were Montreal, which upped its turnout to 200,000 and Dublin where 130,000 demonstrated. The Montreal turnout may have been related to solidarity against American anti-French sentiment, which was a common theme for many of the protesters. A further 15,000 protested in Quebec City. 55,000 protested in Paris, and 4,500 to 10,000 in Marseille. 100,000 protested in Berlin, some 20,000 protested in Athens, close to 10,000 people marched in Tokyo, and tens of thousands in Washington, D.C. Organizers claimed between 30,000 and 45,000 people turned out, while &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and the Associated Press estimated between 20,000 and 25,000 people attended, closer to the number in Portland who participated in the January 18 protest. Thousands more marched in cities worldwide including Bangkok, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amman, Chicago, Calcutta, Melbourne, Christchurch, Dunedin, Paris, London, Portsmouth, Leeds, York, Exeter, Newcastle upon Tyne, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Zurich, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Nicosia, Monaco, Santiago, Havana, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Moscow, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Vancouver, Halifax, Ottawa, and Toronto, as well as cities in Yemen, Turkey, Israel, and the Palestinian territories.

On March 19, across the United Kingdom tens of thousands of school students staged walkouts.

In Birmingham 4,000 (BBC estimate) striking school students held a demonstration which ended at Victoria Square. Though there were some reports of some students throwing coins, West Midlands police said that the protests were &quot;buoyant rather than boisterous&quot; and no arrests were made. The demonstration later moved on to Cannon Hill Park. The son of Lord Hunt, a junior health Minister who quit his job over the march, was amongst the students in attendance.

In West Yorkshire around 500 students (BBC estimate) walked out of Ilkley Grammar School, reportedly one-third of the student body. In Bradford up to 200 students (BBC estimate) gathered in Centenary Square.

A large protest took place at Westminster where London school students gathered.

In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) secondary school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They marched to the BBC studios where they sat down in the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic for over an hour where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.

== Invasion of Iraq ==

On March 23, in the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, individuals threw a grenade at the UK&#x27;s consulate in the city center from a car before quickly fleeing the scene. No victims and only minor material damage were reported. A self-styled People&#x27;s Revolutionary Militias claimed authorship for the attack via email, justifying it as a reaction to the invasion. In this line, the nearby US-funded North American-Ecuadorian Center would also have been a target. A philosophy student of the University of Guayaquil was arrested two days later in connection to the attack, in alleged possession of radical left-wing propaganda material.

On the live broadcast of the 2003 Academy Awards, several presenters and recipients made various comments against the war ranging from Susan Sarandon giving a simple peace sign to Michael Moore publicly denouncing George W. Bush upon receiving his award.

Media reports state at least 20,000 school pupils protesting in Hamburg, Germany. After the protest march, conflicts between police and protesters broke out in front of a US building in Hamburg. Protesters who were pushed back by the police began to throw stones, who in turn reacted with water cannons. There have since been serious discussions about police abuses in Hamburg, and political ramifications may follow. In the afternoon, 50,000 people protested peacefully in Leipzig following traditional prayers for peace in the city&#x27;s Nikolai Church. Prayers for peace and subsequent large demonstrations at that church every Monday (&#x27;Montagsdemos&#x27;) helped bring down the GDR government in East Germany in 1989. The weekly demonstrations, supported by churches, trade unions and other civic organizations, began again in January 2003 in protest to the impending invasion of Iraq. Protest marches in the afternoon were also reported in the German cities of Berlin and Freiburg. In Rome, Milan, Turin and other Italian cities, thousands of pupils and schoolteachers stayed away from school to protest against the Iraq war. The teachers union reported that 60 percent of all schools were closed. The strike had been planned weeks ago as a signal against a school reform bill, but was converted to an anti-war protest. 400 anti-war protesters tried to enter the Australian parliament in Canberra to speak to the prime minister, but were stopped by police. In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, Maoist protesters attacked shops selling Coca-Cola and US soft drinks. Protests in front of US buildings and in fast food shops were also held in Indonesia.

In Oakland, California, police fired rubber bullets and beanbags at protesters and dockworkers outside the port, injuring at least a dozen demonstrators and six longshoremen standing nearby. Protestors were protesting the Iraq War related action performed by American President Lines and defense contractor Stevedoring Services of America. Most of the 500 demonstrators were dispersed peacefully, but a crowd of demonstrators was blocking traffic on private property near the port and failed to disperse after police warnings. The Oakland Police Chief said demonstrators also threw objects and bolts at the police, and said the use of weapons was necessary to disperse the crowd. He indicated that the rubber bullets were used to respond to direct illegal action and the longshoremen were caught in the crossfire. A dockworker spokesman reported that police gave two minutes to disperse, then opened fire rather than making arrests. Demonstrators also claim that the police took direct aim at them, rather than firing in the air or at the ground. Thirty-one people were arrested. Demonstrators regrouped and marched to the Oakland Federal Building. In New York, United States, protesters targeted the Carlyle Group, an investment firm with deep connections to the war. About 20 protesters were arrested in a planned civil disobedience, but police then also surrounded and arrested close to 100 people who were simply watching the protest from across the street.

== Occupation of Iraq ==

Following the Invasion, both protests and armed combat experienced a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often on the occasion of anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu Ghraib prison), calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.

=== October 25, 2003 ===
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Reno, Nevada, and other cities around the world, in opposition to the occupation of Iraq. Protesters also advocated for the return of American troops to the United States, and for the protection of civil liberties.

The Washington, D.C., rally attracted 20,000 (BBC estimate) protesters. The protest ended with a rally at the Washington Monument, within sight of the White House. Protesters also called for the repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act. The Washington and San Francisco protests were jointly organized by ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) and United for Peace and Justice.

A pro-war demonstration in Washington organized by Free Republic attracted only dozens (BBC estimate) of people.

=== August 29, 2004 ===

As part of the 2004 Republican National Convention protests, United for Peace and Justice organized a mass march, one of the largest in U.S. history, in which protesters marched past Madison Square Garden, the site of the convention. The march included hundreds of separate contingents as well as individual marchers. The group One Thousand Coffins held a procession of one thousand full-scale flag-draped cardboard coffins, commemorating each of the U.S. fallen troops as of that date, carried by a nationwide coalition of citizens, veterans, clergy and families of the fallen. Several hundred members of Billionaires for Bush held a mock countermarch. Estimates of crowd size ranged from 120,000 (unnamed police spokesman) to over 500,000 (organizers, second unnamed police source). In March, 2007 NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne stated about the RNC protests: &quot;You certainly had 800,000 on August 29th.&quot;

Organizers held a pre-march press conference in front of thousands on 7th Avenue. Several people spoke in opposition to the war in Iraq and Bush administration policies including Michael Moore, Jesse Jackson, Congressman Charles Rangel, and a father who had lost his son in Iraq. The whole event lasted six hours, with the lead contingent finishing the march long before thousands of people could even move from the starting point. The City government, under Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had earlier denied the protesters a permit to hold a rally in Central Park following the march, citing concern for the park&#x27;s grass. The West Side Highway was offered instead, but organizers refused, citing exorbitant costs for the extra sound equipment and problems for the location. Organizers encouraged people to go to Central Park following the march&#x27;s conclusion in Union Square.
Disturbances were minor. New York Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly reported about 200 arrests with 9 felonies—most of them occurring after the march had concluded.

=== October 2, 2004 ===
A large group of people assembled at the Women&#x27;s Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the National Memorial Procession, described as &quot;A Trail of Mourning and Truth from Iraq to the White House&quot;. The theme of the event was &quot;Mourn the dead. Heal the wounded. End the war.&quot; Participants were encouraged to dress in black to symbolize mourning. Cindy Sheehan was among the participants at this demonstration. Speeches were made by veterans, members of military families, family members of fallen soldiers, and others. Following the speeches, participants marched from Arlington National Cemetery to the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., carrying cardboard coffins to symbolize the war dead. Following the march, another rally was held, where the coffins carried on the march were placed with more coffins placed at the Ellipse earlier. Following the second rally, 28 people, including Michael Berg (father of the American civilian contractor Nicholas Berg who was killed by insurgents in Iraq), were arrested while attempting to deliver the names of fallen heroes to the White House.

=== March 18, 2023 ===
In Washington, D.C., peace rallies from around 200 organizations are held to mark the twentieth anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. Protesters called for an end to US involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as US militarism in general. Protesters also call for the disbandment of NATO.

== Criticism ==
Anarchist author and activist Peter Gelderloos has criticized the protests against the Iraq War for their complete ineffectiveness at stopping the war.

Americans on the political right were highly critical of the protesters, accusing them of giving aid and comfort to the enemy, if not outright treason. One notable group, Protest Warrior, actively counter-protested during anti-war demonstrations. Founded in 2003, Protest Warrior infiltrated liberal protests with signs that satirized leftist positions and expressed support for U.S. military action. The group saw the anti-war protests as damaging to troop morale and argued that they bolstered regimes like Saddam Hussein’s. During the 2004 Republican National Convention, Protest Warriors staged multiple counter-protests, though their confrontational approach sometimes led to friction with liberal demonstrators and even law enforcement.

<doc id="202305" wikidata="Q5584506" url="?curid=202305" title="Magnus Brahe (1790–1844)">
<text>Nils Magnus Brahe (2 September 1790 – 16 September 1844) was a Swedish statesman and military officer during the War of the Sixth Coalition. He served as the Marshal of the Realm between 1831–1844 and was known as the influential favourite of Charles XIV John, King of Sweden.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Nils Magnus Brahe was born on 2 September 1790 to Count Magnus Fredrik Brahe (1756–1826) and his first wife Baroness Ulrika Katarina Koskull (1759–1805), thus making him a member of the Swedish branch of the Brahe family. He is a direct descendant of Per Brahe the Younger, Lord High Steward and Governor-General. After studying at Uppsala University, he pursued a professional military career as cornet at the Royal Life Regiment Brigade&#x27;s Light Dragoons Corps at 19 years of age. Early as 1810, he became Cabinet Chamberlain and had close relations with Charles XIV John during his early reign.

=== The King&#x27;s favourite ===

Not long thereafter, Brahe became one of the King&#x27;s closet friends. He assisted Charles XIV John&#x27;s correspondence with officials and servants. He fought in the War against Napoleon (1813–1814) under Jean Bernadotte who later ascended to the throne as Charles XIV John of Sweden (Swedish: &quot;Karl XIV Johan&quot;). He was in high favour with the French born king who had a poor command of the Swedish language. He became Marshal of the Realm, and especially from 1828 onwards, exercised an influence in public affairs. As a politician, he reportedly remained close to his stepmother, Countess Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull, who was active within Stockholm aristocratic circles and also related to the king&#x27;s mistress Mariana Koskull. In 1837, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="202309" wikidata="Q7828573" url="?curid=202309" title="Touch (1980s band)">
<text>Touch is an American rock band from New York City formed in 1978. The band consists of Mark Mangold (songwriter and keyboards), Glen Kithcart (drums), Craig Brooks (guitars), and Doug Howard. Mangold, Kithcart, and Brooks had previously been in the band &quot;American Tears&quot; and had released three albums under Columbia Records.

==History==

=== 1974 - 1979: American Tears, Signing to Atco ===
In the early 1970s, Mark Mangold formed the keyboard-driven hard-rock band American Tears with bassist Gary Sonny and drummer Tommy Gunn before signing with Columbia Records. In 1974, American Tears released their debut album, &quot;Branded Bad&quot; which failed to chart on the Billboard 200 or produce any hit singles. In 1975, Gary Sonny was replaced by Greg Baze and the band released their second album &quot;Tear Gas&quot; which also failed to chart. In 1977, the band released their final album on Columbia, &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, which featured new members drummer Glen Kithcart, guitarist Craig Brooks, and bassist Kirk Powers. This album also did not chart and American Tears left Columbia. 

In 1978, the band reassembled, changed their name to Touch, and added bassist Doug Howard to their lineup. They began making demos in an attempt to get another record deal, and recorded a demo of &quot;When the Spirit Moves You&quot; at the Power Station. This demo caught the attention of Deep Purple and Rainbow manager Bruce Payne, who helped them get a deal with Atco. Recording for their first album &quot;Touch&quot; then began with English producer Tim Friese-Greene. This would be released in 1980.

===1980: First Album===
The first single from the album, &quot;When The Spirit Moves You&quot; reached #65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #77 on Cashbox Top 100. The second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know What Love Is,&quot; reached #69 on the Hot 100, #86 on Cashbox. &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know What Love Is&quot; was played on AOR radio stations in the USA during the early 80s and did particularly well on a specialist &quot;Melody Maker&quot; chart in Great Britain. In 1981-82, the band also recorded a second album that was produced by Todd Rundgren but it went unreleased.

Touch was the first band to play at the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington racetrack in 1980. A live version of &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know What Love Is&quot; also appeared on the compilation LP &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot;, documenting performances at the festival.

===Post Break-up===
Mark Mangold continued to write and record with and for other artists, with one of his earliest collaborators being a then-relatively unknown musician named Michael Bolton. This working relationship began when Mangold co-wrote and performed on Bolton&#x27;s first solo hit, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Game,&quot; which was featured on the latter artist&#x27;s self-titled 1983 solo album. The song &quot;I Found Someone,&quot; another collaboration with Bolton, was initially recorded by Laura Branigan, though it ultimately became a top-10 hit for Cher.

Furthermore, Craig Brooks also joined Mangold in the studio for Michael Bolton&#x27;s solo album. In addition to being a fellow co-writer on &quot;Fool&#x27;s Game,&quot; Brooks performed guitar and backing vocals for the album. The following year, he also contributed by singing on Roger Glover&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Mask&quot;.

Doug Howard also continued to perform, record and write with acts and artists such as Todd Rundgren, Edgar Winter, Stun Leer, and Roy Buchanan as well as a member of Rundgren&#x27;s Utopia 

===2014: Reformation===
In 2014, Mangold was asked to play Touch songs with a band assembled by the Firefest Festival, including Swedish singer Göran Edman as the lead vocals along with other Swedish musicians. This lineup performed live at the Firefest in Nottingham, UK in October 2014.

===2020 onwards===
In 2020, Mangold announced that all four original members of the band had reunited and were once again working on a new &quot;Touch&quot; album for release in late 2020. In October 2020, Mangold posted a new Touch song on their YouTube. The album, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, was later released on 6 March 2021.

In October 2023 it was announced that Touch (full original lineup) would perform at Firefest Festival (10 Years After) to be held in the UK at Manchester Academy on 11th-13th October 2024. The band preceded headline act Robin McAuley on the Saturday night.

<doc id="202311" wikidata="Q1273271" url="?curid=202311" title="E-services">
<text>Electronic services or e-services are services that make use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are: 
# service provider;
# service receiver; and 
# the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology)

For example, with respect to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. For public e-service the internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government, the term ‘E-Government’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization. E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to 
:&quot;&quot;The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix &#x27;e&#x27; standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.&quot; (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).
:&quot;E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible.&quot;&quot; (Jeong, 2007).

== Importance of e-service ==
Lu (2001) identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing Customer knowledge

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are:

# E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or non-government organizations (NGOs) (private sector).
# E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side).

The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix &#x27;public&#x27; as in &quot;public e-services&quot;. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of e-service in both domains of e-government and e-business.

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to:

* Data layer (data sources), 
* processing layers (customer service systems, 
* management systems, 
* data warehouse systems, 
* integrated customer content systems), 
* exchange layer (Enterprise Application Integration– EAI), 
* interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and 
* presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring service quality and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The SERVQUAL- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The LIRNEasia study [Alawattegama &amp; Wattegama (2008)] focuses more on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned in the table. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of information society reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by government agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==E-service cost factor==
Some major cost factors are (Lu, 2001):

* Expense of setting up applications
* Maintaining applications
* Internet connection
* Hardware/software
* Security concerns
* legal issues
* Training; and
* Rapid technology changes

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc. What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services and e-commerce in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent&#x27;s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance. The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208). In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the Batho Pele portal, SARS e-filing, the e-Natis system, electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one&#x27;s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange (ELX)is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource (MOHR), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

e-Syariah is the seventh project under the Electronic Government flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). A case management system that integrates the processes related to management of cases for the Syariah Courts.

== Examples of e-services in established countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. Government 2.0 (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps. Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.

E-commerce is another growing e-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. Amazon.com is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. Wal-Mart is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart&#x27;s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion. Apple develops and sells a wide variety of technological goods and services such as cell phones, music players, and computers. Apple&#x27;s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was $12 billion. E-services allows businesses to reach new clientele and offer new services. Companies such as eBay and Etsy have achieved great success, with eBay posting a net income in 2016 of nearly $9 billion and Esty claiming roughly $200 million in profits from nearly $2 billion sales. The majority or eBay&#x27;s business is conducted in the United States but it does a great deal of international business including the United Kingdom and Germany. The global reach of Etsy is seen in nearly every country in the world with 31% of gross merchandise sales occurring outside of the United States.

=== E-services in China ===
China&#x27;s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience. China&#x27;s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “Internet Plus.” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as Zhongguancun.

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording) This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased e-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined. There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products. Alibaba is China&#x27;s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion. Its services are globally available in Russia and Brazil through AliExpress. Tencent is another internet company with an annual revenue income of $16 billion. Tencent is used mainly for instant messaging but has other applications as well including mobile games and other digital content. By the end of 2015, Tencent&#x27;s WeChat messaging app reached around 700 million users. The biggest competitor for Tencent is Facebook&#x27;s WhatsApp. Baidu Is the most visited website in the country and it is used as a search engine and has an annual revenue of $10 billion. In March 2016, there were roughly 663 million users. Google challenges Baidu as the major internet search engines in the world. Huawei is a tech company that produces phones, tablets, and develops the equipment used in fixed-line networks. Huawei has an annual revenue income of $61 billion. It is currently located throughout 100 countries worldwide and in 2015, it filed 3,898 patent applications, more than any other country in the world. The biggest competitors to Huawei is Apple and Samsung.

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007) identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* Fraud on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* Privacy due to the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be the penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases, firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is a fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. The possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is a concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations. For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles. The possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilization of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007)

However, in the last years, one can observe appearing of different e-services and related initiatives in developing countries such as Project Nemmadi, MCA21 Mission Mode Project or Digital India even more, in India; Electronic Government Directorate in Pakistan; The E-government citizen program in Iraq; E-government Development Center in Azerbaijan etc.

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery; one worth noting effort is Rowley&#x27;s study (2006) who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p. 1) as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003) finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006) who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site ...Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007), for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007) “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
Digital divide is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009), “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites.&quot;

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or e-readiness. According to by Shalini (2009), “the results of the research project reveal that a high index may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question&#x27;s priorities and perspective.

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services. According to the GAO report of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government. The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large, Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009) argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the stakeholder theory in public settings. The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees&#x27; computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance. Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.

==E-service awards==

<doc id="202312" wikidata="Q1195931" url="?curid=202312" title="General MIDI">
<text>General MIDI (also known as GM or GM 1) is a standardized specification for electronic musical instruments that respond to MIDI messages. GM was developed by the American MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Japan MIDI Standards Committee (JMSC) and first published in 1991. The official specification is available in English from the MMA, bound together with the MIDI 1.0 specification, and in Japanese from the Association of Musical Electronic Industry (AMEI).

GM imposes several requirements beyond the more abstract MIDI 1.0 specification. While MIDI 1.0 by itself provides a communication protocol which ensures that different instruments can interoperate at a fundamental level – for example, that pressing keys on a MIDI keyboard will cause an attached MIDI sound module to play musical notes – GM goes further in two ways. First, GM requires that all compliant MIDI instruments meet a certain minimal set of features, such as being able to play at least 24 notes simultaneously (polyphony). Second, GM attaches specific interpretations to many parameters and control messages which were left unspecified in the MIDI 1.0 specification. For example, assigning one of the 128 possible MIDI &quot;Program Number&quot;s selects an instrument. With MIDI 1.0, the assignment could be to an arbitrary instrument; but with GM, a program number assigns a specific &quot;instrument name&quot;. This helps ensure that playback of MIDI files sounds more consistent between different devices compliant with the GM specification. However, it still leaves the actual &quot;sounds&quot; of each instrument up to the supplier to implement; one manufacturer&#x27;s French horn, say, could be brighter, or more mellow, than another&#x27;s.

The GM 1 specification was extended by General MIDI 2 in 1999; however, GM 1 is still commonly used. General MIDI was widely supported by computer game developers in the 1990s.

== General MIDI 1 requirements ==
To be GM 1 compatible, sound generating devices (keyboards, hardware or software synthesizers, sound cards) are required to meet the General MIDI System Level 1 performance specification:
==Parameter interpretations==
GM Instruments must also obey the following conventions for program and controller events:

===Program change events===

In MIDI, the instrument sound or &quot;program&quot; for each of the 16 possible MIDI channels is selected with the Program Change message, which has a Program Number parameter. The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible GM Program Numbers. There are 128 program numbers. The numbers can be displayed as values 1 to 128, or, alternatively, as 0 to 127. The 0 to 127 numbering is usually only used internally by the synthesizer; the vast majority of MIDI devices, digital audio workstations and professional MIDI sequencers display these Program Numbers as shown in the table (1–128).

===Percussion===

In GM standard MIDI files, channel 10 is reserved for percussion instruments only. Notes recorded on channel 10 always produce percussion sounds when transmitted to a keyboard or synth module which uses the GM standard. Each distinct note number specifies a unique percussive instrument, rather than the sound&#x27;s pitch.

If a MIDI file is programmed to the General MIDI protocol, then the results are predictable, but timbre and sound fidelity may vary depending on the quality of the GM synthesizer. The General MIDI standard includes 47 percussive sounds, using note numbers 35-81 (of the possible 128 numbers from 0–127), as follows:
*35 Acoustic Bass Drum &quot;or&quot; Low Bass Drum
*36 Electric Bass Drum &quot;or&quot; High Bass Drum

The standard does not specify program change numbers for different drum sets.

===Controller events===
In MIDI, adjustable parameters for each of the 16 possible MIDI channels may be set with the Control Change (CC) message, which has a Control Number parameter and a Control Value parameter (expressed in a range from 0 to 127). GM also specifies which operations should be performed by multiple Control Numbers.
===RPN===

GM defines several Registered Parameters, which act like Controllers but are addressed in a different way. In MIDI, every Registered Parameter is assigned a Registered Parameter Number or RPN. Registered Parameters are usually called RPNs for short.

Setting Registered Parameters requires sending (numbers are decimal):
#two Control Change messages using Control Numbers 101 and 100 to select the parameter, followed by
#any number of Data Entry messages of one or two bytes (MSB = Controller #6, LSB = Controller #38), and finally
#an &quot;End of RPN&quot; message

The following global Registered Parameter Numbers (RPNs) are standardized (the parameter is specified by RPN LSB/MSB pair and the value is set by Data Entry LSB/MSB pair):
*0,0 Pitch bend range
*1,0 Channel Fine tuning
*2,0 Channel Coarse tuning
An example of an RPN control sequence to set coarse tuning to A440 (parm 2, value 64) is codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5.

===System Exclusive messages===
Two GM System Exclusive (&quot;SysEx&quot;) messages are defined: one to enable and disable General MIDI compatibility mode (for synthesizers that also have non-GM modes); and the other to set the synthesizer&#x27;s master volume.

==GS extensions==

Roland GS is a superset of the General MIDI standard that added several proprietary extensions. The most notable addition was the ability to address multiple banks of programs (instrument sounds) by using an additional pair of Bank Select controllers to specify up to 16384 &quot;variation&quot; sounds (cc#0 is Bank Select MSB, and cc#32 is Bank Select LSB). Other most notable features were 9 Drum kits with 14 additional drum sounds each, simultaneous Percussion Kits – up to 2 (Channels 10/11), Control Change messages for controlling the send level of sound effect blocks (cc#91-94), entering additional parameters (cc#98-101), portamento, sostenuto, soft pedal (cc#65-67), and model-specific SysEx messages for setting various parameters of the synth engine. The 14 additional drum sounds are numbered 27-34 and 82–87, bracketing the 47 General MIDI standard sounds numbered 35–81, and are as follows:

*27 High Q &quot;or&quot; Filter Snap
*28 Slap Noise
*29 Scratch Push
*30 Scratch Pull
*31 Drum sticks
*32 Square Click
*33 Metronome Click
*34 Metronome Bell
*82 Shaker
*83 Jingle Bell
*84 Belltree
*85 Castanets
*86 Mute Surdo
*87 Open Surdo
GS was introduced in 1991 with the Roland Sound Canvas line, which was also Roland&#x27;s first General MIDI synth module.

==XG extensions==

Yamaha XG is a superset of the General MIDI standard that added several proprietary extensions. The most notable additions were the 600 instruments and 32 notes polyphony.

XG was introduced in 1994 with the Yamaha MU-series line of sound modules and PSR line of digital keyboards.

==General MIDI Level 2==
In 1999, the official GM standard was updated to include more controllers, patches, RPNs and SysEx messages, in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting and proprietary Roland GS and Yamaha XG additions. Here&#x27;s a quick overview of the GM2 changes in comparison to GM/GS:

* Number of Notes – minimum 32 simultaneous notes
* Simultaneous Percussion Kits – up to 2 (Channels 10/11)
* Up to 16384 variation banks are allowed, each containing a version of the 128 Melodic Sounds (the exact use of these banks is up to the individual manufacturer.)
* 9 GS Drum kits are included
* Additional Control Change introduced, called &quot;Sound Controllers 1–10&quot;:

* Registered Parameter Numbers (RPNs)
**Modulation Depth Range (Vibrato Depth Range)
*Universal SysEx messages
** Master Volume, Fine Tuning, Coarse Tuning
**Reverb Type, Time
**Chorus Type, Mod Rate, Mod Depth, Feedback, Send to Reverb
** Controller Destination Setting
** Scale/Octave Tuning Adjust
** Key-Based Instrument Controllers
** GM2 System On SysEx message

Additional melodic instruments can be accessed by setting CC#0 to 121 and then using CC#32 to select the bank before a Program Change.

<text>The Château de Coucy (Picard: &quot;Câtiau Couchy&quot;) is a French castle in the commune of Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique, in Picardy, built in the 13th century and renovated by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century. 
During its heyday, it was famous for the size of its central tower and the pride of its lords, who adopted the staunchly independent rhyme: &quot;roi ne suis, ne prince ne duc ne comte aussi; Je suis le sire de Coucy&quot; (&quot;I am not king, nor prince nor duke nor count; I am the Lord of Coucy&quot;).

==Background==
The castle was constructed in the 1220s by Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy. The castle proper occupies the tip of a bluff or &quot;falaise&quot;. It forms an irregular trapezoid of 92 x 35 x 50 x 80 m. At the four corners are cylindrical towers 20 m in diameter (originally 40 m in height). Between two towers on the line of approach was the massive &quot;donjon&quot; (keep). The donjon was the largest in Europe, measuring 35 meters wide and 55 meters tall. The smaller towers surrounding the court were as big as the donjons being built at that time by the French monarchy. The rest of the bluff is covered by the lower court of the castle, and the small town.
Coucy was occupied in September 1914 by German troops during World War I. It became a military outpost and was frequented by German dignitaries, including Emperor Wilhelm II himself. In March 1917 the retreating German army, on order of General Erich Ludendorff, destroyed the keep and the 4 towers. It is not known whether this act had some military purpose or was merely an act of wanton destruction. The destruction caused so much public outrage that in April 1917 the ruins were declared &quot;a memorial to barbarity&quot;. War reparations were used to clear the towers and to consolidate the walls but the ruins of the keep were left in place.

One of its lords, Enguerrand VII (1340–1397), is the subject of historian Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s study of the fourteenth century &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot;. It also features extensively in British author Anthony Price&#x27;s 1982 crime/espionage novel &quot;The Old Vengeful&quot;.

Château de Coucy has been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture since 1862, and is managed by the &quot;Centre des monuments nationaux&quot;.

<text>Harvest Records is a British-American record label belonging to Capitol Music Group, originally created by EMI in 1969.

==History==
Harvest Records was created by EMI in 1969 to market progressive rock music, and to compete with Philips&#x27; Vertigo and Decca&#x27;s Deram labels, and the independent Island label. Harvest was initially under the direction of Malcolm Jones, and was distributed in North America by EMI&#x27;s US affiliate, Capitol Records. They were the European licensee for the American label Blue Thumb Records from 1969 to 1971.

In the 1970s, the label primarily released progressive rock recordings by British acts including Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, The Move, Roy Wood, Michael Chapman, Barclay James Harvest, Bill Nelson&#x27;s avant garde-prog act Be Bop Deluxe and heavy rock band, Deep Purple. Most acts on the Harvest roster were British; two notable exceptions were Australian progressive band Spectrum (whose first two LPs were issued on Harvest) and Spectrum&#x27;s successor Ariel, whose first two LPs also came out on the label. The Danish musician Sebastian had three albums released in Denmark on the Harvest label between 1972 and 1974.

The focus of the label changed slightly as the 1970s drew to a close, with the signing of post-punk groups Wire, Australian proto punk garage rock band the Saints and the Banned. New wave artist Thomas Dolby released his debut album and fellow new wave-new romantic act Duran Duran released its first two albums on the label in North America. Australian soft rock band Little River Band and English heavy metal band Iron Maiden&#x27;s first three albums were also released in the US by the label. Pink Floyd switched to Columbia Records in the US after the release of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in 1973.

In the United States, Capitol initially treated Harvest as a separate label that they expected big sales from. After only a few issues, they had few sales to show for their effort and consequently only issued a few releases and numbered them within their standard Capitol LP series (mostly using Harvest for Pink Floyd releases). After this initial short-lived series, Capitol passed on most of the UK Harvest artists.

In 1975, a reissue sub-label was launched called Harvest Heritage. This new label largely compiled material that had been previously released on Harvest from 1969 onward. However, Harvest Heritage also reissued music from late 1960s EMI bands that had never recorded for the label, such as the Gods, Love Sculpture and Tomorrow. Heritage also occasionally released new music, such as &quot;Four Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Legends&quot;, a recording of a 1977 concert by rockabilly veterans Charlie Feathers, Buddy Knox, Jack Scott and Warren Smith.

Most of Harvest&#x27;s European back catalog (including Pink Floyd [see exception below], Deep Purple [pre-1971], Duran Duran, and Iron Maiden) were divested by Universal Music after its takeover of EMI, as part of the Parlophone Label Group. Warner Music Group would buy that part of the catalog in February 2013. Rights to the Australian Harvest recordings, including those from the Saints and Little River Band, were ceded to Universal&#x27;s EMI Recorded Music Australia imprint.

Pink Floyd Records controls the Pink Floyd catalog which licensed the catalog for manufacture and distribution by Warner Music Group for the UK and European markets and by Sony Music Entertainment for North America and the rest of the world.

Capitol Music Group announced its relaunch of the label on 25 February 2013, with former Warner Bros. Records and Dangerbird Records executive Piero Giramonti at the helm. Giramonti is tasked with running the label as an independent label, with the support of Capitol Music Group and Caroline Distribution for distribution, radio promotion and licensing. As of 2013, the Harvest roster consists of TV on the Radio, Arthur Beatrice, Babes, Death Grips, the Olms, Together Pangea, White Lies and Young &amp; Sick.

On 15 January 2014, it was announced that Morrissey and Charlotte OC had signed to Harvest Records.

<doc id="202325" wikidata="Q258394" url="?curid=202325" title="Deep linking">
<text>In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of web content on a website (e.g. &quot;https://example.com/path/page&quot;), rather than the website&#x27;s home page (e.g., &quot;https://example.com&quot;). The URL contains all the information needed to point to a particular item. Deep linking is different from mobile deep linking, which refers to directly linking to in-app content using a non-HTTP URI.

==Deep linking and HTTP==
The technology behind the World Wide Web, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), does not actually make any distinction between &quot;deep&quot; links and any other links—all links are functionally equal. This is intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of so-called &quot;deep&quot; linking is therefore built into the Web technology of HTTP and URLs by default—while a site can attempt to restrict deep links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the World Wide Web Consortium Technical Architecture Group, &quot;any attempt to forbid the practice of deep linking is based on a misunderstanding of the technology, and threatens to undermine the functioning of the Web as a whole&quot;.

==Usage==
Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into their content either because it bypasses advertising on their main pages, passes off their content as that of the linker or, like &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, they charge users for permanently valid links.
Sometimes, deep linking has led to legal action such as in the 1997 case of Ticketmaster versus Microsoft, where Microsoft deep-linked to Ticketmaster&#x27;s site from its Sidewalk service. This case was settled when Microsoft and Ticketmaster arranged a licensing agreement.
Ticketmaster later filed a similar case against Tickets.com, and the judge in this case ruled that such linking was legal as long as it was clear to whom the linked pages belonged. The court also concluded that URLs themselves were not copyrightable, writing: &quot;A URL is simply an address, open to the public, like the street address of a building, which, if known, can enable the user to reach the building. There is nothing sufficiently original to make the URL a copyrightable item, especially the way it is used. There appear to be no cases holding the URLs to be subject to copyright. On principle, they should not be.&quot;

==Deep linking and web technologies==
Websites built on technologies such as Adobe Flash and AJAX often do not support deep linking. This can cause usability problems for visitors to those sites. For example, they may be unable to save bookmarks to individual pages or states of the site, use the web browser forward and back buttons—and clicking the browser refresh button may return the user to the initial page.

However, this is not a fundamental limitation of these technologies. Well-known techniques, and libraries such as SWFAddress and unFocus History Keeper, now exist that website creators using Flash or AJAX can use to provide deep linking to pages within their sites.

== Court rulings ==

Probably the earliest legal case arising out of deep linking was the 1996 Scottish case of &quot;The Shetland Times vs. The Shetland News&quot;, in which the &quot;Times&quot; accused the &quot;News&quot; of appropriating stories on the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; website as its own.

At the beginning of 2006, in a case between the search engine Bixee.com and job site Naukri.com, the Delhi High Court in India prohibited Bixee.com from deep linking to Naukri.com.

The most important and widely cited U.S. opinions on deep linking are the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s rulings in &quot;Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.&quot; and &quot;Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.&quot;. In both cases, the court exonerated the use of deep linking. In the second of these cases, the court explained (speaking of defendant Google, whom Perfect 10 had also sued) why linking is not a copyright infringement under US law:

Google does not…display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user&#x27;s computer screen. Because Google&#x27;s computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any &quot;material objects…in which a work is fixed…and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated&quot; and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user&#x27;s browser to a website publisher&#x27;s computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user&#x27;s computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user&#x27;s browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user&#x27;s computer screen. Google may facilitate the user&#x27;s access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner&#x27;s display rights. …While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.

In December 2006, a Texas court ruled that linking by a motocross website to videos on a Texas-based motocross video production website did not constitute fair use. The court subsequently issued an injunction. This case, SFX Motor Sports Inc., v. Davis, was not published in official reports, but is available at 2006 WL 3616983.

In a February 2006 ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) found systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking by portal site of real estate site not to conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. The Court stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one must assume—and accept—that search engines deep-link to individual pages of one&#x27;s website.

==Legend==
Web site owners who do not want search engines to deep link, or want them only to index specific pages can request so using the Robots Exclusion Standard (codice_1 file). People who favor deep linking often feel that content owners who do not provide a robots.txt file are implying by default that they do not object to deep linking either by search engines or others. People against deep linking often claim that content owners may be unaware of the Robots Exclusion Standard or may not use robots.txt for other reasons. Sites other than search engines can also deep link to content on other sites, so some question the relevance of the Robots Exclusion Standard to controversies about Deep Linking. The Robots Exclusion Standard does not programmatically enforce its directives so it does not prevent search engines and others who do not follow polite conventions from deep linking.

<doc id="202327" wikidata="Q442231" url="?curid=202327" title="Marie Stopes">
<text>Marie Charlotte Carmichael Stopes (15 October 1880 – 2 October 1958) was a British author, palaeobotanist and campaigner for eugenics and women&#x27;s rights. She made significant contributions to plant paleontology and coal classification, and was the first female academic on the faculty of the University of Manchester. With her second husband, Humphrey Verdon Roe, Stopes founded the first birth control clinic in Britain. Stopes edited the newsletter &quot;Birth Control News&quot;, which gave explicit practical advice. Her sex manual &quot;Married Love&quot; (1918) was controversial and influential, and brought the subject of birth control into wide public discourse. Stopes publicly opposed abortion, arguing that the prevention of conception was all that was needed, though her actions in private were at odds with her public pronouncements.

In reaction to her controversial beliefs, Marie Stopes International in 2020 changed its name to &quot;MSI Reproductive Choices&quot; with no other changes.

==Early life and education==
Stopes was born in Edinburgh. Her father, Henry Stopes, was a brewer, engineer, architect and palaeontologist from Colchester. Her mother was Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, a Shakespearean scholar and women&#x27;s rights campaigner from Edinburgh. At six weeks old, her parents took Stopes from Scotland; the family stayed briefly in Colchester then moved to London, where in 1880 her father bought 28 Cintra Park in Upper Norwood. Both of her parents were members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where they had met. At an early age, she was exposed to science and was taken to meetings where she met the famous scholars of the day. At first, she was home-schooled, but from 1892 to 1894 she attended St George&#x27;s School for Girls in Edinburgh. Stopes was later sent to the North London Collegiate School, where she was a close friend of Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn.

Stopes primarily focused on her science career in her 20s and 30s. Stopes attended the University of London in 1900, at University College London as a scholarship student, where she studied botany and geology; she graduated with a first class B.Sc. in 1902 after only two years by attending both day and night schools at Birkbeck, University of London.

Stopes&#x27; father died in 1902 leaving her family in financial ruin. Her paleobotany professor, Francis Oliver, took her under his wing and hired her as his research assistant in early 1903. This is what sparked her interest in paleobotany, building a platform to begin her career.

Oliver was on the verge of debatably one of the greatest finds in paleobotany when he took Stopes on as a research assistant. Initially, it was thought that most of the fossil plants found in Carboniferous Coal Measures were ferns, Stopes was tasked to find the specimens that showed better connection with the seeds of fern fronds. It was discovered that some of the &quot;ferns&quot; bore seeds. &quot;Seed ferns&quot; became known and recognized as the missing link between ferns and conifers. They later became known as the pteridosperm. She was provided the opportunity to work with the world&#x27;s leading experts in paleobotany at the time. Within the same year she won the Gilchrist scholarship from University College London, with the help of Oliver and her geology professor, Edmund Garwood who provided incredible references.

Following this, Stopes earned a D.Sc. degree from University College London, becoming the youngest person in Britain to have done so. In 1903 she published a study of the botany of the recently dried-up Ebbsfleet River. After carrying out research on Carboniferous plants at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and at University College, London, she put the money she received from the Gilchrist Scholarship towards a year&#x27;s worth of funding her study on the reproduction of living cycads at the University of Munich. There, she worked with Karl Goebel, who was a leading paleobotanist on cycads. Stopes used this study as her doctoral dissertation, she presented her dissertation in German and received a PhD in botany in 1904. She was, in 1904, one of the first women to be elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and was appointed a demonstrator in order to teach students. She was also a fellow and occasional lecturer in paleobotany at University College, London until 1920.

== Scientific research ==

At age 23, Stopes secured her first job in the world of academia, holding the post of lecturer in paleobotany at the Victoria University of Manchester from 1904 to 1910; in this capacity she became the first female academic of that university. It was during this period that she met William Boyd-Dawkins and Frederick Ernst Weiss. Dawkins was a friend of her father and a board member at the university and advocated for her teaching position when members of the senate opposed the concept of having a woman teach young men. Stopes was known around the campus as a partier: she would socialize freely with staff, colleagues, and a few students, or &#x27;flirt&#x27;.

During Stopes&#x27; time at Manchester, she studied coal and coal balls and researched the collection of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; (Permian seed ferns). This was an attempt to prove the theory of Eduard Suess concerning the existence of Gondwana or Pangaea. A chance meeting with Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott during one of his fund-raising lectures in 1904 brought a possibility of proving Suess&#x27;s theory. Stopes&#x27;s passion to prove Suess&#x27;s theory led her to discuss the possibility of joining Scott&#x27;s next expedition to Antarctica. She did not join the expedition, but Scott promised to bring back samples of fossils to provide evidence for the theory. Scott died during the 1912 &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition, but fossils of plants from the Queen Maud Mountains found near Scott&#x27;s and his companions&#x27; bodies provided this evidence.

Her study of Carboniferous coal balls with Francis Oliver during her time at University College London proved pivotal, and coupled with Dawkins&#x27; and Weiss&#x27; influence at Victoria University of Manchester, helped spark Stopes&#x27; intrigue in this area of research, aided, in part, by her close proximity to coal seams in the north of England. These seams held calcareous nodules that preserved the anatomical structure of the permineralized peat that formed the coal balls. Her motive behind this research was driven, in part, by the importance of coal to the British Empire as its main source of fuel. The mines for these coal balls were close to Manchester, and Stopes became distinct from other paleobotanists by directly going to these mines and observing the coal on site.

During this period of her research, Stopes first worked with James Lomax, a manufacturer of petrographic thin sections. She and Lomax did not get along; as a result, she decided to work with David Meredith-Seares Watson, one of her undergraduate students. Together, they investigated the coal-bearing strata of northern England. Their findings led them to hypothesize that the coal balls native to the area were formed when marine water permeated carboniferous peat mires. They proved that the coal balls had formed in situ, and the nodules had not been transported, which was being claimed at the time. With the coal balls being closely associated with overlying marine bands, Stopes and Watson came to the conclusion that the carbonate in the coal balls washed into the coal swamps from adjacent seas. This was contested while showcasing at conferences, but eventually the evidence became sustainable enough that this finding became one of the greatest contributions to the field.

Continuing in the vein of coal ball research, Stopes expanded her studies to include those from the Mesozoic era. This represented an exciting new area of study for her, as little evidence of anatomically preserved Mesozoic plants had been found at that time. Seeking advice from other academics in the field, she received leads for areas of potential study in India and Japan, the latter of which would become important later on. The most promising region at that time proved to be much closer to home, and on 22 March 1907, during the middle of a massive heat wave, Stopes and Watson departed for the Jurassic coast of northeast Scotland, to the coal-mining town of Brora, on the Moray Firth.

Stopes theorized that Brora would harbor the type of Mesozoic coal balls she was in search of. This form of geological prediction, &#x27;geoprophesy&#x27; as Stopes called it, is formally known as biostratigraphy, and was originally formulated by 17th century Danish scientist Nicholas Steno. Upon arriving in Brora, they discovered the town&#x27;s coal mining operations were still in full operation, and as a result, were unable to gain access to the mines. Instead, the pair set their sights on the coastline, and despite finding some fossil specimens of interest, were unable to locate any coal balls. Despite this setback, the flora fossils they did recover were the first Middle Jurassic period specimens to be uncovered in that region, and demonstrated a biostratigraphic link between the Scottish and north east English coasts.

After returning home to Manchester in April 1907, Stopes set about processing her Brora discoveries for publication. However, a previous endeavour from the year before would come to bear fruit. During her Brora research, Stopes had been in correspondence with several high-profile geologists of the time, including John Wesley Judd and Albert Charles Seward, and these two men helped Stopes secure her first major grant, which she had applied for in 1906. The purpose of this £85 grant was to allow her to conduct her research into Mesozoic coal balls in Japan, and on 19 May 1907, it was granted by the Royal Society. In six weeks, Stopes concluded her Brora research, and made arrangements to depart for Japan on 3 July 1907. She spent eighteen months at the Imperial University, Tokyo and explored coal mines on Hokkaido for fossilized plants. As with the Brora study, Stopes failed to locate any Mesozoic coal balls in Japan either, but did manage to discover many important fossils, such as the Cretaceous angiosperm floras, which she wrote about in her 1909 article &quot;Plant containing nodules from Japan&quot; for the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, London. She also published her Japanese experiences as a diary, called &quot;Journal from Japan: a daily record of life as seen by a scientist&quot;, in 1910.

In 1910, the Geological Survey of Canada commissioned Stopes to determine the age of the Fern Ledges, a geological structure at Saint John, New Brunswick. It is part of the Early Pennsylvanian epoch Lancaster Formation. Canadian scholars were divided between dating it to the Devonian period or to the Pennsylvanian. Stopes arrived in North America before Christmas to start her research. On 29 December, she met the Canadian researcher Reginald Ruggles Gates in St. Louis, Missouri; they became engaged two days later. Starting her work on the Fern Ledges in earnest in February 1911, she did geological field work and researched at geological collections in museums, and shipped specimens to England for further investigation. The couple married in March and returned to England on 1 April that year. Stopes continued her research. In mid-1912 she delivered her results, finding for the Pennsylvanian period of the Carboniferous. The Government of Canada published her results in 1914. Later that year, her marriage to Gates was annulled.

During the First World War, Stopes was engaged in studies of coal for the British government, which culminated in the writing of &quot;Monograph on the constitution of coal&quot; with R.V. Wheeler in 1918. The success of Stopes&#x27; work on marriage issues and birth control led her to reduce her scholarly work; her last scientific publications were in 1935. According to W. G. Chaloner (2005), &quot;between 1903 and 1935 she published a series of palaeobotanical papers that placed her among the leading half-dozen British palaeobotanists of her time&quot;. Stopes made major contributions to knowledge of the earliest angiosperms, the formation of coal balls and the nature of coal macerals. The classification scheme and terminology she devised for coal are still being used. Stopes also wrote a popular book on palaeobotany, &quot;Ancient Plants&quot; (1910; Blackie, London), in what was called a successful pioneering effort to introduce the subject to non-scientists.

==&quot;Married Love&quot;==
Around the start of her annulment proceedings in 1913, Stopes began to write a book about the way she thought marriage should work. In July 1913, she met Margaret Sanger, who had just given a talk on birth control at a Fabian Society meeting. Stopes showed Sanger her writings and sought her advice about a chapter on contraception. Stopes&#x27;s book was finished by the end of 1913. She offered it to Blackie and Son, who declined. Several publishers refused the book because they thought it too controversial. When Binnie Dunlop, secretary of the Malthusian League, introduced her to Humphrey Verdon Roe—Stopes&#x27;s future second husband—in 1917, she received the boost that helped her publish her book. Roe was a philanthropist interested in birth control; he paid Fifield &amp; Co. to publish the work. The book was an instant success, requiring five editions in the first year, and elevated Stopes to national prominence.

&quot;Married Love&quot; was published on 26 March 1918; that day, Stopes was visiting Humphrey Roe, who had just returned with a broken ankle from service during the First World War after his aeroplane crashed. Less than two months later they were married and Stopes had her first opportunity to practise what she preached in her book. The success of &quot;Married Love&quot; encouraged Stopes to provide a follow-up; the already written &quot;Wise Parenthood: a Book for Married People&quot;, a manual on birth control that was published later that year. Many readers wrote to Stopes for personal advice, which she energetically endeavoured to give.

&quot;Wise Parenthood&quot; was aimed at married women, as Stopes believed birth control to be necessary for married couples to help protect mothers against the exhaustion of excessive childbearing. Although many considered Stopes&#x27; advocacy of birth control to be scandalous, &quot;Wise Parenthood&quot; printed ten editions and was a successful sequel to &quot;Married Love&quot;.

The following year, Stopes published &quot;A Letter to Working Mothers on how to have healthy children and avoid weakening pregnancies&quot;, a condensed version of &quot;Wise Parenthood&quot; aimed at the poor. It was a 16-page pamphlet and was to be distributed free of charge. Stopes&#x27;s intended audience had—until this work—been the middle classes. She had shown little interest in, or respect for, the working classes; the &quot;Letter&quot; was aimed at redressing her bias.

On 16 July 1919, Stopes—pregnant and a month overdue—entered a nursing home. Stopes and the doctors clashed over the method of birth—she was not allowed to give birth on her knees. The child was stillborn; the doctors suggested the incident was due to syphilis, but an examination excluded the possibility. Stopes was furious and said her baby had been murdered. She was 38 years old.

== &quot;Marie Stopes: Her Work and Play&quot; ==
Aylmer Maude, acclaimed writer and Tolstoy expert, was brought into the home of Stopes and Gates in an effort to support their financial needs. While already having a troublesome marriage, Maude&#x27;s interjection in the household only added more tension to the marriage as Stopes&#x27; flirtatious nature caused Gates more jealousy and frustration. Maude and Stopes remained friends long after her separation from Gates in 1914, and the intensity of their relationship was reflected in a letter he wrote immediately prior to her second marriage to Humphrey Roe: &quot;My dearest Una [Maude&#x27;s pet name for Stopes], I have been bothering you with letters recently… Still I cannot let the eve of your &quot;third&quot; marriage pass without sending you my most cordial good wishes and fondest greetings.&quot;

Maude&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Authorized Life of Marie C Stopes&quot;, was published in 1924. The book was not well received (&quot;The Spectator&quot; described it as &quot;a panegyric and not a biography&quot;) and it may even have been written by Stopes herself. When Stopes blamed Maude for the book&#x27;s poor sales, he replied: &quot;you so impressed on me the importance of getting the Life out quickly, and I evidently rushed it to the point of scamping it and failed to correct some of the errors in your rough draft.&quot;

The book was republished in 1933 as &quot;Marie Stopes Her Work and Her Play&quot;. While the later book included an account of the Stopes &quot;v&quot; Sutherland libel trial of 1923, questions have been raised about its credibility. For instance, significant aspects of the story of Stopes&#x27; visit to Professor McIlroy in disguise and being fitted with a cervical cap (the same device about which McIlroy had been so critical during the High Court trial) have been shown to have been fabricated, and McIlroy&#x27;s treatment of Stopes has been shown to have been consistent with her testimony in the High Court.

==&quot;A New Gospel to All Peoples&quot;==
When Stopes had sufficiently recovered, she returned to work in 1920; she engaged in public speaking and responding to letters seeking advice on marriage, sex and birth control. She sent Mrs. E. B. Mayne to disseminate the &quot;Letter to Working Mothers&quot; to the slums of East London. Mayne approached twenty families a day, but after several months she concluded the working class was mistrustful of well-intentioned meddlers.

This lack of success made Stopes contemplate a different approach to taking her message to the poor. A conference of Anglican bishops was due to be held in June; not long before the conference, Stopes had a vision. She called in her secretary and dictated a message addressed to the bishops which began: &quot;My Lords, I speak to you in the name of God. You are his priests. I am his prophet. I speak to you of the mysteries of man and woman.&quot;
In 1922, Stopes wrote &quot;A New Gospel to All Peoples&quot;. The bishops were not receptive; among the resolutions carried during the conference was one aimed against &quot;the deliberate cultivation of sexual union&quot; and another against &quot;indecent literature, suggestive plays and films [and] the open or secret sale of contraceptives&quot;. The Catholic Church&#x27;s reaction was more strident, marking the start of a conflict that lasted the rest of Stopes&#x27;s life.

==Family planning==

In 1917, before meeting Marie Stopes, Humphrey Roe offered to endow a birth control clinic attached to St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Manchester. He proposed all patients would be married and that no abortions would be done, but his offer was declined. This was a serious issue for Roe; after their marriage, he and Stopes planned to open a clinic for poor mothers in London.

Margaret Sanger, another birth-control pioneer, had opened a birth control clinic in New York but the police closed it. In 1920, Sanger proposed opening a clinic in London; this encouraged Stopes to act more constructively, but her plan never materialised. Stopes resigned her lectureship at University College London at the end of 1920 to concentrate on the clinic; she founded the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress, a support organisation for the clinic. Stopes explained that the object of the Society was:

&quot;...to counteract the steady evil which has been growing for a good many years of the reduction of the birth rate just on the part of the thrifty, wise, well-contented, and the generally sound members of our community, and the reckless breeding from the C.3 end, and the semi-feebleminded, the careless, who are proportionately increasing in our community because of the slowing of the birth rate at the other end of the social scale. Statistics show that every year the birth rate from the worst end of our community is increasing in proportion to the birth rate at the better end, and it was in order to try to right that grave social danger that I embarked upon this work.&quot;

On the printed notepaper is a list of prominent supporters which include the militant suffragette Lady Constance Lytton, feminist novelist Vera Brittain, Emily Pethick-Lawrence (former Treasurer of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union), Rev Maude Royden (Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies). Later supporters included eminent economist John Maynard Keynes. Three months later she and Roe opened the Mothers&#x27; Clinic at 61 Marlborough Road, Holloway, North London, on 17 March 1921. The clinic was run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors. It offered mothers birth control advice, taught them birth control methods and dispensed Stopes own &quot;Pro-Race&quot; (and &quot;Racial&quot;) cervical caps.

The free clinic was open to all married women for knowledge about reproductive health. Stopes tried to discover alternatives for families and increase knowledge about birth control and the reproductive system. Options included the cervical cap—which was the most popular—coitus interruptus, and spermicides based on soap and oil. Stopes rediscovered the use of olive oil-soaked sponges as an alternative birth control. Olive oil&#x27;s use as a spermicide dates to Greek and Roman times. Her recipe proved very effective. She tested many of her contraceptives on patients at her clinics.

Stopes became enthusiastic about a contraceptive device called the &quot;gold pin&quot;, which was reportedly successful in America. A few months later, she asked Norman Haire, an Australian doctor, whether he would be interested in running a clinical trial of the device, as she had two correspondents who wanted to use it. Haire had already investigated the device and found it to be dangerous. Haire became involved in another birth control clinic that opened in Walworth in November 1921; later a rivalry between Stopes and Haire erupted in &quot;The Lancet&quot;. Haire brought up the gold-pin episode, even though Stopes&#x27; clinic had never used it. The issue of the gold pin device resurfaced in the Stopes-Sutherland libel case a few years later.

In 1925, the Mothers&#x27; Clinic moved to Central London, where it remains . Stopes gradually built up a small network of clinics across Britain, working to fund them. She opened clinics in Leeds in April 1934; Aberdeen in October 1934; Belfast in October 1936; Cardiff in October 1937; and Swansea in January 1943. She also helped Beatrice Green establish a clinic in Abertillery in 1925.

===The Marie Stopes International organisation===

The clinics continued to operate after Stopes&#x27; death, but by the early 1970s they were in financial difficulties and in 1975 they went into voluntary receivership. Marie Stopes International was established a year later as an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) working on sexual and reproductive health. The global partnership took over responsibility for the main clinic, and in 1978 it began its work overseas in New Delhi, India. Since then the organisation has grown steadily; today it works in 37 countries (2019), has 452 clinics and has offices in London, Brussels, Melbourne and in the US.

===Opposition and libel case===
In 1922, Halliday Sutherland wrote a book called &quot;Birth Control: A Statement of Christian Doctrine Against the Neo Malthusians&quot;. In the inter-war years, the terms &quot;birth control&quot; and &quot;eugenics&quot; were closely related; according to Jane Carey they were &quot;so intertwined as to be synonymous&quot;.

Following attacks on &quot;the essential fallacies of Malthusian teaching&quot;, Sutherland&#x27;s book attacked Stopes. Under the headings &quot;Specially Hurtful to the Poor&quot; and &quot;Exposing the Poor to Experiment&quot;, it read:In the midst of a London slum a woman, who is a doctor of German philosophy (Munich), has opened a Birth Control Clinic, where working women are instructed in a method of contraception described by Professor McIlroy as &#x27;The most harmful method of which I have had experience&#x27;. When we remember that millions are being spent by the Ministry of Health and by Local Authorities – on pure milk for necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, on Maternity Clinics to guard the health of mothers before and after childbirth, for the provision of skilled midwives, and on Infant Welfare Centres – it is truly amazing that this monstrous campaign of birth control should be tolerated by the home secretary. Charles Bradlaugh was condemned to jail for a less serious crime.

Stopes was incensed. The reference to &quot;doctor of German philosophy&quot; sought to undermine Stopes because she was not a medical doctor and, being so soon after the First World War, sought to harness anti-German sentiment. Stopes&#x27;s work had been associated with Charles Bradlaugh, who had been convicted of obscenity 45 years earlier when he had republished an American Malthusian text in Britain, which &quot;advocated and gave explicit information about contraceptive methods&quot;. Stopes challenged Sutherland to a public debate. When Sutherland did not respond, she brought a writ for libel against him. The court case began on 21 February 1923; it was acrimonious. Four questions were put to the jury, which they answered as follows:

#Were the words complained of defamatory of the plaintiff? &quot;Yes&quot;.
#Were they true in substance and in fact? &quot;Yes&quot;.
#Were they fair comment? &quot;No&quot;.
#Damages, if any? &quot;£100&quot;.

Based on the jury&#x27;s verdict, barristers for both sides asked for judgement in their favour, so it came down to legal argument. Sutherland&#x27;s barrister successfully argued that as soon as the jury decided that the statements were true in substance and in fact, that was the end of the matter. It was a moral victory for Stopes as the press saw it, and she appealed. On 20 July, the Court of Appeal reversed the previous decision (2–1), awarding the £100 to Stopes. The Catholic community mobilised to support Sutherland, a Catholic, and Stopes publicly campaigned to raise £10,000. Sutherland made a final appeal to the House of Lords on 21 November 1924, and won; Stopes was ordered to repay the one hundred pounds arising from the previous hearing, and to pay the defendant&#x27;s costs in relation to the appeals to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. The trial had made birth control a public topic and the number of clients visiting the clinic doubled. The Law Lords found in Sutherland&#x27;s favour (4–1) and, despite the fact that the decision was irrevocable, Stopes wrote to the Lord Chancellor to overturn it &quot;so that legal subtleties based on misapprehension may not rob me of my victory&quot;. The cost for Stopes was vast; costs were partially compensated by publicity and book sales.

Stopes was even remembered in a playground rhyme:&lt;poem&gt;
Jeanie, Jeanie, full of hopes,
Read a book by Marie Stopes,
But, to judge from her condition,
She must have read the wrong edition.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Eugenics==

In her biography of &lt;includeonly&gt;Marie &lt;/includeonly&gt;Stopes&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;, June Rose claimed &quot;Marie was an elitist, an idealist, interested in creating a society in which only the best and beautiful should survive,&quot; a view echoed by Richard A. Soloway in the 1996 Galton Lecture: &quot;If Stopes&#x27;s general interest in birth control was a logical consequence of her romantic preoccupation with compatible sexuality within blissful marriage, her particular efforts to provide birth control for the poor had far more to do with her eugenic concerns about the impending &#x27;racial darkness&#x27; that the adoption of contraception promised to illuminate.&quot;

Regarding threats of &quot;dys&quot;genics, she spoke of &quot;that intolerable stream of misery which ever overflows its banks.&quot;

Stopes&#x27;s enthusiasm for eugenics and race improvement was in line with many intellectuals and public figures of the time: for example Havelock Ellis, Cyril Burt and George Bernard Shaw. Eugenic sympathies were drawn from the left and the right of politics and included Labour politicians, such as Ellen Wilkinson. As a child Stopes had met Francis Galton, one of the founders of modern eugenics, through her father. She joined the Eugenics Education Society in 1912 and became a life fellow in 1921. Clare Debenham in her 2018 biography of Stopes argues in Chapter Nine that she was a maverick eugenicist, who was shunned by the inner circle of the Eugenic Society. In 1934, she reflected: &quot;I am a Life Fellow and would have much more interest in the Eugenics Society if I had not been cold shouldered&quot;.

The objects of the Society For Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress expressed the eugenic aims of the Mothers&#x27; Clinic, summarised in Tenet 16:

&quot;In short, we are profoundly and fundamentally a pro-baby organisation, in favour of producing the largest possible number of healthy, happy children without detriment to the mother, and with the minimum wastage of infants by premature deaths. In this connection our motto has been &#x27;Babies in the right place,&#x27; and it is just as much the aim of Constructive Birth Control to secure conception to those married people who are healthy, childless, and desire children, as it is to furnish security from conception to those who are racially diseased, already overburdened with children, or in any specific way unfitted for parenthood.&quot;

&quot;Racially diseased&quot; included conditions such as infectious diseases (like tuberculosis), or caused by environmental factors (such as poor living conditions and malnutrition).

In 1918 and 1920, Stopes advocated the compulsory sterilisation of those she considered unfit for parenthood.

In Chapter XX of her 1920 book &quot;Radiant Motherhood&quot; Stopes discussed race and said that the &quot;one central reform&quot; was: &quot;The power of the mother, consciously exerted in the voluntary procreation and joyous bearing of her children, is the greatest power in the world&quot;. She added that two &quot;main dangers&quot; stood in the way. The first of these was ignorance and the second was the &quot;inborn incapacity which lies in the vast and ever increasing stock of degenerate, feeble-minded and unbalanced who are now in our midst and who devastate social customs. These populate most rapidly and tend proportionately to increase and these are like the parasite upon the healthy tree sapping its vitality.&quot; Stopes then stated that &quot;a few quite simple acts of Parliament&quot; could deal with &quot;this prolific depravity&quot; through sterilisation by x-rays and assured the reader that &quot;when Bills are passed to ensure the sterility of the hopelessly rotten and racially diseased, and to provide for the education of the child-bearing woman so that she spaces her children healthily, our race will rapidly quell the stream of the depraved, hopeless and wretched lives which are at present increasing in proportion in our midst&quot;.

Stopes promoted her eugenic ideas to politicians. In 1920 she sent a copy of her book, &quot;Radiant Motherhood&quot;—arguably the most explicitly eugenic of her books—to the prime minister&#x27;s secretary (and mistress), Frances Stevenson, and urged her to get David Lloyd George to read them. In November 1922, just before the general election, she sent a questionnaire to parliamentary candidates asking that they sign a declaration that: &quot;I agree that the present position of breeding chiefly from the C3 population and burdening and discouraging the A1 is nationally deplorable, and if I am elected to Parliament I will press the Ministry of Health to give such scientific information through the Ante-natal Clinics, Welfare Centres and other institutions in its control as will curtail the C3 and increase the A1&quot;. She received 150 replies.

In July 1931 the Women&#x27;s Co-operative Guild at their conference passed a resolution advocating compulsory sterilisation for the mentally or physically unfit.

A 1933 letter from Stopes to a friend revealed disillusion with eugenics: &quot;I do not think I want to write a book about Eugenics. The word has been so tarnished by some people that they are not going to get my name tacked onto it&quot;. Despite this, she attended the International Congress for Population Science in Berlin in 1935. After attending this conference she came under attack by some of her former supporters such a Guy Aldred and Havelock Ellis and, on her death in 1958, she bequeathed her clinics to the Eugenics Society.

In 1934, an interview published in the &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; disclosed her views on mixed-race marriages: she advised correspondents against them and believed that all half-castes should be sterilized at birth... &quot;thus painlessly and in no way interfering with the individual&#x27;s life, the unhappy fate of he who is neither black nor white is prevented from being passed on to yet unborn babes.&quot;

In August 1939 she sent a copy of her &quot;Love Song for Young Lovers&quot; to Adolf Hitler because &quot;Love is the greatest thing in the world&quot;. She wanted her poems to be distributed through the German birth control clinics. However, according to Rose, any sympathy she may have had with Hitler was dissipated when he closed those clinics. On 12 July 1940 she wrote to Winston Churchill to offer a slogan, &quot;Fight the Battle of Britain in Berlin&#x27;s Air&quot;.

===Views on abortion===
Publicly, Stopes professed to oppose abortion; during her lifetime, her clinics did not offer that service. She single-mindedly pursued abortion providers and used the police and the courts to prosecute them. Stopes thought that the use of contraceptives was the preferred means by which families should voluntarily limit their number of offspring. Nurses at Stopes&#x27; clinic had to sign a declaration not to &quot;impart any information or lend any assistance whatsoever to any person calculated to lead to the destruction &quot;in utero&quot; of the products of conception&quot;. When Stopes learned that one of Avro Manhattan&#x27;s friends had had an abortion, she accused him of murdering the unborn child.

Her public actions were at odds with her private pronouncements. In a 1919 letter, she had outlined a method of abortion to an unidentified correspondent, and she &quot;was even prepared in some cases to advocate abortion, or, as she preferred to put it, the evacuation of the uterus&quot;. In &quot;Wise Parenthood&quot;, she had promoted the &quot;Gold Pin&quot; or &quot;Spring&quot;, which was a &quot;method [that] could be described as an abortifacient&quot;.

==Literary life==
Stopes was acquainted with many literary figures of the day. She had long-standing correspondences with George Bernard Shaw and Aylmer Maude, and argued with H. G. Wells. Noël Coward wrote a poem about her, and she edited Lord Alfred Douglas&#x27; letters. She unsuccessfully petitioned Neville Chamberlain to arrange for Douglas to receive a civil list pension; the petition was signed by Arthur Quiller-Couch, John Gielgud, Evelyn Waugh and Virginia Woolf, among others. The general secretary of the Poetry Society, Muriel Spark, had an altercation with Stopes; according to Mark Bostridge, Spark &quot;found herself lamenting that Stopes&#x27;s mother had not been better informed on [birth control]&quot;.

Stopes wrote poems, plays, and novels; during the First World War she wrote increasingly didactic plays. Her first major success was &quot;Our Ostriches&quot;, a play that dealt with society&#x27;s approach to working class women being forced to produce babies throughout their lives. The play ran for three months at the Royal Court Theatre. It was hurriedly produced in place of &quot;Vectia&quot;, another of Stopes&#x27; plays. &quot;Vectia&quot; is an autobiographical attempt to analyse the failure of Stopes&#x27; first marriage. Because of its themes of sex and impotence, it was denied a licence to be performed, despite Stopes&#x27;s frequent efforts. In 1926, Stopes had &quot;Vectia&quot; printed under the title &quot;A Banned Play and a Preface on Censorship&quot;. In addition to a revival of Our Ostriches in 1930, Stopes produced two other plays for the London stage, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Timothy&quot;, a musical farce produced in 1925–26, and &quot;Buckie&#x27;s Bears&quot;, a children&#x27;s Christmas pageant, allegedly dictated by her son, Henry Roe-Stopes, produced annually between 1931 and 1936.

In collaboration with Joji Sakurai, Stopes produced a translation of three Japanese plays &quot;Plays of Old Japan: The Nō&quot; in 1913.

Stopes published several volumes of poetry, including &quot;Man and Other Poems&quot; (1913), &quot;Love Songs for Young Lovers&quot; (1939), &quot;Oriri&quot; (1940), and &quot;Joy and Verity&quot; (1952). She also published a novel, &quot;Love&#x27;s Creation&quot; (1928), under the semi-pseudonym &quot;Marie Carmichael&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stopes had a relationship, mainly through correspondence, with Japanese botanist Kenjiro Fujii, whom she met at the University of Munich in 1904 while researching her PhD In 1907, during her 1904–1910 tenure at Manchester University, she arranged to research in Japan, allowing her to be with Fujii. The relationship ended.

In 1911, Stopes married Canadian geneticist Reginald Ruggles Gates. She had maintained her name out of principle; her work was blooming while his was struggling. Stopes was part of the Women&#x27;s Freedom League and he was strongly opposed to her support for suffragettes and seemingly, was frustrated. The marriage fell apart amid squabbling over the house and rent. After another year, she sought legal advice about ending the marriage. Not receiving useful help, she read the legal code seeking a way to get a divorce. On 11 May 1913, Stopes filed for divorce on the grounds that the marriage had never been consummated. Gates left England the following year and did not contest the divorce, although he disputed Stopes&#x27;s claims, describing her as &quot;super-sexed to a degree that was almost pathological&quot;. He added to this &quot;I could have satisfied the desires of any normal woman&quot;.
In 1918 she married Humphrey Verdon Roe, the financial backer of her most famous work, &quot;Married Love: A New Contribution to the Solution of the Sex Difficulties&quot;. Their son, Harry Stopes-Roe, was born in 1924.

In 1923, Marie Stopes bought the Old Higher Lighthouse on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, as an escape from the difficult climate of London during her court case against Halliday Sutherland. The island&#x27;s Jurassic fossil forests provided her with endless interest. She founded and curated the Portland Museum, which opened in 1930. The cottage housing the museum was an inspiration behind &quot;The Well-Beloved&quot;, a novel by Thomas Hardy, who was a friend of Marie Stopes.

In the 1940s, Stopes disliked Harry&#x27;s companion, Mary Eyre Wallis, who was the daughter of the noted engineer Barnes Wallis. When Harry announced their engagement in October 1947, his mother set about &quot;to try to sabotage the union&quot;. She found fault with Mary and wrote to Mary&#x27;s father to complain. She tried to get Humphrey&#x27;s support against the marriage, arguing that any grandchildren might inherit Mary&#x27;s myopia. He was not persuaded. Later, believing &quot;he had betrayed her by this marriage&quot;, Stopes cut him out of any substantial inheritance.

Stopes died on 2 October 1958, aged 77, from breast cancer at her home in Dorking, Surrey. Her will left her clinic to the Eugenics Society; most of her estate went to the Royal Society of Literature. Her son Harry received her copy of the &quot;Greater Oxford Dictionary&quot; and other small items. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Stopes at 28 Cintra Park, Upper Norwood, where she lived from 1880 to 1892.

<doc id="202336" wikidata="Q2173097" url="?curid=202336" title="Rudolf Ising">
<text>Rudolf Carl &quot;Rudy&quot; Ising ( ; August 7, 1903 – July 18, 1992) was an American animator best known for collaborating with Hugh Harman to establish the Warner Bros. and MGM Cartoon studios during the early years of the golden age of American animation. In 1940, Ising produced William Hanna and Joseph Barbera&#x27;s first cartoon, &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, a cartoon featuring characters later known as Tom and Jerry.

==Personal life==
Rudolf Carl Ising was born in Kansas City, Missouri on August 7, 1903.

He was married twice, first to Maxine Jennings between 1936 until their divorce in 1940, and later to Cynthia Westlake from 1941 until his death, with whom he had a son, Rudolf Ising, Jr.

Ising died of cancer in Newport Beach on 18 July 1992 and is buried at Pacific View Memorial Park in California.

==Career==
Ising spent his teenage years working at a photographic studio before joining Walt Disney&#x27;s Laugh-O-Gram studio alongside other Kansas City youths. He soon became close friends with Hugh Harman, with whom he attempted to do a series of Arabian Nights-inspired cartoons after Disney left for Hollywood in the wake of the bankruptcy of his original studio before rejoining him in 1923 to work in his Alice Comedies. After Disney had a falling out with Charles Mintz over budgets in 1928, Ising, alongside most of the crew, opted to join the latter to continue the production of Disney&#x27;s Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons.

Following Universal&#x27;s terminating Mintz&#x27;s contract in 1929, Ising and Harman created their own cartoon studio which made a brief audition film featuring Bosko, a character created by Harman. In this film, Ising portrays a cartoonist who draws Bosko, who constantly pesters him before being sent back into the inkwell. Soon thereafter, Harman-Ising Pictures gained a contract with Leon Schlesinger at Warner Bros. to produce cartoons beginning with 1930&#x27;s &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;, which launched the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. Ising eventually directed the first &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; beginning in 1931, this being a series of heavily musical cartoons that initially featured recurring characters, the first of which, Foxy, bore such a resemblance to Mickey Mouse that Walt Disney asked Ising to stop using the character after three shorts. His voice was often featured on several of these early cartoons, mostly as deep-voiced villains or caricaturing celebrities of the era.

Budgetary disagreements severed Harman-Ising Pictures&#x27; relationship with Schlesinger by 1933, after which the company outsourced a number of cartoons for Van Beuren Studios. In 1934, they signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to create a new series of cartoons under the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; moniker. Just like they had done at WB, Ising made one-shot musical comedies while Harman mostly directed shorts featuring a revamped Bosko. Ising&#x27;s &quot;The Old Plantation&quot;, released in September 1935, was the first non-Disney cartoon filmed in the new three-strip Technicolor process after Disney&#x27;s exclusive contract lapsed (not counting Ted Esbaugh&#x27;s unreleased &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; cartoon in 1933).

MGM fired Harman and Ising in 1937 over money disputes, only to hire them back the following year after the failure of its in-house studio&#x27;s first projects. As the duo&#x27;s brand of cartoons featuring cutesy characters with light plots fell out of favor by the end of the 1930s, Ising opted to adapt with the times and created Barney Bear, based partly on himself, which first appeared in &quot;The Bear that Couldn&#x27;t Sleep&quot;. Among those who worked in his unit were George Gordon, Mexican cartoonist Gus Arriola, Jerry Brewer, Bob Allen, and a recently-formed duo of animators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, whose first directoral foray, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, which introduced the cat-and-mouse pair later known as Tom and Jerry, featured Ising as producer (being the only credited person in the short). He also produced &quot;The Milky Way&quot; that year, the first non-Disney cartoon to win an Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject.

In 1943, Ising left MGM to join the Army Air Forces film unit as animation supervisor. After the war, he formed his own production company, hiring Hugh Harman in 1951 after his studio (formed after leaving Metro in 1942) folded, reestablishing Harman-Ising Studios.

His final major work was a failed TV pilot named Sir Gee Whiz on the Other Side of The Moon in 1960. Harman-Ising Studios closed in the early 1960s, after which Ising took to painting, mostly to give Harman, who endured dire financial straits, some financial support. After decades of relative obscurity, the now semi-retired Ising became a well-known name to animation fans through interviews made by Mark Kausler among other historians, also being honored by the International Animation Society In 1976.

<doc id="202337" wikidata="Q36831" url="?curid=202337" title="Chagatai language">
<text>Chagatai (, ), also known as Turki, Eastern Turkic, or Chagatai Turkic (), is an extinct Turkic language that was once widely spoken across Central Asia. It remained the shared literary language in the region until the early 20th century. It was used across a wide geographic area including western or Russian Turkestan (i.e. parts of modern-day Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan), Eastern Turkestan (where a dialect, known as Kaşğar tılı, developed), Crimea, the Volga region (such as Tatarstan and Bashkortostan), etc. Chagatai is the ancestor of the Uzbek and Uyghur languages. Turkmen, which is not within the Karluk branch but in the Oghuz branch of Turkic languages, was nonetheless heavily influenced by Chagatai for centuries.

Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i was the greatest representative of Chagatai literature.

Chagatai literature is still studied in modern Uzbekistan, where the language is seen as the predecessor and the direct ancestor of modern Uzbek, and the literature is regarded as part of the national heritage of Uzbekistan.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Chagatai&quot; relates to the Chagatai Khanate (1225–1680s), a descendant empire of the Mongol Empire left to Genghis Khan&#x27;s second son, Chagatai Khan. Many of the Turkic peoples, 
who spoke this language claimed political descent from the Chagatai Khanate.

As part of the preparation for the 1924 establishment of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, Chagatai was officially renamed &quot;Old Uzbek&quot;, which Edward A. Allworth argued &quot;badly distorted the literary history of the region&quot; and was used to give authors such as Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i an Uzbek identity. It was also referred to as &quot;Turki&quot; or &quot;Sart&quot; in Russian colonial sources. In China, it is sometimes called &quot;ancient Uyghur&quot;.

==History==

In the twentieth century, the study of Chaghatay suffered from nationalist bias. In the former Chaghatay area, separate republics have been claiming Chaghatay as the ancestor of their own brand of Turkic. Thus, Old Uzbek, Old Uyghur, Old Tatar, Old Turkmen, and a Chaghatay-influenced layer in sixteenth-century Azerbaijanian have been studied separately from each other. There has been a tendency to disregard certain characteristics of Chaghatay itself, e.g. its complex syntax copied from Persian.
Chagatai developed in the late 15th century. It belongs to the Karluk branch of the Turkic language family. It is descended from Middle Turkic, which served as a lingua franca in Central Asia, with a strong infusion of Arabic and Persian words and turns of phrase.

Mehmet Fuat Köprülü divides Chagatay into the following periods:
# Early Chagatay (13th–14th centuries)
# Pre-classical Chagatay (the first half of the 15th century)
# Classical Chagatay (the second half of the 15th century)
# Continuation of Classical Chagatay (16th century)
# Decline (17th–19th centuries)

The first period is a transitional phase characterized by the retention of archaic forms; the second phase began with the publication of Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i&#x27;s first &quot;divan&quot; and is the highpoint of Chagatai literature, followed by the third phase, which is characterized by two bifurcating developments. One is preservation of the classical Chagatai language of Nava&#x27;i, the other the increasing influence of dialects of the local spoken languages.

==Influence on later Turkic languages==
Uzbek and Uyghur, two modern languages descended from Chagatai, are the closest to it. Uzbeks regard Chagatai as the origin of their language and Chagatai literature as part of their heritage. In 1921 in Uzbekistan, then a part of the Soviet Union, Chagatai was initially intended to be the national and governmental language of the Uzbek SSR. However, when it became evident that the language was too archaic for that purpose, it was replaced by a new literary language based on a series of Uzbek dialects.

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; records the use of the word &quot;Chagatai&quot; in Afghanistan to describe the &quot;Tekke&quot; dialect of Turkmen. Up to and including the eighteenth century, Chagatai was the main literary language in Turkmenistan and most of Central Asia. While it had some influence on Turkmen, the two languages belong to different branches of the Turkic language family.

==Literature==
===15th and 16th centuries===
The most famous of Chagatai poets, Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i, among other works wrote &quot;Muhakamat al-Lughatayn&quot;, a detailed comparison of the Chagatai and Persian languages. Here, Nava’i argued for the superiority of the former for literary purposes. His fame is attested by the fact that Chagatai is sometimes called &quot;Nava&#x27;i&#x27;s language&quot;. Among prose works, Timur&#x27;s biography is written in Chagatai, as is the famous &quot;Baburnama&quot; (or &quot;Tuska Babure&quot;) of Babur, the Timurid founder of the Mughal Empire. A &quot;Divan&quot; attributed to Kamran Mirza is written in Persian and Chagatai, and one of Bairam Khan&#x27;s &quot;Divans&quot; was written in Chagatai.

The following is a prime example of the 16th-century literary Chagatai Turkic, employed by Babur in one of his ruba&#x27;is.
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
I am become a desert wanderer for Islam,
Having joined battle with infidels and Hindus
I readied myself to become a martyr,
God be thanked I am become a ghazi.&lt;/poem&gt;

Uzbek ruler Muhammad Shaybani Khan wrote a prose essay called &quot;Risale-yi maarif-i Shaybāni&quot; in Chagatai in 1507, shortly after his capture of Greater Khorasan, and dedicated it to his son, Muhammad Timur. The manuscript of his philosophical and religious work, &quot;Bahr ul-Khuda&quot;, written in 1508, is located in London 

Ötemish Hajji wrote a history of the Golden Horde entitled the &quot;Tarikh-i Dost Sultan&quot; in Khwarazm.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In terms of literary production, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are often seen as a period of decay. It is a period in which Chagatai lost ground to Persian. Important writings in Chagatai from the period between the 17th and 18th centuries include those of Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur: &quot;Shajara-i Tarākima&quot; (Genealogy of the Turkmens) and &quot;Shajara-i Turk&quot; (Genealogy of the Turks). Abu al-Ghāzī is motivated by functional considerations and describes his choice of language and style in the sentence ‘I did not use one word of Chaghatay (!), Persian or Arabic’. As is clear from his actual language use, he aims at making himself understood to a broader readership by avoiding too ornate a style, notably saj’, rhymed prose. In the second half of the 18th century, Turkmen poet Magtymguly Pyragy also introduced the use of classical Chagatai into Turkmen literature as a literary language, incorporating many Turkmen linguistic features.

Bukharan ruler Subhan Quli Khan (1680–1702) was the author of a work on medicine, &quot;Subkhankuli&#x27;s revival of medicine&quot; (&quot;Ihya at-tibb Subhani&quot;) which was written in the Central Asian Turkic language (Chaghatay) and is devoted to the description of diseases, their recognition and treatment. One of the manuscript lists is kept in the library in Budapest.

===19th and 20th centuries===
Prominent 19th-century Khivan writers include Shermuhammad Munis and his nephew Muhammad Riza Agahi. Muhammad Rahim Khan II of Khiva also wrote ghazals. Musa Sayrami&#x27;s &quot;Tārīkh-i amniyya&quot;, completed in 1903, and its revised version &quot;Tārīkh-i ḥamīdi&quot;, completed in 1908, represent the best sources on the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in Xinjiang.

===Dictionaries and grammars===
The following are books written on the Chagatai language by natives and westerners:

* &quot;Vocabularium Linguae Giagataicae Sive Igureae&quot; (&quot;Lexico Ćiagataico&quot;)
* Muḥammad Mahdī Khān, &quot;Sanglakh&quot;.
* Abel Pavet de Courteille, &quot;Dictionnaire turk-oriental&quot; (1870).
* Ármin Vámbéry 1832–1913, &quot;Ćagataische Sprachstudien, enthaltend grammatikalischen Umriss, Chrestomathie, und Wörterbuch der ćagataischen Sprache&quot;; (1867).
* Sheykh Süleymān Efendi, &quot;Čagataj-Osmanisches Wörterbuch: Verkürzte und mit deutscher Übersetzung versehene Ausgabe&quot; (1902).
* Sheykh Süleymān Efendi, &quot;Lughat-ï chaghatay ve turkī-yi &#x27;othmānī&quot; (Dictionary of Chagatai and Ottoman Turkish).

* Abel Pavet de Courteille, &quot;Mirâdj-nâmeh : récit de l&#x27;ascension de Mahomet au ciel, composé a.h. 840 (1436/1437), texte turk-oriental, publié pour la première fois d&#x27;après le manuscript ouïgour de la Bibliothèque nationale et traduit en français, avec une préf. analytique et historique, des notes, et des extraits du Makhzeni Mir Haïder&quot;.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===

Sounds /f, ʃ, χ, v, z, ɡ, ʁ, d͡ʒ, ʔ, l/ do not occur in initial position of words of Turkish origin.

===Vowels===

Vowel length is distributed among five vowels /iː, eː, ɑː, oː, uː/.

== Orthography ==
Chagatai has been a literary language and is written with a variation of the Perso-Arabic alphabet. This variation is known as Kona Yëziq, (). It saw usage for Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uyghur, and Uzbek.

===Notes===
The letters ف، ع، ظ، ط، ض، ص، ژ، ذ، خ، ح، ث، ء are only used in loanwords and do not represent any additional phonemes.

For Kazakh and Kyrgyz, letters in parentheses () indicate a modern borrowed pronunciation from Tatar that is not consistent with historic Kazakh and Kyrgyz treatments of these letters

===Influence===
Many orthographies, particularly that of Turkic languages, are based on Kona Yëziq. Examples include the alphabets of South Azerbaijani, Qashqai, Chaharmahali, Khorasani, Uyghur, Äynu, and Khalaj. Virtually all other Turkic languages have a history of being written with an alphabet descended from Kona Yëziq, however, due to various writing reforms conducted by Turkey and the Soviet Union, many of these languages now are written in either the Latin script or the Cyrillic script.

The Qing dynasty commissioned dictionaries on the major languages of China which included Chagatai Turki, such as the Pentaglot Dictionary.

== Grammar ==
=== Word order ===
The basic word order of Chagatai is SOV. Chagatai is a head-final language where the adjectives come before nouns. Other words such as those denoting location, time, etc. usually appear in the order of emphasis put on them.

=== Vowel and consonant harmony ===
Like other Turkic languages, Chagatai has vowel harmony (though Uzbek, despite being a direct descendant of Chaghatai, notably doesn&#x27;t ever since the spelling changes under USSR; vowel harmony being present in the orthography of the Uzbek perso-arabic script). There are mainly eight vowels, and vowel harmony system works upon vowel backness.

The vowels [i] and [e] are central or front-central/back-central and therefore are considered both. Usually these will follow two rules in inflection: [i] and [e] almost always follow the front vowel inflections; and, if the stem contains [q] or [ǧ], which are formed in the back of the mouth, back vowels are more likely in the inflection.

These affect the suffixes that are applied to words.

Consonant harmony is relatively less common and only appears in a few suffixes such as the genitive.

=== Number ===
Plural is formed by adding the suffix -لار (-lar/lär). There are two pronunciations which exist due vowel harmony rules. If the vowel of the last syllable is a front syllable ([a], [o], [u]) -lar is used. If the vowel is a back vowel ([ä], [ö], [ü]) or [i] and [e], -lär is used. In rare circumstances -lar is sometimes written as -لر, though generally the suffix -لار is used for both the pronunciations /-lär/ and /-lar/. Or in the case of Kazakh and Kyrgyz /-ler/ and /-lar/.

=== Cases ===
Chagatai has six different cases. The nominative and sometimes the accusative does not have any special making.

=== Pronouns ===
==== Personal Pronouns ====
There are seven Chagatai personal pronouns, as there are formal and informal forms of the second person singular form. Unlike other languages these pronouns do not differ between genders. Each of these pronouns have suffixes added to end of verbs as conjugation.

<text>Crusader Rabbit is an American animated series created by Alexander Anderson and Jay Ward, and the first of its kind to be produced specifically for television. Its main characters were Crusader Rabbit and his sidekick Ragland T. Tiger, or &quot;Rags&quot;. The stories were four-minute-long satirical cliffhangers.

The concept was test marketed in 1948, while the initial serial – &quot;Crusader vs. the State of Texas&quot; – aired on KNBH in Los Angeles beginning on August 1, 1950 (not August 1, 1949 as some sources erroneously state). The program was syndicated from 1950 to 1951 for 195 episodes, then was revived in 1959 for 260 color episodes. Ward, who later went on to create &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;, was involved as business manager and producer.

==Production history==
The concept of a cartoon series made exclusively for television came from animator Alex Anderson, who worked for Terrytoons Studios. Terrytoons turned down Anderson&#x27;s proposed series, preferring to remain in theatrical film animation. Consequently, Anderson approached Jay Ward to create a partnership – Anderson being in charge of production and Ward arranging financing. Ward became business manager and producer, joining with Anderson to form &quot;Television Arts Productions&quot; in 1947.

They tried to sell the series – initially presented as part of a proposed series, &quot;The Comic Strips of Television&quot;, which featured an earlier incarnation of &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot; – to the NBC TV network, with Jerry Fairbanks as the network&#x27;s &quot;supervising producer&quot;. NBC didn&#x27;t broadcast &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot;, but allowed Fairbanks to sell the series in national syndication with many NBC affiliates, including those in New York and Los Angeles, picking it up for local showings. WNBC-TV in New York continued to show the original &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; episodes from 1950 - 1967, and some stations used the program as late as the 1970s.

The original series employed limited animation, appearing almost as narrated storyboards with frequent cuts and minor movement by the characters, much in the style of another early NBC animated program, &quot;Tele-Comics&quot;. This was due to the limited budget that producers Jay Ward and Alex Anderson worked with to film the series.

In 1948 Clarence E. Wheeler created the original opening and closing theme for the animated series, adapting and composing the folk melodies &quot;The Trail to Mexico&quot; (known on cue sheets as &quot;Rabbit Fanfare&quot;) and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (known as &quot;Main Title Rabbit&quot;). Each program began with a title sequence of a mounted knight galloping across the screen. The episodes then featured a short, usually satirical, adventure in the form of a movie serial, ending with a cliffhanger.

&quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; was syndicated from 1950 to 1952, totaling 195 episodes (divided into 10 &quot;crusades&quot;), and then re-aired for many years. It featured Crusader Rabbit, his companion Ragland T. Tiger (&quot;Rags&quot;), and their occasional nemeses – Dudley Nightshade (whose name was a play on the poisonous plant &quot;deadly nightshade&quot;) and Whetstone Whiplash with his sidekick, Bilious Green. Some episodes featured Crusader&#x27;s and Rags&#x27; friend Garfield the Groundhog. Ragland Tiger&#x27;s name was a pun on the jazz tune &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;; his middle initial &quot;T&quot; stood for The (as in Rags The Tiger). As a running gag, another character would ask Rags what the &quot;T&quot; stood for, to which he would reply, &quot;Larry. My father couldn&#x27;t spell!&quot;

The series was revived and 13 new &quot;crusades&quot; (totaling 260 color episodes) were produced in 1956 by Shull Bonsall&#x27;s Capital Enterprises. Bonsall purchased Television Arts Productions and gained the rights to &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; during a protracted legal battle between Jay Ward, Alex Anderson, Jerry Fairbanks and the NBC network over ownership of the series. Animation was provided by Bonsall&#x27;s Creston Studios, also known as TV Spots, Inc., supervised by Bob Ganon and Gerald Ray. The new series was not seen until early 1959.

The revived (2nd) series used an opening and closing theme from the British &quot;Impress&quot; production music library licensed by Emil Ascher publishing of New York. It was titled &quot;Juggins&quot;, and was composed by Van Phillips, the professional name of Alexander Van Cleve Phillips.

Lucille Bliss provided the voice of Crusader Rabbit in the original series; she was replaced by Ge Ge Pearson in the revived series. Vern Louden played Rags in both. Dudley Nightshade was voiced by Russ Coughlan, and narration was by Roy Whaley.

==Legacy==
The success of &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; inspired many more television cartoon character packages. Jay Ward would later produce &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

==Home video==
In 1985, Rhino Entertainment released the first two volumes of &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; in a planned home video release of all the original episodes. However, 20th Century Fox claimed the distribution rights by their acquisition of previous owner Metromedia Producers Corporation. 20th Television currently owns the distribution rights of the show.

In 2009, AudioTape, Inc. released a three-DVD set of 11 &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; serials; two from the black-and-white era (including &quot;Crusader Rabbit Vs. the State of Texas&quot;) and nine from the color era.

==In popular culture==
* There were two Dell Publishing comic books featuring &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; and Rags.
* In 2009, Lulu.com published &quot;Where Is Crusader Rabbit Now That We Really Need Him?&quot;, a biographical novel about soldiers in the Vietnam War by William K. Millar Jr.
* A &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; episode mentions a Crusader Rabbit sweatshirt in the lost and found.
* In interviews, James Garner frequently (with tongue in cheek) compared his television characters of Bret Maverick, Nichols, and Jim Rockford to Crusader Rabbit, for their tendencies to get involved in somewhat ridiculous situations, while surrounded by companions who were often flaky, unreliable, or comically inept.

<doc id="202343" wikidata="Q219551" url="?curid=202343" title="Ferruccio Busoni">
<text>Ferruccio Busoni (1 April 1866 – 27 July 1924) was an Italian composer, pianist, conductor, editor, writer, and teacher. His international career and reputation led him to work closely with many of the leading musicians, artists and literary figures of his time, and he was a sought-after keyboard instructor and a teacher of composition.

From an early age, Busoni was an outstanding, if sometimes controversial, pianist. He studied at the Vienna Conservatory and then with Wilhelm Mayer and Carl Reinecke. After brief periods teaching in Helsinki, Boston, and Moscow, he devoted himself to composing, teaching, and touring as a virtuoso pianist in Europe and the United States. His writings on music were influential, and covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics. He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland.

He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style, but after 1907, when he published his &quot;Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music&quot;, he developed a more individual style, often with elements of atonality. His visits to America led to interest in North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected in some of his works. His compositions include works for piano, among them a monumental Piano Concerto, and transcriptions of the works of others, notably Johann Sebastian Bach (published as the Bach-Busoni Editions). He also wrote chamber music, vocal and orchestral works, and operas—one of which, &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, he left unfinished when he died, in Berlin, at the age of 58.

== Biography ==

===Early career===

Ferruccio Dante Benvenuto Busoni was born on 1 April 1866 in the Tuscan town of Empoli, the only child of two professional musicians, Ferdinando, a clarinettist, and Anna (née Weiss), a pianist. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to Trieste. A child prodigy, largely taught by his father, he began performing and composing at the age of seven. In an autobiographical note he comments &quot;My father knew little about the pianoforte and was erratic in rhythm, so he made up for these shortcomings with an indescribable combination of energy, severity and pedantry.&quot; Busoni made his public debut as a pianist in a concert with his parents at the Schiller-Verein in Trieste on 24 November 1873 playing the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Sonata in C major, and pieces by Schumann and Clementi. Commercially promoted by his parents in a series of further concerts, Busoni later said of this period, &quot;I never had a childhood.&quot; In 1875, he made his concerto début playing Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 24.

From the ages of nine to eleven, with the help of a patron, Busoni studied at the Vienna Conservatory. His first performances in Vienna were glowingly received by the critic Eduard Hanslick. In 1877, Busoni heard the playing of Franz Liszt, and was introduced to the composer, who admired his skill. In the following year, Busoni composed a four-movement concerto for piano and string quartet. After leaving Vienna, he had a brief period of study in Graz with Wilhelm Mayer, and conducted a performance of his own composition &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, Op. 55 in the composer&#x27;s initial numbering sequence, (BV 119, now lost) in 1879. Other early pieces were published at this time, including settings of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (Opp. 1 and 2; BV 67) and some piano pieces.
He was elected in 1881 to the Accademia Filharmonica of Bologna, the youngest person to receive this honour since Mozart. In the mid 1880s, Busoni was based in Vienna, where he met with Karl Goldmark and helped to prepare the vocal score for the latter&#x27;s 1886 opera &quot;Merlin&quot;. He also met Johannes Brahms, to whom he dedicated two sets of piano &quot;Études&quot;, and who recommended he undertake study in Leipzig with Carl Reinecke. During this period, Busoni supported himself by giving recitals, and also by the financial support of a patron, the Baronin von Tedesco. He also continued to compose, and made his first attempt at an opera, &quot;Sigune&quot;, which he worked on from 1886 to 1889 before abandoning it. He described how, finding himself penniless in Leipzig, he appealed to the publisher Schwalm to take his compositions. Schwalm demurred, but said he would commission a fantasy on Peter Cornelius&#x27;s opera &quot;The Barber of Baghdad&quot; for fifty marks down, and a hundred on completion. The next morning, Busoni turned up at Schwalm&#x27;s office, and asked for 150 marks, handing over the completed work, and saying &quot;I worked from nine at night to three thirty, without a piano, and not knowing the opera beforehand.&quot;

===Helsingfors, Moscow, and America (1888–1893)===

In 1888, the musicologist Hugo Riemann recommended Busoni to Martin Wegelius, director of the Institute of Music at Helsingfors (now Helsinki, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire), for the vacant position of advanced piano instructor. This was Busoni&#x27;s first permanent post. Amongst his close colleagues and associates there were the conductor and composer Armas Järnefelt, the writer Adolf Paul, and the composer Jean Sibelius, with whom he struck up a continuing friendship. Paul described Busoni at this time as &quot;a small, slender Italian with chestnut beard, grey eyes, young and gay, with ... a small round cap perched proudly on his thick artist&#x27;s curls&quot;.

Between 1888 and 1890, Busoni gave about thirty piano recitals and chamber concerts in Helsingfors; amongst his compositions at this period were a set of Finnish folksongs for piano duet (Op. 27). In 1889, visiting Leipzig, he heard a performance on the organ of Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565), and was persuaded by his pupil Kathi Petri—the mother of his future pupil Egon Petri, then only five years old—to transcribe it for piano. Busoni&#x27;s biographer Edward Dent writes that &quot;This was not only the beginning of [his] transcriptions, but ... the beginning of that style of pianoforte touch and technique which was entirely [Busoni&#x27;s] creation.&quot; Returning to Helsingfors, in March of the same year Busoni met his future wife, Gerda Sjöstrand, the daughter of the Swedish sculptor Carl Eneas Sjöstrand, and proposed to her within a week. He composed &quot;Kultaselle&quot; (&quot;To the Beloved&quot;) for cello and piano for her (BV 237; published in 1891 without an opus number).

In 1890, Busoni published his first edition of Bach works: the two- and three-part &quot;Inventions&quot;. In the same year he won the prize for composition, with his &quot;Konzertstück&quot; (&quot;Concert Piece&quot;) for piano and orchestra, Op. 31a (BV 236), at the first Anton Rubinstein Competition, initiated by Anton Rubinstein himself at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. As a consequence he was invited to visit and teach at the Moscow Conservatoire. Gerda joined him in Moscow where they promptly married. His first concert in Moscow, when he performed Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto, was warmly received. But living in Moscow did not suit the Busonis for both financial and professional reasons; he felt excluded by his nationalistically-inclined Russian colleagues. So when Busoni received an approach from William Steinway to teach at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, he was happy to take the opportunity, particularly since the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at that time was Arthur Nikisch, whom he had known since 1876 when they performed together at a concert in Vienna.

Busoni&#x27;s first son, Benvenuto (known as Benni), was born in Boston in 1892, but Busoni&#x27;s experience at New England Conservatory proved unsatisfactory. After a year he resigned from the Conservatory and launched himself into a series of recitals across the Eastern US.

===Berlin, 1893–1913: &quot;A new epoch&quot;===

Busoni was at the Berlin premiere of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Falstaff&quot; in April 1893. The result was to force on him a re-evaluation of the potential of Italian musical traditions which he had so far ignored in favour of the German traditions, and in particular the models of Brahms and the orchestral techniques of Liszt and Wagner. Busoni immediately began to draft an adulatory letter to Verdi (which he never summoned the courage to send), in which he addressed him as &quot;Italy&#x27;s leading composer&quot; and &quot;one of the noblest persons of our time&quot;, and in which he explained that &quot;&quot;Falstaff&quot; provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that I can ... date the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life from that time.&quot;

In 1894, Busoni settled in Berlin, which he henceforth regarded as his home base, except during the years around World War I. He had earlier felt unsympathetic toward the city: in an 1889 letter to Gerda he had described it as &quot;this Jewish city that I hate, irritating, idle, arrogant, &quot;&quot;&quot;. The city was swiftly growing in population and influence during this period and determined to stake itself as the musical capital of the united Germany, but as Busoni&#x27;s friend the English composer Bernard van Dieren pointed out, &quot;international &quot;virtuosi&quot; who for practical reasons chose Berlin as their abode were not so much concerned with questions of prestige&quot;, and for Busoni the city&#x27;s development as &quot;the centre of the musical industry [was to] develop an atmosphere which [Busoni] detested more than the deepest pool of stagnant convention&quot;.

Berlin proved an excellent base for Busoni&#x27;s European tours. As in the previous two years in the US, the composer had to depend for his living on exhausting but remunerative tours as a piano virtuoso; in addition at this period he was remitting substantial amounts to his parents, who continued to depend on his income. Busoni&#x27;s programming and style as a recitalist initially raised concerns in some of Europe&#x27;s musical centres. His first concerts in London, in 1897, met with mixed comments. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; reported that he &quot;commenced in a manner to irritate the genuine amateurs [i.e. music-lovers] by playing a ridiculous travesty of one of Bach&#x27;s masterly Organ Preludes and Fugues, but he made amends by an interpretation of Chopin&#x27;s Studies (Op. 25) which was of course unequal but, on the whole, interesting&quot;. In Paris, the critic Arthur Dandelot commented &quot;this artist has certainly great qualities of technique and charm&quot;, but strongly objected to his addition of chromatic passages to parts of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;St. François de Paule marchant sur les flots&quot;.

Busoni&#x27;s international reputation rose swiftly, and he frequently performed in Berlin and other European capitals and regional centres (including Manchester, Birmingham, Marseilles, Florence, and many German and Austrian cities) throughout this period, as well as returning to America for four visits between 1904 and 1915. This journeying life led van Dieren to call him &quot;a musical Ishmael&quot; (after the Biblical wanderer). The musicologist Antony Beaumont considers Busoni&#x27;s six Liszt recitals in Berlin of 1911 as the climax of his pre-war career as a pianist.

Busoni&#x27;s performing commitments somewhat stifled his creative capacity during this period: in 1896 he wrote &quot;I have great success as a pianist, the composer I conceal for the present.&quot; His monumental Piano Concerto (whose five movements last over an hour and include an offstage male chorus) was written between 1901 and 1904. In 1904 and 1905, the composer wrote his &quot;Turandot Suite&quot; as incidental music for Carlo Gozzi&#x27;s play of the same name. A major project undertaken at this time was the opera &quot;Die Brautwahl&quot;, based on a tale by E. T. A. Hoffmann, first performed (to a lukewarm reception) in Berlin in 1912. Busoni also began to produce solo piano works that clearly revealed a more mature style, including the &quot;Elegies&quot; (BV 249; 1907), the suite &quot;An die Jugend&quot; (BV 252; 1909) and the first two piano sonatinas, BV 257 (1910) and BV 259 (1912).

In a series of orchestral concerts in Berlin between 1902 and 1909, both as pianist and conductor, Busoni particularly promoted contemporary music from outside Germany (though he avoided contemporary music, except for his own, in his solo recitals). The series, which was held at the &quot;Beethovensaal&quot; (Beethoven Hall), included German premieres of music by Edward Elgar, Sibelius, César Franck, Claude Debussy, Vincent d&#x27;Indy, Carl Nielsen and Béla Bartók. The concerts also included premieres of some of Busoni&#x27;s own works of the period, among them, in 1904, the Piano Concerto, in which he was the soloist under conductor Karl Muck; in 1905, his &quot;Turandot Suite&quot;, and, in 1907, his &quot;Comedy Overture&quot;. Music of older masters was included, but sometimes with an unexpected twist. For example, Beethoven&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto with the eccentric first movement cadenza by Charles-Valentin Alkan (which includes references to Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony). The concerts aroused much publicity but generated aggressive comments from critics. Couling suggests the programming of the concerts was &quot;generally regarded as a provocation&quot;.

During the period Busoni undertook teaching at masterclasses at Weimar, Vienna and Basel. In 1900 he was invited by Duke Karl-Alexander of Weimar to lead a masterclass for fifteen young virtuosi. This concept was more amenable to Busoni than teaching formally in a Conservatory: the twice-weekly seminars were successful and were repeated in the following year. Pupils included Maud Allan, who later became famous as a dancer and remained a friend. His experience in Vienna in 1907 was less satisfactory, although amongst his more rewarding pupils were Ignaz Friedman, Leo Sirota, Louis Gruenberg, Józef Turczyński and Louis Closson; the latter four were dedicatees of pieces in Busoni&#x27;s 1909 piano album &quot;An die Jugend&quot;. But arguments with the Directorate of the Vienna Conservatoire, under whose auspices the classes were held, soured the atmosphere. In the autumn of 1910 Busoni gave masterclasses and also carried out a series of recitals in Basel.

In the years before World War I, Busoni steadily extended his contacts in the art world in general as well as amongst musicians. Arnold Schoenberg, with whom Busoni had been in correspondence since 1903, settled in Berlin in 1911 partially as a consequence of Busoni lobbying on his behalf. In 1913 Busoni arranged at his own apartment a private performance of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; which was attended by, amongst others, Willem Mengelberg, Edgard Varèse, and Artur Schnabel. In Paris in 1912 Busoni had meetings with Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, who proposed collaboration in a ballet or opera. He also met with the Futurist artists Filippo Marinetti and Umberto Boccioni.

===World War I and Switzerland (1913–1920)===

Following a series of concerts in Northern Italy in spring 1913, Busoni was offered the directorship of the Liceo Rossini in Bologna. He had recently moved to an apartment in Viktoria-Luise-Platz in Schöneberg, Berlin, but took up the offer, intending to spend his summers in Berlin. The posting proved unsuccessful. Bologna was a cultural backwater, despite occasional visits from celebrities such as Isadora Duncan. Busoni&#x27;s piano pupils were untalented, and he had constant arguments with the local authorities. After the outbreak of World War I, in August 1914, he asked for a year of absence to play an American tour; in fact he was never to return. Virtually his sole permanent achievement at the school was to have modernized its sanitary facilities. He had however during this time composed another concertante work for piano and orchestra, the &quot;Indian Fantasy&quot;. The piece is based on melodies and rhythms from various American Indian tribes; Busoni derived them from a book he had received from his former pupil, the ethnomusicologist Natalie Curtis Burlin during his 1910 tour of the US. The work was premiered with Busoni as soloist in March 1914, in Berlin.

From June 1914 to January 1915, Busoni was in Berlin. As a native of a neutral country (Italy) living in Germany, Busoni was not greatly concerned, at first, by the outbreak of war. During this period, he began to work seriously on the libretto for his proposed opera &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;. In January 1915 he left for a concert tour of the US, which was to be his last visit there. During this time he continued work on his Bach edition, including his version of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. Upon the composer&#x27;s return to Europe, Italy had entered the war. Busoni therefore chose to base himself from 1915 in Switzerland. In Zurich, he found local supporters in Volkmar Andreae (conductor of the Tonhalle Orchestra) and Philipp Jarnach. His friend José Vianna da Motta also taught piano in Geneva at this time. Andreae arranged for Busoni to give concerts with his orchestra. Jarnach, who was 23 when he met Busoni, in 1915, became Busoni&#x27;s indispensable assistant, among other things preparing piano scores of his operas; Busoni referred to him as his &quot;&quot;. While in America, Busoni had carried out further work on &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, and had written the libretto of his one-act opera &quot;Arlecchino&quot;. He completed it in Zurich and, to provide a full evening at the theatre, reworked his earlier &quot;Turandot&quot; into a one-act piece. The two were premiered together in Zurich in May 1917.

In Italy in 1916, Busoni met again with the artist Boccioni, who painted his portrait; Busoni was deeply affected when a few months later Boccioni was killed (in a riding accident) whilst on military training, and published an article strongly critical of war. An expanded re-issue of Busoni&#x27;s 1907 work &quot;A New Esthetic of Music&quot; let to a virulent counter-attack from the German composer Hans Pfitzner and an extended war of words. Busoni continued to experiment with microtones: in America he had obtained some harmonium reeds tuned in third-tones, and he claimed that he &quot;had worked out the theory of a system of thirds of tones in two rows, each separated from each other by a semitone&quot;.

Although he met with many other artistic personalities also based in Switzerland during the war (including Stefan Zweig, who noted his extensive drinking, and James Joyce), Busoni soon found his circumstances limiting. After the end of the war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London, he met with the composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji who played his Piano Sonata No. 1 for him (he had dedicated it to Busoni). Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write a letter of recommendation for Sorabji. When Busoni&#x27;s former pupil Leo Kestenberg, by then an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.

===Final years (1920–1924)===
In 1920, Busoni returned to the Berlin apartment at Viktoria-Luise-Platz 11 that he had left in 1915. His health began to decline, but he continued to give concerts. His main concern was to complete &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, the libretto of which had been published in Germany in 1918. In 1921 he wrote &quot;Like a subterranean river, heard but not seen, the music for &quot;Faust&quot; roars and flows continually in the depths of my aspirations&quot;.

Berlin was the heart of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. Busoni&#x27;s works, including his operas, were regularly programmed. Health permitting, he continued to perform; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant that he needed to undertake tours of England. His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto. Among his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel, and Robert Blum, and during these last years Busoni also had contact with Varèse, Stravinsky, the conductor Hermann Scherchen, and others.

Busoni died in Berlin on 27 July 1924, officially from heart failure, although inflamed kidneys and overwork also contributed to his death. &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; remained unfinished at his death and was premiered in Berlin in 1925, completed by Jarnach. Busoni&#x27;s Berlin apartment was destroyed in an air-raid in 1943, and many of his possessions and papers were lost or looted. A plaque at the site commemorates his residence. Busoni&#x27;s wife, Gerda, died in Sweden in 1956. Their son Benni, who, despite his American nationality had lived in Berlin throughout World War II, died there in 1976. Their second son Lello, an illustrator, died in New York in 1962.

==Music==

===Pianism===

The pianist Alfred Brendel said of Busoni&#x27;s playing that it &quot;signifies the victory of reflection over bravura&quot; after the more flamboyant era of Liszt. He cites Busoni himself: &quot;Music is so constituted that every context is a new context and should be treated as an &#x27;exception&#x27;. The solution of a problem, once found, cannot be reapplied to a different context. Our art is a theatre of surprise and invention, and of the seemingly unprepared. The spirit of music arises from the depths of our humanity and is returned to the high regions whence it has descended on mankind.&quot;

Sir Henry Wood was surprised to hear Busoni playing, with two hands in double octaves, passages in a Mozart concerto written as single notes. At this, Donald Tovey proclaimed Busoni &quot;to be an absolute purist in &quot;not&quot; confining himself strictly to Mozart&#x27;s written text&quot;, that is, that Mozart himself could have taken similar liberties. The musicologist Percy Scholes wrote that &quot;Busoni, from his perfect command over every means of expression and his complete consideration of every phrase in a composition to every other phrase and to the whole, was the truest artist of all the pianists [I] had ever heard.&quot;
===Works===

Busoni&#x27;s works include compositions, adaptations, transcriptions, recordings and writings.

====Opus numbers====
Busoni gave many of his works opus numbers; some numbers apply to more than one work (after the composer dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Furthermore, not all the composer&#x27;s numbers are in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue of his works and transcriptions which is also used, in the form of the letters BV (for &quot;Busoni Verzeichnis&quot; (&quot;Busoni Index&quot;); sometimes the letters KiV for &quot;Kindermann Verzeichnis&quot; are used) followed by a numeric identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for &quot;Bearbeitung&quot;, &quot;arrangement&quot;) is used for Busoni&#x27;s transcriptions and cadenzas. For example, BV B 1 refers to Busoni&#x27;s cadenzas for Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4.

====Early compositions====
In 1917, Hugo Leichtentritt suggested that the Second Violin Sonata Op. 36a (BV 244), completed in 1900, &quot;stands on the border-line between the first and second epochs of Busoni&quot;, although van Dieren asserts that in conversation Busoni &quot;made no such claims for any work written before 1910. This means that he dated his work as an independent composer from the piano pieces &quot;An die Jugend&quot; ... and the &quot;Berceuse&quot; in its original version for piano.&quot; (These works were actually written in 1909.) The Kindermann &quot;Busoni Verzeichnis&quot; lists over 200 compositions in the period to 1900, which are met with very rarely in the contemporary repertoire or in recording, mostly featuring piano, either as solo instrument or accompanying others, but also including some works for chamber ensemble and some for orchestra, amongst them two large-scale suites and a violin concerto.

Antony Beaumont notes that Busoni wrote virtually no chamber music after 1898 and no songs between 1886 and 1918, commenting that this was &quot;part of the process of freeing himself from his Leipzig background ... [evoking] worlds of middle-class respectability in which he was not at home, and [in which] the shadows of Schumann, Brahms and Wolf loomed too large.&quot; The first decade of the 20th century is described by Brendel as being for Busoni &quot;a creative pause&quot; after which he &quot;finally gained an artistic profile of his own&quot; as opposed to the &quot;easy routine which had kept his entire earlier production on the tracks of eclecticism&quot;.

During this period, Busoni wrote his Piano Concerto, one of the largest such works he ever wrote in terms of duration and resources. Dent comments &quot;In construction [the Concerto] is difficult to analyse ... on account of the way in which themes are transferred from movement to another. The work has to be considered as a whole, and Busoni always desired it to be played straight through without interruption.&quot; The press reaction to the premiere of the concerto was largely one of outrage: the &quot;&quot; complained of &quot;Noise, more noise, eccentricity and licentiousness&quot;, while another journal opined that &quot;the composer would have done better to stay within more modest boundaries&quot;. The other major work during this &quot;creative pause&quot; was the &quot;Turandot Suite&quot;. Busoni employed motifs from Chinese and other oriental music in the suite, though, as Leichtentritt points out, the Suite is &quot;in fact the product of an Occidental mind, for whom the exact imitation of the real Chinese model would always be unnatural and unattainable ... the appearance is more artistic than the real thing would be.&quot; The suite was first performed as a purely musical item in 1905; it was used in a production of the play in 1911, and was eventually transformed into a two-act opera in 1917.

====Busoni and Bach====

1894 saw the publication in Berlin of the first part of Busoni&#x27;s edition of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach for the piano; the first book of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;. This was equipped with substantial appendices, including one &quot;On the Transcription of Bach&#x27;s Organ Works for the Pianoforte&quot;. This was eventually to form a volume of the Bach-Busoni Edition, an undertaking which was to extend over thirty years. Seven volumes were edited by Busoni himself; these included the 1890 edition of the &quot;Two- and Three-Part Inventions&quot;. Busoni also began to publish his concert piano transcriptions of Bach&#x27;s music, which he often included in his own recitals. These included some of Bach&#x27;s chorale preludes for organ, the organ Toccata and Fugue in D minor, and the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue.

These transcriptions go beyond literal reproduction of the music for piano and often involve substantial recreation, although never straying from the original rhythmic outlines, melody notes and harmony. This is in line with Busoni&#x27;s own concept that the performing artist should be free to intuit and communicate his divination of the composer&#x27;s intentions. Busoni adds tempo markings, articulation and phrase markings, dynamics and metronome markings to the originals, as well as extensive performance suggestions. In his edition of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; (BV B 35), for example, he suggests cutting eight of the variations for a &quot;concert performance&quot;, as well as substantially rewriting many sections. Kenneth Hamilton comments that &quot;the last four variations are rewritten as a free fantasy in a pianistic style which owes far more to Busoni than to Bach.&quot;

On the death of his father in 1909, Busoni wrote in his memory a &quot;Fantasia after J. S. Bach&quot; (BV 253); and in the following year came his extended fantasy based on Bach, the &quot;Fantasia contrappuntistica&quot;.

====Writings====
Busoni wrote a number of essays on music. The &quot;Entwurf einer neuen Ästhetik der Tonkunst&quot; (&quot;Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music&quot;), first published in 1907, set out the principles underlying his performances and his mature compositions. A collection of reflections which are &quot;the outcome of convictions long held and slowly matured&quot;, the &quot;Sketch&quot; asserts that &quot;The spirit of an artwork ... remains[s] unchanged in value through changing years&quot; but its form, manner of expression, and the conventions of the era when it was created, &quot;are transient and age rapidly&quot;. The &quot;Sketch&quot; includes the maxim that &quot;Music was born free; and to win freedom is its destiny&quot;. It therefore takes issue with conventional wisdom on music, caricatured by Busoni as the constricting rules of the &quot;lawgivers&quot;. It praises the music of Beethoven and JS Bach as the essence of the spirit of music (&quot;Ur-Musik&quot;) and says that their art should &quot;be conceived as a &quot;beginning&quot;, and not as an unsurpassable finality.&quot; Busoni asserts the right of the interpreter vis-à-vis the purism of the &quot;lawgivers&quot;. &quot;The performance of music, its &quot;emotional interpretation&quot;, derives from those free heights whence descended Art itself ... What the composer&#x27;s inspiration &quot;necessarily&quot; loses through notation, his interpreter should restore by his own.&quot; He envisages a future music that will include the division of the octave into more than the traditional 12 semitones. However, he asserted the importance of musical form and structure: His idea of a &#x27;Young Classicism&#x27; &quot;aimed to incorporate experimental features in &quot;firm, rounded forms&quot; ... motivated each time by musical necessity.&quot; (Brendel).

Another collection of Busoni&#x27;s essays was published in 1922 as &quot;Von der Einheit der Musik&quot;, later republished as &quot;Wesen und Einheit der Musik&quot;, and in 1957 translated as &quot;The Essence of Music&quot;. Busoni also wrote the librettos of his four operas.

====Mature compositions====
Writing in 1917, Hugo Leichtentritt described Busoni&#x27;s mature style as having elements in common with those of Sibelius, Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, and Schoenberg, noting in particular his movement away from traditional major and minor scales towards atonality.

The first landmarks of this mature style are the group of piano works published in 1907–1912 (the &quot;Elegies&quot;, the suite &quot;An die Jugend&quot; and the first two piano sonatinas) and Busoni&#x27;s first completed opera, &quot;Die Brautwahl&quot;; together with the rather different Bach homage, the 1910 &quot;Fantasia contrappuntistica&quot;, Busoni&#x27;s largest work for solo piano. About half an hour in length, it is essentially an extended fantasy on the final incomplete fugue from Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;. It uses several melodic figures found in Bach&#x27;s work, most notably the B-A-C-H motif. Busoni revised the work a number of times and arranged it for two pianos.

Busoni also drew inspiration from North American indigenous tribal melodies drawn from the studies of Natalie Curtis, which informed his &quot;Indian Fantasy&quot; for piano and orchestra of 1913 and two books of solo piano sketches, &quot;Indian Diary&quot;. In 1917, Busoni wrote the one-act opera &quot;Arlecchino&quot; (1917) as a companion piece for his revision of &quot;Turandot&quot; as an opera. He began serious work on his opera &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; in 1916, leaving it incomplete at his death. It was then finished by his student Philipp Jarnach, who worked with Busoni&#x27;s sketches as he knew of them. In the 1980s Antony Beaumont created an expanded and improved completion by drawing on material to which Jarnach did not have access; Joseph Horowitz has described the Beaumont completion as &quot;longer, more adventurous and perhaps less good.&quot;

In the last seven years of his life Busoni worked sporadically on his &quot;Klavierübung&quot;, a compilation of exercises, transcriptions, and original compositions of his own, with which he hoped to pass on his accumulated knowledge of keyboard technique. It was issued in five parts between 1918 and 1922 An extended version in ten books was published posthumously in 1925.

====Editions, transcriptions and arrangements====
Apart from his work on the music of Bach, Busoni edited and transcribed works by other composers. He edited three volumes of the 34-volume Franz Liszt Foundation&#x27;s edition of Liszt&#x27;s works, including most of the études, and the &quot;Grandes études de Paganini&quot;. Other Liszt transcriptions include his piano arrangement of Liszt&#x27;s organ &quot;Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale &quot;Ad nos, ad salutarem undam&quot;&quot; (BV B 59) (based on a theme from Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Prophète&quot;) and concert versions of two of the &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot;.

Busoni also made keyboard transcriptions of works by Mozart, Franz Schubert, Niels Gade and others in the period 1886–1891 for the publisher Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. Later, during his earliest contacts with Arnold Schoenberg in 1909, he made a &#x27;concert interpretation&#x27; of the latter&#x27;s atonal Piano Piece, Op. 11, No. 2 (BV B 97) (which greatly annoyed Schoenberg himself). Busoni&#x27;s own works sometimes feature incorporated elements of other composers&#x27; music. The fourth movement of &quot;An die Jugend&quot; (1909), for instance, uses two of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Caprices for solo violin (numbers 11 and 15), while the 1920 piece &quot;Piano Sonatina No. 6&quot; (&quot;Fantasia da camera super Carmen&quot;) is based on themes from Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;.

=== Recordings ===

Busoni&#x27;s output on gramophone record as a pianist was very limited, and many of his original recordings were destroyed when the Columbia Graphophone Company&#x27;s factory burned down in 1912. Busoni mentions recording the Gounod-Liszt &quot;Faust Waltz&quot; in a letter to his wife in 1919. This recording was never released. He never recorded any of his own works.

==== Piano rolls ====
Busoni made a considerable number of piano rolls; a few of them have been re-recorded and released on vinyl LP and CD. These include a 1950 recording by Columbia sourced from piano rolls made by Welte-Mignon including music of Chopin and transcriptions by Liszt. The value of these recordings in ascertaining Busoni&#x27;s performance style is a matter of some dispute. Many of his colleagues and students expressed disappointment with the recordings and felt they did not truly represent Busoni&#x27;s pianism.

Egon Petri was horrified by the piano roll recordings when they first appeared on vinyl and said that they were a travesty of Busoni&#x27;s playing. Similarly, Petri&#x27;s student Gunnar Johansen who had heard Busoni play on several occasions, remarked, &quot;Of Busoni&#x27;s piano rolls and recordings, only &quot;Feux follets&quot; (no. 5 of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Transcendental Études&quot;) is really something unique. The rest is curiously unconvincing. The recordings, especially of Chopin, are a plain misalliance&quot;.

==Legacy==

Busoni&#x27;s impact on music was perhaps more through those who studied piano and composition with him, and through his writings on music, than through his compositions themselves, of whose style there are no direct successors. Alfred Brendel has opined: &quot;Compositions like the monstrously overwritten &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; ... obstruct our view of his superlative late piano music. How topical still – and undiscovered – are the first two sonatinas... and the &quot;Toccata&quot; of 1921 ... &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, now as ever, towers over the musical theatre of its time.&quot; Helmut Wirth has written that Busoni&#x27;s &quot;ambivalent nature, striving to reconcile tradition with innovation, his gifts as a composer and the profundity of his theoretical writings make [him] one of the most interesting figures in the history of 20th-century music.&quot;

The Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition was initiated in Busoni&#x27;s honour in 1949, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death.
