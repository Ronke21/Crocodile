<text>Eurythmics were a British new wave duo formed in 1980, consisting of Scottish vocalist Annie Lennox and English musician and producer Dave Stewart. They were both previously in the Tourists, a band that broke up in 1980. They released their first studio album, &quot;In the Garden&quot;, in 1981 to little success, but achieved global acclaim with their second album, &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; (1983). The title track became a worldwide hit, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart, and number one in Canada and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Eurythmics went on to release a string of hit singles and albums, including &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;, &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, before splitting in 1990.

Stewart became a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album &quot;Diva&quot;. After almost a decade apart, Eurythmics reunited to record their ninth album, &quot;Peace&quot;, released 1999. The album produced three singles – &quot;I Saved the World Today&quot;, &quot;17 Again&quot; and &quot;Peace Is Just a Word&quot;. The same year, they were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. They reunited again in 2005 to release the single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Life&quot;, which peaked within the top ten on the singles charts in Scotland, the top twenty in the United Kingdom and reaching number one on the US Dance Club Songs Charts, as part of a new compilation album, &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;.

Eurythmics have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide. Their awards include the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 1984, the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1987, and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1999. They were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.

==History==

===1976–1982: Formation and &quot;In the Garden&quot;===
Lennox and Stewart met in 1975 in a restaurant in London, where Lennox worked at that time. They first played together in 1976 in the punk rock band the Catch. After releasing one single as the Catch in 1977, the band evolved into the Tourists. Stewart and Lennox were also romantically involved. The Tourists achieved some commercial success, but the experience was reportedly an unhappy one. Personal and musical tensions existed within the group, whose main songwriter was Peet Coombes, and legal wrangling happened with the band&#x27;s management, publishers and record labels. Lennox and Stewart felt the fixed band line-up was an inadequate vehicle to explore their experimental creative leanings and decided their next project should be much more flexible and free from artistic compromise. They were interested in creating pop music, but wanted freedom to experiment with electronics and the avant-garde.

It was in a hotel in Wagga Wagga, Australia, while playing around with a portable mini-synthesizer that Lennox and Stewart decided to become a duo. Calling themselves Eurythmics (after the pedagogical exercise system that Lennox had encountered as a child), they decided to keep themselves as the only permanent members and songwriters, and involve others in the collaboration &quot;on the basis of mutual compatibility and availability&quot;. The duo signed to RCA Records. At this time, Lennox and Stewart also split as a couple. During the period that Lennox and Stewart were in the Tourists, and later as Eurythmics, they were managed by Kenny Smith and Sandra Turnbull of Hyper Kinetics Ltd.

They recorded their first album, &quot;In the Garden&quot;, in Cologne with Conny Plank (who had produced the later Tourists sessions). The album, released in October 1981, mixed psychedelic, krautrock and electropop influences, and featured contributions from Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit (of Can), drummer Clem Burke (of Blondie), Robert Görl (of D.A.F.), and flautist Tim Wheater. A couple of the songs were co-written by guitarist Roger Pomphrey (later a TV director). The album was not a commercial success (though the debut single &quot;Never Gonna Cry Again&quot; made the UK charts at No. 63). Lennox and Stewart then activated their new Eurythmics mode of operation by touring the record as a duo, accompanied by backing tracks and electronics, carted around the country by themselves in a horse-box.

During 1982, the duo retreated to Chalk Farm in London and used a bank loan to establish a small eight-track studio above a picture framing factory, giving them freedom to record without having to pay expensive studio fees. They began to employ much more electronics in their music, collaborating with Raynard Faulkner and Adam Williams, recording many tracks in the studio and playing live using various line-up permutations. However, the three new singles they released that year (&quot;This Is the House&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;) all performed badly on initial release in the UK. Although their mode of operation had given them the creative freedom they desired, commercial success still eluded them and the responsibility of personally running so many of their affairs (down to transporting their own stage equipment) took its toll. Lennox apparently suffered at least one nervous breakdown during this period, while Stewart was hospitalised with a collapsed lung.

===1983–1984: &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot;===
Eurythmics&#x27; commercial breakthrough came with their second album, &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, released in January 1983. The successful title track featured a dark and powerful sequenced synth bass line and a dramatic video that introduced the now orange crew-cut Lennox to audiences. The song reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of the year&#x27;s biggest sellers, No. 6 in Australia, and later topped the Canadian chart and US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band&#x27;s fortunes changed immensely from this moment on, and Lennox quickly became a pop icon, gracing the covers of numerous magazines including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Their previous single, &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;, was also re-released and became another chart success. The video for the song saw Lennox in many different character guises, a concept she would employ in various subsequent videos. The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Invisible Hands&quot; (as was a track left off the album), inspiring the name of the British independent company Invisible Hands known for releasing music by Hugh Cornwell, Mick Karn and Hazel O&#x27;Connor. The album also featured a cover of the 1968 Sam &amp; Dave hit &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;, performed as a duet between Lennox and Green Gartside of Scritti Politti.

The duo quickly recorded a follow-up album, &quot;Touch&quot;, which was released in November 1983. It became the duo&#x27;s first No. 1 album in the UK, and also spawned three major hit singles. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot; was a top 3 hit in the UK, the video depicting Lennox as both a blonde chanteuse and as an Elvis Presley clone. It also featured cameo appearances by Hazel O&#x27;Connor, Bananarama (including Stewart&#x27;s future wife, Siobhan Fahey), Kate Garner of Haysi Fantayzee, Thereza Bazar of Dollar, Jay Aston and Cheryl Baker of Bucks Fizz, Kiki Dee, Jacquie O&#x27;Sullivan and the gender-bending pop singer Marilyn, who would go on to musical success of his own that same year. The upbeat, calypso-flavoured &quot;Right by Your Side&quot; made the Top 10, and &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot; (No. 8 in the UK, No. 4 in the US) was an orchestral/synth ballad (with orchestrations by Michael Kamen).

In 1984, RCA released &quot;Touch Dance&quot;, an EP of remixes of four of the tracks from &quot;Touch&quot;, aimed at the club market. The remixes were by prominent New York City producers Francois Kevorkian and John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez. Also released in 1984 was Eurythmics&#x27; soundtrack album &quot;1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)&quot;. Virgin Films had contracted the band to provide a soundtrack for Michael Radford&#x27;s modern film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. However, Radford later said that the music had been &quot;foisted&quot; on his film against his wishes, and that Virgin had replaced most of Dominic Muldowney&#x27;s original orchestral score with the Eurythmics soundtrack (including the song &quot;Julia&quot;, which was heard during the end credits). Nevertheless, the record was presented as &quot;music derived from the original score of Eurythmics for the Michael Radford film version of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;&quot;. Eurythmics charged that they had been misled by the film&#x27;s producers as well, and the album was withdrawn from the market for a period while matters were litigated. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four)&quot;, was a top 5 hit in the UK, Australia and across Europe, and a major dance success in the United States.

===1985–1986: &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot; and new musical direction===

The duo&#x27;s next album, &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot;, was produced in a week in Paris and spent 4 weeks at No. 1 in Australia. It showcased much more of a &quot;band style&quot; and a centred sound (with an R&amp;B influence), with real drums, brass, and much more guitar from Stewart. Almost a dozen other musicians were enlisted, including members of Tom Petty&#x27;s Heartbreakers, guest harmonica from Stevie Wonder, bass guitar from Dean Garcia, string arrangements by Michael Kamen, and Lennox singing duets with Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello. It continued the duo&#x27;s transatlantic chart domination in 1985, and contained four hit singles: &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; was a US Billboard top five hit and Australian No. 1, while &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot; (featuring Wonder&#x27;s harmonica contribution) became their first and only UK No. 1 single. The feminist anthem &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; (a duet with Aretha Franklin, though originally intended for Tina Turner), and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright (Baby&#x27;s Coming Back)&quot; also rode high in the charts. In September 1985, Eurythmics performed &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York.

It was a major commercial success for Eurythmics on international albums charts, reaching the top five in regions including Australia (where it reached number one), New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, it reached the top ten in the United States, Switzerland and Germany. 

It was nominated for the Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album and Top Compact Disk Award at the 1985 Billboard Music Awards and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year at the 1986 Brit Awards. Two of the albums singles – &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; and &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; were nominated for two awards at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards in 1986 for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal respectively.

===1986–1990: &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Savage&quot; and &quot;We Too Are One&quot;===

Eurythmics released their next album, &quot;Revenge&quot;, in 1986. The album continued their move towards a band sound, verging on an AOR-pop/rock sound. Sales continued to be strong in the UK and internationally, but were somewhat slower in the US, though &quot;Missionary Man&quot; reached No. 14 on the US Hot 100 chart and went all the way to No. 1 on the US Album Oriented Rock chart (AOR). &quot;Revenge&quot; would eventually certify double Platinum in the UK and Gold in the US, and spend 40 weeks in the Australian top 10 where it reached No. 2. The band went on a massive worldwide tour in support of the album, and a live concert video from the Australian leg of the tour was released.

In 1987, Lennox and Stewart released the album &quot;Savage&quot;. This saw a fairly radical change within the group&#x27;s sound, being based mainly around programmed samples and drum loops (Lennox would later say that where &quot;Revenge&quot; was more of a Stewart album in sound, &quot;Savage&quot; was more of a Lennox one). Lyrically the songs showed an even darker, more obsessive side to Lennox&#x27;s writing. A video album was also made, directed by Sophie Muller, with a video for each song. This was largely a concept piece, following characters portrayed by Lennox, specifically one of a frustrated housewife-turned-vamp (as exemplified in &quot;Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)&quot;, a UK top 30 and Australian No. 13 hit). The brazen, sexually charged rocker &quot;I Need a Man&quot; remains a Eurythmics staple, as does &quot;You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart&quot;. Much less commercial than the two previous albums, &quot;Savage&quot; was mostly ignored in the US, although rock radio in more progressive markets supported &quot;I Need a Man&quot;. In the duo&#x27;s native UK however, the album was a top 10 success and was certified Platinum.

In 1989, Eurythmics released the album &quot;We Too Are One&quot;, which entered the UK Album Chart at No. 1 (their second No. 1 album after &quot;Touch&quot;) and gave the duo four UK Top 30 hit singles. The album was a return to the rock/pop sound of their mid-80s albums and was certified Double Platinum in the UK, and reached No. 7 in Australia, but was less successful in the US (although the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot; grazed the Billboard Top 40). Other singles from the album included &quot;Revival&quot;, &quot;The King and Queen of America&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Accompanying the album, the duo conducted their &quot;Revival&quot; world tour from 8 September 1989 to 25 January 1990. Parts of the tour (both on and off-stage) were interspersed with promo videos for Eurythmics&#x27; 1990 video album &quot;We Two Are One Too&quot;.

===1990–1998: Hiatus and solo careers===
After strenuous years of touring and recording (Eurythmics had released eight studio albums in eight years), a rift had developed between the duo and Eurythmics disbanded, although no formal notice was given. Stewart began writing film soundtracks and had a big international hit in 1990 with the instrumental track &quot;Lily Was Here&quot; (featuring saxophonist Candy Dulfer). The single reached No. 6 in the UK and the Top 20 throughout much of Europe and the US, and top 10 in Australia. A soundtrack of the same name was also released, produced and largely written by Stewart. He formed a band called the Spiritual Cowboys, releasing two albums with this group in the early 1990s. Lennox took time off from her career to have a baby and to consider a life after Eurythmics. Accordingly, the duo had very little communication with each other from 1991 to 1998. In 1991, Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection was released, entering the UK album chart at No. 1 and spending a total of 10 weeks at that position, plus 8 weeks in New Zealand and 7 weeks in Australia at No. 1 as well as becoming a massive worldwide seller. New remixes of &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot; were also released as singles at this time. During 1993, a live album entitled &quot;Live 1983–1989&quot; featuring recordings from various years throughout Eurythmics&#x27; career was also released.

In 1992, Lennox released her first solo album, &quot;Diva&quot;. The album was a critical and popular success, entering the UK album chart at No. 1 and achieving quadruple platinum status (more than any Eurythmics studio album had done), as well as producing a string of five hit singles. She followed this up in 1995 with her second album, &quot;Medusa&quot;, an album of cover versions. It became her second No. 1 album in the UK, reaching double platinum status both there and in the US.

Stewart, meanwhile, released the solo albums &quot;Greetings from the Gutter&quot; (1995), and &quot;Sly-Fi&quot; (1998), but neither was commercially successful.

===1999–2005: &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;===

In the late 1990s, Eurythmics reunited and recorded a new album, &quot;Peace&quot;, which was released in 1999. The single &quot;I Saved the World Today&quot; reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart, and a remix of &quot;17 Again&quot; gave the duo their first chart-topper on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The band also embarked on a world tour, dubbed the &quot;Peacetour&quot;, to support the album. The tour started on 18 September 1999 at Cologne&#x27;s Kölnarena and ended on 6 December 1999 at the London Docklands Arena (which was filmed and released on video and DVD). All proceeds from the tour went to Greenpeace and Amnesty International. The year 2000 saw numerous European festival appearances by Eurythmics (at Germany&#x27;s Rock am Ring, among others). In 2001, Stewart performed with U2 for the benefit concert. In 2002, he collaborated with Bryan Ferry on his album &quot;Frantic&quot;.

In June 2003, Lennox released her third solo album, &quot;Bare&quot;, which was a top-five hit in the UK and the US., with three tracks reaching the top of the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. She also recorded the song &quot;Into the West&quot; for Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, where it appeared as the closing theme and earned Lennox the Academy Award for Best Song. In November 2003, Eurythmics played three songs at the 46664 in Cape Town, South Africa, for which Stewart was one of the primary organisers. They played an unplugged version of &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, &quot;7 Seconds&quot; with Youssou N&#x27;Dour and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. Stewart collaborated with Rolling Stones vocalist Mick Jagger on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Alfie&quot;, released in 2004, including the critically acclaimed &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;, which won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture.

On 7 November 2005, Eurythmics released &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, a remastered greatest hits package with two new songs. One of them, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Life&quot;, was released as a single and reached No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart as well as spending three consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Music/Club Play in the US. Lennox and Stewart appeared on a number of TV shows to promote their new compilation album, which was a Top 5 hit and certified Platinum in the UK. On 14 November 2005, the duo&#x27;s label, RCA, re-released their eight studio albums in remastered and expanded editions featuring rare B-sides, remixes and unreleased songs. The remasters were made available separately with expanded artwork, and also together in a collector&#x27;s box set, entitled &quot;Boxed&quot;. However, the 1984 soundtrack album &quot;1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)&quot; was not included in this re-release campaign as Virgin Records holds the rights to that album. Also in 2005, Eurythmics were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. In 2007, Lennox resumed her solo career with her fourth album, &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot;, which was a top 10 success in the UK and the US. In 2009, she released her first solo &quot;greatest hits&quot; package, &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot;. The same year, Lennox stated that although she and Stewart remain friends, she does not foresee any further Eurythmics projects in the future.

===One–off reunions (2012–present)===
In an interview with Reuters in September 2012, Stewart was quizzed on whether a new Eurythmics album is in the works, to which he replied: &quot;We&#x27;re not talking about one right now, but never say never.&quot; He added that he was considering developing a musical based on the music of Eurythmics.

====2014: Beatles tribute concert====
Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart performed as a duo for &quot;The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles&quot;. The event was recorded at the Los Angeles Convention Center on 27 January 2014, the day after the Grammy Awards. They performed the Beatles song &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;.

====2019: Sting&#x27;s 30th We&#x27;ll Be Together benefit concert====
Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart, billed as Eurythmics, performed at Sting&#x27;s 30th We&#x27;ll Be Together benefit concert in aid of his Rainforest Foundation Fund on 9 December 2019 at New York City&#x27;s Beacon Theatre. The group played &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, before returning to join in the finale performance of Journey’s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27; along with the night&#x27;s other performers.

====2022: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony====
Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart performed as Eurythmics at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California performing &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, &quot;Missionary Man&quot; and &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; as part of the 2022 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. They were inducted by U2&#x27;s the Edge.

<text>The Tourists were a British rock and pop band. They achieved brief success in the late 1970s before the band split in 1980. Two of its members, singer Annie Lennox and guitarist Dave Stewart, went on to international success as Eurythmics.

==Early history==
Guitarists Peet Coombes and Dave Stewart were members of the folk rock band Longdancer, which was on Elton John&#x27;s Rocket Records label. They moved to London, where they met singer Annie Lennox, who had dropped out of a course at the Royal Academy of Music to pursue her ambitions in pop music.

Forming a band in 1976, the three of them initially called themselves The Catch. In 1977, the band released a single named &quot;Borderline/Black Blood&quot; on Logo Records. It was released in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal, but was not a commercial success.

==The Tourists==
By 1976, they had recruited bass guitarist Eddie Chin and drummer Jim Toomey (without exception, billed throughout his time with the Tourists as Jim &quot;Do It&quot; Toomey), and renamed themselves The Tourists. This was the beginning of a productive period for the band and they released three albums: &quot;The Tourists&quot; (1979), &quot;Reality Effect&quot; (1979), and &quot;Luminous Basement&quot; (1980), as well as half a dozen singles, including &quot;Blind Among the Flowers&quot; (1979), &quot;The Loneliest Man in the World&quot; (1979), &quot;Don&#x27;t Say I Told You So&quot; (1980), and two hits, the Dusty Springfield cover &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; (1979) and &quot;So Good to Be Back Home Again&quot; (1980), both of which reached the top 10 in the UK.

&quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; was also a top-10 hit in Australia and reached number 83 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Coombes was the band&#x27;s main songwriter, although later releases had the first compositions by Lennox and Stewart.

In 1980, the band signed to the UK branch of RCA Records. They toured extensively in the UK and abroad, including as support for Roxy Music on their 1979 Manifesto Tour. The group disbanded in late 1980.

==After the break-up==
Coombes and Chin began a new project named Acid Drops but this met with little success, and Coombes, despite originally being the main artistic force behind The Tourists, drifted out of the music business after the disbanding. 
Lennox and Stewart soon split as a couple, but decided to continue working as an experimental musical partnership, under the name Eurythmics. They retained their RCA recording contract and links with Conny Plank, who produced their first album &quot;In the Garden&quot; in 1981.
Coombes&#x27; death in March 1997 acted as a catalyst for Lennox and Stewart to revive their friendship and musical partnership, after they had previously disbanded Eurythmics in 1990.
Drummer Jim Toomey (no longer using his &quot;Do It&quot; nickname) published the book &quot;We Were Tourists&quot; in 2018, describing the band&#x27;s career.

Bassist Eddie Chin died in 2023

<text>Isabel Martínez de Perón (, born María Estela Martínez Cartas; 4 February 1931) is an Argentine politician who served as the 41st president of Argentina from 1974 to 1976. She was one of the first female republican heads of state in the world, and the first woman to serve as president of a country. Perón was the third wife of President Juan Perón. During her husband&#x27;s third term as president from 1973 to 1974, she served as both the 29th vice president and first lady of Argentina. From 1974 until her resignation in 1985, she was also the 2nd President of the Justicialist Party.

Following her husband&#x27;s death in office in 1974, she served as President for almost two years before the military took over the government with the 1976 coup. Perón was then placed under house arrest for five years before she was exiled to Spain in 1981. After democracy was restored in Argentina in 1983, she was a guest of honor at President Raúl Alfonsín&#x27;s inauguration. For several years, she was a nominal head of Juan Perón&#x27;s Justicialist Party and played a constructive role in reconciliation discussion, but has never again played any important political role.

Isabel Perón is one of the greatest expressions of the right-wing Peronism and mainly of the Orthodox Peronism. Ideologically, she was considered close to corporate neo-fascism. During her short tenure in office, she relied, at different points in time, on pro-neoliberal capitalism politicians, politicized military, and trade unions.

In 2007, an Argentine judge ordered Perón&#x27;s arrest over the forced disappearance of an activist in February 1976, on the grounds that the disappearance was authorised by her signing of decrees allowing Argentina&#x27;s armed forces to take action against &quot;subversives&quot;. She was arrested near her home in Spain on 12 January 2007. Spanish courts subsequently refused her extradition to Argentina.

Since the death of Carlos Menem on 14 February 2021, Perón is the oldest living former Argentine president.

==Early life and career==

María Estela Martínez Cartas was born in La Rioja, Argentina, daughter of María Josefa Cartas Olguín and Carmelo Martínez. She dropped out of school after the fifth grade. In the early 1950s she became a nightclub dancer adopting the name Isabel, the saint&#x27;s name (the Spanish form of that of Saint Elizabeth of Portugal) that she had chosen as a confirmation name.

===Juan Perón===

She met her future husband during his exile in Panama. Juan Domingo Perón, who was 35 years her senior, was attracted by her beauty and believed she could provide him with the female companionship he had been lacking since the death of his beloved second wife Eva Perón (Evita) in 1952. Perón brought Isabel with him when he moved to Madrid, Spain, in 1960. Authorities did not approve of Perón&#x27;s cohabitation with a young woman to whom he was not married, so on 15 November 1961 the former president reluctantly married for a third time.

===Early political career===
As Perón resumed an active role in Argentine politics from exile, Isabel acted as a go-between from Spain to Argentina. Having been deposed in a coup in 1955, Perón was forbidden from returning to Argentina, so his new wife was appointed to travel in his stead. The CGT leader José Alonso became one of her main advisers in Perón&#x27;s dispute against Steelworkers&#x27; leader Augusto Vandor&#x27;s Popular Union faction during mid-term elections in 1965; Alonso and Vandor were both later assassinated in as-yet unexplained circumstances.

====José López Rega====
Isabel met José López Rega, who was a former policeman with an interest in occultism and fortune-telling, during a visit to Argentina in 1965. She was interested in occult matters (and as president reportedly employed astrological divination to determine national policy), so the two quickly became friends. Under pressure from Isabel, Perón appointed López as his personal secretary; López later founded the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A), a death squad accused of perpetrating 1,500 crimes in the 1970s.

====Rise to power====
Dr. Héctor José Cámpora was nominated by Perón&#x27;s Justicialist Party to run in the March 1973 presidential elections on the FREJULI ticket (a Peronist-led alliance). Cámpora won, but it was generally understood that Juan Perón held the real power; a popular phrase at the time was &quot;&quot;Cámpora al gobierno, Perón al poder&quot;&quot; (Cámpora in government, Perón in power). Later that year, Perón returned to Argentina, and Cámpora resigned to allow Perón to run for president. He chose Isabel as his nominee for the Vice Presidency to mollify feuding Peronist factions, as these could agree on no other running mate. His return from exile was marked by a growing rift between the right and left wings of the Peronist movement; while Cámpora represented the left wing, López Rega represented the right wing. The latter was, moreover, supported by the CGT labor federation leadership and Isabel herself, and this faction became known by the left as the &quot;entorno&quot; (&#x27;entourage&#x27;) due to the inner circle status Perón afforded them. Juan Perón had long been inimical to the left, but cultivated their support while he was in exile. His sympathies ended, however, after the assassination of CGT leader José Ignacio Rucci by the leftist Montoneros in September.

Perón&#x27;s victory in a snap election called by Congress in September 1973 was always considered likely, and he won with 62% of the vote. He began his third term on 12 October, with Isabel as Vice President. Perón was by then in precarious health, however; a CIA cable at the time described him as alternating between a lucid state and that of senile dependency. Isabel had to take over as Acting President on several occasions during his tenure.

==Presidency (1974–1976)==

Juan Perón suffered a series of heart attacks on 28 June 1974; Isabel was summoned home from a European trade mission and secretly sworn in as acting president the next day. Juan Perón died on 1 July 1974, less than a year after his third election to office. As vice-president his widow formally ascended to the presidency, thus becoming the first woman in the world to hold the title of &quot;President&quot;, although she was not the first woman to lead a country. She was popularly known as &quot;La Presidente&quot;.

Although she lacked Evita Perón&#x27;s charisma, the grieving widow at first attracted support from the nation. She pledged to uphold the social market economy policies embodied in the 1973 &quot;Social Pact&quot; as well her husband&#x27;s long-held orthodox Peronism and economic nationalism; her first significant economic policy decisions were the enactment of a new, pro-labor employment contract law and the granting to YPF a monopoly over filling stations. Even leftist groups, having fallen out with Juan Perón in previous months, publicly offered support to her. However she cancelled meetings with various constituent and political groups, and the sympathy resulting from her husband&#x27;s death soon dissipated. Her government purged most leftists from university posts and the administration, and (as her husband and other Argentine presidents had done) used Federal intervention powers to unseat leftist governors. Following a string of political murders and a break by the Montoneros with the government, on 30 September Perón signed the Anti-Terrorism Law. This was the first in a series of measures which eroded constitutional rights, ostensibly for the sake of combating leftist violence.

Another source of contention between her and the voters was the increasing impression that José López Rega, the Minister of Social Welfare, set the agenda for a broad swath of Perón&#x27;s policies, vetting nearly all domestic and foreign policy. His public behaviour – which included bizarre actions such as silently mouthing her words as she spoke – began to cost the president much-needed support among the Argentine public. Known to have fascist sympathies, López Rega was also notably corrupt and used his position to secure business partnerships with (ODESSA network principal) Otto Skorzeny, (Libyan leader) Muammar Gaddafi, and (the Italian Fascist) Licio Gelli (to whose P-2 lodge López Rega belonged).

López Rega&#x27;s greatest influence upon Isabel Perón&#x27;s presidency came through his recently formed Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A). A right-wing paramilitary force, between late 1973 and late 1974 the Triple A had already carried out nearly 300 murders, including that of Professor Silvio Frondizi (brother of former President Arturo Frondizi), Congressman Rodolfo Ortega Peña, activist Father Carlos Mugica, Buenos Aires Province Assistant Police Chief Julio Troxler, former Córdoba Vice-Governor Atilio López and former Chilean Army head Carlos Prats. Other prominent public servants, such as UCR Senator Hipólito Solari Yrigoyen, and left-wing University of Buenos Aires President Rodolfo Puiggrós, narrowly survived Triple A attacks; Puiggrós was then removed from his post.

Atrocities were also being committed by left-wing extremists. Organised in 1968, the anarchist Montoneros murdered former head of state Pedro Aramburu, popular CGT union Secretary General José Ignacio Rucci, construction workers&#x27; union leader Rogelio Coria, former Interior Minister Arturo Mor Roig and U.S. Consul John Egan, among other murders and kidnappings. Throughout 1974, the rise of a new and nearly-as-violent Trotskyist group, the ERP, added to the cycle of violence. Having gained notoriety after the murder of FIAT executive Oberdan Sallustro, the ERP began the year with a violent assault on the Azul barracks. It murdered, among others, a criminal court judge, Jorge Quiroga; the writer Jordán Bruno Genta; and the publisher of La Plata&#x27;s centrist &quot;El Día&quot;, David Kraiselburd. The kidnapping of Esso executive Victor Samuelson, freed for a ransom of US$12 million, ignited what would become a rash of such crimes. However, the government and paramilitaries used this environment to target and murder many legitimate opponents of the regime, as listed above.

Following the murder of Buenos Aires Police Chief Alberto Villar (one of López Rega&#x27;s closest collaborators in the Triple A) and his wife, as well as amid increasing activity by the ERP in the Province of Tucumán, Perón was persuaded to declare a state of siege on 6 November (suspending, among other rights, &quot;habeas corpus&quot;). Censorship also increased markedly, culminating in the closure by decree of one of the leading news dailies in Latin America (&quot;Crónica&quot;) and several other publications, as well as the banning of Argentine television figures such as talk show host Mirtha Legrand and comedian Tato Bores.

Operation Independence began in Tucumán on 5 February 1975. This military campaign, though successful from a military standpoint, gained notoriety for its brutality; in addition to going after insurgents, it attacked elected officials, magistrates, University of Tucumán faculty, and even secondary school teachers.

The government turned on the labor movement, the mainstay of Peronism for the better part of a quarter-century, classifying it as &quot;subversive&quot; and subject to reprisals. The November 1974 election of a left-wing union shop steward at a Villa Constitución steel mill and its disapproval by steelworkers&#x27; leader Lorenzo Miguel (a leading figure in the paramount CGT), resulted in a brutal 20 March 1975 police assault on the facility. The raid, executed jointly with Triple A heavies, led to the &quot;disappearances&quot; of many of the 300 workers arrested.
Stacking the State Intelligence Secretariat (SIDE) with Fascists loyal to him, Lopez Rega hastened unprecedented intrigue, culminating in the kidnapping of Jorge and Juan Born, prominent local executives who paid US$60 million for their release (a world record at the time). Using contacts from among the Montoneros&#x27; many double agents, the agency kept the Born brothers in a known SIDE safehouse for nine months until their June 1975 release without public suspicion of SIDE involvement, a successful false flag operation that led to others (albeit less ambitious ones) in the following months.

López Rega, meanwhile, arranged the dismissal of many of the most competent policy makers Perón had inherited from her husband&#x27;s brief presidency; by May 1975, both Economy Minister José Ber Gelbard and Central Bank President Alfredo Gómez Morales had been replaced with right-wing López Rega loyalists.

Isabel Perón initially maintained the Social Pact inherited from her husband, and succeeded in enhancing it with reforms such as the enactment in December 1974 of payroll taxes to strengthen the Public Retirement System. Yielding to pressure from labor she ignored the incomes policy aspect of the Social Pact, however, and while the economy remained otherwise stable, a price/wage spiral ensued with inflation rising from a low of 12% a year at the height of the Social Pact in May 1974 to 80% a year later.

The Social Pact also faced growing opposition by employers, particularly after conservative members of the General Economic Council (CGE) split from the conciliatory CGE in March 1975 to form the more combative APEGE; this group would later adopt the tactic of staging recurring lockouts against the administration.

Faced with record trade and budget deficits, the new Economy Minister, Celestino Rodrigo, proceeded to apply economic shock therapy in June. These measures doubled rates and fares and ordered a surprise halving of the peso&#x27;s value, which, by forcing those who could to stampede towards the U.S. dollar, destroyed the fragile financial balance that had been maintained to that point. Consumer prices doubled between May and August 1975 alone, and though sharp, mandatory wage hikes had been negotiated between the government, labor and employers, the resulting shock (known as the &quot;Rodrigazo&quot;) ignited protest across Argentina, including a two-day general strike by the CGT (the first ever against a Peronist administration). Following protests in front of his offices, the now hated José López Rega was hastily appointed Ambassador to Spain and boarded a flight into exile.

===Fall from power===
López Rega left the country on 19 July. Shortly afterward, Perón dismissed her protégés in the Economy Ministry, Celestino Rodrigo, and in the Armed Forces High Command, General Alberto Numa Laplane, whom she replaced in August with General Jorge Videla, a quiet career officer with an uneventful military record. The president&#x27;s appointment of a pragmatic economist, Peronist wheelhorse Antonio Cafiero and her 13 September announcement of a leave of absence relieved ample sectors of society, from labor unions to business. Designating Senate President Ítalo Luder, a moderately conservative Peronist, in her stead, it was widely hoped that her leave would become permanent; but it was not to be.

Limited largely to the murder of security forces and public figures during 1974, political violence escalated during 1975 to include soft targets in the population at large as Trotskyist ERP and fascist Triple A extremists began taking to midnight lightning strikes against each other and civilian targets such as banks, buses, yachts, parking lots, and restaurants. Over 700 people died from political violence during Mrs. Perón&#x27;s first 15 months in office, of which more than half were subversives and most of the remainder were security forces; by March 1976, civilians comprised fully half of the 1,358 deaths attributable to this conflict.

The Montoneros, moreover, began a series of audacious attacks on military installations, including August dynamiting of the nearly finished destroyer &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; near the port of La Plata and the Operation Primicia, a terrorist attack on a military base in Formosa Province on 5 October. Anxious to placate the exasperated public, the military, hard-line labor leaders (particularly the steelworkers&#x27; Lorenzo Miguel), and most other Peronists, on 6 October she and Luder signed new measures giving blanket immunity for the Armed Forces that they may (in her words) &quot;annihilate subversive elements throughout the country&quot; – in effect a nationwide extension of the state of siege that had been imposed in Tucumán. The measure won her just enough support to return from &quot;sick leave&quot; and on 17 October (on Peronists&#x27; historically central Loyalty Day), Perón appeared at the balcony of the Casa Rosada, back at her post.

Perón&#x27;s health remained fragile, however, and a gallbladder affliction forced her to take a second, shorter leave of absence in November. Interior Minister Ángel Robledo&#x27;s proposal that elections (scheduled for March 1977) should instead be held in November 1976 was approved by the president during this leave, bringing renewed hope that an increasingly rumored coup d&#x27;état could yet be averted.

Anxiety over inflation, meanwhile, continued to dominate daily life. Monthly inflation did slow from the (then-record) 35% logged in July - but remained at 10–15% monthly between September and January 1976. A sudden fall in business investment had by then sent the economy into a sharp recession, however. GDP growth had already slowed from a 6.8% rate in the fourth quarter of 1974 to 1.4% in the second quarter; following the Rodrigazo crisis, the economy shrank 4.4% by the first quarter of 1976, with fixed investment falling by one sixth and auto production by a third.

The mid-year recession had significantly curbed the growth in imports; but because exports continued to fall, the trade deficit reached a record billion dollars in 1975, nearly depleting foreign exchange reserves. The government&#x27;s 1975 budget had been derailed by the crisis and by earlier commitments to cancel its then still-modest foreign debt, something which even so cost Argentina US$2.5 billion that year, alone. The resulting budget deficits (over US$5 billion, in 1975) and a series of lockouts in the agricultural and commercial sectors began to reassert pressure on prices after November, leading to hoarding and shortages.

The appointment of Brigadier General Héctor Fautario, a loyalist of Perón, to the branch&#x27;s high command, fueled broader support in the Air Force for action against her administration, and on 18 December, General Jesús Capellini attempted a coup d&#x27;état by seizing the Morón Airport and Air Base. The military joint chiefs, however, who obtained Fautario&#x27;s dismissal, stayed the mutiny&#x27;s hand, secretly concluding that the timing was premature. Partly in response, the nearly defeated People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP) on 23 December besieged the important Monte Chingolo Armory, which claimed the lives of six military personnel and 85 guerrilla members; this defeat marked the end of the ERP&#x27;s violent campaign.

Allegations had surfaced in August that Perón had embezzled large sums from the &quot;Cruzada de Solidaridad&quot; (&#x27;Solidarity Crusade&#x27;), a government-run charity, into her personal accounts in Spain. A congressional investigation launched in November over the charity fund embezzlement allegations had meanwhile dissipated her remaining support in Congress, prompting the departure of the second-largest party in the FREJULI alliance, the centrist Integration and Development Movement (MID), and dividing the Peronist caucus into &quot;Vericalist&quot; and &quot;Rebel&quot; factions. Her administration was dealt further political blows from within her own party by a break in December with the Governor of Buenos Aires Victorio Calabró, who declared that &quot;we won&#x27;t make it [to the next elections]&quot; and with the resignation in January 1976 of Interior Minister Ángel Robledo, her chief legislative and military point man.
Isabel Perón granted ever more significant policy concessions to the largely conservative military in the early months of 1976, from security matters to economic. Economy Minister Antonio Cafiero, supported by labor, was dismissed in February, and his replacement, Eugenio Mondelli, announced further shock therapy measures similar to the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Rodrigazo&quot; – the &quot;Mondelazo&quot;. These measures included steep hikes in utility rates and a new devaluation of the already shredded peso, causing prices to more than double over the next three months (inflation reached a new record of over 700% by April) and leading a new wave of strikes and business lockouts.

The opposition Radical Civic Union (UCR) initiated impeachment proceedings against the President in February with the support of the &quot;Rebel&quot; Peronist faction in Congress. Near defeat though still active, the Montoneros detonated a bomb at Army headquarters on 15 March, killing one and injuring 29 people. The head of the CGE, Julio Broner, left Argentina with his family, altogether; CGT Secretary General Casildo Herreras followed suit, announcing from exile that he had &quot;erased&quot; himself. The leader of the opposition UCR Ricardo Balbín, while making efforts to form a multi-party congressional crisis committee, held a private meeting in February with Army Chief of Staff Videla and told him, &quot;If you&#x27;re planning to stage a coup, do so as soon as possible – expect no applause from us, but no obstacles either.&quot;

The media were by then openly counting down the days to the expected coup d&#x27;état, and several newspapers published editorials calling for Perón&#x27;s overthrow. Even as the joint chiefs professed loyalty to &quot;La Presidente&quot;, the Armed Forces High Command had already given final approval to a coup, code-named &#x27;Operation Aries&#x27;, when the president returned from her leave of absence in October 1975.

After working late into the evening of 23 March 1976, in the hope of averting a renewed business lockout, Perón celebrated her executive assistant&#x27;s birthday with staff. Alerted to suspicious military exercises, she boarded the presidential helicopter shortly after midnight. It did not fly her to the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence but to an Air Force base in nearby Jorge Newbery International Airport, where she was formally deposed and arrested.

==Detention and exile==
The majority of Peronist officials in the national, provincial, and municipal governments were promptly arrested, brutally beaten, starved, tortured, and interrogated by military police. Many &quot;disappeared&quot; permanently during the subsequent Dirty War, including numerous right-wing Peronists. Isabel Perón herself remained under house arrest in Villa La Angostura and other secluded locations for five years, and was eventually sent into exile in Spain in July 1981. She continued to serve as official head of her husband&#x27;s Justicialist Party until her resignation in February 1985, nearly a decade after her fall from power. Though there were some who desired her return and wished for her return to power, she refused to stand for election to the presidency when elections were ultimately called in 1983. She lived in Madrid, maintained close links with Francisco Franco&#x27;s family, and sometimes went to Marbella. She sold Perón&#x27;s Puerta de Hierro estate in 2001, and relocated to a townhouse in the western suburb of Villafranca del Castillo.

Following the restoration of democracy in Argentina, Perón was pardoned from charges of corruption during her presidency and returned in December 1983 as a guest of honor at President Raúl Alfonsín&#x27;s inauguration, and in May 1984 to participate in policy talks arranged by Alfonsín and opposition leaders. Still nominally head of Juan Perón&#x27;s Justicialist Party, she played a constructive role in the talks, supporting cooperation between the restive CGT labor union (her party&#x27;s political base) and Alfonsín. The talks concluded with a weak agreement, and she resigned from her post as titular head of the party. She returned to Argentina in 1988 to resolve probate disputes concerning the Perón estate, then resumed residence in Spain under a very low profile. On October 17, 2024 (on Loyalty Day), she met with Vice President Victoria Villarruel, citing the need to show national unity. That same day, she inaugurated a bust bearing the likeness of Perón in the Senate.

===Arrest in Spain===

A judge in Mendoza, Argentina in November 2006 demanded testimony from Isabel Perón, along with other Peronist ministers of her government, in a case involving forced disappearances during her presidency; on 12 January 2007, she was arrested by police in Madrid. She was charged by the Argentine authorities with the disappearance of Héctor Aldo Fagetti Gallego on 25 February 1976, and for crimes related to her issuance of 6 October 1975 decree calling the Armed Forces to &quot;annihilate subversive elements.&quot; The &quot;Nunca Más&quot; (&quot;Never Again&quot;) report released in 1984 by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons recorded 600 disappearances and 500 assassinations under the Peronist governments from 1973 to 1976, and it is acknowledged that the Triple A alone murdered some 600 people.

The 2006 capture in Spain of Triple A death-squad overseer Rodolfo Almirón, who had also been in charge of López Rega&#x27;s and Isabel Perón&#x27;s personal security, shed further light on the extent of Triple A involvement in the early stages of the Dirty War. Isabel Perón&#x27;s extradition to Argentina was refused by Spain on 28 March 2008. Spain&#x27;s National Court ruled twice that the charges against her did not constitute crimes against humanity, adding that the statute of limitations on the charges expired after 20 years.

The Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina unanimously dismissed on 21 June 2017 the petitions to interrogate Isabel Perón either as a witness or as a defendant.

===2020s===
In 2024 the current President, Javier Milei, called on all the living ex-Presidents to assist at the signing of the May 25th Pact on 9 July 2024 in the Casa de Tucumán. The ex-President chose not to attend.

<doc id="209194" wikidata="Q1069455" url="?curid=209194" title="Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (album)">
<text>Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) is the second studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 4 January 1983 by RCA Records. Along with the title track, which reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that year, the album also features the singles &quot;This Is the House&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot;, and &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;.

==Background and release==
===Recording and production===
The album was assembled by Eurythmics mainly at two locations: a small project studio in the attic of an old warehouse in the Chalk Farm district of north London, where the duo spent seven months living and working, followed by a small room in the Church Studios in London.
The album was largely recorded onto an 8-track tape machine, apart from three songs: &quot;The Walk&quot; was transferred onto a friend&#x27;s 16-track, and &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; and &quot;Wrap It Up&quot; were both recorded onto 24-track (using only half the tracks) while the Church studio was being built. Equipment-wise, the band had a recording setup consisting of a Tascam 80-8 8-track, a Soundcraft Series 2 mixer, two Beyerdynamic M201 TG microphones, a Roland Space Echo, a Furman compressor, a B.E.L. Electronics noise reduction unit, and a Klark Teknik DN50 spring reverb unit. The instruments they used were mainly a Roland SH-09 synthesizer (later said to be an SH-101 instead), a CSQ-100 sequencer, a Gretsch slide guitar, a Movement drum computer, a Roland Juno-6, and a borrowed Oberheim synthesizer (later described as the OB-X model by Stewart). Overall, the record cost around £5,000 to make, due to equipment costs.

===Release===
After a year and a half of initial commercial failure for Eurythmics, this album became a breakthrough for the duo on both sides of the Atlantic. The title track became particularly popular and remains one of Eurythmics&#x27; most recognisable songs. Its music video, popular on MTV in the United States, featured Annie Lennox&#x27;s gender-bending imagery. In the wake of this success, the single &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;, previously a flop, was re-released and became a hit as well. It too was accompanied by a video that featured Lennox dressed both as a man and a woman.

The album was re-released in 2005 with the entire Eurythmics studio catalogue, except the &quot;1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)&quot; album, to which Virgin Records holds the rights. The recordings were remastered, and several bonus tracks were added to each of the eight albums. In this release, &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; acquired six bonus tracks. Early Australian, German, and US CD releases (printed in Japan) and the 2005 reissue version of this album have a slightly longer version of &quot;This City Never Sleeps&quot;. The length of 6:40 is due to some mixed sound effects and a backmasked message by David A. Stewart saying, &quot;I enjoyed making that there record. Very good, very good.&quot;

Stewart was particularly pleased with the final product and called it &quot;one of the most important records of 1983&quot;, due to the &quot;carefully structured&quot; arrangements and lyrics.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; has generally received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic praised some of the singles but felt that the album possessed a few dull moments. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; noted that some of the lyrics detracted from the &quot;otherwise pleasant LP&quot;, although they were complimentary of &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;. Robert Christgau found that the album was &quot;starkly hooky&quot; but called the duo pretentious. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="209195" wikidata="Q362422" url="?curid=209195" title="Vince Neil">
<text>Vincent Neil Wharton (born February 8, 1961) is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist of heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, which he fronted from their 1981 formation until his departure in 1992. Neil reunited with the band in 1996 and continued with them until the band&#x27;s 2015 retirement, and again from the band&#x27;s 2018 reunion onwards. Outside of Mötley Crüe, Neil has also released three studio albums as a solo artist – the most recent of which, &quot;Tattoos &amp; Tequila&quot;, was released in 2010.

Although his later life has seen media focus more on his poor live performances and off-stage controversy, Neil&#x27;s visual aesthetic and distinctive singing voice are still considered synonymous with the American glam metal movement of the 1980s.

==Early life==
Neil was born in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, to Shirley (née Ortiz) and Clois &quot;Odie&quot; Wharton. He has Mexican ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side and Native American ancestry on his father&#x27;s. During the 1960s, his family moved around Southern California from Inglewood to Watts, before finally settling in Glendora, attending Sunflower Intermediate School and later Royal Oak High School. His biggest musical influence in the early days was Van Halen, imitating the look and the attitude of their frontman David Lee Roth. He also cited AC/DC, Aerosmith, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Journey and The Beach Boys among his favorite artists. As well as having an interest in music while a teenager, Neil was also interested in surfing, basketball, baseball, football and wrestling.

==Music career==
===Mötley Crüe===
Neil was discovered while performing with his band Rock Candy and joined Mötley Crüe in 1981. The newly formed band was seeking a lead vocalist and was impressed by Neil after seeing him perform live at drummer Tommy Lee&#x27;s suggestion. Lee had known Neil in high school and thought the vocalist&#x27;s image would fit well with the new band. With Mötley Crüe, Neil made his recording debut with the band&#x27;s 1981 debut album &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, brought Mötley Crüe to international stardom, and a string of hit releases throughout the decade 
including &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; and the number 1 album &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; established the band as one of the most popular rock acts in the world. Producer Tom Werman, who produced much of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s material in the 1980s, has said that Neil is the least artistic and least involved in the creative process of all the band members.

===Firing===
Following the release of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s 1991 greatest hits album &quot;Decade of Decadence 81–91&quot;, Neil and the band parted ways. Neil&#x27;s drinking was beginning to affect his ability to perform, and after he failed to show up for a band rehearsal on February 10, 1992, Sixx, Lee and Mars agreed that the vocalist was &quot;holding us back&quot;. At the time, the band blamed Neil&#x27;s race car driving in the Indy Lights circuit as the reason for the decision, releasing a statement that read &quot;Race car driving has become a priority in Neil&#x27;s life. His bandmates felt he didn&#x27;t share their determination and passion for music.&quot; Prior to his firing, Sixx says the band was open with him that they were considering a new lead vocalist, with Sixx telling him &quot;We are down here working, and we want to be here. This isn&#x27;t going to happen if you don&#x27;t want to be here and we have to force you out of bed every afternoon because you&#x27;ve been out all night drinking.&quot; Lee accused him of failing to contribute to the creative process and Neil stormed out, and his firing was announced to the public four days later.

===Going solo===
&quot;Exposed&quot; was Neil&#x27;s first solo album and was released in 1993. It debuted at #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The album featured Steve Stevens (who played all bass and guitar tracks on &quot;Exposed&quot;), Dave Marshall, Robbie Crane, and Vik Foxx. The band eventually went on tour, opening for Van Halen.
The album includes Neil&#x27;s debut solo single &quot;You&#x27;re Invited (But Your Friend Can&#x27;t Come)&quot;. The song exists in two versions, the first of which was included on the soundtrack to the Les Mayfield movie &quot;Encino Man&quot;; a music video was released for this version featuring a cameo from Pauly Shore. The track was re-recorded for the album with Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens. Pornographic film actress Janine Lindemulder can be seen in the video for the second single &quot;Sister of Pain&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot; was released as the third single featuring a video filmed at the Record Plant, and the video for the fourth single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Have Your Cake&quot;, featured actress Pamela Anderson as well as Neil&#x27;s son Neil Wharton who portrayed a young Vince Neil.

===&quot;Carved in Stone&quot;===
In September 1995, Neil released &quot;Carved in Stone&quot;, an industrial-oriented album produced by the Dust Brothers. It was recorded and then put on hold while Neil was dealing with the illness of his daughter Skylar. The album charted at #139 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The song &quot;Skylar&#x27;s Song&quot;, dedicated to his daughter, was released as a single for the album and featured a music video, and &quot;The Crawl&quot; was released as a promo single.
The album sold fewer than 100,000 copies in the US, and Neil&#x27;s contract with Warner Bros. Records eventually came to an end. The album was re-released in 2004.

Neil toured with his solo band, which consisted of Slaughter members Jeff Blando and Dana Strum, as well as drummer Zoltan Chaney.

===Reunion with Mötley Crüe===

Mötley Crüe came back into the spotlight after their &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode aired on VH1 in December 1998 and became the highest-rated in the series. A DVD was issued with ten extra minutes of footage in December 1999.

By 1997, Neil&#x27;s solo career and Mötley&#x27;s fortunes were declining, so the four reunited that year. &quot;They admitted they couldn&#x27;t do it without me&quot;, he recalled, &quot;and I wasn&#x27;t selling records the way Mötley Crüe had.&quot; They released &quot;Generation Swine&quot;, which debuted at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Tension soon erupted, however, this time prompting Tommy Lee to leave. The other members replaced him with Randy Castillo and recorded &quot;New Tattoo&quot; in 2000. The renewed band went on hiatus when Castillo died from cancer in 2002.

Mötley&#x27;s fortunes got a boost when Neil and Lee put aside their differences to tour in support of the 2005 compilation &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot;. Dubbed &quot;Carnival of Sins&quot;, the tour featured acrobats, fire breathers and a midget as part of the overall circus atmosphere the band created.

In 2008, Mötley Crüe released the album &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, featuring all the original members.

===2010s===
Neil released his third solo album, &quot;Tattoos &amp; Tequila&quot;, in 2010, his first solo release since &quot;Live at the Whisky: One Night Only&quot; in 2003. The album is a soundtrack to the book Neil released in the same year, &quot;Tattoos &amp; Tequila: To Hell and Back with One of Rock&#x27;s Most Notorious Frontmen&quot;. Each song on the album corresponds with a chapter in the book. The album&#x27;s title track was released as a single for the album and features a music video.

Neil contributed a cover of Japanese rock band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s song &quot;Blurry Eyes&quot; to their 2012 tribute album.

Following Mötley Crüe&#x27;s 2014 and 2015 final world tour, Neil confirmed in September 2018 that the band had reformed and plans to release new music.

In November 2016, Neil revealed that he had been contacted and was scheduled to play with his own band at the inauguration of Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2017. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how long I have to play. I don&#x27;t know if the Republican Party says which (songs) to play and what not to do,&quot; said Neil.

==Other ventures==
===Business ventures===
In 1994, Neil gave up ownership of his Bar One club.

In 1998, Mötley Crüe opened a store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles called S&#x27;Crüe, which stocks clothes from both Sixx and Neil&#x27;s clothing lines (Outlaw and Bad Bones), along with CDs, the Mötley Brüe drink and other items. The store closed in January 1999, with the band deciding to sell the items online.

In 2006, Neil opened a tattoo parlor called Vince Neil Ink, located on the Las Vegas Strip.

Neil founded Vince Vineyards, a winemaking venture that produced a 2003 Napa Cabernet Sauvignon and a 2003 Sonoma County Chardonnay. He also produces a limited edition Petite Sirah through EOS Estate Winery.

In 2005, Neil created the &quot;Off the Strip Poker Tournament&quot;, which takes place in Las Vegas.

In 2007, Neil launched his own brand of tequila called Tres Rios. Neil debuted the tequila at the Food Network South Beach Wine &amp; Food Festival in February 2007.

Neil opened Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s Bar and Grill in West Palm Beach. It took over two and a half years for all of the members of Mötley Crüe to agree and sign off on the bar concept and location. It was finally determined that it would be located in downtown West Palm Beach, close to the ocean and within the high rent district of downtown. On January 19, 2008, Neil played a free concert on the streets of downtown West Palm Beach to celebrate the grand opening of Dr Feelgood&#x27;s. In March 2009, Neil opened another Feelgood&#x27;s in Miami Beach. Vince also owns a Feelgood&#x27;s in Las Vegas.

In 2012, Vince Neil opened a gentleman&#x27;s club named Deja Vu Presents: Vince Neil&#x27;s Girls Girls Girls in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In April 2014, Vince Neil, as the chief executive officer and chairman of RockStar Investment Group, along with long-time friends and business partners Bob Hewko and Mark Daniels, acquired ownership of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Jacksonville Sharks in April 2014.

Neil was the owner of the Las Vegas Outlaws of the Arena Football League, but after 14 weeks of the season, the team was taken over by the league.

===Television and film===
In 1989, Neil had a small role for &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot;, which showed him being protected by Lieutenant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith). The scene was filmed, but didn&#x27;t make it into the final cut.

In 1990, Neil had a small part in the film &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; playing Bobby Black, lead vocalist of the fictional rock band that consisted of Carlos Cavazo, Randy Castillo, and Phil Soussan. Opening sequences of the film featured the band playing at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, where Neil&#x27;s character makes a grand entrance by swooping on stage via zip line.

In 2002, Neil was one of the cast members on the first season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. In 2004, Neil appeared on the special &quot;Remaking Vince Neil&quot;, which showed him trying to recharge his solo career. He also recorded the single &quot;Promise Me&quot; produced by Desmond Child. The song was for sale on iTunes for a brief period, but a solo album never surfaced.

In 2004, Neil played a tattoo artist in an episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Still Standing&quot;.

In 2009, Neil worked on a pilot for an A&amp;E reality TV show. According to Neil, the program would follow him and his family after his parents moved in with him. As Neil told Eddie Trunk, &quot;My wife [Lia] hasn&#x27;t talked to my mom since the wedding&quot;, which took place January 9, 2005, in Las Vegas.

In 2010, he was cast on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Skating with the Stars&quot; as a celebrity contestant who skated with professional ice skater Jennifer Wester.

In 2012, Neil participated in flight training in Henderson, Nevada for the PBS television series &quot;The Aviators&quot;, as reported by the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;.

In 2017, Neil was a cast member on &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot; until his elimination in task 7.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Neil has a son from his high school girlfriend, Tami Jones, named Neil Jason Wharton, born October 3, 1978.

Neil married his first wife, Beth Lynn, in 1981; they divorced in 1985. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Ashley Wharton, born October 29, 1983.

In April 1987, Neil married Sharise Ruddell, a mud wrestler and fashion model. The couple had one daughter, Skylar Lynnae Neil (March 26, 1991 – August 15, 1995), before divorcing in 1993.

In early 1993, he began dating actress and Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark after a blind date arranged by her makeup artist. The two were engaged within two months and married in 2000. After just 15 months of marriage and several attempts at reconciliation, they divorced in 2001.

Neil married his fourth wife, Lia Gerardini, in January 2005. The ceremony was officiated by MC Hammer, an ordained minister and fellow cast member on &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. In 2010, Neil announced their separation.

===Charity work===
On August 15, 1995, Neil and Ruddell&#x27;s daughter, Skylar Neil, died of cancer at the age of four. He founded the Skylar Neil Memorial Fund in her honor. Since that time, Neil and the foundation have raised awareness and funding for various children&#x27;s illnesses. The Skylar Neil Memorial Foundation has donated millions of dollars to The T.J. Martell Foundation, and it sponsors an annual golf tournament to raise money for children with cancer. In mid-2011, Neil hosted a series of benefits called Rockin&#x27; the Red Carpet that benefitted Music for Relief as part of his tour with Mötley Crüe, Poison and the New York Dolls.

===Legal issues===
During the 1980s with Mötley Crüe&#x27;s rising fame, Neil, along with his bandmates, was well known for using drugs, mostly cocaine, LSD, and heroin (which bandmate Nikki Sixx became addicted to); however, during an interview in 2015, Neil stated he had been using cocaine even before joining the band, and, like Sixx before him, became addicted to cocaine and heroin. Neil, as did his bandmates, went to rehab due to excessive usage of drugs.

In late 1984, Finnish hard rock band Hanoi Rocks was on their second American tour and their first to reach California. The two gigs meant to be held in Los Angeles sold out in only twenty minutes. On the day they arrived in Los Angeles, December 8, Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicholas &quot;Razzle&quot; Dingley and the other members of the band (with the exception of singer Michael Monroe, who was recovering from a fractured ankle) visited Neil&#x27;s home and spent the day in Redondo Beach. After partying for hours, Neil and Razzle decided to visit a local liquor store in Neil&#x27;s De Tomaso Pantera. Neil, who was drunk, lost control of the car and hit an oncoming vehicle. The two occupants of the other car were seriously injured and suffered brain damage, and Dingley was killed. Neil was charged with vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol in connection with the crash. His blood alcohol content was 0.17, well above the California legal limit at that time of 0.10. In September 1985, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Edward Hinz Jr. sentenced Neil to 30 days in jail and five years&#x27; probation. Neil was ordered to pay $2.6 million in restitution to the victims of the crash and undertake 200 hours of community service. Neil was paroled after serving 15 days in jail for good behavior; Mötley Crüe dedicated their third studio album, &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot;, to Razzle.

Neil was arrested in 2002 for punching record producer Michael Schuman in a nightclub parking lot. He was ordered to pay restitution and undertake community service.

In 2003, Neil was arrested again after accusations that he assaulted a sex worker at the Moonlite BunnyRanch by grabbing her around the throat and throwing her against a wall. On April 9, 2004, he pleaded no contest to battery charges and he was sentenced to a 30-day jail suspension. He was ordered to undergo 60 days of anger management counseling and was fined $1,000 plus court fees of $132.

On December 15, 2004, an arrest warrant for misdemeanor assault was issued for Neil after a fight during a show on October 30 where he left a soundman unconscious for 45 seconds. Police had given the singer a criminal-trespass warning before he left the club and headed to Houston for a Halloween show.

In 2007, Neil was arrested for suspicion of DUI in Las Vegas after police spotted him making some erratic moves in his Ferrari. He later worked out a deal with prosecutors where he pleaded guilty to reckless driving in exchange for them to drop the DUI charge.

In June 2010, Neil was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in Las Vegas after having allegedly smashed a fan&#x27;s camera, and was released on $2,000 bond. On January 26, 2011, he pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to 15 days in the Clark County jail along with 15 days under house arrest.

In March 2011, Neil was charged with battery and disorderly conduct after an altercation with ex-girlfriend Alicia Jacobs. On May 2, 2011, his attorneys pleaded not guilty on his behalf during an arraignment and he was ordered to stay away from Jacobs, then was scheduled to appear in court on August 8. On August 8, 2011, Neil&#x27;s trial was rescheduled for November 7 due to an unexplained emergency.

In December 2015, Neil, along with Rockstar Investment Group president Mark Daniels and vice president Robert Hewko, were sued by Sohrob Farudi for fraud over a $500,000 investment towards the Las Vegas Outlaws arena football team. In an unrelated legal issue, Neil was also cited by the East Bay area of San Francisco for violating the daily water cap of 1,000 gallons after his home in Danville was discovered to have wasted over 2,200 gallons a day. Neil was fined $2 per gallon over the cap, totaling to over $150,000. He claimed on his Facebook page that he had not lived in that house for over five years.

In April 2016, Neil was charged with misdemeanor battery for assaulting a woman outside the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Kelly Guerrero approached Neil for an autograph when he pulled her to the ground by her hair before actor Nicolas Cage restrained him. Neil pleaded guilty and struck a deal to receive six months&#x27; probation and was fined $1,000. Guerrero sued Neil for $150,000 for medical expenses, lost wages, and physical and emotional distress caused by the incident. In response, Neil demanded the case be thrown out, denying all allegations of wrongdoing and accusing Guerrero of seeking publicity. On December 10, 2018, Howard &amp; Howard Attorneys, PLLC requested to file a lien against Neil after the singer refused to pay $187,364.01 in legal fees. On July 8, 2019, a Federal judge ordered Neil to pay Howard &amp; Howard $170,169.56.

<text>A vigesimal ( ) or base-20 (base-score) numeral system is based on twenty (in the same way in which the decimal numeral system is based on ten). &quot;&quot; is derived from the Latin adjective , meaning &#x27;twentieth&#x27;.

== Places ==
In a vigesimal place system, twenty individual numerals (or digit symbols) are used, ten more than in the decimal system. One modern method of finding the extra needed symbols is to write ten as the letter A, or , where the 20 means base , to write nineteen as , and the numbers between with the corresponding letters of the alphabet. This is similar to the common computer-science practice of writing hexadecimal numerals over 9 with the letters &quot;A–F&quot;. Another less common method skips over the letter &quot;I&quot;, in order to avoid confusion between I20 as eighteen and one, so that the number eighteen is written as J20, and nineteen is written as K20. The number twenty is written as .


According to this notation:
: is equivalent to forty in decimal = 
: is equivalent to two hundred and sixty in decimal = 
: is equivalent to four hundred in decimal = .

In the rest of this article below, numbers are expressed in decimal notation, unless specified otherwise. For example, 10 means ten, 20 means twenty. Numbers in vigesimal notation use the convention that I means eighteen and J means nineteen.

== Fractions ==
As 20 is divisible by two and five and is adjacent to 21, the product of three and seven, thus covering the first four prime numbers, many vigesimal fractions have simple representations, whether terminating or recurring (although thirds are more complicated than in decimal, repeating two digits instead of one). In decimal, dividing by three twice (ninths) only gives one digit periods ( = 0.1111... for instance) because 9 is the number below ten. 21, however, the number adjacent to 20 that is divisible by 3, is not divisible by 9. Ninths in vigesimal have six-digit periods. As 20 has the same prime factors as 10 (two and five), a fraction will terminate in decimal if and only if it terminates in vigesimal.

== Cyclic numbers ==

The prime factorization of twenty is 22 × 5, so it is not a perfect power. However, its squarefree part, 5, is congruent to 1 (mod 4). Thus, according to Artin&#x27;s conjecture on primitive roots, vigesimal has infinitely many cyclic primes, but the fraction of primes that are cyclic is not necessarily ~37.395%. An UnrealScript program that computes the lengths of recurring periods of various fractions in a given set of bases found that, of the first 15,456 primes, ~39.344% are cyclic in vigesimal.

==Use==

===Quinary-vigesimal===
Many cultures that use a vigesimal system count in fives to twenty, then count twenties similarly. Such a system is referred to as &quot;quinary-vigesimal&quot; by linguists. Examples include Greenlandic, Iñupiaq, Kaktovik, Maya, Nunivak Cupʼig, and Yupʼik numerals.

===Africa===
Vigesimal systems are common in Africa, for example in Yoruba. While the Yoruba number system may be regarded as a vigesimal system, it is complex.

===Americas===
* Twenty is a base in the Maya and Aztec number systems. The Maya use the following names for the powers of twenty: (20), (202 = 400), (203 = 8,000), (204 = 160,000), (205 = 3,200,000) and (206 = 64,000,000). See Maya numerals and Maya calendar, Nahuatl language.
* The Inuit-Yupik-Unangax languages have base-20 number systems. In 1994, Inuit students in Kaktovik, Alaska, came up with the base-20 Kaktovik numerals to better represent their language. Before this invention led to a revival, the Inuit numerals had been falling out of use. The Kaktovik numerals are:
===Asia===
* Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan, has a full vigesimal system, with numerals for the powers of 20, 400, 8,000 and 160,000. 
*Atong, a language spoken in the South Garo Hills of Meghalaya state, Northeast India, and adjacent areas in Bangladesh, has a full vigesimal system that is nowadays considered archaic.
* In Santali, a Munda language of India, &quot;fifty&quot; is expressed by the phrase &quot;bār isī gäl&quot;, literally &quot;two twenty ten.&quot; Likewise, in Didei, another Munda language spoken in India, complex numerals are decimal to 19 and decimal-vigesimal to 399.
* The Burushaski number system is base-20. For example, 20 altar, 40 alto-altar (2 times 20), 60 iski-altar (3 times 20) etc.
* In East Asia, the Ainu language also uses a counting system that is based around the number 20. &quot; is 20, &quot; (ten more until two twenties) is 30, &quot; (two twenties) is 40, &quot; (five twenties) is 100. Subtraction is also heavily used, e.g. &quot;&quot; (one more until ten) is 9.
* The Chukchi language has a vigesimal numeral system.

===Oceania===
There is some evidence of base-20 usage in the Māori language of New Zealand as seen in the terms &quot;Te Hokowhitu a Tu&quot; referring to a war party (literally &quot;the seven 20s of Tu&quot;) and &quot;Tama-hokotahi&quot;, referring to a great warrior (&quot;the one man equal to 20&quot;).

===Caucasus===
* Twenty (, ) is used as a base number in Georgian for numbers 30 to 99. For example, 31 (, ) literally means, &quot;twenty-and-eleven&quot;. 67 (, ) is said as, &quot;three-twenty-and-seven&quot;.
* Twenty () is used as a base number in the Nakh languages (Chechen, Ingush, and Batsbi).

===Europe===
In several European languages like French and Danish, 20 is used as a base, at least with respect to the linguistic structure of the names of certain numbers (though a thoroughgoing consistent vigesimal system, based on the powers 20, 400, 8000 etc., is not generally used).

* Twenty () is used as a base number in the French names of numbers from 70 to 99, except in the French of Belgium, Switzerland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley and the Channel Islands. For example, , the French word for &quot;80&quot;, literally means &quot;four-twenties&quot;; &quot;soixante-dix&quot;, the word for &quot;70&quot;, is literally &quot;sixty-ten&quot;; (&quot;75&quot;) is literally &quot;sixty-fifteen&quot;; (&quot;87&quot;) is literally &quot;four-twenties-seven&quot;; (&quot;90&quot;) is literally &quot;four-twenties-ten&quot;; and (&quot;96&quot;) is literally &quot;four-twenties-sixteen&quot;. However, in the French of Belgium, Switzerland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley, and the Channel Islands, the numbers 70 and 90 generally have the names and . Therefore, the year 1996 is in Parisian French, but it is in Belgian French. In Switzerland, &quot;80&quot; can be (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg).
* Twenty () is used as a base number in the Danish names of tens from 50 to 90. For example, (short for ) means 3 times 20, i.e. 60. However, Danish numerals are not vigesimal since it is only the names of some of the tens that are etymologically formed in a vigesimal way. In contrast with e.g. French , the units only go from zero to nine between each ten which is a defining trait of a decimal system. For details, see Danish numerals.
* Twenty () is used as a base number in the Breton names of numbers from 40 to 49 and from 60 to 99. For example, means 2 times 20, i.e. 40, and (literally &quot;three-six and four-twenty&quot;) means 3×6 + 4×20, i.e. 98. However, 30 is and not * (&quot;ten and twenty&quot;), and 50 is (&quot;half-hundred&quot;).
* Twenty () is used as a base number in Welsh from numbers up to 50 () and from 60 to 100 (), although since the 1940s a decimal counting system has come to be preferred. However, the vigesimal system exclusively is used for ordinal numbers and is still required in telling the time, money, and with weights and measures. means &#x27;two twenties&#x27; i.e. 40, means &#x27;three twenties&#x27; i.e. 60, etc. means 57 (two on fifteen and forty). Like with Breton, 50 is (&quot;half-hundred&quot;). Prior to its withdrawal from circulation, (note of sixscore) was the nickname for the ten-shilling (120 pence) note; due to 120 pence = half a pound sterling. the term continues to be used to mean 50 pence in modern Welsh and phrases like (&#x27;50p piece&#x27;) is also not uncommon.
* Twenty () is traditionally used as a base number in Scottish Gaelic, with or being 30 (ten over twenty, or twenty and ten), 40 (two twenties), 50 (two twenty and ten) / 50 (half a hundred), 60 (three twenties) and so on up to 180 (nine twenties). Nowadays a decimal system is taught in schools, but the vigesimal system is still used by many, particularly older speakers.
* Twenty () is traditionally used as a base number in Manx Gaelic, with being 30 (ten and twenty), 40 (two twenties), 50 (ten and two twenties), 60 (three twenty) and so on. A decimal system also exists, using the following tens: (ten), (twenty), (thirty), (forty), (fifty), (sixty), (seventy), (eighty) and (ninety).
* Twenty () is used as a base number in Albanian. The word for 40 () means &quot;two times 20&quot;. The Arbëreshë in Italy may use for 60. Formerly, was also used for 80. Today Cham Albanians in Greece use all numbers. Basically, 20 means 1 , 40 means 2 , 60 means 3 and 80 means 4 . Albanian is the only language in the Balkans which has retained elements of the vigesimal numeral system side by side with decimal system. The existence of the two systems in Albanian reflect the contribution of Pre-Indo-European people of the Balkans to the formation of the Paleo-Balkan Indo-European tribes and their language.
* Twenty () is used as a base number in Basque for numbers up to 100 (). The words for 40 (), 60 () and 80 () mean &quot;two-score&quot;, &quot;three-score&quot; and &quot;four-score&quot;, respectively. For example, the number 75 is called , lit. &quot;three-score-and ten-five&quot;. The Basque nationalist Sabino Arana proposed a vigesimal digit system to match the spoken language, and, as an alternative, a reform of the spoken language to make it decimal, but both are mostly forgotten.
* Twenty ( or ) is used as a base number in the Resian dialect (3×20), 70 by (3×20 + 10), 80 by (4×20) and 90 by (4×20 + 10).
* In the £sd currency system (used in the United Kingdom pre-1971), there were 20 shillings (worth 12 pence each) to the pound. Under the decimal system introduced in 1971 (1 pound equals 100 new pence instead of 240 pence in the old system), the shilling coins still in circulation were re-valued at 5 pence (no more were minted and the shilling coin was demonetised in 1990).
* In the imperial weight system there are twenty hundredweight in a ton.
* In English, the name of the cardinal number 20 is most commonly phrased with the word &#x27;twenty&#x27;. Counting by the score has been used historically; for example, the famous opening of the Gettysburg Address, &quot;Four score and seven years ago...&quot;, refers to the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, 87 years earlier. In the King James Bible, the term &quot;score&quot; is used over 130 times, though a single score is always expressed as &quot;twenty&quot;. &quot;Score&quot; is still occasionally used to denote groups of 20 analogously to the use of &quot;dozen&quot; to quantify groups of 12.
* Other languages have terms similar to &quot;score&quot;, such as Danish and Norwegian .
* Even in regions where greater aspects of the Brythonic Celtic languages may be less apparent in modern dialect, sheep enumeration systems that are vigesimal are recalled to the present day. See .

=== Software applications ===

Open Location Code uses a word-safe version of base 20 for its geocodes. The characters in this alphabet were chosen to avoid accidentally forming words. The developers scored all possible sets of 20 letters in 30 different languages for likelihood of forming words, and chose a set that formed as few recognizable words as possible. The alphabet is also intended to reduce typographical errors by avoiding visually similar digits, and is case-insensitive.

===Related observations===
* Among multiples of 10, 20 is described in a special way in some languages. For example, the Spanish words (30) and (40) consist of &quot; (10 times)&quot;, &quot; (10 times)&quot;, but the word (20) is not presently connected to any word meaning &quot;two&quot; (although historically it is). Similarly, in Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, the numbers 30, 40 ... 90 are expressed by morphologically plural forms of the words for the numbers 3, 4 ... 9, but the number 20 is expressed by a morphologically plural form of the word for 10. The Japanese language has a special word (hatachi) for 20 years (of age), and for the 20th day of the month (hatsuka).
* In some languages (e.g. English, Slavic languages and German), the names of the two-digit numbers from 11 to 19 consist of one word, but the names of the two-digit numbers from 21 on consist of two words. So for example, the English words eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13) etc., as opposed to &quot;twenty&quot;-one (21), &quot;twenty&quot;-two (22), &quot;twenty&quot;-three (23), etc. In French, this is true up to 16. In a number of other languages (such as Hebrew), the names of the numbers from 11 to 19 contain two words, but one of these words is a special &quot;teen&quot; form, which is different from the ordinary form of the word for the number 10, and it may in fact be only found in these names of the numbers 11–19.
* Cantonese and Wu Chinese frequently use the single unit (Cantonese &quot;yàh&quot;, Shanghainese &quot;nyae&quot; or &quot;ne&quot;, Mandarin &quot;niàn&quot;) for twenty, in addition to the fully decimal (Cantonese &quot;yìh sàhp&quot;, Shanghainese &quot;el sah&quot;, Mandarin &quot;èr shí&quot;) which literally means &quot;two ten&quot;. Equivalents exist for 30 and 40 ( and respectively: Mandarin &quot;sà&quot; and &quot;xì&quot;), but these are more seldom used. This is a historic remnant of a vigesimal system.
* Although Khmer numerals have represented a decimal positional notation system since at least the 7th century, Old Khmer, or Angkorian Khmer, also possessed separate symbols for the numbers 10, 20, and 100. Each multiple of 20 or 100 would require an additional stroke over the character, so the number 47 was constructed using the 20 symbol with an additional upper stroke, followed by the symbol for number 7. This suggests that spoken Angkorian Khmer used a vigesimal system.
* Thai uses the term (&quot;yi sip&quot;) for 20. Other multiples of ten consist of the base number, followed by the word for ten, e.g. (&quot;sam sip&quot;), lit. three ten, for thirty. The &quot;yi&quot; of &quot;yi sip&quot; is different from the number two in other positions, which is สอง (&quot;song&quot;). Nevertheless, &quot;yi sip&quot; is a loan word from Chinese.
* Lao similarly forms multiples of ten by putting the base number in front of the word ten, so (&quot;sam sip&quot;), litt. three ten, for thirty. The exception is twenty, for which the word (&quot;xao&quot;) is used. ( &quot;sao&quot; is also used in the North-Eastern and Northern dialects of Thai, but not in standard Thai.)
* The Kharosthi numeral system behaves like a partial vigesimal system.

<doc id="209198" wikidata="Q851991" url="?curid=209198" title="Swordfishtrombones">
<text>Swordfishtrombones is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, released in 1983 on Island Records. It was the first album that Waits self-produced. Stylistically different from his previous albums, &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; moves away from conventional piano-based songwriting towards unusual instrumentation and a somewhat more abstract and experimental rock approach. The album peaked at No. 167 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums and 200 albums charts. 

It is often considered the first in a loose trilogy that includes &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; and &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;. Per &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;These are records of startling originality and playfulness, of cacophonous discord and sudden heartbreaking melody, in which it seemed the artist was trying to incorporate the whole history of American song into his loose-limbed poetic storytelling.&quot;

==Background==
The album marks the beginning of Waits&#x27;s eclectic use of instruments. As he put it in a contemporary interview: &quot;Some of the stuff I think is a bit of a departure for me. The instrumentation is all different, and no saxophones. I used the banjo, accordion, bass-marimba, metal aunglongs, you know, African squeeze drum, a calliope, a harmonium. So some of the stuff is a little more exotic.&quot;

&quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; also represented a lyrical departure. Per AllMusic, Lyrically, Waits&#x27; tales of the drunken and the lovelorn have been replaced by surreal accounts of people who burned down their homes and of Australian towns bypassed by the railroad -- a world (not just a neighborhood) of misfits now have his attention. The music can be primitive, moving to odd time signatures, while Waits alternately howls and wheezes in his gravelly bass voice. He seems to have moved on from Hoagy Carmichael and Louis Armstrong to Kurt Weill and Howlin&#x27; Wolf (as impersonated by Captain Beefheart).

==Artwork==
The cover art is a TinTone photograph by Michael A. Russ showing Waits with the actors Angelo Rossitto and Lee Kolima.

==Reception==
&quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; was ranked the second best album of 1983 by &quot;NME&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; the second greatest album of all time. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number 11 in its 2002 list of the best albums of the 1980s. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; listed it as the 36th best album of the 1980s, while in 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed it as the decade&#x27;s 26th best album. In 2000, it was voted number 374 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Elvis Costello included &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; on his list of essential albums, highlighting &quot;16 Shells From a Thirty-Ought-Six&quot; and &quot;In the Neighborhood&quot;.

Jim Sclavunos recalls &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; was a bombshell to say the least. That an artist with a gift for writing tunes so evocative of memories real and imagined would decisively rend the fabric of his well-established image, and trade in coolly louche atmospherics for neon-lit junkyard sonic grotesquery was a perverse strategy that I couldn’t help admiring. These no-holds-barred albums set the stage for the years of innovation upon innovation that followed.

<doc id="209199" wikidata="Q1034313" url="?curid=209199" title="List of domesticated plants">
<text>This is a list of plants that have been domesticated by humans. The list includes individual plant species identified by their common names as well as larger formal and informal botanical categories which include at least some domesticated individuals. Plants in this list are grouped by the original or primary purpose for which they were domesticated, and subsequently by botanical or culinary categories. Plants with more than one significant human use may be listed in multiple categories.

Plants are considered domesticated when their life cycle, behavior, or appearance has been significantly altered as a result of being under artificial selection by humans for multiple generations (see the main article on domestication for more information). Thousands of distinct plant species have been domesticated throughout human history. Not all modern domesticated plant varieties can be found growing in the wild; many are actually hybrids of two or more naturally occurring species and therefore have no wild counterpart.

<text>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies is the second studio album by the English rock band New Order, released on 2 May 1983 by Factory Records. The album features more electronic tracks than their 1981 debut &quot;Movement&quot;, with heavier use of synthesisers. The album was met with widespread acclaim, and has been included in music industry lists of the greatest albums of the 1980s and of all time. The cover artwork was by Peter Saville, and in 2010 it was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

==Content==
A development of New Order&#x27;s 1981 debut album &quot;Movement&quot;, the album combines the band&#x27;s roots in post-punk with influences from electronic music. The track &quot;5-8-6&quot; has been called &quot;a literal interpretation of early house music&quot;, while influences from Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder has also been noted. Darker songs such as &quot;We All Stand&quot; and “Your Silent Face” are contrasted with brighter and more optimistic songs such as &quot;The Village”. The hit single &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was not included on the album but released separately on a twelve-inch single.

== Artwork ==
Peter Saville&#x27;s design for the album had a colour-based code to represent the band&#x27;s name and the title of the album, but they were not actually written on the original UK sleeve itself (they were present on some non-UK versions), although the catalogue number &quot;FACT 75&quot; does appear on the top-right corner. The decoder for the code was featured prominently on the back cover of the album and can also be seen on the &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot; singles and for Section 25&#x27;s third studio album &quot;From the Hip&quot; (1984).

The cover is a reproduction of the painting &quot;A Basket of Roses&quot; by French artist Henri Fantin-Latour, which is part of the National Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection in London. Saville had originally planned to use a Renaissance portrait of a dark prince to tie in with the Machiavellian theme of the title, but could not find a suitable portrait. At the gallery Saville picked up a postcard with Fantin-Latour&#x27;s painting, and his girlfriend mockingly asked him if he was going to use it for the cover. Saville then realised it was a great idea. Saville suggested that the flowers &quot;suggested the means by which power, corruption and lies infiltrate our lives. They&#x27;re seductive.&quot;

The cover was also intended to create a collision between the overly romantic and classic image that made a stark contrast to the typography based on the modular, colour-coded alphabet. Saville and Tony Wilson, the head of New Order&#x27;s label Factory Records, also said that the owner of the painting (The National Heritage Trust) first refused the label access to it. Wilson then called up the gallery director to ask who actually owned the painting and was given the answer that the Trust belonged to the people of Britain, at some point. Wilson then replied, &quot;I believe the people want it.&quot; The director then replied, &quot;If you put it like that, Mr Wilson, I&#x27;m sure we can make an exception in this case.&quot;

The cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010. Fashion designer Raf Simons used the album&#x27;s cover art on one of his most coveted pieces from the Autumn/Winter 2003 &quot;Closer&quot; collection, ultimately producing four fishtail parkas in varying colours with various pieces of New Order/Joy Division artwork spread around the pieces. The street-fashion label Supreme included the album&#x27;s floral motif as part of their Spring–Summer 2013 collection.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; was praised critically on its release, and is still well regarded. In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Steve Pond felt that the band had finally separated themselves from their past Joy Division associations, calling the album a &quot;remarkable declaration of independence&quot; and a &quot;quantum leap&quot; over &quot;Movement&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found it &quot;relatively gentle and melodic in its ambient postindustrial polyrhythms, their nicest record ever&quot;, but also &quot;pretty much like the others.&quot; The album placed at number 23 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s 1983 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. In a retrospective review, Josh Modell of The A.V. Club called &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; &quot;the sound of a band coming out of the shadows, retaining some of the pop elements of older days, but also embracing happiness and a whole new world of sequencers,&quot; crediting the album&#x27;s humanity as a part of its charm. John Bush of AllMusic stated that the album &quot;cemented New Order&#x27;s place as the most exciting dance-rock hybrid in music.&quot;

In 1989, &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; was ranked number 94 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s, with the magazine citing it as &quot;a landmark album of danceable, post-punk music&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also placed the album at number 262 on the 2020 edition of its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time (it was not included on the original 2003 and 2012 lists). It was placed at number 28 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the best albums of the 1980s, with William Bowers&#x27; accompanying write-up for the album citing it as &quot;the peak of the New Order&#x27;s stellar 80s output.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 23 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s and stated that it &quot;marks the real beginning of New Order&#x27;s career&quot; and was &quot;their first perfect pop record&quot;. In 2013, it was ranked at number 216 on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

<doc id="209203" wikidata="Q1301561" url="?curid=209203" title="List of domesticated animals">
<text>This page gives a list of domesticated animals, also including a list of animals which are or may be currently undergoing the process of domestication and animals that have an extensive relationship with humans beyond simple predation. This includes species which are semi-domesticated, undomesticated but captive-bred on a commercial scale, or commonly wild-caught, at least occasionally captive-bred, and tameable. In order to be considered fully domesticated, most species have undergone significant genetic, behavioural and morphological changes from their wild ancestors, while others have changed very little from their wild ancestors despite hundreds or thousands of years of potential selective breeding. A number of factors determine how quickly any changes may occur in a species, but there is not always a desire to improve a species from its wild form. Domestication is a gradual process, so there is no precise moment in the history of a given species when it can be considered to have become fully domesticated.

Zooarchaeology has identified three classes of animal domesticates:
# Pets (dogs, cats, ferrets, hamsters, etc.)
# Livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.)
# Beasts of burden (horses, camels, donkeys, etc.)

== Domesticated animals ==
== Tame, partially domesticated, and widely captive-bred animals ==
Due to the somewhat unclear outlines of what precisely constitutes domestication, there are some species that may or may not be fully domesticated. There are also some species that are extensively commercially used by humans, but are not significantly altered from wild-type animals. Many animals on this second table are at least somewhat altered from wild-type animals due to their extensive interactions with humans, albeit not to the point that they are regarded as distinct forms (therefore, no separate wild ancestors are noted) or would be unable to survive if reintroduced to the wild.


== Taxonomical groupings ==
The categories used in the Taxon group column are: 
*1a: &quot;Artiodactyla&quot; except &quot;Bovidae&quot;, 1b: &quot;Bovidae&quot;, 1c: &quot;Carnivora&quot;, 1d: &quot;Rodentia&quot;, 1e: &quot;Other mammals&quot;
*2a: &quot;Anseriformes&quot;, 2b: &quot;Galliformes&quot;, 2c: &quot;Columbiformes&quot;, 2d: &quot;Passeriformes&quot;, 2e: &quot;Psittaciformes&quot;, 2f: &quot;Palaeognathae&quot; , 2g: &quot;Other birds&quot;
*3a: &quot;Serpentes&quot;, 3b: &quot;Lacertilia&quot;, 3c: &quot;Testudines&quot;, 3d: &quot;Other reptiles&quot;
*4a: &quot;Anura&quot;, 4b: &quot;Other amphibians&quot;
*5a: &quot;Cyprinidae&quot;, 5b: &quot;Other fish&quot;
*6a: &quot;Hymenoptera&quot;, 6b: &quot;Other insects&quot;, 6c: &quot;Other arthropods&quot;
*7a: &quot;Mollusca&quot;, 7b: &quot;Annelida&quot;, 7c: &quot;Other animals&quot;

<text>Pancho &amp; Lefty by Townes Van Zandt (1972) became well-known through a honky tonk album by outlaw country musicians Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson, released in 1983. Original vinyl copies from 1983 give the album&#x27;s title as &quot;Poncho &amp; Lefty&quot; on the cover, as well as on the inner sleeve and the record label; the album&#x27;s title track is similarly rendered &quot;Poncho &amp; Lefty&quot; on the cover, inner sleeve, and label. Later editions correct the title to the intended &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty.” They are backed by Don Markham of The Strangers.

==Background==
The title track was written by Texas songwriter Townes Van Zandt and was recorded towards the end of the recording sessions. The song tells the story of a Mexican bandit named Pancho and a more mysterious character, his associate Lefty, and implies that Pancho was killed after he was betrayed by Lefty, who was paid off by the Mexican federales. In the Van Zandt documentary &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot;, Nelson recalls how the album with Haggard was nearly completed but he felt they didn&#x27;t have &quot;that blockbuster, you know, that one big song for a good single and a video, and my daughter Lana suggested that we listen to &#x27;Pancho and Lefty&#x27;. I had never heard it and Merle had never heard it.&quot; Lana Nelson returned with a copy of the song and Nelson cut it immediately with his band in the middle of the night but had to retrieve a sleeping Haggard, who had retired to his bus hours earlier, to record his vocal part. Van Zandt appears in the video for the song playing one of the Mexican federales. &quot;It was real nice they invited me,&quot; Van Zandt told Aretha Sills in 1994. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music singles chart. A second single, the sombre &quot;Reasons to Quit,&quot; was another Top 10 hit.

Haggard and Nelson would record another album together, &quot;Seashores of Old Mexico&quot;, in 1987.

==Reception==

Martin Monkman of AllMusic calls the album &quot;an album by two legends that lives up to, and at one point exceeds, expectations... one gets the sense that this is a collaboration in every sense.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau wrote &quot;Haggard hasn&#x27;t sung with so much care in years, which is obviously Nelson&#x27;s doing...&quot;

<doc id="209210" wikidata="Q2002548" url="?curid=209210" title="Texas Flood">
<text>Texas Flood is the debut studio album by the American blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, released on June 13, 1983, by Epic Records. The album was named after a cover song featured on the album, &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, which was first recorded by blues singer Larry Davis in 1958. Produced by the band and recording engineer Richard Mullen, &quot;Texas Flood&quot; was recorded in the space of three days at Jackson Browne&#x27;s personal recording studio in Los Angeles. Vaughan wrote six of the album&#x27;s ten tracks.

Two singles, &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot; and &quot;Pride and Joy&quot;, were released from the album. A music video was made for &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot; and received regular rotation on MTV in 1983. &quot;Texas Flood&quot; was reissued in 1999 with five bonus tracks, including an interview segment, studio outtake, and three live tracks recorded on September 23, 1983, at The Palace in Hollywood, California. The album was reissued again in 2013, with two CDs in celebration of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Disc 1 is the original album with one bonus track, &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;. Disc 2 is selections from a previously unreleased concert recorded at Ripley&#x27;s Music Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 20, 1983, originally recorded for the King Biscuit Flower Hour radio program.

&quot;Texas Flood&quot; received positive reviews, with critics praising the deep blues sound, and Vaughan’s songwriting, while some criticized the album for straying too far from mainstream rock. A retrospective review by AllMusic awarded it five out of five stars.

==Background==
Vaughan and Double Trouble had performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1982 and caught the attention of musician Jackson Browne. He offered the band three days&#x27; free use of his Los Angeles recording studio. They accepted the offer and recorded a demo during Thanksgiving weekend in late November. It was heard by record producer John H. Hammond, who had discovered artists such as Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen among many others. He presented the demo to Greg Geller, head of A&amp;R at Epic Records, and arranged a recording contract.

==Recording and production==
As the first day of production largely involved setting up equipment, &quot;Texas Flood&quot; was recorded in two days, with no overdubs. In early 1983, subsequent to the band&#x27;s signing with Epic, they were given an advance of $65,000 to re-master the recordings. The album was mixed and mastered in New York City. The recordings were released as &quot;Texas Flood&quot; in June 1983.

Bassist Tommy Shannon recalls of the sessions, &quot;It really was just a big warehouse with concrete floors and some rugs thrown down. We just found a little corner, set up in a circle looking at and listening to each other and played like a live band.&quot; Vaughan used two Fender Vibroverbs and a 150-watt Dumbleland Special owned by Browne. A combination of these amps marked the first time Vaughan used the Dumbleland Special, which contributed to his trademark sound. Engineer and co-producer Richard Mullen says of his production techniques: 

==Touring==

Vaughan and Double Trouble toured North America and Europe in June–December 1983 to support &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. On July 15, 1983, they performed at the Rooftop Skyroom Bar in Buffalo, NY, then July 20 the El Mocambo in Toronto and a film was released in December 1999 by Sony named &quot;Live at the El Mocambo&quot; on DVD. A performance from &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; was also released on the video &quot;Live from Austin, Texas&quot;. On August 22, 1983, the band performed a sold-out concert at The Palace in Hollywood. The show was broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour and three tracks were included on the reissue of &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. The tour continued on through Europe and the band appeared at the Reading Festival in England. They went back to the United States and opened 17 shows for The Moody Blues.

==Reception==
&quot;Texas Flood&quot; was released on June 13, 1983, with two singles released from the album—&quot;Pride and Joy&quot; and &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;. &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; peaked at #20 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Texas Flood&quot; was nominated for Best Traditional Blues Performance and &quot;Rude Mood&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. The album was mostly well received by critics. A retrospective five-star AllMusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as a &quot;monumental impact&quot; and said it &quot;sparked a revitalization of the blues&quot;. Despite many positive responses, it also received some negative notices with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticizing Vaughan for a lack of originality and claiming that he did not possess a distinctive style.

&quot;Texas Monthly&quot; gave the album a positive review, calling Vaughan &quot;the most exciting guitarist to come out of Texas since Johnny Winter&quot;. In a less enthusiastic review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau felt that the album lacked &quot;momentum and song form&quot;, which he averred to be the essence of rock and roll. It was the lack of these characteristics that was, he said, the reason his attention wandered &quot;after the kickoff originals &#x27;Love Struck Baby&#x27; and &#x27;Pride and Joy.&#x27;&quot; The album peaked at #38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart immediately after its release. It went platinum in Canada and double-platinum in the United States, selling over 2,000,000 units.

On December 21, 2020, it was announced that the album was a 2021 inductee into the Grammy Hall of Fame in recognition of its historical significance.

<text>Right or Wrong is the third studio album by American country music artist George Strait, released on October 6, 1983, by MCA Records.

&quot;Right or Wrong&quot; topped Billboard&#x27;s (North America) Top Country albums chart, and peaked at #163 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

There were three cover songs on the album: 1) &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, a traditional song dating back to the 1920s which was previously most associated with the Emmett Miller and Bob Wills versions; 2) the Hank Williams song &quot;I&#x27;m Satisfied with You&quot;; and 3) the Merle Haggard song, &quot;Our Paths May Never Cross&quot;. The album was recorded and mixed digitally.

<text>Kill &#x27;Em All is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 25, 1983, through the independent label Megaforce Records. After forming in 1981, Metallica began by playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They recorded several demos to gain attention from club owners and eventually relocated to San Francisco to secure the services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group&#x27;s &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot; demo tape (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a budget of $15,000 (equivalent to $48,835.49 in 2025) for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled &quot;Metal Up Your Ass&quot;, with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. Zazula convinced the band to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success.

Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill &#x27;Em All for One tour with English heavy metal band Raven in the US. The album also generated two singles: &quot;Whiplash&quot; and &quot;Jump in the Fire&quot;. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the US, the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide by the end of Metallica&#x27;s Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984. The album did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until 1986, when it peaked at number 155, following Metallica&#x27;s commercial success with its third studio album, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;; the 1988 Elektra reissue peaked at number 120. &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was critically praised at the time of its release and has since been regarded as a groundbreaking album for thrash metal, because of its &quot;precise musicianship, which fused new wave of British heavy metal riffs with hardcore punk tempos&quot;. It was also retrospectively placed on a few publications&#x27; best album lists. The album&#x27;s musical approach and lyrics were markedly different from rock&#x27;s mainstream of the early 1980s and inspired a number of bands who followed in a similar manner. It was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States.

==Background and recording==

Metallica was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by drummer Lars Ulrich and by vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield. Before settling on a definitive lineup, Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel asked Metallica to record a song for the first edition of his &quot;Metal Massacre&quot; compilation. Hetfield and Ulrich chose &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; from Hetfield&#x27;s and his childhood friend Ron McGovney&#x27;s previous band Leather Charm, and recorded it with Hetfield on vocals, McGovney on bass, and temporary guitarist Lloyd Grant. The band&#x27;s first lineup featured Hetfield, Ulrich, McGovney, and guitarist Dave Mustaine, who was acquired through a newspaper advertisement. The band practiced in McGovney&#x27;s garage and looked for gigs at local clubs. Metallica&#x27;s first show was on March 14, 1982, at the Radio City in Anaheim. The nine-song setlist consisted of two originals (&quot;Hit the Lights&quot; and an unfinished version of &quot;Jump in the Fire&quot; from Mustaine&#x27;s earlier band Panic) and covers of new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands such as Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Savage, and Sweet Savage. The gig did not go as well as planned, because Mustaine had problems with the guitar distortion pedal, and broke a string during a song. Metallica&#x27;s second gig was on March 27, 1982, at Hollywood&#x27;s Whisky a Go Go, opening for Saxon. Although Mötley Crüe was originally scheduled to open the show, the group canceled because of its growing popularity. Metallica recorded a three-song demo to persuade the venue&#x27;s management to allow the band to open for Saxon. Metallica&#x27;s third concert was in April 1982, the first time &quot;The Mechanix&quot;, written by Mustaine during his tenure with Panic, was played. Mustaine interacted with the fans at Metallica&#x27;s earliest shows because Hetfield was shy.

To garner attention from club owners, Metallica recorded the &quot;Power Metal&quot; demo in April 1982, which featured &quot;Motorbreath&quot; in addition to the already-performed originals. The logo, displaying the band&#x27;s name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs and italicized, was designed by Hetfield. The &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot; demo was recorded in July 1982, and it created a buzz in the underground tape trading circles. &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot; featured a re-recorded version of &quot;Hit the Lights&quot;, which appeared on the second pressing of &quot;Metal Massacre&quot;, in addition to new songs such as &quot;Phantom Lord&quot;, &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot;, and &quot;Metal Militia&quot;. The recording and mastering were financed by Kenny Kane, owner of the punk label High Velocity, and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott. Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band in December. Ulrich was impressed by Cliff Burton&#x27;s performance with Trauma at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, and offered to let him join the band. Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area. Moving to El Cerrito in February 1983, the band stayed and rehearsed at Exodus manager Mark Whitaker&#x27;s house, which they called the &quot;Metallica Mansion&quot;. Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel&#x27;s independent label on an $8,000 budget ($24,722 in 2023). Slagel could not afford the record, and Ulrich contacted Jon Zazula, a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had already heard &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot;. Metallica rented a U-Haul truck and drove to New Jersey in late March, and upon arrival, allowed Zazula to sell copies of &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot; to help him found Megaforce Records because no label wanted to finance the album&#x27;s recording.

Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on the morning of April 11 after a gig in New York, because of his drug and alcohol problems, overly aggressive behavior, and clashes with bandmates. On Whitaker&#x27;s recommendation, Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett, who played in Exodus and was a one-time student of Joe Satriani. Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later. Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America Studios in Rochester, and recorded the album in two weeks. Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions, the band members stayed over in people&#x27;s houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in Jamaica, Queens, where Anthrax held rehearsals. Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band. He thought the initial tapes sounded very distorted and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs. Metallica resented Curcio&#x27;s involvement, because he seemed uninterested, and had little impact on the sound. Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine&#x27;s solos, Hammett&#x27;s guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine&#x27;s original solos, with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure. Despite their differences, Mustaine&#x27;s contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged, and he received four co-writing credits on &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. Zazula was not pleased with the initial mix because he thought that the drums were too loud, and the guitars were too low in the mix. The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz, according to Zazula&#x27;s instructions. The final cost for the record rounded to an estimated $15,000 ($46,354 in 2023), which nearly caused Zazula to go bankrupt. &quot;This was mortgage money I&#x27;m spending, not something I&#x27;ve got put by I&#x27;m going to invest,&quot; he said later. Zazula had a hard time finding a distributor for the record, but he eventually convinced Relativity Records to distribute the album in the US and Canada, and Music for Nations in Europe.
The band intended to title the album &quot;Metal Up Your Ass&quot; with a cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change the title, because he thought that distributors would not stock it as it was too explicit to display. The final cover featured the shadow of a hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;—referring to timid record distributors, saying, &quot;Those record company fuckers ... kill &#x27;em all!&quot;—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, &quot;Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things.&quot; Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a &quot;Metal Up Your Ass&quot; T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled &quot;Metal Up Your Ass (Live)&quot;, featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and a standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the silver labels with the track listing but without track lengths. Every issue produced has had the phrase &quot;Bang That Head That Doesn&#x27;t Bang&quot;. The phrase &quot;Bang That Head That Doesn&#x27;t Bang&quot; was dedicated to San Francisco fan Rich Burch, known for his headbanging at the band&#x27;s early shows.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in thrash metal&#x27;s genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica&#x27;s subsequent albums. Hetfield&#x27;s vocals evolved from the melodic wail on &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot; to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. Author Joel McIver described Burton&#x27;s and Hetfield&#x27;s performances as nearly virtuosic, highlighting Burton&#x27;s smooth-sounding bass and Hetfield&#x27;s precise picking skills. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a &quot;naive charm&quot;. The musical approach on &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica&#x27;s street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock.
&quot;Hit the Lights&quot; was based on an unfinished Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich, and the two worked out different arrangements. Performed at 160 beats per minute, &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; opens with fade-in distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield. The song is driven by the 16th note repeated main riff and the continuous eighth note snare drum hits. The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high-pitched vocals. The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett, who performed cleaner and more melodic versions of Mustaine&#x27;s leads.
&quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; is a revamp of the Mustaine-penned &quot;The Mechanix&quot;, which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station. A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on Megadeth&#x27;s debut &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; (1985), named &quot;Mechanix&quot;. Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music, Hetfield wrote lyrics about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and added a bridge and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle. Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;.
&quot;Motorbreath&quot; was written by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song is based on a four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most recognizable parts are Ulrich&#x27;s drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett&#x27;s solos.

&quot;Jump in the Fire&quot; was the first song ever written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield&#x27;s revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan&#x27;s point of view, describing how the devil watches people killing each other, and is sure they will go to hell for their actions. &quot;Jump in the Fire&quot; was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom. The single featured &quot;Phantom Lord&quot; and &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot; as live tracks, although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them. The single&#x27;s cover art features an oil painting titled &quot;The Devils of D-Day&quot;, created by artist Les Edwards in 1978.
&quot;(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth&quot; is a bass solo by Burton, accompanied on drums by Ulrich. A staple of Burton&#x27;s live performances since his high school days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton&#x27;s distinctive &quot;lead-bass&quot; style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as &quot;Bass solo, take one&quot;, informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. &quot;(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth&quot; was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: &quot;We heard this wild solo going on and thought, &#x27;I don&#x27;t see any guitar player up there.&#x27; We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, &#x27;Dude, that&#x27;s a bass!&#x27; Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn&#x27;t care whether people were there. He was looking down at his bass, playing.&quot; For the album version, Cliff Burton insisted on recording this track alone in an empty room, while the studio technicians were downstairs. He made this recording in one take, after about twenty minutes of preparation.

&quot;Whiplash&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that &quot;Whiplash&quot; signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: &quot;If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, &#x27;Whiplash&#x27; is indisputably it.&quot;

&quot;Phantom Lord&quot; is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with a synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion.

&quot;No Remorse&quot; is a mid-tempo song that suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle.

&quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot; was inspired by Diamond Head&#x27;s &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; and is the first song Metallica recorded during the &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong.

&quot;Metal Militia&quot;, one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal&#x27;s way of life and nonconformity. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army. The song ends with tramping feet and bullet ricochet in a fade-out.

==Reception==
&quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. Bernard Doe of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; described &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; as one of the fastest and heaviest albums ever recorded, and remarked that the album is not for the faint-hearted. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; acknowledged it as the &quot;speed metal prototype&quot;, but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, &quot;Billboard&quot; praised &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey called it &quot;the true birth of thrash&quot;. He praised Hetfield&#x27;s highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was &quot;playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos&quot;. Rob Kemp, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot; and &quot;(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth&quot;, most of the album had the band &quot;trying to look tough&quot; over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs.

Journalist Martin Popoff said &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; differentiated from the debuts by Metallica&#x27;s Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield&#x27;s lyrics and the band&#x27;s appearance. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Chuck Eddy considered &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; the inception of the &quot;extreme metal mania&quot; of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise at the time of its release but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; production, &quot;Loudwire&quot;″s Jon Wiederhorn said that &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; sounds like an &quot;influential slice of history&quot; and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.
&quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was released on July 25, 1983, by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the label&#x27;s financial restrictions, the album was pressed in batches of 500 copies. &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; had sold 17,000 copies in the US by the end of the year. Similarly to punk rock acts, Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as &quot;Metal Forces&quot; in the UK and &quot;Metal Mania&quot; in the US. The album did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart until 1986, when it peaked at number 155 following Metallica&#x27;s commercial success with its third studio album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. The 1988 re-issue on Elektra Records also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 120. It was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years.
&quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, as the first thrash metal album released in the US, had a substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness. Guitarist Kerry King acknowledged Slayer was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity. Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian was impressed by the album&#x27;s heaviness and songwriting and said it influenced him as much as the albums by Iron Maiden. Dream Theater&#x27;s drummer Mike Portnoy observed that &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burton&#x27;s bass solo as the album&#x27;s peak. Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish black metal band Morbid cited &quot;Motorbreath&quot; and &quot;Metal Militia&quot; as songs that influenced him as a young musician. &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was ranked at number 35 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;80s. Additionally, the album placed at number 54 on &quot;The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot; and again at number 35 on &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, two lists compiled by the same magazine. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed the album at number 29 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2010, Consequence of Sound ranked it number 94 among its &quot;Top 100 Albums Ever&quot;.

==Touring==
In late July 1983, Metallica embarked on the two-month Kill &#x27;Em All for One tour with British co-headliners Raven. The tour name melded the titles of the albums the two bands were promoting: Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; and Raven&#x27;s &quot;All for One&quot;, both released on Megaforce. The two groups met in Zazula&#x27;s home two days before the tour began and traveled in the same vehicle throughout the tour with five roadies and sound engineer Whitaker. The tour was set to conclude with three shows in San Francisco, thus Hetfield painted &quot;No Life &#x27;til Frisco&quot; on the Winnebago tour bus. The tour had a few poorly attended gigs, such as a performance at the Cheers club in Babylon, New York, attended by some 50 people. After the conclusion of Kill &#x27;Em All for One in early September, Metallica returned to El Cerrito to work on new material. Seven weeks after the tour ended, Metallica booked a number of performances at Bay Area clubs, the first a Halloween gig at the Keystone in Palo Alto. At the Country Club in Reseda, the group debuted &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; and &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, along with an early version of &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, then titled &quot;When Hell Freezes Over&quot;. Three days later, at a gig at The Stone in San Francisco, Metallica premiered &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, the title track from the upcoming album. In December, Metallica went on a short tour in the Midwest and eastern United States with a three-man road crew: Whitaker, guitar technician John Marshall, and drum technician Dave Marrs. The concert of January 14, 1984, in Boston, was canceled because the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen the night before.
In February, Metallica embarked on its first European trek with Twisted Sister, supporting Venom&#x27;s Seven Dates of Hell tour. The tour was sponsored by Metallica&#x27;s UK distributor, Music for Nations, who released the &quot;Jump in the Fire&quot; EP for that occasion. The first show was at the Volkshaus in Zurich on February 3. At the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle on February 11, Metallica played in front of 7,000 people, its largest audience at the time. The tour stretched through countries such as Italy, Germany, France, and Belgium, culminating in two sold-out shows at the Marquee Club in London. After concluding the Seven Dates of Hell tour, Metallica headed to Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record its second album, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. By the end of the tour, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; had sold 60,000 copies worldwide and Metallica began to gain international recognition. On June 8, 2013, at the Orion Festival, billed as the fictional band Dehaan, Metallica played the album in its entirety for the first time ever to mark the 30 year anniversary of the album.

<text>Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille (; ; 10 September 1897 – 8 July 1962) was a French philosopher and intellectual working in philosophy, literature, sociology, anthropology, and history of art. His writing, which included essays, novels, and poetry, explored such subjects as eroticism, mysticism, surrealism, and transgression. His work would prove influential on subsequent schools of philosophy and social theory, including post-structuralism.

==Early life==
Georges Bataille was the son of Joseph-Aristide Bataille (b. 1851), a tax collector (later to go blind and be paralysed by neurosyphilis), and Antoinette-Aglaë Tournarde (b. 1865). Born on 10 September 1897 in Billom in the region of Auvergne, his family moved to Reims in 1898, where he was baptized. He went to school in Reims and then Épernay. Although brought up without religious observance, he converted to Catholicism in 1914, and became a devout Catholic for about nine years. He considered entering the priesthood and attended a Catholic seminary briefly. However, he quit, apparently in part in order to pursue an occupation where he could eventually support his mother. He eventually renounced Christianity in the early 1920s.

Bataille attended the École Nationale des Chartes in Paris, graduating in February 1922. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s thesis titled . Though he is often referred to as an archivist and a librarian because of his employment at the Bibliothèque Nationale, his work there was with the medallion collections (he also published scholarly articles on numismatics). His thesis at the École des Chartes was a critical edition of the medieval poem which he produced directly by classifying the eight manuscripts from which he reconstructed the poem. After graduating he moved to the School of Advanced Spanish Studies in Madrid. As a young man, he befriended, and was much influenced by, the Russian existentialist Lev Shestov, who schooled him in the writing of Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, and Plato as well as Shestov&#x27;s own critique of reason and philosophical systematization.

==Career==
Founder of several journals and literary groups, Bataille is the author of a large and diverse body of work: readings, poems, essays on innumerable subjects (on the mysticism of economy, poetry, philosophy, the arts and eroticism). He sometimes published under pseudonyms, and some of his publications were banned. He was relatively ignored during his lifetime and scorned by contemporaries such as Jean-Paul Sartre as an advocate of mysticism, but after his death had considerable influence on authors such as Michel Foucault, Philippe Sollers, and Jacques Derrida, all of whom were affiliated with the journal . His influence is felt most explicitly in the phenomenological work of Jean-Luc Nancy, but is also significant for the work of Jean Baudrillard, the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, and recent anthropological work from the likes of Michael Taussig.

Initially attracted to Surrealism, Bataille quickly fell out with its founder André Breton, although Bataille and the Surrealists resumed cautiously cordial relations after World War II. Bataille was a member of the extremely influential College of Sociology which included several other renegade surrealists. He was heavily influenced by Hegel, Freud, Marx, Marcel Mauss, the Marquis de Sade, Alexandre Kojève, and Friedrich Nietzsche, the last of whom he defended in a notable essay against appropriation by the Nazis.

Fascinated by human sacrifice, he founded a secret society, , the symbol of which was a headless man. According to legend, Bataille and the other members of each agreed to be the sacrificial victim as an inauguration; none of them would agree to be the executioner. An indemnity was offered for an executioner, but none was found before the dissolution of shortly before the war. The group also published an eponymous review of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy which attempted to postulate what Derrida has called an &quot;anti-sovereignty&quot;. Collaborators in these projects included André Masson, Pierre Klossowski, Roger Caillois, Jules Monnerot, Jean Rollin and Jean Wahl. The German philosopher and cultural critic, Walter Benjamin, described Bataille and ″s fascination with sacrifice as a &quot;pre-fascist aestheticism&quot;.

Bataille drew from diverse influences and used various modes of discourse to create his work. His novel &quot;Story of the Eye&quot; (), published under the pseudonym Lord Auch (literally, Lord &quot;to the shithouse&quot; — &quot;auch&quot; being short for &quot;aux chiottes&quot;, slang for telling somebody off by sending him to the toilet), was initially read as pure pornography, while interpretation of the work has gradually matured to reveal the same considerable philosophical and emotional depth that is characteristic of other writers who have been categorized within &quot;literature of transgression&quot;. The imagery of the novel is built upon a series of metaphors which in turn refer to philosophical constructs developed in his work: the eye, the egg, the Sun, the Earth, the testicle.

Other famous novels include the posthumously published &quot;My Mother&quot; (which would become the basis of Christophe Honoré&#x27;s film ), &quot;The Impossible&quot; and &quot;Blue of Noon&quot;, which, with its incest, necrophilia, politics, and autobiographical undertones, is a much darker treatment of contemporary historical reality.

During World War II Bataille produced &quot;Summa Atheologica&quot; (the title parallels Thomas Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;) which comprises his works &quot;Inner Experience&quot;, &quot;Guilty&quot;, and &quot;On Nietzsche&quot;. After the war he composed &quot;The Accursed Share&quot;, which he said represented thirty years&#x27; work. The singular conception of &quot;sovereignty&quot; expounded there would become an important topic of discussion for Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Luc Nancy and others. Bataille also founded the influential journal .

==Personal life==
Bataille&#x27;s first marriage was to actress Sylvia Maklès, in 1928; they divorced in 1934, and she later married the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Bataille also had an affair with Colette Peignot, who died in 1938. In 1946 Bataille married Diane de Beauharnais (author, pseudonym, Selena Warfield), with whom he had a daughter.

In 1955 Bataille was diagnosed with cerebral arteriosclerosis, although he was not informed at the time of the terminal nature of his illness. He died seven years later, on 8 July 1962.

Bataille was an atheist.

==Key concepts==
===Base materialism===
Bataille developed base materialism during the late 1920s and early 1930s as an attempt to break with mainstream materialism, which he viewed as a subtle form of idealism. He argues for the concept of an active base matter that disrupts the opposition of high and low and destabilises all foundations. Inspired by Gnostic ideas, this notion of materialism defies strict definition and rationalisation. Base materialism was a major influence on Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction, and both thinkers attempt to destabilise philosophical oppositions by means of an unstable &quot;third term&quot;. Bataille&#x27;s notion of materialism may also be seen as anticipating Louis Althusser&#x27;s conception of aleatory materialism or &quot;materialism of the encounter,&quot; which draws on similar atomist metaphors to sketch a world in which causality and actuality are abandoned in favour of limitless possibilities of action.

===The &quot;accursed share&quot;===
The &quot;accursed share&quot; is an economic concept Bataille introduced in his book published in 1949 by . The book was translated into English and published in 1991, with the title &quot;The Accursed Share&quot;. It presents a new economic theory, which Bataille calls &quot;general economy,&quot; as distinct from the &quot;restricted&quot; economic perspective of most economic theory. Thus, in the theoretical introduction, Bataille writes the following:

I will simply state, without waiting further, that the extension of economic growth itself requires the overturning of economic principles—the overturning of the ethics that grounds them. Changing from the perspectives of restrictive economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican transformation: a reversal of thinking—and of ethics. If a part of wealth (subject to a rough estimate) is doomed to destruction or at least to unproductive use without any possible profit, it is logical, even inescapable, to surrender commodities without return. Henceforth, leaving aside pure and simple dissipation, analogous to the construction of the Pyramids, the possibility of pursuing growth is itself subordinated to giving: The industrial development of the entire world demands of Americans that they lucidly grasp the necessity, for an economy such as theirs, of having a margin of profitless operations. An immense industrial network cannot be managed in the same way that one changes a tire… It expresses a circuit of cosmic energy on which it depends, which it cannot limit, and whose laws it cannot ignore without consequences. Woe to those who, to the very end, insist on regulating the movement that exceeds them with the narrow mind of the mechanic who changes a tire.

Thus, according to Bataille&#x27;s theory of consumption, the accursed share is that excessive and non-recuperable part of any economy which is destined to one of two modes of economic and social expenditure. This must either be spent luxuriously and knowingly without gain in the arts, in non-procreative sexuality, in spectacles and sumptuous monuments, or it is obliviously destined to an outrageous and catastrophic outpouring in war. Though the distinction is less apparent in Robert Hurley&#x27;s English translation, Bataille introduces the neologism &quot;consummation&quot; (akin to a fire&#x27;s burning) to signal this excess expenditure as distinct from &quot;consommation&quot; (the non-excess expenditure more familiarly treated in theories of &quot;restricted&quot; economy).

The notion of &quot;excess&quot; energy is central to Bataille&#x27;s thinking. Bataille&#x27;s inquiry takes the superabundance of energy, beginning from the infinite outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life&#x27;s basic chemical reactions, as the norm for organisms. In other words, an organism in Bataille&#x27;s general economy, unlike the rational actors of classical economy who are motivated by scarcity, normally has an &quot;excess&quot; of energy available to it. This extra energy can be used productively for the organism&#x27;s growth or it can be lavishly expended. Bataille insists that an organism&#x27;s growth or expansion always runs up against limits and becomes impossible. The wasting of this energy is &quot;luxury.&quot; The form and role luxury assumes in a society, are characteristic of that society. &quot;The accursed share&quot; refers to this excess, destined for waste, which he calls &quot;dépense&quot; (French for expenditure). This non-productive expenditure of excess energy, which transcends the mere requirements for survival, challenges traditional economic paradigms by emphasizing the importance of unproductive uses of surplus that contribute to societal and cultural enrichment, rather than mere economic growth. Bataille&#x27;s exploration of dépense highlights the philosophical and existential dimensions of how societies utilize their surplus resources.

Crucial to the formulation of the theory was Bataille&#x27;s reflection upon the phenomenon of potlatch. It is influenced by Marcel Mauss&#x27;s &quot;The Gift&quot;, as well as by Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;. Reception to the accursed share concept was mixed.

<doc id="209218" wikidata="Q370515" url="?curid=209218" title="New wave of British heavy metal">
<text>The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that began in England in the mid-1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Editor Alan Lewis coined the term for an article by Geoff Barton in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper &quot;Sounds&quot; to describe the emergence of heavy metal bands in the mid-to-late 1970s, as punk rock declined amid the dominance of new wave music.

Although encompassing diverse styles inherited from rock music, the music of the NWOBHM is best remembered for infusing earlier heavy metal with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the NWOBHM bands led to raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes, such as mythology, fantasy, horror, and the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lifestyle.

The NWOBHM began as an underground phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. Promotion by &quot;Sounds&quot; and rock DJ Neal Kay moved it into public consciousness and toward radio airplay, recognition, and success in the UK. Its musicians and fans were largely young, white, working-class men who suffered the hardships of unemployment after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they then created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other&#x27;s company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was criticised for local media hype for mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered the progress of the heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.

By some estimates, the movement spawned as many as a thousand heavy metal bands. Only a few survived the advent of MTV and the rise of the more commercial glam metal in the second half of the 1980s. Iron Maiden and Def Leppard became superstars; Motörhead and Saxon also had considerable success. Other groups, such as Diamond Head, Venom, and Raven, had more limited chart success, but influenced the successful extreme metal subgenres of the mid-to-late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.

==Background==

===Social unrest===

In the second half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and widespread poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialisation, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots, including one in Brixton and another in Toxteth. During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before and during the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The desperation and the violent reaction of a generation robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant as long as the music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship – otherwise denied because of their unemployment.

===Heavy rock in the UK===
The UK was a cradle of the first wave of heavy metal, which was born at the end of the 1960s and flowered in the early 1970s. Of the many British bands that came to prominence during that period, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple achieved worldwide success and critical acclaim. The success of the music genre, usually called heavy rock at the time, generated a community of UK fans with strong ties to psychedelia, hippie doctrines and biker subculture. Each of these bands was in crisis in the mid-to-late 1970s: Led Zeppelin were plagued by discord and personal tragedies and had drastically reduced their activities, Black Sabbath finally fired their charismatic but unreliable frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple disbanded. As a consequence, the whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest, which were refocused on what British writer Malc Macmillan calls &quot;the more fashionable or lucrative markets of the day&quot; such as disco, glam, mod revival, new wave and electronic music. Just like progressive rock acts and other mainstream music groups of the 1970s, heavy rock bands were viewed as – in the words of journalist Garry Bushell – &quot;lumbering dinosaurs&quot; by a music press infatuated with punk rock and new wave. Some writers even declared the premature demise of heavy metal altogether.

The crisis of British heavy rock giants left space for the rise of other rock bands in the mid-1970s, including Queen, Hawkwind, Budgie, Bad Company, Status Quo and Nazareth, all of which had multiple chart entries in the UK and had conducted successful international tours. The British chart results of the period show that there was still a vast audience for heavy metal in the country, and upcoming bands UFO and Judas Priest, also had tangible success and media coverage in the late 1970s. Foreign hard rock acts, such as Blue Öyster Cult and Kiss from the US, Rush from Canada, Scorpions from West Germany, Thin Lizzy from Ireland, and especially AC/DC from Australia, climbed the British charts in the same period.

===Motörhead===
Motörhead were founded in 1975 by already experienced musicians. Their leader Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister was a former member of the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight&#x27;s Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; programme and the first to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, &quot;the NWOBHM ... didn&#x27;t do us much good&quot;, because Motörhead &quot;came along a bit too early for it&quot;.

Other critics view Motörhead as the first significant exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy&#x27;s friends&#x27; punk band The Damned. Motörhead&#x27;s musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.

==Characteristics==

===Identity and style===
The NWOBHM involved both musicians and fans who were largely young, male and white and shared class origin, ethics, and aesthetic values. American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book &quot;Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture&quot;, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years. British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas, metalheads, or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads in time to the music, dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the counterculture of the 1960s and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s, updating the shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture and definitely separating it from mainstream society.
Towards the end of the 1970s, British metalheads coalesced into a closed community of peers that exalted power and celebrated masculinity. According to Deena Weinstein&#x27;s analysis, their male camaraderie and the general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into machismo and misogyny. In the same article, she wrote that British heavy metal: &quot;is not racist, despite its uniformly white performers, and its lyrics are devoid of racial references.&quot; Another characteristic of the subculture was its latent homophobia, less violent, but not dissimilar to British skinheads&#x27; disposition; in his book &quot;Running with the Devil: Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music&quot;, Robert Walser calls it a &quot;collective affirmation of heterosexuality&quot;, and in a journal British sociologist John Clarke regards it as &quot;a reaction against the erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity&quot;.

Headbangers showed little interest in political and social problems, finding in each other&#x27;s company, in the consumption of beer and in the music, the means to escape their bleak reality; for this reason they were often accused of nihilism or escapism. In contrast with punks, they loved musicianship and made idols of virtuoso guitarists and vocalists, viewing the live show as the full realisation of their status. The fans were very loyal to the music, to each other and to the bands with whom they shared origins and from whom they required coherence with their values, authenticity and continuous accessibility. To depart from this strict code meant being marked as a &quot;sell out&quot; or &quot;poseur&quot; and being somewhat excluded from the community. The lyrics of the song &quot;Denim and Leather&quot; by Saxon reflect precisely the condition of British metalheads in those years of great enthusiasm. Access to this male-dominated world for female musicians and fans was not easy, and only women who adapted to their male counterparts&#x27; standards and codes were accepted, as attested by Girlschool and Rock Goddess, the only notable all-female heavy metal bands of that era.
The music, philosophy and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous to the limit of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie&#x27;s content as much too real.

===Visual aspects===

The dress code of the British headbangers reflected the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S&amp;M fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.

Most bands of the NWOBHM had the same look as their fans and produced rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.

===Musical and lyrical elements===
The NWOBHM – comprising bands with very different influences and styles – was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during the mid-to-late 1970s. Especially in those early years, what characterised the flood of new music was its raw sound, due in large part to low-budget productions, but also to the amateurish talents of many young bands. Those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from the works of the aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and kept a sort of continuity with the earlier acts, whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion, but was still thriving underground. However, the media of the 1980s and the promotional literature of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars, but was not classifiable as &quot;punk&quot; under the blanket term &quot;heavy metal&quot;, subsuming the entire spectrum of NWOBHM bands within a single music genre.

Following a largely organic and uncalculated impulse, many of these new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the intensity of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers of Pan Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.
A style more melodic and more akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally represented during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After the peak of the movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.

These two styles do not exhaust all of the musical influences found in the British heavy metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Demon, Saracen, Shiva, Witchfynde), boogie rock (Saxon, Vardis, Spider, Le Griffe) and glam rock (Girl, Wrathchild). Doom metal bands Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General were also part of the NWOBHM and their albums are considered among the best examples of that already established subgenre.

British writer John Tucker writes that NWOBHM bands were in general fuelled by their first experiences with adult life and &quot;their lyrics rolled everything into one big youthful fantasy&quot;. They usually avoided social and political themes in their lyrics, or treated them in a shallow &quot;street-level&quot; way, preferring topics from mythology, the occult, fantasy, science fiction and horror films. Songs about romance and lust were rare, but the frequent lyrics about male bonding and the rock lifestyle contain many sexist allusions. Christian symbolism is often present in the lyrics and cover art, as is the figure of Satan, used more as a shocking and macabre subject than as the antireligious device of 1990s&#x27; black metal subculture.

==History==

===Underground movement (1975–1978)===

Popular heavy rock bands such as Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest were already major successes and playing international arenas, when new heavy metal bands, composed of younger people, debuted in small venues in many cities in the UK. The country&#x27;s larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered less profitable. Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a dedicated local fan base and enabled them to come in contact with managers and record label agents.

Angel Witch, Iron Maiden, Praying Mantis and Samson from London, Son of a Bitch (later Saxon) from Barnsley, Diamond Head from Stourbridge, Marseille from Liverpool, White Spirit from Hartlepool, Witchfynde from Derbyshire, Vardis from Wakefield, Def Leppard from Sheffield, Raven and Tygers of Pan Tang from around Newcastle, and Holocaust from Edinburgh were the most important metal bands founded between 1975 and 1977 that animated the club scene in their respective cities and towns. The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock. Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences. What punk and NWOBHM musicians had in common was their &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; attitude toward the music business and the consequent practice of self-production and self-distribution of recorded material in the form of audio cassette demos, or privately pressed singles, aimed initially at local supporters.

It also led to the birth and diffusion of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement&#x27;s evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.
While British and international media covered punk intensively, the new grassroots metal movement remained underground until 1978, largely ignored by popular music magazines such as &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and by radio stations. News about the bands and music circulated by word-of-mouth and fanzines, or through interested DJs, who travelled the country from club to club. Neal Kay was one of those DJs; he started to work in 1975 at a disco club called The Bandwagon in Kingsbury, North West London, housed in the back-room of the Prince of Wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system. He transformed his nights at The Bandwagon into The Heavy Metal Soundhouse, a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music and a place to listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands, which circulated among fans through cassette trading. NWOBHM International Heroes&#x27; lead singer and songwriter, Sean T. Wright, was a renowned cassette trader at the time.

Besides participating in air guitar competitions and watching live shows, the audience could also vote for Kay&#x27;s selections. The DJ made a weekly Heavy Metal Top 100 list of the most requested songs at The Soundhouse, by both newcomers and established bands and sent it to record shops and to the music journal &quot;Sounds&quot;, the only paper that showed interest in the developing scene. Many young musicians realised that they were not alone in playing metal only through that weekly list, which included bands from all over the country. At the time, Geoff Barton was a staffer at &quot;Sounds&quot; who wrote features on the new up-and-coming metal bands and was pivotal in directing the developing subculture of metalheads with his articles. At the suggestion of his editor Alan Lewis, and in an attempt to find a common stylistic element in the bands&#x27; music, he used the term &quot;New Wave of British Heavy Metal&quot; for the first time in his review of a gig on the &quot;Metal Crusade&quot; tour featuring Angel Witch, Iron Maiden and Samson at The Music Machine in London on 8 May 1979. The term soon became the identifier for the whole movement.

===First wave (1979–1981)===
Compilation albums featuring bands from the nascent movement started to circulate, issued by Neat Records, Heavy Metal Records and Ebony Records, companies that became leaders in the independent metal label market during the 1980s. The fresh outlet of Neal Kay&#x27;s chart, the attention of &quot;Sounds&quot; and the many compilations issued by independent labels, focused the efforts of the new bands on producing demos and singles. Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; is one of the best known collections of such demos. As Barton recalled: &quot;There were hundreds of these bands. Maybe even thousands. Barely a day would go by without a clutch of new NWOBHM singles arriving in the &quot;Sounds&quot; office.&quot;

Tommy Vance, a BBC radio host, took notice of the phenomenon and played singles by the NWOBHM bands on his late night &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1. Along with John Peel&#x27;s broadcast, Vance&#x27;s was the only mainstream radio show to feature songs from underground metal acts, many of whom were invited to play live at BBC studios under the supervision of long-time collaborator and producer, Tony Wilson. Alice&#x27;s Restaurant Rock Radio, a pirate FM radio station in London, also championed the new bands on air and with their own &quot;roadshow&quot; in rock pubs and clubs.
Despite the transition of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels&#x27; A&amp;R agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon were the first to sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.

&quot;Sounds&quot; gave &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; a poor review, but the album was nevertheless a commercial success and may have been instrumental in encouraging major labels to sign a few more bands. A II Z, Fist, White Spirit and Praying Mantis were dropped after the release of their debut albums, while Tygers of Pan Tang, Samson, More, Demon and Girlschool had more success and lasted longer on major labels&#x27; line-ups. The new releases by these bands were better produced and some of them, with the support of intensive tours in the UK and Europe, obtained good chart results. The best chart performances of that period were for Iron Maiden&#x27;s debut album &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and for &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot; by Saxon, which reached No. 4 and No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart respectively, while their singles &quot;Running Free&quot;, &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot; and &quot;747 (Strangers in the Night)&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart Top 50. The immediate consequence of that success was increased media coverage for metal bands, which included appearances on the British music TV shows &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. The emergence of many new bands in the period between 1978 and 1980 was another remarkable effect of the promotion of the movement to a relevant national phenomenon.

The momentum behind the NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases. Ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan returned to sing heavy metal with the album &quot;Mr. Universe&quot; in 1979 and was on the forefront of the British metal scene with his band Gillan in the following years. His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow&#x27;s releases &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (1979) and &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1980) and &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG&#x27;s first album peaked at No. 8, Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Ready an&#x27; Willing&quot; at No. 6, Judas Priest&#x27;s best-seller &quot;British Steel&quot; and Motörhead&#x27;s &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; at No. 4, while &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC reached number one.

As proof of the successful revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs of old and new acts were sold out, both at home and in other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US for the first time in 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Sammy Hagar. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.

===Into the mainstream (1981–1985)===

The NWOBHM eventually found space in newspapers and music magazines other than &quot;Sounds&quot;, as journalists caught up with the &quot;next big thing&quot; happening in the UK. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; even published a weekly heavy metal chart based on record shop sales. &quot;Sounds&quot;″ publisher exploited his support of the movement to launch the first issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, a colour magazine directed by Geoff Barton devoted exclusively to hard rock and heavy metal, in June 1981. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was an unexpected success and soon became the reference magazine for metalheads worldwide, followed shortly by the American &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, the Dutch &quot;Aardschok&quot;, the German &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and the British &quot;Metal Forces&quot;. The attention of international media meant more record sales and more world tours for NWOBHM bands, whose albums entered many foreign charts. Their attempts to climb the British charts culminated in Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; topping the UK Albums Chart on 10 April 1982 and staying at number 1 for two weeks. The album charted at number 33 in the US, where the band acquired a reputation as Devil-worshippers due to the album cover&#x27;s depiction of a hellish scene.

The success of the music produced by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by the ease with which record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.

NWOBHM bands had been touring steadily in the United States, but had not yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing &quot;Pyromania&quot; at the beginning of 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band&#x27;s goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where &quot;Pyromania&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of &quot;Pyromania&quot; induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard&#x27;s example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.

===Decline===

The UK had been a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started broadcasting in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programmes with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable to follow up on their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.

By the mid-1980s, glam metal, which often emphasized a band&#x27;s appearance and featured lyrics about love and sex, quickly replaced other styles of metal in the tastes of many British rock fans; this sub-genre emanating from Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Strip was spearheaded already in the late 1970s by Van Halen and followed by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Great White, Ratt and W.A.S.P. New Jersey act Bon Jovi and the Swedish Europe, thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop, also became very popular in the UK, with the former even headlining the 1987 Monsters of Rock Festival. Record companies latched on to the more polished glam metal subgenre over the NWOBHM bands, which maintained a fan base elsewhere in Europe, but found themselves crowded out of the UK and US markets by the success of these American groups. While the attention devoted to the NWOBHM bands waned, a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many British metalheads. Power metal and thrash metal, both stemming from the NWOBHM and maintaining much of its ethos, were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success in the second half of the 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound. Bands such as Helloween, Savatage, Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax captured much of the market share of those metalheads who were not content with the sound or style of more mainstream, pop-oriented metal bands.

&quot;The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia&quot; by Malc Macmillan lists more than 500 recording bands established in the decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The record labels&#x27; lack of interest, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing by the end of the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.

===Revival===
The widespread popularity of the Internet in the late 1990s/early 2000s helped NWOBHM fans and musicians to reconnect and rekindle their shared enthusiasm. The NWOBHM experienced a minor underground revival, highlighted by the good sales of old vinyl and collectibles and by the demand for new performances. Statements of appreciation by metal bands of the 1990s, the success of tribute bands, the re-issues of old albums and the production of new thoroughly edited compilations, attracted the media&#x27;s attention and encouraged many of the original groups to reunite for festival appearances and tours. According to Macmillan and AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, probably the most important of those compilation albums was &quot;New Wave of British Heavy Metal &#x27;79 Revisited&quot;, compiled by Metallica&#x27;s drummer Lars Ulrich and former &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; journalist Geoff Barton. It was released in 1990 as a double CD, featuring bands as obscure as Hollow Ground right through to the major acts of the era.

A new publication called &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, featuring Barton and many of the writers from &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned in the second half of the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.

==Influences and legacy==

The NWOBHM triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM is now seen as key to the diversification of heavy metal in the second half of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and several minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.

Starting around 1982, distant points such as North America, West Germany, and Brazil each became the locus of its own distinctive thrash metal scenes – East Coast and Bay Area, Teutonic, and Brazilian thrash metal. Their debt to the NWOBHM was acknowledged for example by Metallica&#x27;s Lars Ulrich, an active fan and avid collector of NWOBHM recordings and memorabilia. Under his influence, the setlists of Metallica&#x27;s early shows were filled with covers of British metal groups. The sound of the NWOBHM even &quot;cross-pollinated&quot; a subgenre of punk, as UK 82 street punk bands like Discharge blended punk music with elements of metal. The birth of speed metal in the early 1980s was also pivotal for the evolution of power metal in the latter half of the decade, as exemplified by Helloween from Germany, and Manowar, Savatage, and Virgin Steele from the US.

Since the beginning of the NWOBHM, North American bands like Anvil, Riot, Twisted Sister, Manowar, Virgin Steele, The Rods, Hellion, Cirith Ungol, and Exciter had a continuous exchange with the other side of the Atlantic, where their music was appreciated by British metalheads. In this climate of reciprocity, Manowar and Virgin Steele initially signed with the British indie label Music for Nations, while Twisted Sister recorded their first two albums in London.

The sound of Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor groups was also influenced by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England to be part of the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Yugoslavia and Mexico promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany, E. F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust, Sortilège and Nightmare from France, Barón Rojo, Obús and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, Gordi, Pomaranča, Divlje Jagode, and Warriors from Yugoslavia, Luzbel from Mexico or Aria from the Soviet Union formed between 1978 and the beginning of the new decade and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.

<doc id="209227" wikidata="Q298601" url="?curid=209227" title="Wes Montgomery">
<text>John Leslie &quot;Wes&quot; Montgomery (March 6, 1923 – June 15, 1968) was an American jazz guitarist. Montgomery was known for his unusual technique of plucking the strings with the side of his thumb and for his extensive use of octaves, which gave him a distinctive sound.

Montgomery often worked with his brothers Buddy (Charles F.) and Monk (William H.), as well as organist Melvin Rhyne. His recordings up to 1965 were oriented toward hard bop, soul jazz, and post bop, but around 1965 he began recording more pop-oriented instrumental albums that found mainstream success. His later guitar style influenced jazz fusion and smooth jazz.

==Early life and education==
Montgomery was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. According to NPR, the nickname &quot;Wes&quot; was a child&#x27;s abbreviation of his middle name, Leslie. The family was large, and the parents split up early in the lives of the children. Montgomery and his brothers moved to Columbus, Ohio, with their father and attended Champion High School. His older brother Monk dropped out of school to sell coal and ice, gradually saving enough money to buy Wes a four-string tenor guitar from a pawn shop in 1935. Although Montgomery spent many hours playing that guitar, he dismissed its usefulness, saying he had to start over when he got his first six-string several years later.

==Career==

He and his brothers returned to Indianapolis. By 1943, Montgomery found work as a welder and got married. At a dance with his wife, he heard a Charlie Christian record for the first time. This inspired him to pick up guitar at the age of 19 and spent a year teaching himself how to play by imitating the recordings of Christian. Although he hadn&#x27;t intended to become a musician, he felt obligated to learn after buying the guitar. Montgomery received no formal instruction and couldn&#x27;t read music. By the age of twenty, he was performing in clubs in Indianapolis at night, copying Christian&#x27;s solos, while working during the day at a milk company. In 1948, when Lionel Hampton was on tour in Indianapolis, he was looking for a guitarist, and after hearing Montgomery play like Christian he hired him.

Montgomery spent two years with the Hampton band. Fear kept him from flying with the rest of the band, so he drove from city to city, town to town, while fellow musicians marveled at his stamina. When arriving at a club, the first thing he did was call home to his wife and family. He was given the opportunity to play with Charles Mingus, Milt Buckner, and Fats Navarro, but not the opportunity he hoped for, and he returned to Indianapolis a better player, though tired and discouraged. He resumed performing at local clubs, this time with the Eddie Higgins Trio and the Roger Jones Quintet, playing with Eddie Higgins, Walter Perkins, and Leroy Vinnegar. He joined his brothers Buddy and Monk and saxophonist Alonzo &quot;Pookie&quot; Johnson in the Johnson/Montgomery Quintet, somewhat in the style of George Shearing. The band auditioned for Arthur Godfrey and recorded sessions with Quincy Jones. After a residency at a club from 1955 to 1957, Montgomery and his brothers went west.

Buddy and Monk Montgomery formed The Mastersounds and signed a contract with Dick Bock at Pacific Jazz. Montgomery joined them for a recording session in 1957 that included Freddie Hubbard. Some of the songs were released by Pacific Jazz on the album &quot;The Montgomery Brothers and Five Others&quot;, while others were issued on &quot;Fingerpickin&#x27;&quot; (Pacific Jazz, 1958). The Mastersounds remained in California when Montgomery returned to Indianapolis to work in his trio with organist Melvin Rhyne.

He worked as a welder during the day to support his wife and seven children, then performed at two clubs at night until well into the morning. He was a smoker who had blackouts while trying to maintain this busy schedule. During one performance, the audience included Cannonball Adderley, George Shearing, and Lennie Tristano. Adderley was so impressed by Montgomery&#x27;s guitar playing that he persuaded Orrin Keepnews to sign him to Riverside. Keepnews was also persuaded by a gushing review written by Gunther Schuller. In New York City Montgomery recorded &quot;A Dynamic New Sound, the Wes Montgomery Trio&quot;, his first album as a leader after twenty years as a musician. In 1960, he recorded &quot;The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery&quot; with Tommy Flanagan, Percy Heath, and Albert Heath.

He joined his brothers in California to perform as the Montgomery Brothers for the Monterey Jazz Festival. The Mastersounds had broken up, and Buddy and Monk had signed with Fantasy and recorded (with Wes) &quot;The Montgomery Brothers&quot;, followed by &quot;Groove Yard&quot;. Montgomery recorded another album as a leader, &quot;So Much Guitar&quot;, then while visiting his brothers had a chance to perform with John Coltrane&#x27;s group in San Francisco. In 1961, work was getting harder to find. A tour in Canada led to the album &quot;The Montgomery Brothers in Canada&quot;, then the band broke up. Montgomery returned to Indianapolis to work in his trio with Rhyne. Keepnews sent him back to California to record a live album with Johnny Griffin, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. Their performance became the album &quot;Full House&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Fusion!&quot; (1963), his first instrumental pop album.

After two more organ trio jazz sessions for Riverside Records in 1963 (&quot;Boss Guitar&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Wes&quot;), Montgomery left the label for Verve Records. At Verve, Montgomery began working with producer Creed Taylor, who produced Montgomery for the rest of the guitarist&#x27;s life. His first Verve release, &quot;Movin&#x27; Wes&quot; (1964), was an instrumental pop album arranged by Johnny Pate. It quickly sold more than 100,000 copies and repositioned Montgomery within the recording industry as a crossover artist capable of significant LP sales. At Verve, Montgomery released his last two small-group jazz albums (a 1965 collaboration with Wynton Kelly, and a 1966 collaboration with organist Jimmy Smith), but his main focus was recording contemporary pop hits as instrumentals. Montgomery had notable success with his versions of &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Tequila&quot;, and &quot;Goin&#x27; Out of My Head&quot;. After moving to A&amp;M, Montgomery had his biggest radio hit, a version of &quot;Windy&quot;, a pop song originally recorded by The Association. Of the ten Wes Montgomery albums that Taylor produced while Montgomery was alive (all recorded for Verve and A&amp;M Records), eight were aimed at the pop market. The success of these albums led to invitations for Montgomery to perform on major U.S. television shows including &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

==Death==
Montgomery died of a heart attack on June 15, 1968, while at home in Indianapolis. He was 45 years old.

==Artistry==
According to jazz guitar educator Wolf Marshall, Montgomery often approached solos in a three-tiered manner: he would begin the progression with single note lines, derived from scales or modes; after a fitting number of sequences, he would play octaves for a few more sequences, finally culminating with block chords. He used mostly superimposed triads and arpeggios as the main source for his soloing ideas and sounds.

Instead of using a guitar pick, Montgomery plucked the strings with the fleshy part of his thumb, using down strokes for single notes and a combination of up strokes and down strokes for chords and octaves. He developed this technique not for technical reasons but for the benefit of his neighbors and not waking his children. He worked long hours as a machinist before his music career began and practiced late at night. To keep everyone happy, he played quietly by using his thumb. This actually worked out well, as he used an amplifier when performing, which allowed him to really exploit his thumb-picking style. His style smoothly incorporated the guitar into jazz and was studied by many.

==Legacy==
Jazz guitarist Bobby Broom said that on &quot;A Dynamic New Sound&quot; in 1959, Montgomery &quot;introduced a brand new approach to playing the guitar... The octave technique... and his chord melody and chord soloing playing still is today unmatched&quot;. Broom modeled his guitar-organ trio after Montgomery&#x27;s.

==Tributes==
Stevie Wonder wrote two tributes to Montgomery: &quot;Bye Bye World&quot;, which appeared on his 1968 album &quot;Eivets Rednow&quot;, and &quot;We All Remember Wes&quot;, which George Benson recorded for his 1978 live album &quot;Weekend in L.A.&quot;

In 1982, Bob James and Earl Klugh collaborated on a duet album and recorded the song &quot;Wes&quot; as a tribute to Montgomery on the album &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;.

Guitarist Emily Remler released a tribute album to Montgomery in 1988, titled &quot;East to Wes&quot;.

Pat Martino released &quot;&quot; in 2006.

Eric Johnson paid tribute to Montgomery on his 1990 album &quot;Ah Via Musicom&quot; in a song titled &quot;East Wes&quot;.

Guitarist David Becker paid tribute to Montgomery on the 1991 album &quot;In Motion&quot; with the song &quot;Westward Ho&quot;.

Lee Ritenour recorded a tribute album in 1993, &quot;Wes Bound&quot;, that contained Montgomery covers and some originals by Ritenour. While the production and arrangements are typical for the time, he performed the entire album in Montgomery&#x27;s style on a Gibson L-5 model.

Guitarist Joe Diorio released a tribute album in 1998, I Remember You - A Tribute To Wes Montgomery.

<text>Djadochtatherioidea is a superfamily of extinct mammals known from the upper Cretaceous and Paleocene of what is now Central Asia, North America and Europe. They were members of the order Multituberculata. These were very ecologically diverse; several were jerboa-like hoppers, while others like &quot;Mangasbaatar&quot; were large sized and fossorial. Unusually for multituberculates, some of this group are represented by very good remains. All upper Cretaceous Mongolian multituberculates are included with one exception, the genus &quot;Buginbaatar&quot;.

This superfamily is further subdivided into three families and several other genera, as listed in the table. The Djadochtatherioids are within the suborder of Cimolodonta. 
Djadochtatherioidea was established by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Jørn Hurum in 2001 as a replacement for the previously proposed Djadochtatheria that they had proposed in 1997. Shared characteristics of the group are

<text>The Flagstaff War, also known as Heke&#x27;s War, Hōne Heke&#x27;s Rebellion and the Northern War, was fought between 11 March 1845 and 11 January 1846 in and around the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. The conflict is best remembered for the actions of Hōne Heke who challenged the authority of the British by cutting down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill (Maiki Hill) at Kororāreka (now Russell). The flagstaff had been a gift from Hōne Heke to James Busby, the first British Resident. The Northern War involved many major actions, including the Battle of Kororāreka on 11 March 1845, the Battle of Puketutu on 8 May 1845, the Battle of Ōhaeawai on 23 June 1845 and the siege of Ruapekapeka Pā from 27 December 1845 to 11 January 1846. The conflict is seen as one of the first of the New Zealand Wars.
==Causes==

The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi started on 6 February 1840, and Governor William Hobson believed that it established the legal basis for the British sovereignty over New Zealand, while Ngāpuhi, the largest and most powerful northern tribe, believed the contrary, that they had entered into a partnership with the Crown. All Ngāpuhi chiefs had signed the treaty document translated from English to Māori in the context of the time. The actions of Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti in 1844 reflect the controversy that began soon after the treaty was signed. Flag poles became a focus of protest when Governor Hobson refused to allow the United Tribes flag to be flown alongside the British Union flag.

On 21 May 1840 Governor Hobson formally annexed New Zealand to the British Crown, and the following year he moved the capital from Russell to Auckland, some south of Waitangi. In the Bay of Islands, Hōne Heke, one of the original signatories to the treaty, was increasingly unhappy with the outcome of the agreement. Among other things, Heke objected to the relocation of the capital to Auckland. Moreover, the Governor in Council had imposed a custom tariff on staple articles of trade. Before the tariff had gone into effect, more than 20 whaling ships would be visiting the Bay of Islands at any one time; the tariff resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of ships that visited Kororāreka. This reduction in the number of visiting ships caused a serious loss of revenue to Ngāpuhi. Heke also lost income due to their less-frequent collection of the £5 fee they levied on each ship that entered the Bay, a payment which the cousins divided between themselves. Pōmare II complained that he no longer collected payment from American ships that called at Otuihu across from Opua.

Heke and the Ngāpuhi chief Pōmare II had listened to Captain William Mayhew (the Acting-Consul for the United States from 1840) and other Americans talk about the successful revolt of the American colonies against England over the issue of taxation. Heke obtained an American ensign from Henry Green Smith, a storekeeper at Wahapu who had succeeded Mayhew as Acting-Consul. After the flagstaff was cut down for a second time, the Stars and Stripes flew from the carved sternpost of Heke&#x27;s war canoe.

In the Bay of Islands, there existed a vague but widely diffused belief that the Treaty of Waitangi was merely a ruse of the Pākehā, and the belief that it was the intention of the Europeans, so soon as they became strong enough, to seize all Māori lands. This belief, together with Heke&#x27;s views about the imposition of the customs duties, can also be linked to the further widely diffused belief that the British flag flying on Flagstaff Hill over the town of Kororāreka signified that the Māori had become taurekareka (slaves) to Queen Victoria. This discontent appears to have been fostered by the talk with the American traders, although it was an idea that had existed since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi; William Colenso, the CMS missionary printer, in his record of the events of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi commented that &quot;[a]fter some little time Te Kemara came towards the table and affixed his sign to the parchment, stating that the Roman Catholic bishop (who had left the meeting before any of the chiefs had signed) had told him &quot;not to write on the paper, for if he did he would be made a slave.&quot;

The trial and execution of Wiremu Kīngi Maketū in 1842 for murder was, in the opinion of Archdeacon Henry Williams, the beginning of Heke&#x27;s antagonism towards the colonial administration, as Heke began gathering support thereafter among the Ngāpuhi for a rebellion. However it was not until 1844 that Heke sought support from Te Ruki Kawiti and other leaders of the Ngāpuhi iwi by the conveying of &#x27;te ngākau&#x27;, the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.

==Hōne Heke moves against Kororāreka==
Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end of Kororāreka (Russell).

In July 1844, Kotiro, a former slave of Heke, openly insulted the Ngāpuhi chief. Kotiro had been captured from a southern tribe 15 years earlier, and was now living with her English husband, the town butcher, in Kororāreka. There are differing stories as to the specific insult or the circumstances in which it was delivered. Cowan (1922) says that while bathing with other women, a heated argument about Heke took place and Kotiro dismissed him as an &quot;upoko poaka&quot; or a pig&#x27;s head; and that upon hearing of this insult Heke used it as a reason to begin his attack on the town. Hugh Carleton (1874) claimed that Heke used the presence of Kotiro, and her status, as pretext for a taua – a raid upon Kororāreka.
It happened that a slave girl belonging to Heke, Kotiro by name, was living at Kororāreka with a butcher named Lord. Heke, having a colourable right to recover his slave. A karere [messenger] was sent ahead, to announce the intention; the message was delivered to the woman in the butcher&#x27;s shop, where several fat hogs were hanging up. Kotiro answering contemptuously of their power to take her away, pointing to one of the hogs, said, &quot;ina a Heke&quot; [that is Heke]. In any event Heke used the insult as a reason to enter the town, to demand payment from Lord as compensation for the insult. Satisfaction was refused: for several days Heke and his warriors remained in the town persisting in the demand, but, in reality, feeling their way, trying the temper of the Pākehā.

&quot;The Auckland Chronicle&quot; reported the incident as such:
[Heke and his warriors] brandished their tomahawks in the faces of the white people, indecently treated some white females, and exposed their persons; they took every thing out of [Lord&#x27;s, the husband of Kotiro] house.
==Flagstaff cut down for the first time==
On 8 July 1844 the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end of Kororāreka was cut down for the first time, by the Pakaraka chief Te Haratua. Heke had set out to cut down the flagstaff, but was persuaded by Archdeacon
William Williams not to do so. The &quot;Auckland Chronicle&quot; reported this event, saying:
[They] then proceeded to the flagstaff, which they deliberately cut down, purposely with the intention of insulting the government, and of expressing their contempt of British authority.
In the second week of August 1844, the barque &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived at the Bay of Islands from New South Wales with 160 officers and men of the 99th Regiment. On 24 August 1844 Governor FitzRoy arrived in the bay from Auckland upon . The Government brig &quot;Victoria&quot; arrived in company with , with a detachment of the 96th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel William Hulme. Governor FitzRoy summoned the Ngāpuhi chiefs to a conference at Te Waimate mission on 2 September and apparently defused the situation. Tāmati Wāka Nene requested the Governor to remove the troops and redress the native grievances in respect of the customs duties that were put in place in 1841, that Heke and Pōmare II viewed as damaging the maritime trade from which they benefited. Tāmati Wāka Nene and the other Ngāpuhi chiefs undertook to keep Heke in check and to protect the Europeans in the Bay of Islands. Hōne Heke did not attend, but sent a conciliatory letter and offered to replace the flagstaff. The soldiers were returned to Sydney, but the accord did not last. The Ngāpuhi warriors led by Te Ruki Kawiti and Hōne Heke decided to challenge the Europeans at Kororāreka.

==Flagstaff falls twice more==

On 10 January 1845, the flagstaff was cut down a second time, this time by Heke. On 17 January, a small detachment of a subaltern and 30 men of the 96th Regiment were landed. A new and stronger flagstaff sheathed in iron was erected on 18 January 1845 and the guard post built around it. Nene and his men provided guards for the flagstaff, but the next morning the flagstaff was felled for the third time. Governor FitzRoy sent over to New South Wales for reinforcements.

Early in February 1845 Kawiti&#x27;s warriors begun to plunder the settlers a mile or two from Kororāreka. The &quot;Hazard&quot; arrived from Auckland on 15 February with the materials to construct the block-house around the base of the flagstaff. Within a few days the block-house was completed and a guard of 20 soldiers was placed in it. Soon after this the officials purchased the mizzenmast from a foreign ship in the harbour and installed this as the fourth flagstaff.

The British force consisted of about 60 soldiers of the 96th Regiment and about 90 Royal Marines and sailors from the &quot;Hazard&quot;, plus colonists and sailors from the merchant ships provided about 200 armed men.

==Battle of Kororāreka==
The next attack on the flagstaff on 11 March 1845 was a more serious affair. There were incidents between the Ngāpuhi warriors led by Hōne Heke, Kawiti and Kapotai on 7 and 8 March. A truce was declared for the next day, a Sunday, during which the Reverend Brown entered the camp of Heke and performed a service for him and his people who had been baptised by the Church Missionary Society. A Catholic priest conducted a service for those warriors among Kawiti&#x27;s followers who were Catholics. The next day, Ngāpuhi warriors approached Kororāreka, but were fired upon. An account of the preparation for the attack later given by the CMS missionaries was that on Monday, the plans of Heke were disclosed to Gilbert Mair, who informed Police Magistrate Thomas Beckham, who then informed Lieutenant George Phillpotts, RN, of HMS &quot;Hazard&quot;, but the &quot;information was received with indifference, not unmingled with contempt&quot;.

At dawn on Tuesday 11 March, a force of about 600 Māori armed with muskets, double-barrelled guns and tomahawks attacked Kororāreka. Hōne Heke&#x27;s men attacked the guard post, killing all the defenders and cutting down the flagstaff for the fourth time. At the same time, as a diversion, Te Ruki Kawiti and his men attacked the town of Kororāreka. In the early afternoon, the powder magazine at Polack&#x27;s Stockade exploded and the surrounding buildings caught fire. The garrison of about 100 men managed to hold the perimeter while the town was evacuated to the ships moored in the bay. Lieutenant Phillpotts of ordered the bombardment of Kororāreka. Europeans and Māori proceeded to plunder the buildings, and most of the buildings in the north of the town were burned. However, Heke had ordered that the southern end of the town, which included the missionaries&#x27; homes and the church, be left untouched. Tāmati Wāka Nene and his men did not fight with the Ngāpuhi who sacked Kororāreka. As the services of the Government Brig &quot;Victoria&quot; were no longer required, Thomas Beckham ordered her to sail for Auckland. Conveying the despatches and her share of the women and children, she departed at about 7.00 p.m.

In the early hours of Thursday, 13 March, the third day, HMS &quot;Hazard&quot; prepared for sea. Lieutenant Phillpotts, RN, had deemed it advisable to sail with all despatch, considering that the flagstaff was down, the town sacked and burnt, and there was no further reason to remain. They had stayed as long as they could, and the sick and wounded required attention. At 8:30 am the flagstaff blockhouse was set alight, as well as the police office and temporary buildings on the beach. The refugees of Kororāreka sailed for Auckland, with HMS &quot;Hazard&quot; (whose sailors had taken part in the fighting ashore), the British whaler &quot;Matilda&quot;, schooner &quot;Dolphin&quot; and 21-gun United States corvette departing the Bay of Islands throughout the day.

Thirteen soldiers and civilians had died in the battle or as a result of it soon after, with about 36 wounded. Heke and Kawiti were victorious.

==Attack on the pā of Pōmare II==
The British did not fight alone but had Māori allies, particularly Tāmati Wāka Nene and his men. He had given the government assurances of the good behaviour of the Ngāpuhi and he felt that Hōne Heke had betrayed his trust. Pōmare II remained neutral.

The colonial government attempted to re-establish its authority in the Bay of Islands on 28 April 1845 with troops of the 58th and 96th Regiments, and volunteers, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Hulme, along with HMS &quot;North Star&quot;, &quot;Slains Castle&quot;, &quot;Velocity&quot;, &quot;Aurora&quot; and the Government schooner. The following day, 29 April, the force prepared to attack Otuihu, the pā of Pōmare II, notwithstanding his position of neutrality, for what were claimed to be treasonous letters from Pōmare to Pōtatau Te Wherowhero that had been intercepted. The expedition ships got under way in the morning and anchored off the Pōmare&#x27;s pā at midnight.

At daylight, they found a white flag of truce flying within the pā, which Hulme &quot;could not recognize as an emblem of peace from a supposed rebel&quot;. In response, a white flag was hoisted from HMS &quot;North Star&quot;. Having landed the troops, Hulme sent several messages through two interpreters up to the pā requesting Pōmare to come to meet him, to which Pōmare replied that Hulme come to meet him. Hulme then threatened that if Pōmare did not come, he would attack the pā. His troops advanced some distance checked by Pōmare&#x27;s men. Pōmare came down to talk to Hulme and, after some words, was promptly surrounded, taken prisoner and confined on HMS &quot;North Star&quot;.
Pomare then ordered his men not to resist the British and they dispersed into the surrounding bush. In the evening, the soldiers plundered and burnt the pā, along with making an unsuccessful attempt to cut off and disarm Pōmare&#x27;s men. This action caused considerable puzzlement since up until that time, as Pōmare had been considered neutral by himself and almost everyone else. Along with the pā, the British also burnt two pubs, or grog shops, which Pōmare had established there to encourage Pākehā settlers, sailors, whalers and others, to visit and trade with him. Pōmare was taken to Auckland on the &quot;North Star&quot;. He was released after the intervention of Tāmati Wāka Nene.

==Battle of the sticks==

After the attack on Kororāreka Heke and Kawiti and the warriors travelled inland to Lake Ōmāpere near Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Tāmati Wāka Nene built a pā at Ōkaihau, near Lake Ōmāpere. Heke&#x27;s Lake Ōmāpere pā, Te Kahika (Puketutu), sometimes called &quot;Te Mawhe&quot; in relation to a hill of that name to the north-east, was away. In April 1845, as the colonial forces gathered in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes, on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu between the two pā, and on open country between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke&#x27;s force numbered about 300 men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another 150 warriors. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about 400 warriors that supported Tāmati Wāka Nene, including his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone and the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his son Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi and Nōpera Panakareao. F. E. Maning, Jacky Marmon and John Webster, of Opononi, Hokianga were three Pākehā Māori (a European turned native) who volunteered to fight with Nene and fought alongside the warriors from Hokianga. Webster used a rifle (a novel weapon at that time) and had made two hundred cartridges.

==Attack on Heke&#x27;s pā at Puketutu==

After the destruction of Pōmare II&#x27;s pā, the 58th and 99th regiments moved to attack Heke&#x27;s pā, choosing to travel by a walking track from the Bay of Islands rather than via a cart track that ran from Kerikeri through Waimate and passed nearby Heke&#x27;s pā. This decision may have been influenced by the wish of the missionaries to keep Te Waimate mission tapu by excluding armed men so as to preserve an attitude of strict neutrality. In any event, this choice meant that cannon were not taken inland. After a difficult cross-country march, they arrived at Puketutu Pā (Te Mawhe Pā) on 7 May 1845.

Because of the almost constant intertribal warfare, the art of defensive fortifications had reached a very high level among the Māori. A pā was usually situated on top of a hill, surrounded by palisades of timber that were backed up by trenches. Since the introduction of muskets the Māori had learnt to cover the outside of the palisades with layers of flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) leaves, making them effectively bulletproof as the velocity of musket balls was dissipated by the flax leaves. For example, the pā at Ōhaeawai, the site of a battle in the Flagstaff War, was described as having an inner palisade that was high, built using pūriri logs. In front of the inner palisade was a ditch in which the warriors could shelter and reload their muskets, then fire through gaps in the two outer palisades. The British were to discover, to their considerable cost, that a defended pā was a difficult fortification to defeat.
Lieutenant Colonel Hulme and his second-in-command, Major Cyprian Bridge, made an inspection of Heke&#x27;s pā and found it to be quite formidable. Lacking any better plan, they decided on a frontal assault the following day. The British troops had no heavy guns, but they had brought with them a dozen Congreve rockets. The Māori had never seen rockets used and were anticipating a formidable display. The first two missed their target completely; the third hit the palisade, exploded and was seen to have done no damage. This display gave considerable encouragement to the Māori. Soon all the rockets had been expended, leaving the palisade intact.

The storming parties began to advance, first crossing a narrow gully between Lake Ōmāpere and the pā. Here they came under heavy fire both from the palisade and from the surrounding scrub. Kawiti and his warriors arrived and engaged the soldiers in the scrub and gullies around the pā. It became apparent that there were as many warriors outside the pā as there were inside. There followed a savage and confused battle. Eventually the discipline and cohesiveness of the British soldiers began to prevail and the Māori were driven back inside their fortress. But they were by no means beaten, far from it. Without artillery, the British had no way to overcome the defences of the pā. Hulme decided to disengage and retreat back to the Bay of Islands.

At the Battle of Puketutu Pā (Te Mawhe Pā), the 58th and 99th regiments suffered casualties of 39 wounded and 13 dead; warriors of Heke and Kawiti were also killed.

This battle is sometimes described as the Battle of Okaihau, although Okaihau is to the west.

==Raid on Kapotai&#x27;s pā==
The return to the Bay of Islands was accomplished without incident. A week later, on 15 May, Major Cyprian Bridge and three companies of troops and the warriors of Tāmati Wāka Nene attempted a surprise attack on Kapotai&#x27;s pā at Waikare Inlet, which they could reach easily by sea. The defenders of the pā became aware of the attack and chose not to defend it, although the warriors of Kapotai and Nene fought in the forests around the pā. The pā was soon burnt and destroyed.

Lieutenant Colonel Hulme returned to Auckland and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Despard, a soldier who did very little to inspire any confidence in his troops.

==Battle of Te Ahuahu==

Until the 1980s, histories of the First Māori War tend to ignore the poorly documented Battle of Te Ahuahu, yet it was in some ways the most desperate fight of the entire war. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action. It was fought entirely between the Māori: Hōne Heke and his tribe against Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors. As there was no British involvement in the action, there is limited mention of the event in contemporary British accounts.

After the successful defence of Puketutu pā on the shores of Lake Ōmāpere, Hōne Heke returned to his pā at Te Ahuahu (&quot;Heaped Up&quot;), otherwise known as Puke-nui (&quot;Big Hill&quot;), a long-extinct volcano. Te Ahuahu was a short distance from both Heke&#x27;s pā at Puketutu and the site of the later Battle of Ōhaeawai. Some days later, he went to Kaikohe to gather food supplies. During his absence, one of Tāmati Wāka Nene&#x27;s allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui (the father of Aperahama Taonui), attacked and captured Te Ahuahu. This was a tremendous blow to Heke&#x27;s mana or prestige; obviously it had to be recaptured as soon as possible.

The ensuing battle was a traditional formal Māori conflict, taking place in the open with preliminary challenges and responses. By Māori standards, the battle was quite large. Heke mustered somewhere between 400 and 500 warriors, while Tāmati Wāka Nene had about 300 men. Hōne Heke lost at least 30 warriors. There are no detailed accounts of the battle fought on 12 June 1845 nearby Te Ahuahu at Pukenui. Hugh Carleton (1874) provides a brief description of the battle: &quot;Heke committed the error (against the advice of Pene Taui) of attacking Walker, who had advanced to Pukenui. With four hundred men, he attacked about one hundred and fifty of Walker&#x27;s party, taking them also by surprise; but was beaten back with loss. Kahakaha was killed, Haratua was shot through the lungs&quot;. Thomas Walker was a name adopted by Tāmati Wāka Nene.

Rev. Richard Davis also recorded that a &quot;sharp battle was fought on the 12th inst. between the loyal and disaffected natives. The disaffected, although consisting of 500 men, were kept at bay all day, and ultimately driven off the field by the loyalists, although their force did not exceed 100. Three of our people fell, two on the side of the disaffected, and one on the side of the loyalists. When the bodies were brought home, as one of them was a principal chief of great note and bravery, he was laid in state, about a hundred yards from our fence, before he was buried. The troops were in the Bay at the time, and were sent for by Walker, the conquering chief; but they were so tardy in their movements that they did not arrive at the seat of war to commence operations until the 24th inst.!&quot;

Tāmati Wāka Nene remained in control of Heke&#x27;s pā. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. In a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Despard, Tāmati Wāka Nene described the battle as a &quot;most complete victory over Heke&quot;.

==Battle of Ōhaeawai==

A debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui&#x27;s pā at Ōhaeawai.

Although it was now the middle of the southern winter, Lieutenant Colonel Despard insisted on resuming the campaign immediately with troops from the 58th and 99th Regiments, Royal Marines and a detachment of artillery they sailed across the bay to the mouth of the Kerikeri River and began to march inland to Ōhaeawai, where Kawiti had built formidable defences around Pene Taui&#x27;s pā; the inner palisade, high, was built using pūriri logs. In front of the inner palisade was a ditch in which the warriors could shelter and reload their muskets, then fire through gaps in the two outer palisades. The conditions were atrocious: continual rain and wind on wet and sticky mud. It was several days before the entire expedition was gathered at the Waimate Mission, by which time Despard was apoplectic, so much so that when Tāmati Wāka Nene arrived with 250 men, Despard said that if he had wanted the assistance of savages, he would have asked for it. Fortunately, the interpreter delivered a completely different message.

The British troops arrived before the Ōhaeawai pā on 23 June and established a camp about away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu), they established a four-gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark, but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day, the guns were brought to within of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days, but still caused very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade, but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences.

After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun, which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene&#x27;s colours – the Union Jack. The Union Jack was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak).

This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult, Colonel Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day. The attack was directed at the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured. The casualties included Captain Grant of the 58th Regiment and Lieutenant Phillpotts of .

Shaken by his losses, Despard decided to abandon the siege. However, his Māori allies opposed this. Tāmati Wāka Nene persuaded Despard to wait for a few more days. More ammunition and supplies were brought in and the shelling continued. On the morning of 8 July, the pā was found to have been abandoned, the enemy having disappeared in the night. When they had a chance to examine it, the British officers found it to be even stronger than they had feared. It was duly destroyed, and the British retreated once again to the Bay of Islands. Te Ruki Kawiti and his warriors escaped, Hōne Heke recovered from his wounds, and a new and even stronger pā was built at Ruapekapeka.

The Battle of Ōhaeawai was presented a victory for the British force, notwithstanding the death of about a third of the soldiers. The reality of the end of the Battle of Ōhaeawai was that Te Ruki Kawiti and his warriors had abandoned the pā in a tactical withdrawal, with the Ngāpuhi moving on to build the Ruapekapeka pā from which to engage the British force on a battlefield chosen by Te Ruki Kawiti.

An account of the battle is provided by the Rev. Richard Davis, who was living at the CMS mission at Te Waimate mission and visited the pā during the siege; as a consequence, Despard complained as to interference by the missionary in the action against Hōne Heke. The Rev. Richard Davis commented on the siege that, &quot;[t]he, natives, I know, are capable of taking care of themselves. It was a happy thing for the troops, that they did not succeed in getting into the Pa. Had they accomplished their object, from the construction of the Pa the poor fellows must all have fallen. It was a sad sacrifice as it was of human life, and ought not to have been made. The Commander-in-chief had every opportunity of viewing the interior of the fort from the heights only about 500 yards distant. People&#x27;s mouths were opened rather largely on the subject. The bravery of the poor fellows who made the attack was beyond all praise; but the wisdom of their commander has been questioned. To judge of this I leave to wiser heads than mine.&quot;

==Battle of Ruapekapeka==

After the Battle of Ōhaeawai, the troops remained at Waimate until the middle of October, destroying Te Haratua&#x27;s pā at Pakaraka on 16 July 1845. Te Ruki Kawiti and his allies, including Mataroria and Motiti, constructed a pā at the place now known as Ruapekapeka, which was in a good defensive position, in an area of no strategic value, well away from non-combatants. The new governor, Sir George Grey, tried to make peace, but the Māori rebels wished to test the strength of their new pā against the British. A considerable force was assembled in the Bay of Islands. Between 7 and 11 December 1845, it moved up to the head of the Kawakawa River, one of the streams flowing into the Bay of Islands. They were then faced with of very difficult country before they could reach Kawiti&#x27;s new pā, Ruapekapeka or the Bat&#x27;s Nest. This pā improved on the design used at the Ōhaeawai pā. Lieutenant Balneavis, who took part in the siege described Ruapekapeka in his journal as &quot;a model of engineering, with a treble stockade, and huts inside, these also fortified. A large embankment in rear of it, full of under-ground holes for the men to live in; communications with subterranean passages enfilading the ditch&quot;.

The colonial forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Despard, consisted of the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot (led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Wynyard), the 99th Regiment (led by Captain Reed) and 42 volunteers from Auckland (led by Captain Atkyns). Tāmati Wāka Nene Patuone, Tawhai, Repa, and Nōpera Pana-kareao led 450 warriors in support of the colonial forces. The soldiers were supported by the Royal Marines (under Captain Langford) and sailors from HMS &quot;Castor&quot;, HMS &quot;Racehorse&quot;, , , and the 18-gun sloop HEICS &quot;Elphinstone&quot; of the Honourable East India Company.

The ordnance used in the battle were three naval 32-pounders, one 18-pounder, two 12-pounder howitzers, one 6-pounder brass gun, four 5½&quot; brass Mann mortars, and two Congreve rocket-tubes. It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the pā. The cannon bombardment started on 27 December 1845. The directing officers were Lieutenant Bland (HMS &quot;Racehorse&quot;) and Lieutenant Leeds (HEICS &quot;Elphinstone&quot;); Lieutenant Egerton (HMS &quot;North Star&quot;) was in charge of firing the rocket-tubes. The guns were fired with accuracy throughout the siege, causing considerable damage to the palisades, although those inside the pā were safe in the underground shelters.

The siege continued for some two weeks, with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, William Walker Turau, the brother of Eruera Maihi Patuone, discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned, although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. The assaulting force drove Kawiti and his warriors out of the pā. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle. The reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the pā is the subject of continuing debate. It was later suggested that most of the Māori had been at church, as many of them were devout Christians. Knowing that their opponents, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday. The Rev. Richard Davis noted in his diary of 14 January 1846, &quot;Yesterday the news came that the Pa was taken on Sunday by the sailors, and that twelve Europeans were killed and thirty wounded. The native loss uncertain. It appears the natives did not expect fighting on the Sabbath, and were, the great part of them, out of the Pa, smoking and playing. It is also reported that the troops were assembling for service. The tars, having made a tolerable breach with their cannon on Saturday, took the opportunity of the careless position of the natives, and went into the Pa, but did not get possession without much hard fighting, hand to hand.&quot;
Later commentators cast doubt as to this explanation, as fighting did continue on Sunday at the Battle of Ōhaeawai. Another explanation provided by later commentators is that Heke deliberately abandoned the pā to lay a trap in the surrounding bush, as this would provide cover and give Heke a considerable advantage. If this is the correct explanation, then the Heke&#x27;s ambush was only partially successful, as Kawiti&#x27;s men, fearing their chief had fallen, returned towards the pā and the British forces engaged the Māori rebels immediately behind the pā.
It was Māori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became tapu, so the Ngāpuhi left the Ruapekapeka pā. After the battle, Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some north-west to Waiomio, the ancestral home of the Ngatihine. The British forces, left in occupation of the pā, proclaimed a victory. Lieutenant Colonel Despard claimed the outcome as a &quot;brilliant success&quot;.
The casualties in the British forces were in the 58th, 2 men killed; in the 99th, 1 man killed and 11 wounded; 2 marines killed and 10 wounded; and 9 seamen killed and 12 wounded.

Later examination of the pā showed that it had been very well designed and very strongly built. Under different circumstances, it could have been a long and costly siege. The earthworks can still be seen just south of Kawakawa. The ingenious design of the Ōhaeawai pā and the Ruapekapeka pā became known to other Māori tribes. These designs were the basis of what is now called the &quot;gunfighter pā&quot; that were built during the later New Zealand Wars.

The Battle of Ruapekapeka Pā marked the end of the Flagstaff War. Kawiti and Heke did not suffer an outright defeat, but the war affected the Ngāpuhi – in the disruption to agriculture and in the presence of British forces who brought with them disease and social disruption. While Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight, Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the colonial forces would leave Ngāpuhi land, and they asked Tāmati Wāka Nene to act as an intermediary in the negotiations with Governor Grey. The Governor accepted that clemency was the best way to ensure peace in the north. Heke and Kawiti were granted free pardons and none of their land was confiscated. This prompted Wāka to say to Grey, &quot;you have saved us all.&quot; As peace was concluded in the north, a new war was about to break out at the southern end of the North Island, around Wellington.

The British casualties during the war were 82 killed and 164 wounded. Heke and Kawiti assessed their losses at 60 killed and 80 wounded, although the British estimated 94 killed and 148 wounded. There is no record of the numbers of allied Māori hurt during the conflict.

==Outcome of the Flagstaff War==

After the capture of Ruapekapeka, Kawiti and Heke approached Tāmati Wāka Nene about a ceasefire. This did not necessarily suggest they wished to acquiesce to British demands, but it did reflect the economic strain imposed on the Ngāpuhi and the disruption of food supplies and epidemics that resulted in significant numbers of deaths. The war was, by Māori standards, unusually prolonged, and their casualties, whilst not crippling, were indeed serious. Arguably, the British army, which was hardened to prolonged campaigns, may have had the resources to continue, had it not been for trouble brewing in the south.

The outcome of the Flagstaff War is therefore a matter of some debate. Although the war was widely lauded as a British victory, it is clear that the outcome was somewhat more complex, even contentious.

To some extent, the objectives of the colonial government had been achieved: the war brought Kawiti and Heke&#x27;s rebellion to an end.

The capture of the Ruapekapeka pā can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.

It is clear that Kawiti and Heke made considerable gains from the war, despite the British victory at Ruapekapeka. After the war&#x27;s conclusion, Heke enjoyed a considerable surge in prestige and authority. The missionary Richard Davis, writing in August 1848, stated that Heke had &quot;raised himself to the very pinnacle of honour,&quot; and that &quot;the whole of the tribes around pay him profound homage.&quot;

The question of the ultimate result of the Northern War is contentious, as the British, Heke and Kawiti had all gained from its conclusion. For the British, their authority was preserved and the rebellion crushed, and their settlement of the area continued; although the control exercised by the colonial government over the north was somewhat limited and exercised mainly through Tāmati Wāka Nene. Heke and Kawiti both enjoyed increased prestige and authority amongst their peers.

It is clear that both the British and their allies, as well as Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti, found the prospect of peace attractive, as the war took a considerable toll on both sides. Far from being a one-sided victory, in a military sense the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities. The political legacy of the rebellion by Kawiti and Heke was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of the opinions of the Ngāpuhi before taking action in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The Waitangi Tribunal in &quot;The Te Roroa Report 1992&quot; (Wai 38) state that &quot;[a]fter the war in the north, government policy was to place a buffer zone of European settlement between Ngapuhi and Auckland.&quot;

The flagstaff which had proved so controversial was not re-erected. Whilst the region was still nominally under British influence, the fact that the Government&#x27;s flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. This was not lost on Henry Williams, who, writing to E.G. Marsh on 28 May 1846, stated that &quot;the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.&quot; The flagstaff that now stands at Kororāreka was erected in January 1858 at the direction of Kawiti&#x27;s son Maihi Paraone Kawiti; the symbolism of the erection of the fifth flagstaff at Kororāreka by the Ngāpuhi warriors who had conducted the Flagstaff War, and not by government decree, indicates the colonial government did not want to risk any further confrontation with the Ngāpuhi.

<text>A pest is any organism harmful to humans or human concerns. The term is particularly used for creatures that damage crops, livestock, and forestry or cause a nuisance to people, especially in their homes. Humans have modified the environment for their own purposes and are intolerant of other creatures occupying the same space when their activities impact adversely on human objectives. Thus, an elephant is unobjectionable in its natural habitat but a pest when it tramples crops.

Some animals are disliked because they bite or sting; wolves, snakes, wasps, ants, bed bugs, fleas and ticks belong in this category. Others enter the home; these include houseflies, which land on and contaminate food; beetles, which tunnel into the woodwork; and other animals that scuttle about on the floor at night, like rats and cockroaches, which are often associated with unsanitary conditions.

Agricultural and horticultural crops are attacked by a wide variety of pests, the most important being rodents, insects, mites, nematodes and gastropod molluscs. The damage they do results both from the direct injury they cause to the plants and from the indirect consequences of the fungal, bacterial or viral infections they transmit. Plants have their own defences against these attacks but these may be overwhelmed, especially in habitats where the plants are already stressed, or where the pests have been accidentally introduced and may have no natural enemies. The pests affecting trees are predominantly insects, and many of these have also been introduced inadvertently and lack natural enemies, and some have transmitted novel fungal diseases with devastating results.

Humans have traditionally performed pest control in agriculture and forestry by the use of pesticides; however, other methods exist such as mechanical control, and recently developed biological controls.

== Concept ==
A pest is any living thing which humans consider troublesome to themselves, their possessions, or the environment. Pests can cause issues with crops, human or animal health, buildings, and wild areas or larger landscapes. An older usage of the word &quot;pest&quot; is of a deadly epidemic disease, specifically plague. In its broadest sense, a pest is a competitor to humanity. Pests include plants, pathogens, invertebrates, vertebrates, or any organism that harms an ecosystem.


===Animals===
Animals are considered pests or vermin when they injure people or damage crops, forestry, or buildings. Elephants are regarded as pests by the farmers whose crops they raid and trample. Mosquitoes and ticks are vectors that can transmit ailments but are also pests because of the distress caused by their bites. Grasshoppers are usually solitary herbivores of little economic importance until the conditions are met for them to enter a swarming phase, become locusts and cause enormous damage. Many people appreciate birds in the countryside and their gardens, but when these accumulate in large masses, they can be a nuisance. Flocks of starlings can consist of hundreds of thousands of individual birds, their roosts can be noisy and their droppings voluminous; the droppings are acidic and can cause corrosion of metals, stonework, and brickwork as well as being unsightly. Pigeons in urban settings may be a health hazard, and gulls near the coast can become a nuisance, especially if they become bold enough to snatch food from passers-by. All birds are a risk at airfields where they can be sucked into aircraft engines. Woodpeckers sometimes excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, causing structural damage; they also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, down-spouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting. Jellyfish can form vast swarms which may be responsible for damage to fishing gear, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea.

Many of the animals that we regard as pests live in our homes. Before humans built dwellings, these creatures lived in the wider environment, but co-evolved with humans, adapting to the warm, sheltered conditions that a house provides, the wooden timbers, the furnishings, the food supplies and the rubbish dumps. Many no longer exist as free-living organisms in the outside world, and can therefore be considered to be domesticated. The St Kilda house mouse rapidly became extinct when the last islander left the island of St Kilda, Scotland in 1930, but the St Kilda field mouse survived.

===Plants===
Plants may be considered pests, for example, if they are invasive species or weeds. There is no universal definition of what makes a plant a pest. Some governments, such as that of Western Australia, permit their authorities to prescribe as a pest plant &quot;any plant that, in the local government authority&#x27;s opinion, is likely to adversely affect the environment of the district, the value of property in the district, or the health, comfort or convenience of the district&#x27;s inhabitants.&quot; An example of such a plant prescribed under this regulation is caltrop, &quot;Tribulus terrestris&quot;, which can cause poisoning in sheep and goats, but is mainly a nuisance around buildings, roadsides and recreation areas because of its uncomfortably sharp spiny burrs.

===Pathogens===

Disease-causing pathogens such as fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, and viruses can cause damage to crops and garden plants.

==Ecology==

The term &quot;plant pest&quot;, mainly applied to insect micropredators of plants, has a specific definition in terms of the International Plant Protection Convention and phytosanitary measures worldwide. A pest is any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal, or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products.

Worldwide, agricultural pest impacts are increased by higher degrees of interconnectedness. This is due to the increased risk that any particular pest problem anywhere in the world (as a system) will propagate across the entire system.

===Plant defences against pests===

Plants have developed strategies that they use in their own defence, be they thorns (modified stems) or spines (modified leaves), stings, a thick cuticle or waxy deposits, with the second line of defence being toxic or distasteful secondary metabolites. Mechanical injury to the plant tissues allows the entry of pathogens and stimulates the plant to mobilise its chemical defences. The plant soon seals off the wound to reduce further damage.

Plants sometimes take active steps to reduce herbivory. &quot;Macaranga triloba&quot; for example has adapted its thin-walled stems to create ideal housing for an ant &quot;Crematogaster&quot; spp., which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores. In addition to providing housing, the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source in the form of food bodies located on the leaf stipules. Similarly, several &quot;Acacia&quot; tree species have developed stout spines that are swollen at the base, forming a hollow structure that provides housing for ants which protect the plant. These &quot;Acacia&quot; trees also produce nectar in nectaries on their leaves as food for the ants.

===Climate change===
Pest ranges are heavily determined by climate. The most common example for the longest time has been rainfall: Although drought stress weakens crop disease resistance, drought also retards contagion and infection; and some variability in precipitation is universal. More recently climate change has been rapidly altering ranges, mostly by pushing them towards the poles (both North and South). From 1960–2013 ranges have shifted poleward by per year - albeit with significant differences between taxa. (Especially in the case of viruses and nematodes which show the opposite trend, toward the equator. This may be due to their lack of airborne dispersal, so their trend conforms with the trend of human-aided dispersal; or identification difficulties in the field.) In Europe, crop pests are expected to burgeon as the vertebrate predators which control them are expected to be suppressed by future climatic conditions.

==Economic impact==

=== In agriculture and horticulture===
Together pests and diseases cause up to 40% yield losses every year. The animal groups of the greatest importance as agricultural pests are (in order of economic importance) insects, mites, nematodes and gastropod molluscs.

Insects are responsible for two major forms of damage to crops. First, there is the direct injury they cause to the plants as they feed on the tissues; a reduction in leaf surface available for photosynthesis, distortion of growing shoots, a diminution of the plant&#x27;s growth and vigour, and the wilting of shoots and branches caused by the insects&#x27; tunneling activities. Secondly there is the indirect damage, where the insects do little direct harm, but either transmit or allow entry of fungal, bacterial or viral infections. Although some insects are polyphagous, many are restricted to one specific crop, or group of crops. In many cases it is the larva that feeds on the plant, building up a nutritional store that will be used by the short-lived adult; sawfly and lepidopteran larvae feed mainly on the aerial portions of plants while beetle larvae tend to live underground, feeding on roots, or tunnel into the stem or under the bark. The true bugs, Hemiptera, have piercing and sucking mouthparts and live by sucking sap from plants. These include aphids, whiteflies and scale insects. Apart from weakening the plant, they encourage the growth of sooty mould on the honeydew the insects produce, which cuts out the light and reduces photosynthesis, stunting the plant&#x27;s growth. They often transmit serious viral diseases between plants.

The mites that cause most trouble in the field are the spider mites. These are less than in diameter, can be very numerous, and thrive in hot, dry conditions. They mostly live on the underside of leaves and puncture the plant cells to feed, with some species forming webbing. They occur on nearly all important food crops and ornamental plants, both outdoors and under glass, and include some of the most economically important pests. Another important group of mites is the gall mites which affect a wide range of plants, several mite species being major pests causing substantial economic damage to crops. They can feed on the roots or the aerial parts of plants and transmit viruses. Some examples are the big bud mite that transmits the reversion virus of blackcurrants, the coconut mite which can devastate coconut production, and the cereal rust mite which transmits several grass and cereal viruses. Being exceedingly minute, many plant mites are spread by wind, although others use insects or other arthropods as a means to disperse.

The nematodes (eelworms) that attack plants are minute, often too small to be seen with the naked eye, but their presence is often apparent in the galls or &quot;knots&quot; they form in plant tissues. Vast numbers of nematodes are found in soil and attack roots, but others affect stems, buds, leaves, flowers and fruits. High infestations cause stunting, deformation and retardation of plant growth, and the nematodes can transmit viral diseases from one plant to another. When its populations are high, the potato cyst nematode can cause reductions of 80% in yield of susceptible potato varieties. The nematode eggs survive in the soil for many years, being stimulated to hatch by chemical cues produced by roots of susceptible plants.

Slugs and snails are terrestrial gastropod molluscs which typically chew leaves, stems, flowers, fruit and vegetable debris. Slugs and snails differ little from each other and both do considerable damage to plants. With novel crops being grown and with insect pests having been brought more under control by biological and other means, the damage done by molluscs becomes of greater significance. Terrestrial molluscs need moist environments; snails may be more noticeable because their shells provide protection from desiccation, while most slugs live in soil and only come out to feed at night. They devour seedlings, damage developing shoots and feed on salad crops and cabbages, and some species tunnel into potatoes and other tubers.

=== Weeds ===

A weed is a plant considered undesirable in a particular situation; the term has no botanical significance. Often, weeds are simply those native plants that are adapted to grow in disturbed ground, the disturbance caused by ploughing and cultivation favouring them over other species. Any plant is a weed if it appears in a location where it is unwanted; Bermuda grass makes a good lawn plant under hot dry conditions but become a bad weed when it out-competes cultivated plants.

A different group of weeds consists of those that are invasive, introduced, often unintentionally, to habitats to which they are not native but in which they thrive. Without their original competitors, herbivores, and diseases, they may increase and become a serious nuisance. One such plant is purple loosestrife, a native of Europe and Asia where it occurs in ditches, wet meadows and marshes; introduced into North America, it has no natural enemies to keep it in check and has taken over vast tracts of wetlands to the exclusion of native species.

=== In forestry ===
In forestry, pests may affect various parts of the tree, from its roots and trunk to the canopy far overhead. The accessibility of the part of the tree affected may make detection difficult, so that a pest problem may already be far advanced before it is first observed from the ground. The larch sawfly and spruce budworm are two insect pests prevalent in Alaska and aerial surveys can show which sections of forest are being defoliated in any given year so that appropriate remedial action can be taken.

Some pests may not be present on the tree all year round, either because of their life cycle or because they rotate between different host species at different times of the year. In forestry, pests may affect various parts of the tree, from its roots and trunk to the canopy far overhead. The larvae of wood-boring beetles, for example, are notorious for spending years excavating tunnels under the bark of trees, leading to significant structural damage. These larvae only emerge into the open for brief periods as adults, primarily to mate and disperse. The import and export of timber has inadvertently assisted some insect pests to establish themselves far from their country of origin. An insect may be of little importance in its native range, being kept under control by parasitoid wasps, predators, and the natural resistance of the host trees, but be a serious pest in a region into which it has been introduced. This is the case with the emerald ash borer, an insect native to north-eastern Asia, which, since its arrival in North America, has killed millions of ash trees. Another example of a beetle species that exhibits pest behavior are &quot;Melolontha Hippocastrani&quot;, that cause severe, long-term damage on young trees by feeding on roots.

=== In buildings ===

Animals able to live in the dry conditions found in buildings include many arthropods such as beetles, cockroaches, moths, mites, and silverfish. Another group, including termites, woodworm, longhorn beetles, and wood ants cause structural damage to buildings and furniture. The natural habitat of these is the decaying parts of trees. The deathwatch beetle infests the structural timbers of old buildings, mostly attacking hardwood, especially oak. The initial attack usually follows the entry of water into a building and the subsequent decay of damp timber. Furniture beetles mainly attack the sapwood of both hard and soft wood, only attacking the heartwood when it is modified by fungal decay. The presence of the beetles only becomes apparent when the larvae gnaw their way out, leaving small circular holes in the timber.

Carpet beetles and clothes moths cause non-structural damage to property such as clothing and carpets. It is the larvae that are destructive, feeding on wool, hair, fur, feathers and down. The moth larvae live where they feed, but the beetle larvae may hide behind skirting boards or in other similar locations between meals. They may be introduced to the home in any product containing animal fibres including upholstered furniture; the moths are feeble fliers but the carpet beetles may also enter houses through open windows. Furniture beetles, carpet beetles and clothes moths are also capable of creating great damage to museum exhibits, zoological and botanical collections, and other cultural heritage items. Constant vigilance is required to prevent an attack, and newly acquired items, and those that have been out on loan, may need quarantining before being added to the general collection.

There are over four thousand species of cockroach worldwide, but only four species are commonly regarded as pests, having adapted to live permanently in buildings. Considered to be a sign of unsanitary conditions, they feed on almost anything, reproduce rapidly and are difficult to eradicate. They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals, and are linked with allergic reactions in humans.

Various insects attack dry food products, with flour beetles, the drugstore beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle and the Indianmeal moth being found worldwide. The insects may be present in the warehouse or maybe introduced during shipping, in retail outlets, or in the home; they may enter packets through tiny cracks or may chew holes in the packaging. The longer a product is stored, the more likely it is to become contaminated, with the insects often originating from dry pet foods.

Some mites, too, infest foodstuffs and other stored products. Each substance has its own specific mite, and they multiply with great rapidity. One of the most damaging is the flour mite, which is found in grain and may become exceedingly abundant in poorly stored material. In time, predatory mites usually move in and control the flour mites.

==Countermeasures==

===Pest control in agriculture and horticulture===

The control of pests in crops is as old as civilisation. The earliest approach was mechanical, from ploughing to picking off insects by hand. Early methods included the use of sulphur compounds, before 2500 BC in Sumeria. In ancient China, insecticides derived from plants were in use by 1200 BC to treat seeds and to fumigate plants. Chinese agronomy recognised biological control by natural enemies of pests and the varying of planting time to reduce pests before the first century AD. The agricultural revolution in Europe saw the introduction of effective plant-based insecticides such as pyrethrum, derris, quassia, and tobacco extract. The phylloxera (a powdery mildew) damage to the wine industry in the 19th century resulted in the development of resistant varieties and grafting, and the accidental discovery of effective chemical pesticides, Bordeaux mixture (lime and copper sulphate) and Paris Green (an arsenic compound), both very widely used. Biological control also became established as an effective measure in the second half of the 19th century, starting with the vedalia beetle against cottony cushion scale. All these methods have been refined and developed since their discovery.

===Pest control in forestry===
Forest pests inflict costly damage, but treating them is often unaffordable, given the relatively low value of forest products compared to agricultural crops. It is also generally impossible to eradicate forest pests, given the difficulty of examining entire trees, and the certainty that pesticides would damage many forest organisms other than the intended pests. Forest integrated pest management therefore aims to use a combination of prevention, cultural control measures, and direct control (such as pesticide use). Cultural measures include choosing appropriate species, keeping competing vegetation under control, ensuring a suitable stocking density, and minimizing injury and stress to trees.

===Pest control in buildings===
Pest control in buildings can be approached in several ways, depending on the type of pest and the area affected. Methods include improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides. For example, the pesticide Boron can be impregnated into the fibres of cellulose insulation to kill self-grooming insects such as ants and cockroaches. Clothes moths can be controlled with airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating and the use of chemicals. Traditional mothballs deter adult moths with strong-smelling naphthalene; modern ones use volatile repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene. Moth larvae can be killed with insecticides such as permethrin or pyrethroids. However, insecticides cannot safely be used in food storage areas; alternative treatments include freezing foods for four days at or baking for half an hour at to kill any insects present.

==In mythology, religion, folklore, and culture==
Pests have attracted human attention from the birth of civilisation. Plagues of locusts caused devastation in the ancient Middle East, and were recorded in tombs in Ancient Egypt from as early as 2470 BC, and in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, as taking place in Egypt around 1446 BC. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; mentions locusts taking to the wing to escape fire. Given the impact of agricultural pests on human lives, people have prayed for deliverance. For example, the 10th century Greek monk Tryphon of Constantinople is said to have prayed &quot;Snails, earwigs and all other creatures, hurt not the vines, nor the land nor the fruit of the trees, nor the vegetables ... but depart into the wild mountains.&quot;
The 11th-century Old English medical text &quot;Lacnunga&quot; contained charms and spells to ward off or treat pests such as &quot;wid smeogan wyrme&quot;, &quot;penetrating worms&quot;, in this case requiring a charm to be sung, accompanied by covering the wound with spittle, pounded green centaury, and hot cow&#x27;s urine.
The 20th century &quot;prayer against pests&quot; including the words &quot;By Your power may these injurious animals be driven off so that they will do no harm to any one and will leave our fields and meadows unharmed&quot; was printed in the 1956 &quot;Rural Life Prayerbook&quot;.

<text>Pest () is the part of Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, that lies on the eastern bank of the Danube. Pest was administratively unified with Buda and Óbuda in 1873; prior to this, it was an independent city. In colloquial Hungarian, &quot;Pest&quot; is sometimes also used &quot;pars pro toto&quot; to refer to Budapest as a whole. 

Comprising about two-thirds of the city&#x27;s area, Pest is flatter and much more heavily urbanized than Buda. Many of Budapest&#x27;s most notable sites are in Pest, including the Inner City (), the Parliament (&quot;Országház&quot;), the Opera, the Great Market Hall, Heroes&#x27; Square, and Andrássy Avenue. 

==Etymology==
According to Ptolemy the settlement was called &quot;Pession&quot; in antiquity (Contra-Aquincum). Alternatively, the name &quot;Pest&quot; may have come from a Slavic word meaning &quot;furnace&quot;, &quot;oven&quot; (Bulgarian ; Serbian /&quot;peć&quot;; Croatian &quot;peć&quot;), related to the word (meaning &quot;cave&quot;), probably with reference to a local cave where fire burned. The spelling &quot;Pesth&quot; was occasionally used in English, even as late as the early 20th century, although it is now considered archaic.

==History==

Pest was originally founded as a Celtic settlement, then a fortified camp established by the Romans (Contra-Aquincum) across the river from their military border camp at Aquincum. Remains of the original Roman camp can still be seen at Március 15. tér.

During the Middle Ages, Pest was an independent city separate from Buda/Ofen, which became an important economic center during the 11th–13th centuries. The first written mention dates back to 1148.

Pest was destroyed in 1241 Mongol invasion of Hungary, but was rebuilt shortly thereafter.

Demographically, in the 15th century Pest was mostly Hungarian, while Buda across the Danube had a German-majority population.
In 1838 Pest was flooded by the Danube; parts of the city were under as much as eight feet of water, and the flood destroyed or seriously damaged three-fourths of the city&#x27;s buildings. In 1849 the first suspension bridge, the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, was constructed across the Danube connecting Pest with Buda. Subsequently, in 1873, the two cities were unified with Óbuda to become Budapest.

<text>Since the 1958 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, the various republican governments of Iraq have used a number of different flags, all featuring the pan-Arab colors of green, black, white, and red. The current official and internationally recognized flag of Iraq () was adopted in 2008 as a temporary compromise, and consists of the three equal horizontal red, white, and black stripes of the Arab Liberation Flag, that was first used by Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Egyptian Revolution, with the &quot;takbīr&quot; written in green in the Kufic script that was originally added by Saddam Hussein following the Gulf War&quot;.&quot;

This basic tricolour has been in use since its adoption on 31 July 1963, with several changes to the green symbols in the central white stripes; the most recent version adopted on 22 January 2008 bears the &quot;takbīr&quot; rendered in dark green and removes the three green stars present since 1963. The flag was initially meant to be temporary but has remained the official flag long past originally intended.

== Colour scheme==
Valid for Iraqi flags 1963–present

==History==

=== Ancient Mesopotamia 2334–539 BC ===
===Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258)===

The Abbasid Revolution against the Umayyad Caliphate adopted black for its for which their partisans were called the s. Their rivals chose other colours in reaction; among these, forces loyal to Marwan II adopted red. The choice of black as the colour of the Abbasid Revolution was already motivated by the &quot;black standards out of Khorasan&quot; tradition associated with the Mahdi. The contrast of white vs. black as the Fatimid vs. Abbasid dynastic colour over time developed in white as the colour of Shia Islam and black as the colour of Sunni Islam. After the revolution, Islamic apocalyptic circles admitted that the Abbasid banners would be black but asserted that the Mahdi&#x27;s standard would be black and larger. Anti-Abbasid circles cursed &quot;the black banners from the East&quot;, &quot;first and last&quot;.

===Kingdom of Iraq (1921–1959)===

The first flag of modern Iraq was in Mandatory Iraq, and was adopted in 1921. It was a black-white-green horizontal flag, with a red triangle extending from the mast side, inspired by the flag of the Arab Revolt. It was soon changed to a new version with a red trapezoid replacing the triangle containing two, seven-point white stars denoting the Tigris River and the Euphrates River. Both designs also reflected the newly installed Hashemite Dynasty in Iraq (originally from the Hejaz in the Arabian Peninsula), who had played a leading role in the Arab Revolt. As such, it was similar to the flags of Hashemite Jordan, and the short-lived Kingdom of Hejaz. The new flag continued to be used in the Kingdom of Iraq.

===1958===
In 1958, in response to the merger of Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic, the two Hashemite kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan established the Arab Federation, a confederation of the two states. The flag of the union was essentially that of Jordan but without seven pointed star in the red chevron. This flag is identical to the flag of Palestine adopted in 1964, and almost identical to the flag of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The union lasted less than six months, being terminated by the Iraqi Revolution of 1958 in July.

===Qasimist Iraq (1959–1963)===

Following the Revolution of 14 July 1958, led by Abd al-Karim Qasim, which abolished the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq and turned the country into a republic, Iraq adopted a new flag (Law 102 of 1959) that consisted of a black-white-green vertical tricolour, with a red eight-pointed star with a yellow circle at its centre. The black, white, green, and red are the Pan-Arab colors, representing pan-Arabism, with the yellow Kurdish Sun in the middle to represent the Iraqi Kurds, surrounded by the red Star of Ishtar to represent the indigenous Assyrians.

===Ba&#x27;athist Iraq (1963–2004)===

After Qassim was overthrown by the Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1963, the new government, led by the Nasserist Abdul Salam Arif (under the influence of what would become the Arab Socialist Union), adopted a modified version of the Arab Liberation Flag as the new flag of Iraq on 31 July 1963 (Law 28 of 1963). This horizontal tricolour of red, white, and black bands (a subset of the Pan-Arab colours, first used in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952) formed the basis of the flag of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Though the UAR broke up in 1961, hopes for Arab unity persisted. As such, whereas the UAR flag had two green stars in the white band, signifying its two members (Egypt and Syria), the new Iraqi flag had three stars, symbolising the aspiration that Iraq would join with Egypt and Syria in a new union. Sharing this goal, Syria adopted the new Iraqi flag as its own later that same year. This remained the flag of Syria until 1971, when the green stars were replaced by the Hawk of Quraish as the Coat of arms of Syria.

During the presidency of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi Flag Law No. 28 of 1963 was replaced by Flag Law No. 33 of 1986, which did not alter the flag but changed the meaning of the three stars from their original geographic meaning to representations of the three tenets of the Ba&#x27;ath Party motto: &quot;&quot; (unity, freedom and socialism).
On 13 January 1991, the flag was modified by Flag Law No. 6 of 1991. At the instigation of President Saddam Hussein, the &#x27; (the phrase &quot;Allahu akbar&quot;, meaning &quot;God is the greatest&quot; in Arabic) was added in green between the stars. The form of the &#x27; was said to be Saddam&#x27;s own handwriting. Many interpreted the addition of the sacred Islamic text as an attempt to garner wartime support from previously outlawed religious Iraqi leaders, to stop the disrespect of the Iraqi flag in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, and to bolster the Iraqi government&#x27;s Islamist credentials in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War. Despite this, the flag without the Takbir remained legal and remained in co-official use until 2004. The version without the Takbir was never officially used by the American administration.

As with other flags inscribed with Arabic script, the hoist is to the right of the obverse (front) of the flag. The &quot;hamza&quot; over the &quot;alif&quot; of “&quot;Allah&quot;” in the main variant seems to be a spelling error according to formal Arabic grammar, but it is a common mistake found in many texts.

This flag remerged during the 2012–2013 Iraqi protests as a symbol of Sunni (mainly Arab and Turkmen) identity in Iraq, and remains in use by Sunni Iraqi diaspora worldwide. The flag also remains in use by rebel groups such as the Free Iraqi Army, the Naqshbandi Army and the Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance, often swapping between the original 1963 and takbir versions of the flag. 

Because of the associations between these movements and the flag, the flag is commonly retroactively known or perceived as being a Ba&#x27;athist flag, Saddamist flag or Sunni flag, despite being an inherently non-sectarian symbol with Nasserist origins that had widespread use long before the rule of Saddam Hussein.

===2004–2008===
Owing to differing views on a flag proposed by the United States-appointed administration, and the prevailing opposition to an outright abandonment of the current Iraqi flag, a compromise measure was adopted by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi interim administration in 2004. The basic form of the existing flag was retained; however, the &quot;takbīr&quot; was rendered in traditional stylized Kufic script, as opposed to the handwriting of Saddam Hussein.

The modified flag was unveiled at the ceremony marking the technical &quot;handover&quot; of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority occupation forces to the U.S.-appointed administration on 28 July 2004.

Despite this measure, the Kurdish population still opposed the flag, as it contained the three stars associated with the Ba&#x27;athist regime of Saddam Hussein, and thus, the atrocities that were committed upon the Kurds by the Ba&#x27;athists. This eventually led to the removal of the three stars in 2008, which also provoked some criticism among non-Kurdish Iraqis, who flew it in protest.

===2008–present===
On 22 January 2008, the Council of Representatives of Iraq approved its new design for the national flag, confirmed by Law 9 of 2008 as the compromising temporary replacement for the Ba&#x27;athist Saddam-era flag. In this current version, the three stars were removed, with the two words of the &quot;takbīr&quot; being brought closer together and rendered in bold, and corrected the previous spelling of &quot;Allah&quot; ( to ). The removal of the three stars was demanded by the Kurdish population of Iraq, who associated the three stars with the Al-Anfal genocide. But their removal provoked criticism among non-Kurdish Iraqis, mainly Iraqi Arabs, who argued that the stars did not represent the Ba&#x27;athist regime, and the city of Fallujah refused to fly the temporary flag that year unless instructed otherwise. The parliament intended for the new design to last one year, after which a final decision on the flag would be made. However, the flag law was reviewed in parliament on 30 August 2009.

== Symbolism ==
The Iraqi flag consists of four colours: red, white, green and black, inspired by the poetic verse of Safi al-Din al-Hilli: &quot;Our actions are bright, our battlefields are dark, our lands are green, and our swords are red with the blood of our enemies&quot;.

== Specifications ==

The flag is in the form of a rectangle, the width of which is two-thirds of its length, and it consists of three horizontal bands of equal dimensions, the top in red, the middle in white, and the bottom in black, and the words ʾAllāhu ʾakbar &quot;الله اكبر&quot; in Kufic script coloured green is in the middle of the middle white rectangle. The ratio of flag is 2:3.

==Flag proposals and flag contest==
===2004 flag proposal and controversy===

Following the military invasion of Iraq by the United States in 2003, the Iraqi government was overthrown, and the Ba&#x27;ath party was outlawed. Strong speculation followed that the U.S. government would press for a change in the Iraqi flag to remove its pan-Arab symbolism, and to make a definitive break with the period of Ba&#x27;athist rule. To a degree, this view was shared by some groups in Iraq. In addition to some displeasure among Iraqis who had suffered under Saddam Hussein to retaining national symbols used by his government, there was also strong aversion to the flag from Iraq&#x27;s Kurdish minority, who resented its evocation of pan-Arabism. However, Iraqi opponents of changing the flag argued that since the flag had been used since 1963, long before Saddam Hussein&#x27;s presidency, it was unfair to characterise it as a &quot;Saddamist&quot; flag. They also stressed that pan-Arabism has been a dominant popular principle among Iraqi&#x27;s majority population for decades prior to Iraqi independence in 1932.

On 14 August 2004 the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) announced a new flag during Saddam&#x27;s Iraq. The IGC stated that, from around 30 competing entries, it had chosen a design by the distinguished Iraqi artist-architect Rifat Chadirji, who lived in London, and is a brother of a member of the IGC. Chadirji commented that the guidelines stipulated that Iraq should be portrayed as part of the Western world, with historical elements included. The simplicity of his design was inspired by the flags of Canada and Switzerland, and it also shares elements (a crescent, stripes, a light blue shade) with the flag of his ethnic group, the Iraqi Turkmen.

The proposed flag had several meanings:
The design marked a notable break with the three flags of modern Iraqi history (namely the Arab Revolt-inspired flag of the Kingdom, the flag introduced by Abd al-Karim Qasim, and the Arab Liberation inspired flag of 1963), all of which were based on the four Pan-Arab colours. Indeed, of these colours, only white was represented in the IGC design. Moreover, Islamic crescents are usually depicted in green or red in Arab heraldry. The proposed change provoked an intensely negative reaction across groups of Iraq&#x27;s Arab majority, including those vehemently opposed to Saddam Hussein. Those opposed to the U.S. occupation, including Shi&#x27;a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, decried the design as an attempt by the U.S. government to strip Iraq of its identity, and its historically prominent role in the Arab world. In particular, critics lamented the proposed abandonment of the Arab Liberation Flag, the omission of the traditional colours of pan-Arabism, and the removal of the &quot;takbīr&quot;.

Additionally, the new flag&#x27;s predominantly blue-on-white appearance immediately antagonized many in Iraq because of the claim that it was similar to the flag of Israel.

The new flag was reported to have been burned by insurgents in Fallujah on 27 April 2004, the day before its planned official adoption. 

On 28 April 2004, IGC President Masoud Barzani formally presented a modified version of the flag in which the originally very light shade of blue as reported by the press on 26 April 2004 had been changed to a darker tone. It was unclear whether this was a change made because of the protests made against the original design or, as the Council claimed, a rectification of printing errors in the earlier news reports. Barzani also explained that the flag was a temporary design, to be used over the ensuing months until the adoption of a definitive flag.

In the face of the overwhelming public outcry, adoption of the blue crescent flag was abandoned entirely.&#x27;

===2008 flag proposal===

Despite the compromise in 2004, opposition to the flag persisted from Kurdish groups. In January 2008, a new design was proposed, removing the three green stars, instead placing a green eight pointed star around a yellow circle in the middle of the &quot;takbīr&quot;, which is written in the Kufic script and prized as a Mesopotamian Arabic style, having originated in Iraq.&#x27;

===2008 flag contest===

In July 2008, the Iraqi parliament launched a contest to design a new Iraqi flag. The contest ran until September 2008, with 50 designs submitted. Six designs were chosen and sent to the parliament which was to choose a new flag before the end of 2008.

Another proposed design was also similar to the 2004–2008 flag, but the script was changed to yellow to represent the Kurdish people in northern Iraq. The meaning of the three stars would be changed to symbolize peace, tolerance and justice.

<text>21 (twenty-one) is the natural number following 20 and preceding 22.

The current century is the 21st century AD, under the Gregorian calendar.

== Mathematics ==
Twenty-one is the fifth distinct semiprime, and the second of the form formula_1 where formula_2 is a higher prime. It is a repdigit in quaternary (1114).

=== Properties ===

As a biprime with proper divisors 1, 3 and 7, twenty-one has a prime aliquot sum of 11 within an aliquot sequence containing only one composite number (21, 11, 1, 0). 21 is the first member of the second cluster of consecutive discrete semiprimes (21, 22), where the next such cluster is (33, 34, 35). There are 21 prime numbers with 2 digits. There are a total of 21 prime numbers between 100 and 200.

21 is the first Blum integer, since it is a semiprime with both its prime factors being Gaussian primes.

While 21 is the sixth triangular number, it is also the sum of the divisors of the first five positive integers:

formula_3

21 is also the first non-trivial octagonal number. It is the fifth Motzkin number, and the seventeenth Padovan number (preceded by the terms 9, 12, and 16, where it is the sum of the first two of these). 
In decimal, the number of two-digit prime numbers is twenty-one (a base in which 21 is the fourteenth Harshad number). It is the smallest non-trivial example in base ten of a Fibonacci number (where 21 is the 8th member, as the sum of the preceding terms in the sequence 8 and 13) whose digits (2, 1) are Fibonacci numbers and whose digit sum is also a Fibonacci number (3). It is also the largest positive integer formula_4 in decimal such that for any positive integers formula_5 where formula_6, at least one of formula_7 and formula_8 is a terminating decimal; see proof below:
For any formula_9 coprime to formula_4 and formula_11, the condition above holds when one of formula_9 and formula_11 only has factors formula_14 and formula_15 (for a representation in base ten).

Let formula_16 denote the quantity of the numbers smaller than formula_4 that only have factor formula_14 and formula_15 and that are coprime to formula_4, we instantly have formula_21.

We can easily see that for sufficiently large formula_4, formula_23 

However, formula_24 where formula_25 as formula_4 approaches infinity; thus formula_21 fails to hold for sufficiently large formula_4.

In fact, for every formula_29, we have
:formula_30 and
:formula_31
So formula_21 fails to hold when formula_33 (actually, when formula_34).

Just check a few numbers to see that the complete sequence of numbers having this property is formula_35

21 is the smallest natural number that is not close to a power of two formula_36, where the range of nearness is formula_37 

==== Squaring the square ====

Twenty-one is the smallest number of differently sized squares needed to square the square. 

The lengths of sides of these squares are formula_38 which generate a sum of 427 when excluding a square of side length formula_39; this sum represents the largest square-free integer over a quadratic field of class number two, where 163 is the largest such (Heegner) number of class one. 427 number is also the first number to hold a sum-of-divisors in equivalence with the third perfect number and thirty-first triangular number (496), where it is also the fiftieth number to return formula_40 in the Mertens function.

=== Quadratic matrices in Z ===

While the twenty-first prime number 73 is the largest member of Bhargava&#x27;s definite quadratic 17–integer matrix formula_41 representative of all &quot;prime&quot; numbers, 
formula_42

the twenty-first composite number 33 is the largest member of a like definite quadratic 7–integer matrix
formula_43

representative of all &quot;odd&quot; numbers.

== Age 21 ==
*In thirteen countries, 21 is the age of majority. See also: Coming of age. 
*In eight countries, 21 is the minimum age to purchase tobacco products.
*In seventeen countries, 21 is the drinking age. 
*In nine countries, it is the voting age.
*In the United States:
**21 is the minimum age at which a person may gamble or enter casinos in most states (since alcohol is usually provided).
**21 is the minimum age to purchase a handgun or handgun ammunition under federal law.
**In some states, 21 is the minimum age to accompany a learner driver, provided that the person supervising the learner has held a full driver license for a specified amount of time. See also: List of minimum driving ages.

== In sports ==
* In NASCAR, 21 has been used by Wood Brothers Racing and Ford for decades. The team has won 99 NASCAR Cup Series races, a majority with 21, and 5 Daytona 500s.

== In other fields ==

21 is:
*The number of firings in a 21-gun salute honoring royalty or leaders of countries.
* In Israel, the number is associated with the profile 21 (the military profile designation granting an exemption from the military service).
* The number of shillings in a guinea.

<doc id="209251" wikidata="Q6483611" url="?curid=209251" title="Lancelot Dent">
<text>Lancelot Dent was a 19th-century British merchant resident for a period in Canton, China who dealt primarily in opium.

He was christened on August 4, 1799, in Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland, England, son of William and Jane (Wilkinson) Dent.

Lancelot took over as senior partner of trading house Dent &amp; Co. headquartered in Canton, when his brother Thomas departed the company in 1831. He had a powerful hold over some agency houses buying opium from the Calcutta auction, including Carr, Tagore and Company, managed by Bengali merchant Dwarkanath Tagore.

Together with Thomas, Lancelot commissioned construction of Flass House, now a grade two listed building in the Palladian style, on land inherited from their sister in England&#x27;s northern Lake District. The property would remain in the Dent family until 1972, when it was sold to banker, historian and writer Frank Welsh.

Lancelot and John Dent were consuls of Italy in Hong Kong.

Lancelot had a son, John Dent Fish born 1828 in Macau, with Mary Colledge, the sister of Thomas Richardson Colledge. She later married Captain John Fish and her son adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname, but Lancelot was listed as the father in documents.

Dent died in London on 28 November 1853 aged 54 and buried at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church Crosby Ravensworth Cumbria

<doc id="209255" wikidata="Q209498" url="?curid=209255" title="Two-tone (music genre)">
<text>Two-tone, or 2 tone, also known as ska-rock and ska revival, is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s that fused traditional Jamaican ska, rocksteady, and reggae music with elements of punk rock and new wave music. Its name derives from 2 Tone Records, a record label founded in 1979 by Jerry Dammers of the Specials, and references a desire to transcend and defuse racial tensions in Thatcher-era Britain: many two-tone groups, such as the Specials, the Selecter and the Beat, featured a mix of black, white, and multiracial people.

Originating in Coventry in the West Midlands of England in the late 1970s, it was part of the second wave of ska music. It followed on from the first ska music that developed in Jamaica in the 1950s and 1960s, infused with punk and new wave textures.

Although two-tone&#x27;s mainstream commercial appeal was largely limited to the UK, it influenced the ska punk movement that developed in the US in the late 1980s and 1990s.

==History==
The two-tone sound originated among young musicians in Coventry in the West Midlands of England, who grew up listening to 1960s Jamaican music. They combined influences from ska, reggae and rocksteady with elements of punk rock and new wave. Bands considered part of the genre include the Specials, the Selecter, Madness, the Beat, Bad Manners, the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz.

The Specials&#x27; keyboard player Jerry Dammers coined the term &quot;two-tone&quot;. Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designer John &quot;Teflon&quot; Sims, developed the iconic &quot;Walt Jabsco&quot; logo (a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers) to represent the two-tone genre. The logo, based on an early album-cover photo of Peter Tosh, included an added black-and-white check pattern.

Most of the bands considered to be part of the two-tone genre were signed to 2 Tone Records (operative 1979–1985) at some point. Other record labels associated with the two-tone sound were Stiff Records and Go Feet Records. The music was especially popular among skinheads, rudies and mod revivalists.

===Museum===
On 1 October 2010, the 2-Tone Central museum, cafe and venue opened in the Coventry University Students&#x27; Union building, and by August 2011 it had moved to the 2-Tone Village in Stoke, Coventry. It includes exhibition space and the Coventry Music Wall of Fame.

<text>William Strang (13 February 1859 – 12 April 1921) was a Scottish painter and printmaker, notable for illustrating the works of Bunyan, Coleridge and Kipling.

==Early life==
Strang was born at Dumbarton, the son of Peter Strang, a builder, and was educated at the Dumbarton Academy. For fifteen months after leaving school he worked in the counting-house of a firm of shipbuilders, then in 1875, when he was sixteen, went to London. There, he was a pupil of Edward Poynter for three months, before studying drawing and etching under Alphonse Legros at the Slade School of Fine Art for six years. Strang had great success as an etcher and became assistant master in the etching class. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, and his work was part of its first exhibition in 1881. Some of his early plates were published in &quot;The Portfolio&quot; and other art magazines.

==Work==
He worked in many techniques: etching, drypoint, mezzotint, sand-ground mezzotint, burin engraving, lithography and woodcut. He cut a large wood engraving of a man ploughing, later published by the Art for Schools Association. A privately produced catalogue of his engraved work contained more than three hundred items. Amongst his earlier works were &quot;Tinkers&quot;, &quot;St. Jerome&quot;, &quot;A Woman Washing Her Feet&quot;, &quot;An Old Book-stall with a Man Lighting His Pipe from a Flare&quot;, and &quot;The Head of a Peasant Woman&quot; on sand-ground mezzotint. Later plates such as &quot;Hunger&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;The Salvation Army&quot; were also important.

Some of his best etchings were done as series—one of the earliest, illustrating poet William Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of Aken Drum&quot;, is remarkable for clear, delicate workmanship in the shadow tones, showing great skill and power over his materials, and for strong drawing. Another praised series was &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, revealing austere sympathy with John Bunyan&#x27;s teaching. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot; and Strang&#x27;s own &quot;Allegory of Death&quot; and &quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Wife&quot;, have served him with suitable imaginative subjects. Some of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s stories were also illustrated by him, and his likeness of Kipling was one of his most successful portrait plates. Other etched portraits included those of Ernest Sichel and of his friend Joseph Benwell Clark, with whom Strang collaborated in illustrating Lucian&#x27;s &quot;True History&quot; (1894) &quot;Baron Munchausen&quot; (1895) and &quot;Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba&quot; (1896).

Thomas Hardy, Sir Henry Newbolt, and other distinguished men also sat for Strang. Proofs from these plates have been much valued.

Strang produced many paintings, portraits, nude figures in landscapes, and groups of peasant families, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy, The International Society, and several German exhibitions. He painted a decorative series of scenes from the story of Adam and Eve for the library of a Wolverhampton landowner named Hodson; they were exhibited at the Whitechapel exhibition in 1910. He made some drawings of the nude figure in silver point and red and black chalk.

He also painted landscapes, mostly small in size. In later years he developed a style of drawing in red and black chalk, with the whites and high lights rubbed out, on paper brushed with wash. His method gives qualities of delicate modelling and refined form and gradations akin to the drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger. He drew portraits in this manner of many members of the Order of Merit for the royal library at Windsor Castle. In 1902 Strang retired from the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, as a protest against the inclusion in its exhibitions of etched or engraved reproductions of pictures. His work was subsequently seen principally in the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, the Society of Twelve and the International Society, to which he was elected in 1905. Strang was also elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy when that degree was revived in 1906. William Strang was master of the Art Workers&#x27; Guild in 1907, where his portrait can be seen. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

==Literary works==
Strang also ventured into literature, creating &quot;Death and the Ploughman&#x27;s Wife&quot;, an illustrated ballad in 1888 (published 1894 by Lawrence and Bullen). He also wrote short stories, but these were not published.

==Recognition==
Strang was a member of the Art Workers&#x27; Guild, being elected as Master in 1907. In 1918, he became President of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers and in 1921 was elected an Engraver Member of the Royal Academy.

==Family==
In 1885, William Strang married Agnes McSymon Rogerson (d. 1933), also from Dumbarton. They had four sons and one daughter, Nancy. Their sons Ian Strang (1886–1952) and David Strang (1887–1967) were both artists. William had at least one granddaughter, Joan Strang, born of David&#x27;s short-lived marriage to the English soprano Dora Labbette.

In 1955 David Strang gave impressions of the bulk of William Strang&#x27;s etchings to the National Gallery of Scotland, many of which he had annotated for clarification of the subject matter.

<text>Alphonse Legros (; 8 May 1837 – 8 December 1911) was a French, later British, painter, etcher, sculptor, and medallist. He moved to London in 1863 and later was naturalized as British. He was important as a teacher in the British etching revival.

==Life==
Legros was born in Dijon; his father was an accountant, and came from the neighbouring village of Véronnes. While young, Legros visited the farms of his relatives, and the peasants and landscapes of that part of France are the subjects of many of his works. He was sent to the art school at Dijon with a view to qualifying for a trade, and was apprenticed to Maître Nicolardo, house decorator and painter of images. In 1851, Legros left for Paris to take another situation; but passing through Lyon he worked for six months as journeyman wall-painter under the decorator Beuchot, who was painting the chapel of Cardinal Bonald in the cathedral.

In Paris, Legros studied with Charles-Antoine Cambon, scene-painter and decorator of theatres. He also attended the drawing-school of Lecoq de Boisbaudran (the &quot;Petite école&quot;) where he found himself in sympathy with Jules Dalou and Auguste Rodin. In 1855, he attended the evening classes of the École des Beaux Arts. Legros learned the art of etching around 1857, and taught himself the making of medals.
Legros sent two portraits to the Paris Salon of 1857: one was rejected, and formed part of the exhibition of protest organized by François Bonvin in his studio; the other, which was accepted, was a profile portrait of his father. This work was presented to the museum at Tours by the artist when his friend Jean-Charles Cazin was curator. Champfleury saw the work in the Salon, and sought out the artist to enlist him in the &quot;Realists,&quot; a group round Gustave Courbet.

In 1859, Legros&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Angelus&quot; was exhibited, the first of the church interiors for which he was best known. Two years later &quot;Ex Voto&quot; (1861; Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon) was exhibited, but only obtained a mention at the Salon. He moved to England in 1863 having been encouraged by his friend, James Abbot McNeil Whistler, and in 1864 married Frances Rosetta Hodgson. At first he lived by his etching and teaching. He then became teacher of etching at the South Kensington School of Art, and in 1876 Slade Professor at University College London in succession to Edward Poynter. Legros was never a fluent English speaker. Therefore his teaching was more through demonstration than verbal instruction. His students at the Slade included Charles Holroyd, who later became Director of the National Gallery and William Stang. As gifted artists they flourished under this approach, however, not all of his pupils flourished and some found his non-verbal approach to be frustrating. Although now based in London, he continued to exhibit at the Paris Salon. He also had works included in the second Impressionist group exhibition in 1876. His work was much admired by his friend Edgar Degas and a study of hands by him was displayed between two drawings by Ingres in his bedroom. 

Whilst teaching at the Slade School Legros taught a large contingent of women, who came to be known as the Slade Girls. Through his field of sculpture he encouraged the design of medals based upon the Italian renaissance style of portrait, illustrating the character, profession or life of the individual portrayed.

The Slade Girls attracted commissions from a range of societies and organisations due to the beauty and skill of their work. Pupils of note include the Casella sisters (Ella and Nelia), Jessie Mothersole, Fedora Gleichen, Lilian Swainson (later Hamilton) and Elinor Hallé.

In his &quot;Etchings by French and English Artists&quot; (1874) Philip Gilbert Hamerton included work by Legros and Léon Gaucherel.
Legros was naturalized as a British subject in 1881, and remained at University College for 17 years. He would draw or paint a torso or a head for the students in an hour or less; in the painting school he insisted on a good outline, preserved by a thin rub in of umber, and then the work was to be finished in a single painting. He considered the traditional journey to Italy an important part of artistic training, and gave part of his salary to augment the income available for a travelling studentship.

==Personal life==
At the time of his naturalization as in 1881, Legros was described as a married French artist aged 43, living at Brook Green, Hammersmith, with four of his children, Lucien Alphonse, aged 15, Marie Florence, 13, Alfred Victor, 11, and Aimee Clotilde, 3.

Legros died on 8 December 1911 in Watford.

==Works==
Later works, after Legros resigned his professorship in 1892, returned to the manner of his early days—imaginative landscapes, castles in Spain, and farms in Burgundy, etchings such the series of &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot;, and the sculptured fountains for the gardens of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey. Pictures, drawings and etchings by Legros, went to the following galleries and museums:

*&quot;Amende Honorable&quot;, &quot;Dead Christ&quot;, bronzes, medals and twenty-two drawings, in the Luxembourg, Paris
*&quot;Landscape,&quot; &quot;Study of a Head,&quot; and portraits of Browning, Burne-Jones, Cassel, Huxley and Marshall, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Kensington

<text>Jean-Charles Cazin (25 May 1840 – 17 March 1901) was a French landscapist, museum curator and ceramicist.

==Biography==
The son of a well-known doctor, FJ Cazin (1788–1864), he was born at Samer, Pas-de-Calais. After studying in France, he went to England, where he was strongly influenced by the pre-Raphaelite movement. His chief earlier pictures have a religious interest, shown in such examples as &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot; (1877), or &quot;Hagar and Ishmael&quot; (1880, Luxembourg); and afterwards his combination of luminous landscape with figure-subjects (&quot;Souvenir de fête&quot;, 1881; &quot;Journée faite&quot;, 1888) gave him a wide repute, and made him the leader of a new school of idealistic subject-painting in France.

In 1890, Theodore Child discussed a few of his paintings (including a series of five paintings depicting the story of Judith and Holofernes) in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He painted a scene from &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Ulysses after the Shipwreck&quot;.

He was made an officer of the Legion of Honour in 1889. His charming and poetical treatment of landscape, and especially seascape, is the feature in his tonalism painting which in later years has given them an increasing value among connoisseurs. 

His wife, Marie Cazin (1844–1924), who was his pupil and exhibited her first picture at the Salon in 1876, the same year in which Cazin himself made his debut there, was also a well-known artist and sculptor.

In 1885–86 he posed for the figure of Eustache de Saint-Pierre in the bronze group &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot; by his friend, Auguste Rodin.

<text>Sloanbaatar is a mammal genus that lived in Mongolia during the Upper Cretaceous. It lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. This animal was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and the family Sloanbaataridae.

The genus &quot;Sloanbaatar&quot; was named by Kielan-Jaworowska, Z. in 1970. The name means &quot;Sloan&#x27;s hero&quot;, in honour of paleontologist R.E. Sloan.

Fossil remains of the only known species, &quot;Sloanbaatar mirabillis&quot;, have been found in the Coniacian - Santonian (Upper Cretaceous)-age strata of the Djadokhta Formation in Mongolia.

<text>Pieter Zeeman (, ; ; 25 May 1865 – 9 October 1943) was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Hendrik Lorentz for his discovery of the Zeeman effect.

==Childhood and youth==
Pieter Zeeman was born in Zonnemaire, a small town on the island of Schouwen-Duiveland, the Netherlands, the son of Rev Catharinus Forandinus Zeeman, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Willemina Worst.

Pieter became interested in physics at an early age. In 1883, the aurora borealis happened to be visible in the Netherlands. Zeeman, then a student at the high school in Zierikzee, made a drawing and description of the phenomenon and submitted it to Nature, where it was published. The editor praised &quot;the careful observations of Professor Zeeman from his observatory in Zonnemaire&quot;.

After finishing high school in 1883, Zeeman went to Delft for supplementary education in classical languages, then a requirement for admission to University. He stayed at the home of Dr J.W. Lely, co-principal of the gymnasium and brother of Cornelis Lely, who was responsible for the concept and realization of the Zuiderzee Works. While in Delft, he first met Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was to become his thesis adviser.

==Education and early career==

After Zeeman passed the qualification exams in 1885, he studied physics at the University of Leiden under Kamerlingh Onnes and Hendrik Lorentz. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz&#x27;s assistant. This allowed him to participate in a research programme on the Kerr effect. In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the Kerr effect, the reflection of polarized light on a magnetized surface. After obtaining his doctorate he went for half a year to Friedrich Kohlrausch&#x27;s institute in Strasbourg. In 1895, after returning from Strasbourg, Zeeman became Privatdozent in mathematics and physics in Leiden. The same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873–1962); they had three daughters and one son.

In 1896, shortly before moving from Leiden to Amsterdam, he measured the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field, a discovery now known as the Zeeman effect, for which he won the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics. This research involved an investigation of the effect of magnetic fields on a light source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components in the presence of a magnetic field. Lorentz first heard about Zeeman&#x27;s observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz&#x27;s theory of electromagnetic radiation.

The importance of Zeeman&#x27;s discovery soon became apparent. It confirmed Lorentz&#x27;s prediction about the polarization of light emitted in the presence of a magnetic field. Thanks to Zeeman&#x27;s work it became clear that the oscillating particles that according to Lorentz were the source of light emission were negatively charged, and were a thousandfold lighter than the hydrogen atom. This conclusion was reached well before J. J. Thomson&#x27;s discovery of the electron. The Zeeman effect thus became an important tool for elucidating the structure of the atom.

==Professor in Amsterdam==
Shortly after his discovery, Zeeman was offered a position as lecturer in Amsterdam, where he started to work in the autumn of 1896. In 1900, this was followed by his promotion to professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam. In 1902, together with his former mentor Lorentz, he received the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of the Zeeman effect. Five years later, in 1908, he succeeded Van der Waals as full professor and Director of the Physics Institute in Amsterdam.

In 1918 he published &quot;Some experiments on gravitation: The ratio of mass to weight for crystals and radioactive substances&quot; in the &quot;Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen,&quot; experimentally confirming the equivalence principle with regard to gravitational and inertial mass.

A new laboratory built in Amsterdam in 1923 was renamed the Zeeman Laboratory in 1940. This new facility allowed Zeeman to pursue a refined investigation of the Zeeman effect. For the remainder of his career he remained interested in research in magneto-optic effects. He also investigated the propagation of light in moving media. This subject became the focus of a renewed interest because of special relativity, and enjoyed a keen interest from Lorentz and Albert Einstein. Later in his career he became interested in mass spectrometry.

==Later years==
In 1898 Zeeman was elected to membership of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, and he served as its secretary from 1912 to 1920. He won the Henry Draper Medal in 1921, and several other awards and Honorary degrees. Zeeman was elected a Foreign member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He retired as a professor in 1935.

Zeeman died on 9 October 1943 in Amsterdam, and was buried in Haarlem.

==Awards and honors==
Zeeman received the following awards for his contributions.
* Nobel Prize for Physics (1902)
* Matteucci Medal (1912)
* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921
* Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences (1921)
* Rumford Medal (1922)
* Franklin Medal (1925)

The crater Zeeman on the Moon is named in his honour.

<doc id="209274" wikidata="Q34618" url="?curid=209274" title="Gustave Courbet">
<text>Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet ( ; ; ; 10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work.

Courbet&#x27;s paintings of the late 1840s and early 1850s brought him his first recognition. They challenged convention by depicting unidealized peasants and workers, often on a grand scale traditionally reserved for paintings of religious or historical subjects. Courbet&#x27;s subsequent paintings were mostly of a less overtly political character: landscapes, seascapes, hunting scenes, nudes, and still lifes. Courbet was imprisoned for six months in 1871 for his involvement with the Paris Commune and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1873 until his death four years later.

== Biography ==
Gustave Courbet was born in 1819 to Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans (department of Doubs). Anti-monarchical feelings prevailed in the household. (His maternal grandfather fought in the French Revolution.) Courbet&#x27;s sisters, Zoé, Zélie, and Juliette were his first models for drawing and painting. After moving to Paris he often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish, and find inspiration.

Courbet went to Paris in 1839 and worked at the studio of Steuben and Hesse. An independent spirit, he soon left, preferring to develop his own style by studying the paintings of Spanish, Flemish and French masters in the Louvre, and painting copies of their work.

Courbet&#x27;s first works were an &quot;Odalisque&quot; inspired by the writing of Victor Hugo and a &quot;Lélia&quot; illustrating George Sand, but he soon abandoned literary influences, choosing instead to base his paintings on observed reality. Among his paintings of the early 1840s are several self-portraits, Romantic in conception, in which the artist portrayed himself in various roles. These include &quot;Self-Portrait with Black Dog&quot; (, accepted for exhibition at the 1844 Paris Salon), the theatrical &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; which is also known as &quot;Desperate Man&quot; (), &quot;Lovers in the Countryside&quot; (1844, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon), &quot;The Sculptor&quot; (1845), &quot;The Wounded Man&quot; (1844–54, Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris), &quot;The Cellist, Self-Portrait&quot; (1847, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, shown at the 1848 Salon), and &quot;Man with a Pipe&quot; (1848–49, Musée Fabre, Montpellier).

Trips to the Netherlands and Belgium in 1846–47 strengthened Courbet&#x27;s belief that painters should portray the life around them, as Rembrandt, Hals and other Dutch masters had. By 1848, he had gained supporters among the younger critics, the Neo-romantics and Realists, notably Champfleury.

Courbet achieved his first Salon success in 1849 with his painting &quot;After Dinner at Ornans&quot;. The work, reminiscent of Chardin and Le Nain, earned Courbet a gold medal and was purchased by the state. The gold medal meant that his works would no longer require jury approval for exhibition at the Salon—an exemption Courbet enjoyed until 1857 (when the rule changed).

In 1849–50, Courbet painted &quot;The Stone Breakers&quot; (destroyed in the Allied Bombing of Dresden in 1945), which Proudhon admired as an icon of peasant life; it has been called &quot;the first of his great works&quot;. The painting was inspired by a scene Courbet witnessed on the roadside. He later explained to Champfleury and the writer Francis Wey: &quot;It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning.&quot;

== Realism ==

Courbet&#x27;s work belonged neither to the predominant Romantic nor Neoclassical schools. History painting, which the Paris Salon esteemed as a painter&#x27;s highest calling, did not interest him, for he believed that &quot;the artists of one century [are] basically incapable of reproducing the aspect of a past or future century ...&quot; Instead, he maintained that the only possible source for living art is the artist&#x27;s own experience. He and Jean-François Millet would find inspiration painting the life of peasants and workers.

Courbet painted figurative compositions, landscapes, seascapes, and still lifes. He courted controversy by addressing social issues in his work, and by painting subjects that were considered vulgar, such as the rural bourgeoisie, peasants, and working conditions of the poor. His work, along with that of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as &quot;Realism&quot;. For Courbet realism dealt not with the perfection of line and form, but entailed spontaneous and rough handling of paint, suggesting direct observation by the artist while portraying the irregularities in nature. He depicted the harshness of life, and in doing so challenged contemporary academic ideas of art. One of the distinctive features of Courbet&#x27;s Realism was his lifelong attachment to his native province, the Franche-Comté, and of his birthplace, Ornans.

===&quot;The Stone Breakers&quot;===

Considered to be the first of Courbet&#x27;s great works, &quot;The Stone Breakers&quot; of 1849 is an example of social realism that caused a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1850. The work was based on two men, one young and one old, whom Courbet discovered engaged in backbreaking labor on the side of the road when he returned to Ornans for an eight-month visit in October 1848. On his inspiration, Courbet told his friends and art critics Francis Wey and Jules Champfleury, &quot;It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting.&quot;

While other artists had depicted the plight of the rural poor, Courbet&#x27;s peasants are not idealized like those in works such as Breton&#x27;s 1854 painting, &quot;The Gleaners&quot;.

During World War II, from 13 to 15 February 1945, the Allies continuously bombed the city of Dresden, Germany. German troops hastily loaded artworks from Dresden&#x27;s galleries and museums onto trucks. &quot;The Stone Breakers&quot; was destroyed, along with 153 other paintings, when a transport vehicle moving the pictures to the Königstein Fortress, near Dresden, was bombed by Allied forces.

=== &quot;A Burial at Ornans&quot; ===

The Salon of 1850–1851 found him triumphant with &quot;The Stone Breakers&quot;, the &quot;Peasants of Flagey&quot; and &quot;A Burial at Ornans&quot;. The &quot;Burial&quot;, one of Courbet&#x27;s most important works, records the funeral of his grand uncle which he attended in September 1848. People who attended the funeral were the models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives, but in &quot;Burial&quot; Courbet said he &quot;painted the very people who had been present at the interment, all the townspeople&quot;. The result is a realistic presentation of them and life in Ornans.

The vast painting, measuring , drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public, in part because it upset convention by depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which would previously have been reserved for a religious or royal subject.

According to art historian Sarah Faunce, &quot;In Paris, the &quot;Burial&quot; was judged as a work that had thrust itself into the grand tradition of history painting, like an upstart in dirty boots crashing a genteel party, and in terms of that tradition it was, of course, found wanting.&quot; The painting lacks the sentimental rhetoric that was expected in a genre work: Courbet&#x27;s mourners make no theatrical gestures of grief, and their faces seemed more caricatured than ennobled. The critics accused Courbet of a deliberate pursuit of ugliness.

Eventually, the public grew more interested in the new Realist approach, and the lavish, decadent fantasy of Romanticism lost popularity. Courbet well understood the importance of the painting, and said of it, &quot;&quot;Burial at Ornans&quot; was in reality the burial of romanticism.&quot;
Courbet became a celebrity and was spoken of as a genius, a &quot;terrible socialist&quot; and a &quot;savage&quot;. He actively encouraged the public&#x27;s perception of him as an unschooled peasant, while his ambition, his bold pronouncements to journalists, and his insistence on depicting his own life in his art gave him a reputation for unbridled vanity.

Courbet associated his ideas of realism in art with political anarchism, and, having gained an audience, he promoted political ideas by writing politically motivated essays and dissertations. His familiar visage was the object of frequent caricature in the popular French press.

In 1850, Courbet wrote to a friend:
During the 1850s, Courbet painted numerous figurative works using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as &quot;Village Damsels&quot; (1852), &quot;The Wrestlers&quot; (1853), &quot;The Bathers&quot; (1853), &quot;The Sleeping Spinner&quot; (1853), and &quot;The Wheat Sifters&quot; (1854).

=== &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot; ===
In 1855, Courbet submitted fourteen paintings for exhibition at the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;. Three were rejected for lack of space, including &quot;A Burial at Ornans&quot; and his other monumental canvas &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot;. Refusing to be denied, Courbet took matters into his own hands. He displayed forty of his paintings, including &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot;, in his gallery called &quot;The Pavilion of Realism&quot; (Pavillon du Réalisme) which was a temporary structure that he erected next door to the official Salon-like &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;.

The work is an allegory of Courbet&#x27;s life as a painter, seen as a heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left. Friends on the right include the art critics Champfleury, and Charles Baudelaire, and art collector Alfred Bruyas. On the left are figures (priest, prostitute, grave digger, merchant, and others) who represent what Courbet described in a letter to Champfleury as &quot;the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.&quot;

In the foreground of the left-hand side is a man with dogs, who was not mentioned in Courbet&#x27;s letter to Champfleury. X-rays show he was painted later, but his role in the painting is important: he is an allegory of the then-current French Emperor, Napoleon III, identified by his famous hunting dogs and iconic twirled mustache. By placing him on the left, Courbet publicly shows his disdain for the emperor and depicts him as a criminal, suggesting that his &quot;ownership&quot; of France is an illegal one.

Although artists like Eugène Delacroix were ardent champions of his effort, the public went to the show mostly out of curiosity and to deride him. Attendance and sales were disappointing, but Courbet&#x27;s status as a hero to the French avant-garde became assured. He was admired by the American James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and he became an inspiration to the younger generation of French artists including Édouard Manet and the Impressionist painters. &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot; was recognized as a masterpiece by Delacroix, Baudelaire, and Champfleury, if not by the public.

=== Seascapes ===

While Courbet&#x27;s seascapes, painted during his many visits to the northern coast of France in the late 1860s, were decidedly less controversial than his salon submissions, they furthered his contributions (willing or otherwise) to realism with their emphasis on both the beauty and danger of the natural world. There is a distinct range in the tones of this period with &quot;The Calm Sea&quot; (1869) depicting the serenity of the receded tide, and &quot;The Sailboat&quot; (c. 1869) showing a sailboat wrestling with violent tides.

=== Realist manifesto ===
Courbet wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of this independent, personal exhibition, echoing the tone of the period&#x27;s political manifestos. In it, he asserts his goal as an artist is &quot;to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my epoch according to my own estimation.&quot;

== Notoriety ==
In the Salon of 1857, Courbet showed six paintings. These included &quot;Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine (Summer)&quot;, depicting two prostitutes under a tree, as well as the first of many hunting scenes Courbet was to paint during the remainder of his life: &quot;Hind at Bay in the Snow&quot; and &quot;The Quarry&quot;.

&quot;Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine&quot;, painted in 1856, provoked a scandal. Art critics accustomed to conventional, &quot;timeless&quot; nude women in landscapes were shocked by Courbet&#x27;s depiction of modern women casually displaying their undergarments.

By exhibiting sensational works alongside hunting scenes, of the sort that had brought popular success to the English painter Edwin Landseer, Courbet guaranteed himself &quot;both notoriety and sales&quot;. 

During the 1860s, Courbet painted a series of increasingly erotic works such as &quot;Femme nue couchée&quot;, culminating in &quot;The Origin of the World (L&#x27;Origine du monde)&quot; (1866), which depicts female genitalia and was not publicly exhibited until 1988, and &quot;Sleep&quot; (1866), featuring two women in bed. The latter painting became the subject of a police report when it was exhibited by a picture dealer in 1872.

Until about 1861, Napoléon&#x27;s regime had exhibited authoritarian characteristics, using press censorship to prevent the spread of opposition, manipulating elections, and depriving Parliament of the right to free debate or any real power. In the 1860s, however, Napoléon III made more concessions to placate his liberal opponents. This change began by allowing free debates in Parliament and public reports of parliamentary debates. Press censorship, too, was relaxed and culminated in the appointment of the Liberal Émile Ollivier, previously a leader of the opposition to Napoléon&#x27;s regime, as the &quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister in 1870. As a sign of appeasement to the Liberals who admired Courbet, Napoleon III nominated him to the Legion of Honour in 1870. His refusal of the cross of the Legion of Honour angered those in power but made him immensely popular with those who opposed the prevailing regime.
== Courbet and the Paris Commune ==
On 4 September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Courbet made a proposal that later came back to haunt him. He wrote a letter to the Government of National Defense, proposing that the column in the Place Vendôme, erected by Napoleon I to honour the victories of the French Army, be taken down. He wrote:

 Courbet proposed that the Column be moved to a more appropriate place, such as the Hotel des Invalides, a military hospital. He also wrote an open letter addressed to the German Army and to German artists, proposing that German and French cannons should be melted down and crowned with a liberty cap, and made into a new monument on Place Vendôme, dedicated to the federation of the German and French people. The Government of National Defense did nothing about his suggestion to tear down the column, but it was not forgotten.

On 18 March, in the aftermath of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, a revolutionary government called the Paris Commune briefly took power in the city. Courbet played an active part and organized a Federation of Artists, which held its first meeting on 5 April in the Grand Amphitheater of the School of Medicine. Some three hundred to four hundred painters, sculptors, architects, and decorators attended. There were some famous names on the list of members, including André Gill, Honoré Daumier, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Eugène Pottier, Jules Dalou, and Édouard Manet. Manet was not in Paris during the Commune and did not attend, and Corot, who was seventy-five years old, stayed in a country house and his studio during the Commune, not taking part in the political events.

Courbet chaired the meeting and proposed that the Louvre and the Musée du Luxembourg, the two major art museums of Paris, closed during the uprising, be reopened as soon as possible and that the traditional annual exhibit called the Salon be held as in years past, but with radical differences. He proposed that the Salon should be free of any government interference or rewards to preferred artists; no medals or government commissions would be given. Furthermore, he called for the abolition of the most famous state institutions of French art; the École des Beaux-Arts, the French Academy in Rome, the French School at Athens, and the Fine Arts section of the Institute of France.

On 12 April, the Executive Committee of the Commune gave Courbet, though he was not yet officially a member of the Commune, the assignment of opening the museums and organizing the Salon. They issued the following decree at the same meeting: &quot;The Column of the Place Vendôme will be demolished.&quot; On 16 April, special elections were held to replace more moderate members of the Commune who had resigned their seats, and Courbet was elected as a delegate for the 6th arrondissement of Paris. He was given the title of Delegate of Fine Arts, and on 21 April he was also made a member of the Commission on Education. At the meeting of the Commission on 27 April, the minutes reported that Courbet requested the demolition of the Vendôme column be carried out and that the column would be replaced by an allegorical figure representing the taking of power of the Commune on 18 March.

Nonetheless, Courbet was a dissident by nature, and he was soon in opposition with the majority of the Commune members on some of its measures. He was one of a minority of Commune Members who opposed the creation of a Committee on Public Safety, modeled on the committee of the same name which carried out the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution.

Courbet opposed the Commune on another more serious matter: the arrest of his friend Gustave Chaudey, a prominent socialist, magistrate, and journalist, whose portrait Courbet had painted. The popular Commune newspaper, &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;, accused Chaudey, when he was briefly deputy mayor of the 9th arrondissement before the Commune was formed, of ordering soldiers to fire on a crowd that had surrounded the Hôtel de Ville. Courbet&#x27;s opposition was of no use; on 23 May 1871, in the final days of the Commune, Chaudey was shot by a Commune firing squad. According to some sources Courbet resigned from the Commune in protest.

On 13 May, on the proposal of Courbet, the Paris house of Adolphe Thiers, the chief executive of the French government, was demolished, and his art collection confiscated. Courbet proposed that the confiscated art be given to the Louvre and other museums, but the director of the Louvre refused to accept it. On 16 May, just nine days before the fall of the Commune, in a large ceremony with military bands and photographers, the Vendôme column was pulled down and broke into pieces. Some witnesses said Courbet was there, others denied it. The following day, the Federation of Artists debated dismissing directors of the Louvre and of the Luxembourg museums, suspected by some in the Commune of having secret contacts with the French government, and appointed new heads of the museums.

According to one legend, Courbet defended the Louvre and other museums against &quot;looting mobs&quot;, but there are no records of any such attacks on the museums. The only real threat to the Louvre came during &quot;Bloody Week&quot;, 21–28 May 1871, when a unit of Communards, led by a Commune general, Jules Bergeret, set fire to the Tuileries Palace, next to the Louvre. The fire spread to the library of the Louvre, which was destroyed, but the efforts of museum curators and firemen saved the art gallery.

After the final suppression of the Commune by the French army on 28 May, Courbet went into hiding in the apartments of different friends. He was arrested on 7 June. At his trial before a military tribunal on 14 August, Courbet argued that he had only joined the Commune to pacify it and that he had wanted to move the Vendôme Column, not destroy it. He said he had only belonged to the Commune for a short period, and rarely attended its meetings. He was convicted, but given a lighter sentence than other Commune leaders: six months in prison and a fine of five hundred francs. Serving part of his sentence in the Sainte-Pélagie Prison in Paris, he was allowed an easel and paints, but he could not have models pose for him. He did a famous series of still-life paintings of flowers and fruit during his confinement.

== Exile and death ==

Courbet completed his prison sentence on 2 March 1872, but his problems caused by the destruction of the Vendôme Column were still not over. In 1873, the newly elected president of the Republic, Patrice de MacMahon, announced plans to rebuild the column, with the cost to be paid by Courbet. Unable to pay, Courbet went into a self-imposed exile in Switzerland to avoid bankruptcy. In the following years, he participated in Swiss regional and national exhibitions. Surveilled by the Swiss intelligence service, he enjoyed in the small Swiss art world the reputation as head of the &quot;realist school&quot; and inspired younger artists such as Auguste Baud-Bovy and Ferdinand Hodler.

Important works from this period include several paintings of trout, &quot;hooked and bleeding from the gills&quot;, that have been interpreted as allegorical self-portraits of the exiled artist. In his final years, Courbet painted landscapes, including several scenes of water mysteriously emerging from the depths of the earth in the Jura Mountains of the France–Switzerland border. Courbet also worked on sculpture during his exile. Previously, in the early 1860s, he had produced a few sculptures, one of which – the &quot;Fisherman of Chavots&quot; (1862) – he donated to Ornans for a public fountain, but it was removed after Courbet&#x27;s arrest.

In May 1877, the state set the final cost of reconstructing the Vendôme Column at 323,000 francs for Courbet to repay in annual installments of 10,000 francs for the next 33 years. On 31 December 1877, a day before the first installment was due, Courbet died, aged 58, in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, of a liver disease aggravated by heavy drinking.

== Legacy ==
Courbet was admired by many younger artists. Claude Monet included a portrait of Courbet in his own version of &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; from 1865–1866 (Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris). Courbet&#x27;s particular kind of realism influenced many artists to follow, notably among them the German painters of the Leibl circle, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Cézanne. Courbet&#x27;s influence can also be seen in the work of Edward Hopper, whose &quot;Bridge in Paris&quot; (1906) and &quot;Approaching a City&quot; (1946) have been described as Freudian echoes of Courbet&#x27;s &quot;The Source of the Loue&quot; and &quot;The Origin of the World&quot;. His pupils included Henri Fantin-Latour, Hector Hanoteau and Olaf Isaachsen.

Courbet once wrote this in a letter:

=== Courbet and Cubism ===
Two 19th-century artists prepared the way for the emergence of Cubism in the 20th century: Courbet and Cézanne. Cézanne&#x27;s contributions are well-known. Courbet&#x27;s importance was announced by Guillaume Apollinaire, poet-spokesperson for the Cubists. Writing in &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques&quot; (1913) he declared, &quot;Courbet is the father of the new painters.&quot; Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes often portrayed Courbet as the father of all modern art.

Both artists sought to transcend the conventional methods of rendering nature; Cézanne through a dialectical method revealing the process of seeing, Courbet by his materialism. The Cubists would combine these two approaches in developing a revolution in art.

On a formal level, Courbet wished to convey the physical characteristics of what he was painting: its density, weight, and texture. Art critic John Berger said: &quot;No painter before Courbet was ever able to emphasize so uncompromisingly the density and weight of what he was painting.&quot; This emphasis on material reality endowed his subjects with dignity. Berger observed that the Cubist painters &quot;were at great pains to establish the physical presence of what they were representing. And in this, they are the heirs of Courbet.&quot;
== Nazi-looted art ==
During the Third Reich (1933–1945) Jewish art collectors throughout Europe had their property seized as part of the Holocaust. Many artworks created by Courbet were looted by Nazis and their agents during this period and have only recently been reclaimed by the families of the previous owners.

Courbet&#x27;s &quot;La Falaise d&#x27;Etretat&quot; was owned by the Jewish collector Marc Wolfson and his wife Erna, who both were murdered in Auschwitz. After disappearing during the Nazi occupation of France, it reappeared years later at the musée d&#x27;Orsay.

The great Hungarian Jewish collector Baron Mor Lipot Herzog owned several Courbet artworks, including &quot;Le Chateau de Blonay (Neige)&quot; (, &quot;The Chateau of Blonay (Snow)&quot;, now at the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts), and Courbet&#x27;s most infamous work — (&quot;The Origin of the World&quot;). His was looted by Nazis and many are still missing.

Gustav Courbet&#x27;s paintings &quot;Village Girl With Goat&quot;, &quot;The Father&quot;, and &quot;Landscape With Rocks&quot; were discovered in the Gurlitt Trove of art stashed in Munich. It is not known to whom they belonged.

Josephine Weinmann and her family, who were German Jews, had owned &quot;Le Grand Pont&quot; before they were forced to flee. The Nazi militant Herbert Schaefer acquired it and loaned it to the Yale University Art Gallery, against whom the Weinmanns filed a claim.

The French &quot;Database of Art Objects at the Jeu de Paume (Cultural Plunder by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg)&quot; has 41 entries for Courbet.

In March 2023, a museum at the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom, returned a painting &quot;La Ronde Enfantine&quot; by Gustave Courbet, which was stolen in 1941 by the Nazis in Paris. The canvas belonged to a Jewish member of the Resistance. The Spoliation Advisory Panel, a body created in 2000 by the British government, concluded on 28 March &quot;that the painting was stolen by the Nazi occupation forces because Robert Bing was Jewish&quot;.

<text>James Weldon Johnson (June 17, 1871June 26, 1938) was an American writer and civil rights activist. He was married to civil rights activist Grace Nail Johnson. Johnson was a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where he started working in 1917. In 1920, he was chosen as executive secretary of the organization, effectively the operating officer. He served in that position from 1920 to 1930. Johnson established his reputation as a writer, and was known during the Harlem Renaissance for his poems, novel and anthologies collecting both poems and spirituals of Black culture. He wrote the lyrics for &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;, which later became known as the Black National Anthem, the music being written by his younger brother, composer J. Rosamond Johnson.

Johnson was appointed under President Theodore Roosevelt as U.S. consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua for most of the period from 1906 to 1913. In 1934, he was the first African American professor to be hired at New York University. Later in life, he was a professor of creative literature and writing at Fisk University, a historically Black university. In recognition of his scholarship and impact, New York University established the James Weldon Johnson Professorship in 2020.

==Life==
Johnson was born in 1871 in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of James Johnson, a biracial headwaiter and Helen Louise Dillet, a native of Nassau in the Bahamas. His maternal great-grandmother, Hester Argo, had escaped from Saint-Domingue (today Haiti) during the revolutionary upheaval in 1802, along with her three young children, including James&#x27; grandfather Stephen Dillet (1797–1880). Although originally headed to Cuba, their boat was intercepted by privateers and they were taken to Nassau, where they permanently settled. In 1833, Stephen Dillet became the first man of color to win election to the Bahamian legislature.

James&#x27; brother John Rosamond Johnson became a composer. The boys were first educated by their mother, a musician and public-school teacher, before attending Edwin Stanton School. After James earned his Bachelor&#x27;s degree, he also completed some graduate coursework.

The achievement of his father, a preacher and the headwaiter at the St. James Hotel, a luxury establishment built when Jacksonville was one of Florida&#x27;s first winter resort destinations, inspired young James to pursue a professional career. Molded by the classical education for which Atlanta University was known, Johnson regarded his academic training as a trust. He knew he was expected to devote himself to helping Black people advance. Johnson was a prominent member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

Johnson and his brother Rosamond moved to New York City as young men, joining the Great Migration out of the South in the first half of the 20th century. They collaborated on songwriting and achieved some success on Broadway in the early 1900s. Over the next 40 years, Johnson served in several public capacities, working in education, the diplomatic corps, and civil rights activism. In 1904, he participated in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s successful presidential campaign. After becoming president, Roosevelt appointed Johnson as United States consul at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, where he served from 1906 to 1908, and then to Nicaragua, where he served from 1909 to 1913.

In 1910, Johnson married Grace Nail, whom he had met in New York City several years earlier while he was working as a songwriter. A cultured, well-educated New Yorker, Grace Nail Johnson later collaborated with her husband on a screenwriting project. After their return to New York from Nicaragua, Johnson became increasingly involved in the Harlem Renaissance, a great flourishing of art and writing. He wrote his own poetry and supported work by others, also compiling and publishing anthologies of spirituals and poetry. Owing to his influence and his innovative poetry, Johnson became a leading voice in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.

==Civil rights activism==
Johnson became involved in civil rights activism, especially the campaign to pass the federal Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, as Southern states did not prosecute perpetrators. He was a speaker at the 1919 National Conference on Lynching. Starting as a field secretary for the NAACP in 1917, Johnson rose to become one of the most successful officials in the organization. He traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, for example, to investigate a brutal lynching that was witnessed by thousands. His report on the carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the burning-to-death of Ell Persons was published nationally as a supplement to the July 1917 issue of the NAACP&#x27;s &quot;Crisis&quot; magazine, and during his visit there he chartered the Memphis chapter of the NAACP. His 1920 report about &quot;the economic corruption, forced labor, press censorship, racial segregation and wanton violence introduced to Haiti by the U.S. occupation encouraged numerous African Americans to flood the State Department and the offices of Republican Party officials with letters&quot; calling for an end to the abuses and to remove troops. The United States finally ended its occupation of Haiti in 1934, 16 years after the threat of Germany in the area had been ended by its defeat in the First World War.

Appointed in 1920 as the first executive secretary of the NAACP, Johnson helped increase membership and extended the movement&#x27;s reach by organizing numerous new chapters in the South. During this period, the NAACP was mounting frequent legal challenges to the Southern states&#x27; disenfranchisement of African Americans, which had been established at the turn of the century by such legal devices as poll taxes, literacy tests, and white primaries.
While attending Atlanta University, Johnson became known as an influential campus speaker. In 1892, he won the Quiz Club Contest in English Composition and Oratory. He founded and edited the &quot;Daily American&quot; newspaper in 1895. At a time when Southern legislatures were passing laws and constitutions that disenfranchised blacks and Jim Crow laws to impose racial segregation, the newspaper covered both political and racial topics. It was terminated a year later due to financial difficulty. These early endeavors were the start of Johnson&#x27;s long period of activism.

In 1904 he accepted a position as the treasurer of the Colored Republican Club, started by Charles W. Anderson. A year later he was elected as president of the club. He organized political rallies. During 1914, Johnson became editor of the editorial page of &quot;The New York Age&quot;, an influential African-American weekly newspaper based in New York City. In the early 20th century, it had supported Booker T. Washington&#x27;s position for racial advancement by industrious work within the racial community, against the arguments of W. E. B. Du Bois for development of a &quot;talented tenth&quot; and political activism to challenge white supremacy. Johnson&#x27;s writing for the &quot;Age&quot; displayed the political gift that soon made him famous.

In 1916, Johnson started working as a field secretary and organizer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had been founded in 1910. In this role, he built and revived local chapters. Opposing race riots in Northern cities and the lynchings frequent in the South during and immediately after the end of World War I, Johnson engaged the NAACP in mass demonstrations. He organized a silent protest parade of more than 10,000 African Americans down New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue on July 28, 1917, to protest the still frequent lynchings of blacks in the South.

Social tensions erupted after veterans returned from the First World War, and tried to find work. In 1919, Johnson coined the term &quot;Red Summer&quot; and organized peaceful protests against the white racial violence against blacks that broke out that year in numerous industrial cities of the North and Midwest. There was fierce competition for housing and jobs.

Johnson traveled to Haiti to investigate conditions on the island, which had been occupied by U.S. Marines since 1915, ostensibly because of political unrest. As a result of this trip, Johnson published a series of articles in &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1920 in which he described the American occupation as brutal. He offered suggestions for the economic and social development of Haiti. These articles were later collected and reprinted as a book under the title &quot;Self-Determining Haiti.&quot;

In 1920, Johnson was chosen as the first black executive secretary of the NAACP, effectively the operating officer position. He served in this role through 1930. He lobbied for the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill of 1921, which was passed easily by the House, but repeatedly defeated by the white Southern bloc in the Senate.

Throughout the 1920s, Johnson supported and promoted the Harlem Renaissance, trying to help young black authors to get published. Shortly before his death in 1938, Johnson supported efforts by Ignatz Waghalter, a Polish-Jewish composer who had escaped the Nazis of Germany, to establish a classical orchestra of African-American musicians.

==Education and law careers==
In the summer of 1891, following his freshman year at Atlanta University, Johnson went to a rural district in Georgia to teach the descendants of former slaves. &quot;In all of my experience there has been no period so brief that has meant so much in my education for life as the three months I spent in the backwoods of Georgia,&quot; Johnson wrote. &quot;I was thrown for the first time on my own resources and abilities.&quot; Johnson graduated from Atlanta University in 1894.

After graduation, he returned to Jacksonville, where he taught at Stanton, a school for African-American students (the public schools were segregated) that was the largest of all the schools in the city. In 1906, at the young age of 35, he was promoted to principal. In the segregated system, Johnson was paid less than half of what white colleagues earned. He improved black education by adding the ninth and tenth grades to the school, to extend the years of schooling. He later resigned from this job to pursue other goals.

While working as a teacher, Johnson also read the law to prepare for the bar. In 1897, he was the first African American admitted to the Florida Bar Exam since the Reconstruction era ended. He was also the first black in Duval County to seek admission to the state bar. In order to be accepted, Johnson had a two-hour oral examination before three attorneys and a judge. He later recalled that one of the examiners, not wanting to see a black man admitted, left the room. Johnson drew on his law background especially during his years as a civil rights activist and leading the NAACP.

In 1930, at the age of 59, Johnson returned to education after his many years leading the NAACP. He accepted the Spence Chair of Creative Literature at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The university created the position for him in recognition of his achievements as a poet, editor and critic during the Harlem Renaissance. In addition to discussing literature, he lectured on a wide range of issues related to the lives and civil rights of black Americans. He held this position until his death. In 1934, he also was appointed as the first African-American professor at New York University, where he taught several classes in literature and culture.

==Music==

As noted above, in 1901 Johnson had moved to New York City with his brother J. Rosamond Johnson to work in musical theater. They collaborated on such hits as &quot;Tell Me, Dusky Maiden&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Looking but the Owl and the Moon&quot;, and the spiritual &quot;Dem Bones&quot;, for which Johnson wrote the lyrics and his brother the music. Johnson composed a poem which was later set to music to become &quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; to honor renowned educator Booker T. Washington who was visiting Stanton School, when the poem was recited by 500 school children as a tribute to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birthday. This song became widely popular and has become known as the &quot;Negro National Anthem&quot;, a title that the NAACP adopted and promoted. The song included the following lines:

Lift ev&#x27;ry voice and sing, &#x27;Til earth and heaven ring,Ring with the harmonies of liberty;Let our rejoicing rise, high as the list&#x27;ning skies,Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.Sing a song full of faith that the dark past has taught us,Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,Let us march on &#x27;til victory is won.

&quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; had influenced other artistic works, inspiring art such as Gwendolyn Ann Magee&#x27;s quilted mosaics. &quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; contrasted with W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27;s exploration in &quot;Souls of Black Folk&quot; of the fears of post-emancipation generations of African Americans.

After some successes, the brothers worked on Broadway and collaborated with producer and director Bob Cole. Johnson also collaborated on the opera &quot;Tolosa&quot; with his brother, who wrote the music; it satirized the U.S. annexation of the Pacific islands. Thanks to his success as a Broadway songwriter, Johnson moved in the upper echelons of African-American society in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
==Diplomacy==
In 1906, Johnson was appointed by the Roosevelt Administration as consul of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. In 1909, he transferred to Corinto, Nicaragua. During his stay at Corinto, a rebellion erupted against President Adolfo Diaz. Johnson proved an effective diplomat in such times of strain.

His positions also provided time and stimulation to pursue his literary career. He wrote substantial portions of his novel, &quot;The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,&quot; and his poetry collection, &quot;Fifty Years,&quot; during this period. His poetry was published in major journals such as &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; and in &quot;The Independent.&quot;

==Literary writing==
Johnson&#x27;s first success as a writer was the poem &quot;Lift Ev&#x27;ry Voice and Sing&quot; (1899), which his brother Rosamond later set to music; the song became unofficially known as the &quot;Negro National Anthem&quot;. During his time in the diplomatic service, Johnson completed what became his best-known book, &quot;The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man&quot;, which he published anonymously in 1912. He chose anonymity to avoid any controversy that might endanger his diplomatic career. It was not until 1927 that Johnson acknowledged writing the novel, stressing that it was not a work of autobiography but mostly fictional.

In this period, he also published his first poetry collection, &quot;Fifty Years and Other Poems&quot; (1917). It showed his increasing politicization and adoption of the black vernacular influences that characterize his later work.

Johnson returned to New York, where he was involved in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. He had a broad appreciation for black artists, musicians and writers, and worked to heighten awareness in the wider society of their creativity. In 1922, he published a landmark anthology &quot;The Book of American Negro Poetry,&quot; with a &quot;Preface&quot; that celebrated the power of black expressive culture. He compiled and edited the anthology &quot;The Book of American Negro Spirituals,&quot; which was published in 1925.

He continued to publish his own poetry as well. Johnson&#x27;s collection &quot;God&#x27;s Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse&quot; (1927) is considered most important. He demonstrated that black folk life could be the material of serious poetry. He also comments on the violence of racism in poems such as &quot;Fragment&quot;, which portrays slavery as against both God&#x27;s love and God&#x27;s law.

Following the flourishing of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, Johnson reissued his anthology of poetry by black writers, &quot;The Book of American Negro Poetry,&quot; in 1931, including many new poets. This established the African-American poetic tradition for a much wider audience and also inspired younger poets.

In 1930, he published a sociological study, &quot;Black Manhattan&quot; (1930). His &quot;Negro Americans, What Now?&quot; (1934) was a book-length address advocating fuller civil rights for African Americans. By this time, tens of thousands of African Americans had left the South for Northern and Midwestern cities in the Great Migration, but the majority still lived in the South. There they were politically disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws and white supremacy. Outside the South, many faced discrimination but had more political rights and chances for education and work.

Johnson assisted playwright Annie Nathan Meyer in crafting the Broadway play &quot;Black Souls&quot; (1924) by editing the work for authenticity of language. The work is credited as &quot;one of the earliest known &#x27;lynching dramas&#x27; written by a white woman.

==Film==

At least one of Mr. Johnson&#x27;s works was credited as leading to a movie. &quot;Go Down, Death!&quot; was a Harlemwood Studios production, directed by Spencer Williams. In the film credits, it states, &quot;Alfred N. Sack Reverently Presents...&quot; (the film), with hymns playing in the background. The film opens:

: &quot;Forward: This Story of Love and Simple Faith and Triumph of Good Over Evil was inspired by the Poem &quot;GO DOWN, DEATH!&quot; from the Pen of the Celebrated Negro Author James Weldon Johnson, Now of Sainted Memory.&quot;

The film featured an all African-American cast, including Myra D. Hemings, Samuel H. James, Eddie L. Houston, Spencer Williams and Amos Droughan, among others. It also included a dancing and band sequence, depicting a fun-looking, middle-class oriented club with drinks and gambling, as its opening backdrop.

==Death==
Johnson died in 1938 while vacationing in Wiscasset, Maine, when the car his wife was driving was hit by a train. His funeral in Harlem was attended by more than 1,000 people. Johnson&#x27;s ashes are interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

<text>Bulganbaatar is an extinct genus of early mammals from the Upper Cretaceous.

It is a member of the extinct order Multituberculata. It lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and is a member of the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea. The genus &quot;Bulganbaatar&quot; was named by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska in 1974 after the village of Bulgan situated near Bayn Dzak.
It is one of many Cretaceous aged mammal discoveries made by Kielan-Jaworowska and co-workers from Central Asian sites. Kielan-Jaworowska considered &quot;B.nemegtbaatorides&quot; to be the ancestor to the genus &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; due to similarity but more derived teeth in the latter, hence the names. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, both &quot;Bulganbaatar&quot; and &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; are distinctive for exhibiting &quot;elongation of the last
upper premolar and molars, and an increase in their cusp numbers.&quot;

Fossil remains of &quot;Bulganbaatar&quot; have been found in Upper Cretaceous-aged strata of the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Their appearances range between 84 and 81 million years ago, from the late Santonian to the early Campanian ages.

<doc id="209278" wikidata="Q637156" url="?curid=209278" title="Warrant (finance)">
<text>In finance, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy or sell stock, typically the stock of the issuing company, at a fixed price called the exercise price.

Warrants and options are similar in that the two contractual financial instruments allow the holder special rights to buy securities. Both are discretionary, and have expiration dates. They differ mainly in that warrants are only issued by specific authorized institutions (typically the corporation on which the warrant is based), and in certain technical aspects of their trading and exercise.

Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay lower interest rates or dividends. They can be used to enhance the yield of the bonds and make them more attractive to potential buyers. Warrants can also be used in private equity deals. Frequently, these warrants are detachable, and can be sold independently of the bond or stock.

In the case of warrants issued with preferred stock, stockholders may need to detach and sell the warrant before they can receive dividend payments. Thus, it is sometimes beneficial to detach and sell a warrant as soon as possible so that the investor can earn dividends.

Warrants are actively traded in some financial markets, such as the German and Hong Kong stock exchanges.

==Structure and features==
Warrants have similar characteristics to that of other equity derivatives, such as options, for instance:
* Exercising: A warrant is exercised when the holder informs the issuer their intention to purchase the shares underlying the warrant.

The warrant parameters, such as exercise price, are fixed shortly after the issue of the bond. With warrants, it is important to consider the following main characteristics:

* Premium: A warrant&#x27;s &quot;premium&quot; represents how much extra you have to pay for your shares when buying them through the warrant as compared to buying them in the regular way.
* Gearing (leverage): A warrant&#x27;s &quot;gearing&quot; is the way to ascertain how much more exposure you have to the underlying shares using the warrant as compared to the exposure you would have if you buy shares through the market.
* Expiration Date: This is the date the warrant expires. If you plan on exercising the warrant, you must do so before the expiration date. The more time remaining until expiry, the more time for the underlying security to appreciate, which, in turn, will increase the price of the warrant (unless it depreciates). Therefore, the expiry date is the date on which the right to exercise ceases to exist.
* Restrictions on exercise: Like options, there are different exercise types associated with warrants such as American style (holder can exercise anytime before expiration) or European style (holder can only exercise on expiration date).
Warrants are longer-dated options and are generally traded over-the-counter.

==Secondary market==
Sometimes the issuer will try to establish a market for the warrant and to register it with a listed exchange. In this case, the price can be obtained from a stockbroker. But often, warrants are privately held or not registered, which makes their prices less obvious. On the NYSE, warrants can be easily tracked by adding a &quot;w&quot; after the company&#x27;s ticker symbol to check the warrant&#x27;s price. Unregistered warrant transactions can still be facilitated between accredited parties and in fact, several secondary markets have been formed to provide liquidity for these investments.

==Comparison with call options==
Warrants are very similar to call options. For instance, many warrants confer the same rights as equity options and warrants often can be traded in secondary markets like options. However, there also are several key differences between warrants and equity options:

* Warrants are issued by private parties, typically the corporation on which a warrant is based, rather than a public options exchange.
* Warrants issued by the company itself are dilutive. When the warrant issued by the company is exercised, the company issues new shares of stock, so the number of outstanding shares increases. When a call option is exercised, the owner of the call option receives an existing share from an assigned call writer (except in the case of employee stock options, where new shares are created and issued by the company upon exercise). Unlike common stock shares outstanding, warrants do not have voting rights.
* Unlisted warrants are considered over the counter instruments and thus are usually only traded by financial institutions with the capacity to settle and clear these types of transactions. Other warrants are traded on exchanges.
* Often, a warrant&#x27;s lifetime is measured in years (as long as 15 years), while options are typically measured in months. Even LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities), the longest stock options available, tend to expire in two or three years. Upon expiration, the warrants are worthless unless the price of the common stock is greater than the exercise price.
* Warrants are not standardized like exchange-listed options. While investors can write stock options on the ASX (or CBOE), they are not permitted to do so with ASX-listed warrants, since only companies can issue warrants and, while each option contract is over 1000 underlying ordinary shares (100 on CBOE), the number of warrants that must be exercised by the holder to buy the underlying asset depends on the conversion ratio set out in the offer documentation for the warrant issue.
* As with options, warrants slowly lose extrinsic value due to time decay. The sensitivity to this is called &quot;theta&quot;.

==Types of warrants==
The reasons you might invest in one type of warrant may be different from the reasons you might invest in another type of warrant. A wide range of warrants and warrant types are available:
* Equity warrants: Equity warrants can be call and put warrants. Callable warrants offer investors the right to buy shares of a company from that company at a specific price at a future date prior to expiration. Puttable warrants offer investors the right to sell shares of a company back to that company at a specific price at a future date prior to expiration.
* Covered warrants: A covered warrant is a warrant that has some underlying backing, for example the issuer will purchase the stock beforehand or will use other instruments to cover the option.
* Basket warrants: As with a regular equity index, warrants can be classified at, for example, an industry level. Thus, it mirrors the performance of the industry. 
* Index warrants: Index warrants use an index as the underlying asset. Your risk is dispersed—using index call and index put warrants—just like with regular equity indexes. They are priced using index points. That is, you deal with cash, not directly with shares.
* Wedding warrants: are attached to the host debentures and can be exercised only if the host debentures are surrendered
* Detachable warrants: the warrant portion of the security can be detached from the debenture and traded separately.
* Naked warrants: are issued without an accompanying bond and, like traditional warrants, are traded on the stock exchange. 
* Cash or Share Warrants in which the settlement may be in the form of either cash or physical delivery of the shares - depending on its status at expiry.

===Traditional===
Traditional warrants are issued in conjunction with a bond (known as a warrant-linked bond) and represent the right to acquire shares in the entity issuing the bond. In other words, the writer of a traditional warrant is also the issuer of the underlying instrument. Warrants are issued in this way as a &quot;sweetener&quot; to make the bond issue more attractive and to reduce the interest rate that must be offered in order to sell the bond issue.

====Example====
* Price paid for bond with warrants formula_1
* Coupon payments C
* Maturity T
* Required rate of return r
* Face value of bond F

:Value of warrants = formula_2

===Covered or naked===
Covered warrants, also known as naked warrants, are issued without an accompanying bond and, like traditional warrants, are traded on the stock exchange. They are typically issued by banks and securities firms and are settled for cash, e.g. do not involve the company who issues the shares that underlie the warrant. In most markets around the world, covered warrants are more popular than the traditional warrants described above. Financially they are also similar to call options, but are typically bought by retail investors, rather than investment funds or banks, who prefer the more keenly priced options which tend to trade on a different market. Covered warrants normally trade alongside equities, which makes them easier for retail investors to buy and sell them.

===Third-party warrants===
A third-party warrant is a derivative issued by the holders of the underlying instrument. Suppose a company issues warrants which give the holder the right to convert each warrant into one share at $500. This warrant is company-issued. Suppose, a mutual fund that holds shares of the company sells warrants against those shares, also exercisable at $500 per share. These are called third-party warrants. The primary advantage is that the instrument helps in the price discovery process. In the above case, the mutual fund selling a one-year warrant exercisable at $500 sends a signal to other investors that the stock may trade at $500-levels in one year. If volumes in such warrants are high, the price discovery process will be that much better; for it would mean that many investors believe that the stock will trade at that level in one year. Third-party warrants are essentially long-term call options. The seller of the warrants does a covered call-write. That is, the seller will hold the stock and sell warrants against them. If the stock does not cross $500, the buyer will not exercise the warrant. The seller will, therefore, keep the warrant premium.

<text>Chulsanbaatar is an extinct genus of mammal from the Cretaceous of Mongolia. It was a member of the order of Multituberculata and is within the suborder Cimolodonta. The genus &quot;Chulsanbaatar&quot; was named by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska in 1974 , after the locality of Khulsan near the dig sites where these organisms were found, and Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Chulsanbaatar vulgaris&quot; have been found in multiple localities in the Gobi Desert, including the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav (also known as Khermeen Tsav, part of the Barun Goyot Formation) in Mongolia. They range in the fossil record from 84 to 71 million years ago, from the late Santonian, through the Campanian and early Maastrichtian ages.

This small multituberculate had a long skull. Remarkably, it has been possible to study the ear bones, which shows how well some of the fossils are preserved. With several intact skulls having been found, it can be determined that &quot;C.vulgaris&quot; has a dental formula of . The adult body mass has been estimated at , which is similar to a small modern mouse.
According to detailed reconstructions by Kielan-Jaworowska and Gambaryan, &quot;Chulsanbaatar&quot; was likely nocturnal due its large eyes, and had live births but relatively undeveloped young due to its pelvic structure. It likely was behaviorially similar to that of the modern gerbil.

The type specimen of &quot;Chulsanbaatar&quot; is now a resident of the Polish Academy of Science in Warsaw, Poland. (ZPAL MgM-I/189). Kielan-Jaworowska noted &quot;C.vulgaris&quot; to be the most commonly found mammal in Campanian aged Gobi Desert dig sites and was precisely why she gave the species that name (common = ).

<text>Sir Henry John Newbolt, CH (6 June 1862 – 19 April 1938) was an English poet, novelist and historian. He also had a role as a government adviser with regard to the study of English in England. He is perhaps best remembered for his poems &quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot; and &quot;Drake&#x27;s Drum&quot;.

==Background==
Henry John Newbolt was born in Bilston, Wolverhampton (then in Staffordshire, but now in the West Midlands), son of the vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church, the Rev. Henry Francis Newbolt (1824–1866), and his second wife, Emily née Stubbs (1838–1921), the older brother of Sir Francis Newbolt. After his father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Walsall, where Henry was educated.

==Education==
Newbolt attended Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School, Walsall, and Caistor Grammar School, from which he gained a scholarship to Clifton College, where he was head of the school (1881) and edited the school magazine. His contemporaries there included John McTaggart, Arthur Quiller-Couch, Roger Fry, William Birdwood, Francis Younghusband and Douglas Haig. Graduating from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Newbolt was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1887 and practised until 1899.

==Family==

Newbolt married Margaret Edwina née Duckworth (1867–1960) of the prominent publishing family -Duckworth Books; they had two children:
* a son, Capt Arthur Francis Newbolt CMG (1893–1966) and,
* a daughter, Margaret Cecilia Newbolt (1890–1975), who in 1914 married Lt. Col. Sir Ralph Dolignon Furse KCMG DSO (1887–1973), the Head of Recruitment at the Colonial Service.

Newbolt resided at 14 Victoria Road in Kensington from 1889 to 1898. He was the grandfather of actress Jill Furse.

==Publications==
His first book was a novel, &quot;Taken from the Enemy&quot; (1892), and in 1895 he published a tragedy, &quot;Mordred&quot;;
but it was the publication of his ballads, &quot;Admirals All&quot; (1897), that created his literary reputation. By far the best-known of these is &quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot;. They were followed by other volumes of stirring verse, including &quot;The Island Race&quot; (1898), &quot;The Sailing of the Long-ships&quot; (1902), &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; (1904) and &quot;Songs of the Fleet&quot; (1910).

&quot;The Twymans: A Tale of Youth&quot; (1911) is a short work of fiction wherein Newbolt fleshes out the features of his own extraordinary education at Clifton. One of the themes of the novel, as of Newbolt&#x27;s preparation for college and for life, is indicated in this remark that a teacher makes to a &quot;practical&quot; parent inquiring about the school: &quot;For information, you purchase a text-book; for education, you live in a society.&quot;

In 1914, Newbolt published &quot;Aladore&quot;, a fantasy novel about a bored but dutiful knight who abruptly abandons his estate and wealth to discover his heart&#x27;s desire and woo a half-fae enchantress. It is a tale filled with allegories about the nature of youth, service, individuality and tradition. It was reissued in a new edition by Newcastle Publishing Company in 1975.

===&quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot;===
Probably the best known of all Newbolt&#x27;s poems, which was written in 1892 and for which he is now chiefly remembered, is &quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot;. The title is taken from a quotation by Lucretius and means &quot;the torch of life&quot;. It describes how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the Close at Clifton College:

:There&#x27;s a breathless hush in the Close to-night—
:Ten to make and the match to win—
:A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
:An hour to play and the last man in.
:And it&#x27;s not for the sake of a ribboned coat,
:Or the selfish hope of a season&#x27;s fame,
:But his captain&#x27;s hand on his shoulder smote
:&quot;Play up! play up! and play the game!&quot;

:The sand of the desert is sodden red,—
:Red with the wreck of a square that broke;—
:The Gatling&#x27;s jammed and the Colonel dead,
:And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.
:The river of death has brimmed his banks,
:And England&#x27;s far, and Honour a name,
:But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:
:&quot;Play up! play up! and play the game!&quot;

:This is the word that year by year,
:While in her place the school is set,
:Every one of her sons must hear,
:And none that hears it dare forget.
:This they all with a joyful mind
:Bear through life like a torch in flame,
:And falling fling to the host behind—
:&quot;Play up! play up! and play the game!&quot;

The engagement mentioned in verse two is the Battle of Abu Klea in Sudan in January 1885 during the unsuccessful expedition to rescue General Gordon. Frederick Burnaby is the colonel referred to in the line &quot;The Gatling&#x27;s jammed and the Colonel&#x27;s dead...&quot;, although it was a Gardner machine gun which jammed, and while Mahdist warriors did break into the British square, it did not collapse disastrously as the poem suggests.

===&quot;Drake&#x27;s Drum&quot;===
According to legend the drum owned by Sir Francis Drake and carried with him on his voyages will beat in times of national crisis and the spirit of Drake will return to aid his country. Sir Henry reinforced the myth with his 1897 poem &quot;Drake&#x27;s Drum&quot;, &quot;Drake he&#x27;s in his hammock an&#x27; a thousand mile away...&quot;:

:Drake he&#x27;s in his hammock an&#x27; a thousand mile away,
:(Capten, art tha sleepin&#x27; there below?)
:Slung atween the round shot in Nombre Dios Bay,
:An&#x27; dreamin&#x27; arl the time o&#x27; Plymouth Hoe.
:Yarnder lumes the island, yarnder lie the ships,
:Wi&#x27; sailor lads a-dancin&#x27; heel-an&#x27;-toe,
:An&#x27; the shore-lights flashin&#x27;, an&#x27; the night-tide dashin&#x27;
:He sees et arl so plainly as he saw et long ago.

:Drake he was a Devon man, an&#x27; ruled the Devon seas,
:(Capten, art tha sleepin&#x27; there below?),
:Rovin&#x27; tho&#x27; his death fell, he went wi&#x27; heart at ease,
:An&#x27; dreamin&#x27; arl the time o&#x27; Plymouth Hoe,
:&quot;Take my drum to England, hang et by the shore,
:Strike et when your powder&#x27;s runnin&#x27; low;
:If the Dons sight Devon, I&#x27;ll quit the port o&#x27; Heaven,
:An&#x27; drum them up the Channel as we drummed them long ago.&quot;

:Drake he&#x27;s in his hammock till the great Armadas come,
:(Capten, art tha sleepin&#x27; there below?),
:Slung atween the round shot, listenin&#x27; for the drum,
:An&#x27; dreamin&#x27; arl the time o&#x27; Plymouth Hoe.
:Call him on the deep sea, call him up the Sound,
:Call him when ye sail to meet the foe;
:Where the old trade&#x27;s plyin&#x27; an&#x27; the old flag flyin&#x27;,
:They shall find him, ware an&#x27; wakin&#x27;, as they found him long ago.

The poem has been widely anthologised and has been set to both classical and folk tunes. &quot;Drake&#x27;s Drum&quot; is the first of five poetic settings by the composer Charles Villiers Stanford. Stanford wrote two song cycles based on poems by Newbolt: &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Fleet&quot;.

===&quot;Monthly Review&quot;===
Newbolt was the editor of the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; from October 1900 to September 1904. He was also a member of the Athenaeum and the Coefficients dining club.

==War and history==
At the start of the First World War, Newbolt – along with over 20 other leading British writers – was brought into the War Propaganda Bureau, which had been formed to promote Britain&#x27;s interests during the war and maintain public opinion in favour of the war.

He subsequently became Controller of Wireless and Cables at the Foreign Office. His poems about the war include &quot;The War Films&quot;, printed on the leader page of &quot;The Times&quot; on 14 October 1916, which seeks to temper the shock effect on cinema audiences of footage of the Battle of the Somme.

Newbolt was knighted in 1915 and was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1922.

In the late 1920s he was the editor of the Nelson&#x27;s Classics series of books published by Faber and Gwyer and later by Faber &amp; Faber.

== The Newbolt Report ==
In 1921 he had been the author of a government Report entitled &quot;The Teaching of English in England&quot; which established the foundations for modern English Studies and professionalised the forms of teaching of English Literature. It established a canon, argued that English must become the linguistic and literary standard throughout the British Empire, and even proposed salary rates for lecturers. For many years it was a standard work for English teachers in teacher training Colleges.

==Death and legacy==
Newbolt died at home in Campden Hill, Kensington, London, on 19 April 1938, aged 75. His residency there is commemorated by a blue plaque. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s church on an island in the lake on the Orchardleigh Estate of the Duckworth family in Somerset.

In his home town of Bilston, a public house was named after him, and a blue plaque is displayed on Barclay&#x27;s bank near the street where he was born.

Early 20th century British composer Hope Squire wrote several songs based on Newbolt’s poems.

In June 2013 a campaign was launched by &quot;The Black Country Bugle&quot; to erect a statue in Newbolt&#x27;s memory.

Recordings were made of Newbolt reading some of his own poems. They were on four 78rpm sides in the Columbia Records &quot;International Educational Society&quot; Lecture series, Lecture 92 (D40181/2).

During an April 2018 episode of Steve Jones&#x27;s radio show Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox, John Cooper Clarke revealed Newbolt as one of his early inspirations, reciting from memory a portion of Vitaï Lampada.

Welsh composer David John Thomas (1881-1928), also known by his bardic name as Afan Thomas, composed a cantata based on Newbolt&#x27;s &quot;He Fell Among Thieves&quot;. The poem is about the stoic death of the explorer George Hayward (c. 1839 – 18 July 1870), captured and killed in Kashmiri territory.

<text>The Naval Reactors Facility (NRF) is located northwest of Idaho Falls, Idaho. The NRF is a United States Department of Energy-Naval Reactors facility where three nuclear propulsion prototypes A1W, S1W and S5G were located. It is contractor-operated for the government by Fluor Corporation through their subsidiary, Fluor Marine Propulsion, LLC, which also operates Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory and Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory.

From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, NRF supported the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered fleet by testing reactor designs, receiving spent nuclear fuel for processing and storage, and training nearly 40,000 Navy personnel to operate surface and submarine nuclear power plants. 

The only remaining active facility at NRF is the Expended Core Facility / Dry Storage Facility, which provides for storage of spent fuel from U.S. Naval reactors. 

NRF is part of the Idaho National Laboratory.

<doc id="209284" wikidata="Q18601564" url="?curid=209284" title="Nemegtbaatar">
<text>Nemegtbaatar is an extinct genus of mammal from the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Central Asia. It belonged to the order Multituberculata. &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; is within the suborder Cimolodonta and is a member of the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea.

The genus &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska, 1974) was named after the Nemegt Valley and Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia. The type species is &quot;Nemegtbaatar gobiensis.&quot; It was discovered in Campanian aged strata of the Barun Goyot Formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Fossils of this species have been found in rocks dated from 76 to 71 million years ago, correlating to the Campanian and early Maastrichtian ages. With several intact skulls having been found, it can be determined that &quot;N.gobiensis&quot; has a dental formula of with a &quot;roughly triangular&quot; snout. &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; is possibly derived from a &quot;Bulganbaatar&quot; ancestor, based on a comparison of their dentition.

&quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; was a relatively large member of Djadochtatherioidea, with a skull length of up to and estimated adult body mass of , which is roughly the size of a modern rat. According to detailed reconstructions by Kielan-Jaworowska and Gambaryan, &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; was likely nocturnal due its large eyes, and had live births but relatively undeveloped young due to its pelvic structure. It likely was behaviorially similar to that of the modern gerbil.

Fossil specimens were collected during several Polish-Mongolian expeditions that took place during the 1960s and 1970s, during which this species was discovered. At least one specimen is in the Institute of Paleobiology collection of the Polish Academy of Science at Warsaw, (ZPAL MgM-1/76). Fossil remains of &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; are unusually complete, allowing for significant reconstructive analyses to be performed on them.

<text>A warrant is generally an order that serves as a specific type of authorization, that is, a writ issued by a competent officer, usually a judge or magistrate, that permits an otherwise illegal act that would violate individual rights in order to enforce the law and aid in investigations; affording the person executing the writ protection from damages if the act is performed.

A warrant is usually issued by a court and is directed to a sheriff, a constable, or a police officer. Warrants normally issued by a court include search warrants, arrest warrants, and execution warrants.

==Types==
* Arrest warrant, issued by a judge to detain someone
* Execution warrant, writ issued by a judge authorizing the death of someone
* Possessory warrant, a civil writ issued by a judge ordering property searched for, then delivered to a named person
* Search warrant, a writ issued by a judge allowing law enforcement to look inside a property
* Warrant of committal, issued by a judge ordering enforcement of a previous order against an uncooperative person or corporation
* Warrant of delivery, a civil writ issued by a judge ordering property delivered to a named person
* Warrant of execution, a writ issued by a judge allowing law enforcement officers to seize property
* Warrant of possession, an Australian judge ordered to terminate of a residential real estate tenancy

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, senior public appointments are made by warrant under the &quot;royal sign-manual&quot;, the personal signature of the monarch, on the recommendation of the government. In an interesting survival from medieval times, these warrants abate (lose their force) on the death of the sovereign if they have not already been executed. This particularly applied to death warrants in the days when England authorized capital punishment.

Perhaps the most well-known example of this occurred on 17 November 1558, when England was under the rule of a Catholic queen, Mary I, daughter of Henry VIII and the Spanish Catholic Catherine of Aragon. Several Protestants convicted of heresy had been condemned to die. They were tied to stakes in Smithfield, an open market area in central London, and the firewood bundles were about to be lit, when a royal messenger rode up to announce that Mary I had died: the warrants for their death had lost their force. The first formal act of Mary&#x27;s successor, the Protestant Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, was to decline to re-issue the warrants; the Protestants were released a few weeks later.

==United States==
===History===
For many years, the English, later British, government had used a &quot;general warrant&quot; to enforce its laws. These warrants were broad in nature and did not have specifics as to why they were issued or what the arrest was being made for. A general warrant placed almost no limitations on the search or arresting authority of a soldier or sheriff. This concept had become a serious problem when those in power issued general warrants to have their enemies arrested when no wrongdoing had been done. The Parliament of Great Britain passed the Revenue Act 1767 (7 Geo. 3. c. 46) which reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, and gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods. This law was one of the key acts of Great Britain which led to the American Revolution, and is the direct reason that the American Founding Fathers ensured that general warrants would be illegal in the United States by ratifying the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1791.

===Practice===
Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution a warrant is broadly required, which particularly describes the place to be searched, and the persons, or things, to be seized; no warrants may be issued without probable cause, and support by testimony before a judge.

The courts have recognized many warrantless searches, including exceptions for routine administrative or inventory searches, searches made under exigent circumstances, and searches made with consent.

A typical arrest warrant in the United States will take the approximate form of: &quot;This Court orders the Sheriff or Constable to find the named person, wherever he may be found, and deliver said person to the custody of the Court.&quot; Generally, a U.S. arrest warrant must contain the caption of the court issuing the warrant, the name (if known) of the person to be arrested, the offense charged, the date of issue, the officer(s) to whom the warrant is directed, and the signature of the magistrate.

Warrants may also be issued by other government entities, including legislatures, since most have the power to compel the attendance of their members. When a legislature issues a warrant, it is called a call of the house.

The person being investigated, arrested, or having their property seized, pursuant to a warrant is given a copy of the warrant at the time of its execution.

<text>John Henry O&#x27;Hara (January 31, 1905 – April 11, 1970) was an American writer. He was one of America&#x27;s most prolific writers of short stories, credited with helping to invent &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine short story style. He became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; and &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;. While O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century. Few college students educated after O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.

&quot;O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,&quot; wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, in a 2013 appreciation of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s work. Stein added, &quot;You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on &quot;Mad Men&quot;, and for some of the same reasons. On the topics of class, sex, and alcohol—that is, the topics that mattered to him—his novels amount to a secret history of American life.&quot;

O&#x27;Hara achieved substantial commercial success in the years after World War II, when his fiction repeatedly appeared in &quot;Publishers Weekly&#x27;s&quot; annual list of the top ten best-selling fiction works in the United States. These best sellers included &quot;A Rage to Live&quot; (1949), &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; (1955), &quot;From the Terrace&quot; (1959), &quot;Ourselves to Know&quot; (1960), &quot;Sermons and Soda Water&quot; (1960) and &quot;Elizabeth Appleton&quot; (1963). Five of his works were adapted into popular films in the 1950s and 1960s.

Despite the popularity of these books, O&#x27;Hara accumulated detractors due to his outsized and easily bruised ego, alcoholic irascibility, long-held resentments and politically conservative views that were unfashionable in literary circles in the 1960s. After O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s death, John Updike, an admirer of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s writing, said that the prolific author &quot;out-produced our capacity for appreciation; maybe now we can settle down and marvel at him all over again.&quot;

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Hara was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to an affluent Irish American family. Though his family lived among the gentry of eastern Pennsylvania during his childhood, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Irish Catholic background gave him the perspective of an outsider to elite WASP society, a theme he wrote of again and again. He attended the secondary school Niagara Prep in Lewiston, New York, where he was named Class Poet for Class of 1924. His father died about that time, leaving him unable to afford Yale, the college of his dreams, and he fell overnight from the privileged life of a well-heeled doctor&#x27;s family, including club memberships, riding and dance lessons, fancy cars in the barn, and domestic servants in the house. By all accounts, this social fall afflicted O&#x27;Hara with status anxiety for the rest of his life, honing the cutting social class awareness that characterizes his work.

Brendan Gill, who worked with O&#x27;Hara at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, claimed that O&#x27;Hara was nearly obsessed with a sense of social inferiority due to not having attended Yale. &quot;People used to make fun of the fact that O&#x27;Hara wanted so desperately to have gone to Yale, but it was never a joke to O&#x27;Hara. It seemed... that there wasn&#x27;t anything he didn&#x27;t know about it in regard to college and prep-school matters.&quot; Hemingway once said someone should &quot;start a bloody fund to send up a collection to send John O&#x27;Hara to Yale.&quot; As his literary acclaim grew, O&#x27;Hara yearned for an honorary degree from Yale, but never received it. According to Gill, the college was unwilling to award the honor precisely because O&#x27;Hara had obstreperously &quot;asked for it.&quot;

==Career and reputation==
Initially, O&#x27;Hara worked as a reporter for various newspapers. Moving to New York City, he began to write short stories for magazines. During the early part of his career, he was also a film critic, a radio commentator and a press agent. In 1934, O&#x27;Hara published his first novel, &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot;. Endorsing the novel, Ernest Hemingway wrote: &quot;If you want to read a book by a man who knows exactly what he is writing about and has written it marvelously well, read &quot;Appointment in Samarra.&quot;&quot; O&#x27;Hara followed &quot;Samarra&quot; with &quot;BUtterfield 8,&quot; his roman à clef based upon the tragic, short life of flapper Starr Faithfull, whose mysterious death in 1931 became a tabloid sensation. Over four decades, O&#x27;Hara published novels, novellas, plays, screenplays and more than 400 short stories, the majority of them in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. 

During World War II, he was a correspondent in the Pacific theater. After the war, he wrote screenplays and more novels, including &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot;, for which he won the 1956 National Book Award and &quot;From the Terrace&quot; (1958), which he considered his &quot;greatest achievement as a novelist.&quot; Late in life, with his reputation established, he became a newspaper columnist. In his last decade, O&#x27;Hara created &quot;a body of work of magnificent dimensions,&quot; wrote the novelist George V. Higgins, whose own trademark dialogue was influenced heavily by O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s style. &quot;Between 1960 and 1968,&quot; Higgins noted, O&#x27;Hara &quot;published six novels, seven collections of short fiction, and some 137 terse and extended stories that all by themselves would supply credentials for a towering reputation in the world of perfect justice that he never did quite find.&quot;
Many of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s stories (and his later novels written in the 1950s) are set in Gibbsville, Pennsylvania, a barely fictionalized version of his home town of Pottsville, a small city in the anthracite region of the northeastern United States. He named Gibbsville for his friend and frequent editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Wolcott Gibbs. Most of his other stories were set in New York or Hollywood.

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s short stories earned him his highest critical acclaim. He contributed more of them to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; than any other writer. He complained that his numerous short stories took his time away from writing novels. &quot;I had an apparently inexhaustible urge to express an unlimited supply of short story ideas. No writing has ever come more easily to me,&quot; he claimed. In the Library of America&#x27;s collection of 60 of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s best stories, editor Charles McGrath praises them for their &quot;sketchlike lightness and brevity... in which nothing necessarily &#x27;happens&#x27; in the old-fashioned sense, but in which some crucial loss or discovery is revealed just by implication... a sense of speed and economy is just what makes the best of these stories so thrilling.&quot; Gill, who worked with O&#x27;Hara at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, ranks him &quot;among the greatest short-story writers in English, or in any other language&quot; and credits him with helping &quot;to invent what the world came to call &quot;The New Yorker&quot; short story.&quot; In the foreword to a collection published four years before his death, O&#x27;Hara declared, &quot;No one writes them any better than I do.&quot; Two more volumes of his stories were published soon after his death.

Despite his success as a best-selling author, most of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s longer work is not held in as high regard by the literary establishment. Critic Benjamin Schwarz and writer Christina Schwarz claimed: &quot;So widespread is the literary world&#x27;s scorn for John O&#x27;Hara that the inclusion of &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; on the Modern Library&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels of the twentieth century was used to ridicule the entire project.&quot; Some of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s novels and stories are tied off with clumsy, abrupt endings. Some of the harsh literary criticism is attributed to personal dislike of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s abrasive ego and arrogant manner, his vigorous self-promotion, his obsession with his social status, and the politically conservative columns he wrote late in his career. Early and mid-20th century critics also disparaged his novels for their blunt and non-judgmental depictions of loose women and homosexuals, but critics writing after the sexual revolution saw in O&#x27;Hara a pioneer in showing female sexuality in frank, realistic ways. John Kenneth Galbraith, writing about the strict Calvinist culture of his early 20th century childhood in remote, rural Ontario, remembered, &quot;We were taught that sexual intercourse was, under all circumstances, a sin, and we were free from the countervailing influence of movies, television and John O&#x27;Hara.&quot; O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s most biting critics regard his novels as shallow and overly concerned with sexual desire, drinking and surface details at the expense of deeper meaning. Many of his leading characters are alcoholics who live as emotional zombies, anesthetized by drinking to the agony of the human heart in conflict with itself. As his contemporary William Faulkner said of such writers in his Nobel Prize address of 1949, &quot;He writes not of the heart but of the glands.&quot;

In 1949, O&#x27;Hara left &quot;The New Yorker&quot; bitterly, after it published a withering review of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s long novel &quot;A Rage to Live&quot; by his colleague Brendan Gill. Gill disparaged O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s book as &quot;a formula family novel&quot; , one of those turned out by &quot;writers of the third and fourth magnitude in such disheartening abundance&quot; and declared it &quot;a catastrophe&quot; by an author who &quot;plainly intended to write nothing less than a great American novel.&quot; Literary critics called Gill&#x27;s review a &quot;savage attack&quot; and a &quot;cruel hatchet job&quot; on one of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s most popular writers. &quot;During the preceding two decades O&#x27;Hara had been &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s most prolific contributor of stories&quot; (no fewer than 197 by one count). After the magazine published Gill&#x27;s review, O&#x27;Hara quit writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for more than a decade, and when readers complained to Gill for driving O&#x27;Hara away, Gill deflected blame onto another &quot;New Yorker&quot; contributor, James Thurber, for stirring up animosity. O&#x27;Hara would not resume writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; until the 1960s, upon the arrival of a new editor who sought out O&#x27;Hara with an olive branch. Nearly 50 years after the scandalous review, at a forum on O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s legacy held in 1996, Gill stood up in the audience to explain his attack on O&#x27;Hara, pleading that &quot;I had to tell the truth about the novel.&quot;

According to biographer Frank MacShane, O&#x27;Hara thought that Hemingway&#x27;s death made O&#x27;Hara the leading candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. O&#x27;Hara wrote to his daughter &quot;I really think I will get it,&quot; and &quot;I want the Nobel prize... so bad I can taste it.&quot; MacShane says that T.S. Eliot told O&#x27;Hara that he had, in fact, been nominated twice. When John Steinbeck won the prize in 1962, O&#x27;Hara wired, &quot;Congratulations, I can think of only one other author I&#x27;d rather see get it.&quot; In a letter to Steinbeck two years before that, O&#x27;Hara placed himself with Steinbeck in the pantheon of great 20th century American writers, Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner, singling out Faulkner among them as &quot;the one, the genius.&quot;

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s work has many literary admirers, including authors such as Joan Didion, John Updike, Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Fran Lebowitz and Shelby Foote. Charles McGrath, a former fiction editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and former editor of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, has called O&#x27;Hara &quot;one of the great listeners of American fiction, able to write dialogue that sounded the way people really talk, and he also learned the eavesdropper&#x27;s secret—how often people leave unsaid what is really on their minds.&quot;. O&#x27;Hara said he learned from reading Ring Lardner &quot;that if you wrote down speech as it is spoken truly, you produce true characters,&quot; and added, &quot;Sometimes I almost feel that I ought to apologize for having the ability to write good dialogue, and yet it&#x27;s the attribute most lacking in American writers and almost totally lacking in the British.&quot;

==Death==
O&#x27;Hara died from cardiovascular disease in Princeton, New Jersey, and is interred in the Princeton Cemetery. A comment he made about himself and which was chosen by his wife for his epitaph reads: &quot;Better than anyone else, he told the truth about his time. He was a professional. He wrote honestly and well.&quot; Of this, Gill commented: &quot;From the far side of the grave, he remains self-defensive and overbearing. Better than anyone else? Not merely better than any other writer of fiction but better than any dramatist, any poet, any biographer, any historian? It is an astonishing claim.&quot;

After his death, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s study and its contents were reconstructed in 1974 for display at Pennsylvania State University, where his papers are held. His childhood home, the John O&#x27;Hara House in Pottsville, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

==Adaptations==

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940) led to the successful Broadway musical, with libretto by O&#x27;Hara and songs by Rodgers and Hart. In 1957, &quot;Pal Joey&quot; was made into a musical film starring Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak, and Barbara Nichols.

&quot;From the Terrace&quot; is a 1960 film adapted from O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1958 novel. The film starred Paul Newman as disenchanted Alfred Eaton, son of a wealthy but indifferent father and alcoholic mother as well as Joanne Woodward as his socially ambitious, self-pitying and unfaithful wife Mary St. John.

Also in 1960, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s best-selling 1935 novel &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; was released as a film with the same name. Elizabeth Taylor won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gloria Wandrous. Of the film version, Taylor famously said, &quot;I think it stinks.&quot;

&quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; is a 1958 film based on O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1955 novel. Gary Cooper starred as Joe Chapin, with Diane Varsi, Ray Stricklyn, Suzy Parker, and Geraldine Fitzgerald in supporting roles. O&#x27;Hara called Cooper&#x27;s performance &quot;sensitive, understanding and true.&quot;

&quot;A Rage to Live&quot; is a 1965 film directed by Walter Grauman and starring Suzanne Pleshette as Grace Caldwell Tate, a well-mannered, upper-crust beauty whose passions wreak havoc on her social circle. The screenplay by John T. Kelley is based on O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s best-selling 1949 novel.

O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s short stories about Gibbsville were used as the basis for the 1975 NBC television movie &quot;John O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Gibbsville&quot; (also known as &quot;The Turning Point of Jim Malloy&quot;) and for the short-lived 1976 NBC dramatic television series &quot;Gibbsville&quot;.

In 1987, an adaptation of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1966 story &quot;Natica Jackson,&quot; about a film actress in 1930s Hollywood, was produced for the PBS anthology series &quot;Great Performances&quot;. It was directed by Paul Bogart and starred Michelle Pfeiffer in the title role.

The television period drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, on AMC from 2007 to 2015, generated renewed popular interest in O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s work, which dealt with similar themes of mid-20th century American society.

==Columns==
In the early 1950s, O&#x27;Hara wrote a weekly book column, &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; for the &quot;Trenton Times-Advertiser&quot; and a biweekly column, &quot;Appointment with O&#x27;Hara&quot;, for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine. MacShane calls them &quot;garrulous and outspoken&quot; and says neither &quot;added much of importance to O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s work&quot;. Biographer Shelden Grebstein says that O&#x27;Hara in these columns was &quot;simultaneously embarrassing and infuriating in his vaingloriousness, vindictiveness, and general bellicosity.&quot; Biographer Geoffrey Woolf says these earlier columns anticipated &quot;his disastrous &#x27;My Turn&#x27; in &quot;Newsday&quot;, which endured fifty-three weeks ... beginning in late 1964... of his dismissive and contemptuous worst&quot;.

His first &quot;Newsday&quot; column opened with the line, &quot;Let&#x27;s get off to a really bad start.&quot; His second complained, &quot;the same hysteria that afflicted the Prohibitionists is now evident among the anti-cigarettists.&quot; His third column nominally supported the Republican Party nominee Barry Goldwater for U.S. president by identifying his cause with fans of the corny accordionist and band leader Lawrence Welk. &quot;I think it&#x27;s time the Lawrence Welk people had their say,&quot; wrote O&#x27;Hara. &quot;The Lester Lanin and Dizzy Gillespie people have been on too long. When the country is in trouble, like war kind of trouble, man, it is the Lawrence Welk people who can be depended upon, all the way.&quot; In his fifth column, he argued that Martin Luther King Jr. should not have received the Nobel Peace Prize.

The syndicated column was not a success, published by a continuously decreasing number of newspapers, and did not endear him to the politically liberal New York literary establishment.

Several of his columns demonstrate his knowledge of trivia about and yearning for association with Ivy League colleges. As he noted, &quot;Through the years I have acquired a vast amount of information about colleges and universities.&quot; The May 8, 1965, column takes as its ostensible topic the fact that Yale owns stock in American Broadcasting Company and thus is a beneficiary of the television program &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. O&#x27;Hara writes: 
Later, he notes that James Gould Cozzens is a &quot;genuine Harvard alumnus&quot; and speculates that Harvard should broker a television serialization of a Cozzens novel:
His September 4, 1965, column deals entirely with his failure to have received any honorary degrees, going into detail about three honorary degrees he was actually offered but, for various reasons, did not accept. In the column, he lists the awards he has received:
He complains that the colleges write him &quot;highly complimentary&quot; letters asking him to perform &quot;chores&quot; such as officiating as writer-in-residence, judging literary contests, and give lectures, yet do not give him degree citations. &quot;The five major distinctions,&quot; he notes, &quot;were awarded me by other writers, not by [academia].&quot;

The column closes with the comment:

<text>Nonius Marcellus was a Roman grammarian of the 4th or 5th century AD. His only surviving work is the &quot;De compendiosa doctrina&quot;, a dictionary or encyclopedia in 20 books that shows his interests in antiquarianism and Latin literature from Plautus to Apuleius. Nonius may have come from Africa.

==Life==

Little is known about Nonius. The full title of his work, &quot;Noni Marcelli Peripatetici Tubursicensis de Conpendiosa Doctrina ad filium&quot;, indicates that he was a Peripatetic philosopher from Thubursicum in Numidia. An inscription at Thubursicum dedicated by a certain &quot;Nonius Marcellus Herculius&quot; in 323 AD indicates that his family was based in that area. Since Nonius does not mention Christianity and calls himself a peripatetic, he seems not to have converted.

Nonius quotes Aulus Gellius and other 2nd-century compilers, and is himself quoted and praised three times by Priscian in the 5th century, and so must have lived between these dates. According to the &quot;Cambridge History of Classical Literature&quot;, he was probably active in the first half of the 4th century, although some scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries thought he might have lived later in the 4th or even in the 5th century. More recently it has been argued that Nonius lived in the Severan period and can be dated to around A.D. 205–20.

==Works==
The &quot;De compendiosa doctrina&quot; is one of the major sources for lost works of the Roman Republic, including the tragedies of Accius and Pacuvius, the satires of Lucilius, and the history of Sisenna. It consists of words, a short definition, and then quotations of authors using the word. It has been printed under a number of titles, including &quot;De proprietate latini sermonis&quot; and &quot;De varia significatione Verborum&quot;. It is one of three major Latin dictionaries preserved from antiquity, along with that of Festus, which was an epitome of Verrius Flaccus&#x27; work &quot;De verborum significatu&quot;, and the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; of Isidore of Seville.

The first twelve of Nonius&#x27;s twenty books are organized grammatically around words or forms of words, and the remaining eight by subject matter such as clothing, weapons, food, etc. Each entry of either type consists of a brief definition and quotations from Republican-era writers, taken from 2nd-century sources, including Aulus Gellius and Fronto, rather than the original texts. &quot;His ignorance and inattention,&quot; notes the &quot;Cambridge History of Classical Literature&quot;, &quot;diminish but cannot destroy the value of his compilation.&quot;

The research of W. M. Lindsay and later of Strzelecki has shown that Nonius obtained many of his lemmata (entries) and the first citation for each from earlier grammatical texts which are now lost. The remainder of the entries and the extra citations belong to 41 books which he either owned or borrowed from a local library. For each section (either a book or a letter entry within a book), Nonius worked through his 41 lists from 41 volumes in the same order, first to find the lead-citation, and then again in order for additional citations. Based on this methodology, it can be determined whether Nonius is quoting an author first-hand, or from a grammar which was full of errors.

The &quot;Doctrina&quot; preserves fragments from early dramatists, annalists, satirists, and antiquarian writers. In arranging quotations from authors, Nonius always follows the same order, beginning with Plautus and ending with Varro and Cato. The grammarians Priscian and Fulgentius borrowed largely from his book, and in the 5th century a certain Julius Tryphonianus Sabinus brought out a revised and annotated edition.

The &quot;Doctrina&quot; was edited with notes by J. Mercier in 1614 at Paris under the title &quot;De varia significatione Verborum&quot;. The page numbers of the Mercier edition are used as a reference in later editions (e.g. 121 M. means &quot;page 121 of the Mercier edition&quot;).

Nonius also wrote a volume of letters &quot;On the neglect of study&quot;, which is lost but to which he refers in the &quot;Doctrina&quot;.

<text>The cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum) is a member of the family Bombycillidae or waxwing family of passerine birds. It is a medium-sized bird that is mainly brown, gray, and yellow. Some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. It is a native of North and Central America, breeding in open wooded areas in southern Canada and wintering in the southern half of the United States, Central America, and the far northwest of South America. Its diet includes cedar cones, fruit, holly berries, and insects. The cedar waxwing is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The genus name &quot;Bombycilla&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;bombux&quot;, &quot;silk&quot; and the Modern Latin &quot;cilla&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;; this is a direct translation of the German &quot;Seidenschwanz&quot;, &quot;silk-tail&quot;, and refers to the silky-soft plumage of these birds. The specific &quot;cedrorum&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the cedars&quot;.

==Description==

Cedar waxwings are medium-sized birds approximately long and weighing roughly . Wingspan ranges from . They are smaller and browner than their close relative, the Bohemian waxwing (which breeds farther to the north and west). Their markings are a &quot;silky, shiny collection of brown, gray, and lemon-yellow, accented with a subdued crest, rakish black mask, and brilliant-red wax droplets on the wing feathers.&quot; These droplets may be the same colour as the madrone berries they are known to eat. These birds&#x27; most prominent feature is this small cluster of red wax-like droplets on tips of secondary flight feathers on the wings, a feature they share with the Bohemian waxwing (but not the Japanese waxwing). These wax-like droplets are attributed to the pigmented and medullary layers of the secondary tip being surrounded by a transparent cuticle. The wings are &quot;broad and pointed, like a starling&#x27;s.&quot; The tail is typically yellow or orange depending on diet. Birds that have fed on berries of introduced Eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail feathers will have darker orange-tipped tail-feathers. The tail is somewhat short, and square-tipped. Adults have a pale yellow belly. The waxwing&#x27;s crest often &quot;lies flat and droops over the back of the head.&quot; It has a short and wide bill. The waxwing&#x27;s black mask has a thin white border. Immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks, and often do not have the black mask of the adults. Males and females look alike.

The flight of waxwings is strong and direct, and the movement of the flock in flight resembles that of a flock of small pale European starlings. Cedar waxwings fly at and fly at an altitude of .

Cedar waxwings are also known as the southern waxwing, Canada robin, cedar bird, cherry bird, or .

The oldest observed cedar waxwing was eight years and two months old.

===Vocalizations===
The two common calls of these birds include very high-pitched whistles and buzzy trills about a half second long often represented as &quot;see&quot; or &quot;sree&quot;. Its call can also be described as &quot;high, thin, whistles.&quot; They call often, especially in flight.
==Distribution and habitat==

Preferred habitat consists of trees at the edge of wooded areas, or forests, especially those that provide access to berry sources as well as water. They are frequently seen in fruiting trees. Waxwings are attracted to the sound of running water and like to bathe in and drink from shallow creeks. In urban or suburban environments, waxwings often favour parkland with well-spaced trees;
golf courses, cemeteries, or other landscaping with well-spaced trees; bushes that provide berries; and a nearby water source such as a fountain or birdbath. Also look for them near farms, orchards, and gardens, particularly those with fruiting trees or shrubs.

Outside the breeding season, cedar waxwings often feed in large flocks numbering hundreds of birds. This species is nomadic and irruptive, with erratic winter movements, though most of the population migrates farther south into the United States and beyond, sometimes reaching as far as northern South America. They will move in huge numbers if berry supplies are low. Rare vagrants have reached western Europe, and there are two recorded occurrences of cedar waxwing sightings in Great Britain. Individual Bohemian waxwings will occasionally join large winter flocks of cedar waxwings.

==Behavior and ecology==
Cedar waxwings are sociable, seen in flocks year round. They are non-territorial birds and &quot;will often groom each other.&quot; They move from place to place depending on where they can find good sources of berries.

===Breeding===

Mating season for this bird begins around the end of spring and runs through to late summer. The male will do a &quot;hopping dance&quot; for the female. If she is interested, she&#x27;ll hop back. During courtship the male and female will sit together and pass small objects back and forth, such as flower petals or an insect. Mating pairs will sometimes rub their beaks together. The nest is a loose open cup built with grass and twigs, lined with softer materials and supported by a tree branch averaging above ground but, at times, considerably higher. It takes around five or six days for the female waxwing to build the nest and can take up to 2,500 trips back and forth. Sometimes the female will steal nest material from other species&#x27; nests. The outer diameter of the nest is approximately . Usually 5 or 6 eggs are laid and the female incubates them for 11 to 13 days. The eggs are oval shaped with a smooth surface and very little, if any, gloss. The egg shells are of various shades of light or bluish grey with irregular, dark brown spots or greyish-brown splotches. Both parents build the nest and feed the young. Typically, there are one or two broods during the mating season. Young leave the nest about 14 to 18 days after hatching.

===Diet===


Cedar waxwings eat berries and sugary fruit year-round, including dogwood, serviceberry, cedar, juniper, hawthorn, and winterberry, with insects becoming an important part of the diet in the breeding season. Its fondness for the small cones of the eastern redcedar (a kind of juniper) gave this bird its common name. They eat berries whole. They sometimes fly over water to catch insects. The cedar waxwing is sometimes responsible for significant damage to commercial fruit farms and thus can be considered a pest, especially because it feeds in large groups.

When the end of a twig holds a supply of berries that only one bird at a time can reach, members of a flock may line up along the twig and pass berries beak to beak down the line so that each bird gets a chance to eat.

Sometimes, cedar waxwings will eat fruit that is overripe and has begun to ferment, intoxicating the bird.

===Digestion===
Cedar waxwings are a highly specialized frugivorous species, exhibiting almost full reliance on sugary fruits, unlike other fruit-eating passerines that exhibit only opportunistic frugivory when other food sources are in poor supply. Their efficient digestion of fruits containing simple sugars allows them to live on fruit alone, while other fruit-eating passerines found subsisting on fruit alone to be fatal. Reliance on primarily fruit alone occurs until fruit cessation in the spring when the birds start to feed on insects and flowers. In such cases intestinal analysis revealed stomach contents of 84% fruit, 12% invertebrates, and 4% flowers, among 212 individuals involved in the study.

Despite the advantage of frugivorous specialization, they did lose body mass when experimentally fed one fruit type alone (&quot;Viburnum opulus&quot;), but gained body mass when fed pollen-rich catkins as well (&quot;Populus deltoides&quot;). Many fleshy fruits are energy rich. However, they are deficient in nitrogen (protein) levels required by cedar waxwings (1.7%). The nutrient deficit of sugary fruits alone is mitigated through flower and subsequent pollen consumption that is rich in protein. This response to food diversity illustrates the importance of multiple food sources in order to acquire the precise nutrients needed to maintain bodily metabolism.

Even though waxwings displayed efficient rates of digestion, they also exhibited relatively quick passage rates that are indicative of their low utilization efficiency (36.5%) as fruit skins appeared undigested in feces. The low utilization efficiency of fruits digested by Cedar Waxwings not only indicates the necessity of consuming large quantities of fruits, but viable seeds found in feces also suggest the important role they may play in seed dispersal.

The presence of seeds in feces is also indicative of the digestive limitations associated with eating seed-rich fruits, specifically fruits laden with smaller seeds that pass much more slowly through the digestive tract. A positive correlation between seed defecation and fruit consumption is seen as rates of ingestion increased only when rates of seed processing also increased. Studies have shown that when seeds were observed being regurgitated or expelled, activity and ingestion increased as opposed to when seeds were consumed and passed through the digestive tract, limiting further activity and foraging in which waxwings exhibited a period of &quot;loafing&quot; characterized by stretches of inactivity after a meal. This limitation of fruit processing poses potential issues for cedar waxwings observed consuming nutrient-poor fruits and their seeds as the ingestion of seeds prevents them from increasing consumption efforts to mitigate this low-quality diet.
Ingestion of seeds by cedar waxwings is alleviated via efficient rates of seed processing in which seeds are separated from and defecated before the pulp of the fruit. This allows them to still exhibit relatively high digestion efficiencies in spite of the gut processing limitations that are associated with eating seeds. The digestive strategies employed by these birds allow them to subsist on a predominately fruit-based diet.

==Conservation status==
Waxwings are evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Populations are increasing in their range partly because fields are being allowed to grow into forests and shrublands, and fruiting trees like mountain ash are being planted as landscaping. On the other hand, cedar waxwings do sometimes crash into windows, and get hit by cars while foraging along roadsides.

<text>The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) is a peer-reviewed scientific journal of astrophysics and astronomy, established in 1895 by American astronomers George Ellery Hale and James Edward Keeler. The journal discontinued its print edition and became an electronic-only journal in 2015.

Since 1953, The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (ApJS) has been published in conjunction with &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot;, with generally longer articles to supplement the material in the journal. It publishes six volumes per year, with two 280-page issues per volume.

The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL), established in 1967 by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar as Part 2 of &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot;, is now a separate journal focusing on the rapid publication of high-impact astronomical research.

The three journals were published by the University of Chicago Press for the American Astronomical Society until, in January 2009, publication was transferred to IOP Publishing, following the move of the society&#x27;s &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot; in 2008. The reason for the changes were given by the society as the increasing financial demands of the University of Chicago Press. Compared to journals in other scientific disciplines, &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; has a larger (&gt; 85%) acceptance rate, which, however, is similar to other journals covering astronomy and astrophysics.

On January 1, 2022, the AAS Journals, including ApJ, changed to an open access model, with access restrictions and subscription charges removed from previously published papers. Articles accepted after October 11, 2022, will be published under the Creative Commons license CC-BY-SA 4.0. Non-open access articles accepted before that date will be free to access but will still need permission to reuse.

== History ==

The journal was founded in 1895 by George Ellery Hale and James E. Keeler as &quot;The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics&quot;. In addition to the two founding editors, there was an international board of associate editors: M. A. Cornu, Paris; N. C. Dunér, Upsala; William Huggins, London; P. Tacchini, Rome; H. C. Vogel, Potsdam, C. S. Hastings, Yale; A. A. Michelson, Chicago; E. C. Pickering, Harvard; H. A. Rowland, Johns Hopkins; and C. A. Young, Princeton. It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories. The further development of ApJ up to 1995 was outlined by Helmut Abt in an article entitled &quot;Some Statistical Highlights of the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;&quot; in 1995.

<doc id="209298" wikidata="Q4347124" url="?curid=209298" title="Porridge (1974 TV series)">
<text>Porridge is a British sitcom, starring Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale, written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and broadcast on BBC1 from 1974 to 1977. The programme ran for three series and two Christmas specials. A feature film of the same name based on the series was released in 1979.

The sitcom focuses on two prison inmates, Norman Fletcher (played by Barker) and Lennie Godber (played by Beckinsale), who are serving time at the fictional HMP Slade in Cumberland. The show&#x27;s title is a 1950s British slang term for a prison sentence, derived from the traditional breakfast that used to be served in British prisons.

&quot;Porridge&quot; was critically acclaimed and is widely considered to be one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. It is ranked No. 35 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000. In 2004, &quot;Porridge&quot; placed seventh in a poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom.

The series was followed by a 1978 sequel, &quot;Going Straight&quot;, which saw Barker reprise his character as he tries to avoid going back to prison. &quot;Porridge&quot; was revived in 2016 under the same name, with Fletcher&#x27;s grandson beginning a prison sentence.

==Premise==
The main storylines of the sitcom focus on its central character, Norman Stanley Fletcher, a man from Muswell Hill, London. Fletcher, described as &quot;an habitual criminal&quot; by the judge who sentences him (and whose words, voiced by Barker, are repeated in the show&#x27;s opening titles), is sent to HMP Slade, a fictional Category C prison in Cumberland, to serve a prison sentence for his latest crime. The sitcom also follows his cellmate Lennie Godber, a naïve inmate from Birmingham serving his first sentence, whom Fletcher takes under his wing. Each episode&#x27;s story focuses on their time in prison and the various issues they endure while serving their prison sentences.

While both Fletcher and Godber are the show&#x27;s main characters, the series features two major supporting characters, both prison officers. The first is Mr Mackay, a tough and austere Scotsman with a clear dislike of Fletcher, with whom he often comes into conflict (and by whom he is often surreptitiously mocked). The other is Mr Barrowclough, Mackay&#x27;s empathetic, progressive-minded subordinate, who is prone to manipulation by his charges because of his well-meaning character and principles.

The programme&#x27;s scriptwriters appear, uncredited, outside Fletch and Godber&#x27;s cell in the episode &quot;No Peace for the Wicked&quot;. Ronnie Barker had suggested the part of Lennie Godber for Paul Henry, but the decision to cast Richard Beckinsale was taken by the production team.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Porridge&quot; originated with the BBC&#x27;s 1973 project &quot;Seven of One&quot;, which would see Ronnie Barker star in seven different situation comedy pilot episodes. The most successful would then be made into a full series. One of the episodes was &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;, written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais about a newly sentenced habitual criminal, Norman Stanley Fletcher (Barker), being escorted to prison by two warders: the timid Barrowclough (Brian Wilde) and the stern Mackay (Fulton Mackay). It was broadcast on 1 April 1973 on BBC2. Despite Barker&#x27;s initial preference for another of the pilots, a sitcom about a Welsh gambling addict, &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;, was selected. It was renamed &quot;Porridge&quot;, a British slang term for a prison sentence from the 1950s; Barker, Clement and La Frenais actually came up with the same title independently of each other.

In their research, Clement and La Frenais spoke to Jonathan Marshall, a former prisoner who had written a book called &quot;How to Survive in the Nick&quot; (Allison and Busby, 1973), and he advised them about prison slang, dress and routines. Struggling to think up plots and humour for such a downbeat, confined environment, a particular phrase used by Marshall – &quot;little victories&quot; – struck a chord and convinced them to base the series on an inmate who made his daily life in prison more bearable by beating the system, even in trivial ways.

The BBC was forced to look around for locations because the Home Office refused permission for any production filming inside or outside a real prison. Instead, the main gatehouse of the disused prison in Victoria Street, St Albans, was used in the opening credits. Exteriors were first filmed at Leavesden Hospital near Watford. However, after the completion of the second series, the hospital withdrew permission for more filming following complaints from patients&#x27; families. Another institution near Ealing was then used for the third series. Scenes within cells and offices were filmed at the BBC&#x27;s London studios, but for shots of the wider prison interior, series production designer Tim Gleeson converted an old water tank, used at Ealing Studios for underwater filming, into a multi-storey set.

The first episode, &quot;New Faces, Old Hands&quot;, was aired on BBC1 on 5 September 1974, attracting a television audience of more than 16 million, and receiving positive reviews from critics. Two further series were commissioned, as well as two Christmas special episodes. The final episode of &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Final Stretch&quot;, was broadcast on 25 March 1977. The producers and the writers were keen to make more episodes, but Barker was wary of being &quot;stuck with a character&quot; and also wanted to move on to other projects, so the series came to a close. Barker did, however, reprise his role as Fletcher in a sequel, &quot;Going Straight&quot;, which ran for one series in 1978. A feature-length version of the show was made in 1979, and in 2003 a follow-up mockumentary entitled &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot; was aired.

===Locations===
The prison exterior in the title sequence is the old St Albans prison gatehouse and HM Prison Maidstone, which was also featured in the BBC comedy series &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (HMP Slade is referred to in &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; when the protagonists&#x27; husbands are imprisoned there after reoffending in Series 7). The interior shots of doors being locked were filmed in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush police station as the BBC had a good relationship with officers there. In the episode &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, Fletcher speaks to Blanco (David Jason) in the prison gardens: this was filmed in the grounds of an old brewery outside Baldock on the A505 to Royston. The barred windows approximated a prison. The building has since been demolished.

The 1974 episode &quot;A Day Out&quot;, which features a prison work party, was filmed in and around the Welsh village of Penderyn, the prisoners&#x27; ditch being excavated by a JCB. Loftus Road, the home of Queens Park Rangers Football Club, was briefly featured in &quot;Happy Release&quot;, standing in for Elland Road in Leeds.

In the episode &quot;No Way Out&quot;, Fletcher tries to get MacKay to fall into a tunnel in the prison yard. These outside shots were filmed at St Bernard&#x27;s Hospital in West London, the barred windows in this case being those of the hospital pharmacy. The interior shots for the 1979 film were shot entirely at HM Prison Chelmsford, Essex.

===Titles and music===
The opening credits consist of outside shots of Slade prison and of several doors and gates being closed and locked, which was intended to set the scene. In the first series, there were also shots of St Pancras railway station, which was changed in subsequent series to shots of Fletcher walking around Slade prison. Title music was thought unsuitable for a show set in prison, so instead there is a booming narration (voiced by Barker himself) given by the presiding judge passing sentence on Fletcher:

For series 1, the narration is &quot;clean&quot; (i.e. no effects) and plays in one complete piece. For series 2 and 3, it is broken down by sentence into three sections and has an echo effect added to increase the gravity of the &quot;judge&#x27;s&quot; words, with each of the three sentences followed by shots of locking various doors around the &quot;prison&quot; with key locking sound effects.

Subsequently, Barker is reported to have said that he regretted recording himself as the judge, a role subsequently played by Maurice Denham in two episodes of the third series.

The theme music for the closing credits was written by Max Harris, who had also written the theme music for numerous other TV shows, including &quot;The Strange World of Gurney Slade, The Gold Robbers&quot; and &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, and would go on to arrange the theme for &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (which was written by Joseph Ascher), another of the Seven of One pilots. The cheery theme was &quot;deliberately at variance with the dour comedy&quot; and given a music hall feel by Harris because of the lead character&#x27;s Cockney origins.

==Episodes==

Following the pilot episode broadcast on 1 April 1973, the sitcom ran for three series between and , with 20 episodes in total. Each episode was 30 minutes long, except for the two Christmas specials in 1975 and 1976, which were 40 and 45 minutes long respectively.

==Sequels==

===&quot;Going Straight&quot;===

A sequel to &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Going Straight&quot;, was aired between 24 February and 7 April 1978. Beginning with Fletcher&#x27;s release from prison on parole, it follows his attempts to &quot;go straight&quot; and readjust to a law-abiding life. Richard Beckinsale reprised his role as Godber, now the fiancé of Fletcher&#x27;s daughter Ingrid (Patricia Brake), and the couple married in the final episode. Nicholas Lyndhurst also featured as Fletcher&#x27;s gormless son, Raymond. The series lasted six episodes, and generally was not as well received as its predecessor, although it did win two BAFTAs, for Best Situation Comedy and Best Light Entertainment Performance (jointly with &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;) for Ronnie Barker.

===&quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;===

On 29 December 2003, a mockumentary follow-up to &quot;Porridge&quot; was broadcast on BBC Two. It looked back on Fletcher&#x27;s life and how the various inmates of Slade had fared 25 years after Fletcher&#x27;s release from prison. Warren is now a sign painter, Lukewarm is in a civil partnership with Trevor, McLaren is an MSP, Grouty has become a celebrity gangster, Horrible Ives collects money for non-existent charities, Godber is still a lorry driver and still happily married to Ingrid, and Fletcher runs a pub with his childhood sweetheart, Gloria.

===&quot;Porridge&quot; (2016)===

On Sunday 28 August 2016, a one-off sequel to the original series, also titled &quot;Porridge&quot;, was broadcast on BBC One. It starred Kevin Bishop as Nigel Norman Fletcher, Norman Stanley Fletcher&#x27;s grandson, serving five years in prison for computer hacking.

The special was written by the original creators and writers of &quot;Porridge&quot;, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. It gained praise from both viewers and TV critics, with many calling for a full series to be made. The overnight ratings showed an estimated 4.4 million people had watched it. Following the success of the initial episode, in October 2016 the BBC announced that a full series of six episodes had been commissioned, with production to start in January 2017. The full series was released online on 6 October 2017 on the BBC iPlayer as well as starting a six-week run on prime-time BBC One on Fridays.

==International adaptations==
An American version entitled &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (1975–76) ran for a season, while a Dutch version &quot;Laat maar zitten&quot; (a pun: the title has several meanings, like &quot;Don&#x27;t mention it&quot; and &quot;Let it be&quot;, but in this case it can also be interpreted as &quot;Let them do time&quot;) ran from 1988 to 1991; later episodes of the Netherlands version were original scripts, the series also had a very successful Portuguese remake entitled &quot;Camilo na Prisão&quot; (&quot;Camilo in Prison&quot;).

==In other media==
===Film adaptation===

Following the example of other sitcom crossovers, such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, a feature-length version of &quot;Porridge&quot; was made in 1979. Barker again starred as Fletcher, and most of the supporting cast also returned. Unlike the television series, it was actually filmed at a real prison as HMP Chelmsford was temporarily vacant following a fire.

===Novelisations and audio===
Novelisations of the three series of &quot;Porridge&quot; were issued by BBC Books: &quot;Porridge&quot; by Jonathan Marshall (1975), &quot;Another Stretch of Porridge&quot; by Paul Victor (1976), and &quot;A Further Stir of Porridge&quot; by Paul Victor (1977). &quot;Going Straight&quot; was novelised under that title by Paul Victor in 1978. The film of &quot;Porridge&quot; was novelised as &quot;Porridge: The Inside Story&quot; by Paul Ableman, published by Pan Books in 1979.

The three BBC &quot;Porridge&quot; novelisations were published as the collected volume &quot;Three Helpings of Porridge&quot; (1984), republished as &quot;The Complete Porridge&quot; (1990).

BBC Enterprises released an LP record featuring two &quot;Porridge&quot; episodes, &quot;A Night In&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; in 1977.(REB 270) Two volumes of audio cassette releases (&#x27;Porridge&#x27; and &#x27;More Porridge&#x27;) comprising four episodes each, including the two episodes from the vinyl release, were issued in the mid-1990s, and later re-released on CD. A third volume of four episodes (&#x27;A Third Helping&#x27;) was released on cassette in 2002.

===Stage show===
In 2009 &quot;Porridge&quot; was adapted into a stage show, also written by Clement and La Frenais, starring former &quot;EastEnders&quot; actor Shaun Williamson as Fletcher and Daniel West as Godber. Peter Kay, a fan of the show, was previously offered the role but turned it down. It opened in September 2009 to positive reviews.

===Related publications===
Ronnie Barker was the author of &quot;Fletcher&#x27;s Book of Rhyming Slang&quot; (Pan, 1979), which includes an introduction by &#x27;Fletch&#x27;. 

The 2001 book &quot;Porridge: The Inside Story&quot; (not to be confused with the 1979 film novelisation of the same name) contains a series guide by Richard Webber and the scripts of the three seasons and the Christmas specials by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. The book was republished in 2005 under the title &quot;Porridge: The Complete Scripts and Series Guide&quot;.

===&quot;Comedy Classics: Porridge&quot;===
On 16 December 2023, Channel 5 aired a 66-minute special retrospective for their &quot;Comedy Classics&quot; series. Actors and celebrities, including two former cast members Christopher Biggins and Philip Jackson take a look back, discuss and pay tribute to the show.

==Stamps==

A set of special stamps celebrating the 50th anniversary of the TV show was issued by Royal Mail on 3 September 2024.

==Reception==
===Popularity with prisoners===
&quot;Porridge&quot; was immensely popular with British prisoners. Erwin James, an ex-prisoner who wrote a bi-weekly column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, stated that:

He also noted:

===Contributions to the English language===
The script allowed the prisoners to swear without offending viewers by using the word &quot;&quot; in place of ruder words (&quot;Naff off!&quot;, &quot;Darn your own naffing socks&quot;, &quot;Doing next to naff all&quot;), thereby popularising a word that had been virtually unknown and the first recorded use of which was in 1966. Ronnie Barker did not claim to have invented it and in a television interview in 2003 it was explained to him on camera what the word meant, as he did not have a clue. The word is used in another Clement and La Frenais penned series, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen Pet&quot;, by the character of Oz who, after nearly being hit by falling scaffolding, calls one of the other workers a &quot;naffing arsehole&quot;.

A genuine neologism was &quot;nerk&quot;, which was used in place of the more offensive &quot;&quot;. &quot;Berk&quot; has changed meaning since its inception and is generally used now to mean &quot;fool&quot; while the original rhyming slang meaning refers to female genitalia (via &quot;Berkeley Hunt&quot;). Another term was &quot;scrote&quot; (presumably derived from scrotum), meaning a nasty, unpleasant person.

<text>Lucian Müller (17 March 1836 – 24 April 1898) was a German classical scholar.

==Life==
Müller was born in Merseburg in the Province of Saxony. After studying at the universities of Berlin and Halle, he lived for five years in the Netherlands, working on his &quot;Geschichte der klassischen Philologie in den Niederlanden&quot; (1869). Unable to obtain a university appointment in Germany, he accepted (1870) the professorship of Latin at the Imperial Historico-Philological Institute in St Petersburg.

He died in St Petersburg.

==Works==
Müller&#x27;s works display great erudition and critical acumen, and also feature bitter attacks on eminent scholars whose opinions differ from his own. He was a disciple of the methods of Richard Bentley and Karl Lachmann. His &quot;De re metrica poetarum latinorum&quot; (1861; 2nd ed. 1894) represents a landmark in the investigation of the metrical system of the Roman poets (the dramatists excepted), and his &quot;Metrik der Griechen und Römer&quot; (2nd ed., 1885) is an excellent treatise on a limited subject (Eng. trans. by Samuel Ball Platner, Boston, 1892).

His other chief publications were:
*&quot;G. Lucili saturarum reliquiae&quot; (1872), including the fragments of Accius and Sueius
*&quot;Leben und Werke des Gaius Lucilius&quot; (1876; suppt. &quot;Luciliana&quot;, 1884)
*edition of Horace (1869; 2nd ed. 1879; 3rd ed. 1897)
*edition of Catullus (1870)
*edition of Phaedrus (1877)
*&quot;Quintus Horatius Flaccus, eine litterarhistorische Biographie&quot; (1880)
*&quot;Quintus Ennius&quot; (1884), an introduction to the study of Roman poetry
*&quot;Q. Enni carminum reliquiae&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Livi Andronici et Gnaeus Naevius fabularum reliquiae&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Der saturnische Vers und seine Denkmäler&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Noni Marcelli compendiosa doctrina&quot; (1888)
*&quot;De Pacuvii fabulis&quot; (1889)
*&quot;De Accii fabulis disputatio&quot; (1890)
*&quot;Ein Horazjubiläum&quot; (1892), contains a short autobiography
*edition of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; and &quot;Epodes&quot;, with German commentaries (1882)
*edition of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Satires&quot; and &quot;Epistles&quot; (1891–93)

<text>A back office in most corporations is where work that supports &quot;front office&quot; work is done. The front office is the &quot;face&quot; of the company and is all the resources of the company that are used to make sales and interact with customers and clients. The back office is all the resources of the company that are devoted to actually producing a product or service such as data entry, payroll, accounting and all the other labor that is not seen by customers, such as administration or logistics. Broadly speaking, back office work includes roles that affect the costs side of a business&#x27;s trading statement and front office work includes roles that affect the income side of a business&#x27;s trading statement.

Although the operations of a back office are seldom prominent, they are a major contributor to a business&#x27;s success. They can include functions such as accounting, planning, inventory management, supply-chain management, human resources and logistics.

Back offices are often located somewhere other than company headquarters. Many are in areas and countries with cheaper rent and lower labor costs. Some office parks provide back offices for tenants whose front offices are in more expensive neighborhoods. Back office functions can be outsourced to consultants and contractors, including ones in other countries.

<text>From the Terrace is a 1960 American DeLuxe Color romantic drama film in CinemaScope directed by Mark Robson from a screenplay by Ernest Lehman, based on the 1958 novel of the same name by John O&#x27;Hara. The film stars Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Myrna Loy, Ina Balin, George Grizzard, and Leon Ames, with a young Barbara Eden appearing in one scene. The plot tells the story of the estranged son of a Pennsylvania factory owner who marries a prestigious family and moves to New York to seek his fortune.

This was the third theatrically released film that real-life spouses Newman and Woodward made together.

==Plot==

In 1946, navy veteran David Alfred Eaton returned home from the war to Philadelphia. He finds his mother, Martha driven to alcoholism by years of neglect and abuse from her husband Samuel Eaton, owner of a prestigious iron and steel company. Having withdrawn from his family after the death of his firstborn son thirteen years earlier, Samuel has resentment towards Alfred. As a result, Alfred turns his back on the family business and strikes out on his own with his closest friend Lex Porter.

While attending a party at the estate of Lex&#x27;s wealthy uncle, Alfred is dazzled by Mary St. John, the daughter of a wealthy family. Mary is drawn into a relationship with Alfred and defies her parents by breaking her secret engagement to Dr. Jim Roper. After Alfred&#x27;s father Samuel falls ill, Alfred shuns the family business once again to start an aviation company with Lex.

On his wedding day, Alfred receives word that his father has died. With his uncle&#x27;s money, Lex funds the Nassau Aircraft Corporation with Alfred, but Alfred becomes impatient when Lex shows more interest in perfecting aircraft designs than in selling aircraft.

One wintry day, Alfred and Mary are driving home from a party when they see a little boy fall through the thin ice of a frozen pond. Alfred plunges into the icy waters to save him. The boy&#x27;s grandfather, James Duncan MacHardie, the most famous financier in America, invites Alfred and Mary to dinner. MacHardie offers Alfred a job in his investment firm.

Obsessed by the need to outdo his father, Alfred travels the country for MacHardie, leaving Mary alone for months at a time. Lonely and self-pitying, Mary begins to resent Alfred&#x27;s constant absences. MacHardie&#x27;s son-in-law, Creighton Duffy, suggests that Alfred spend two months in rural Pennsylvania checking out the business aptitude and prospects of Ralph Benziger, a prosperous coal mine owner.

After an ugly argument with his wife, Alfred goes to Pennsylvania. Invited to dinner at Benziger&#x27;s home, he meets Natalie, the man&#x27;s beautiful and compassionate daughter. Feeling lonely, Alfred impetuously invites Natalie on a date, but she refuses because he is married. However, she later reconsiders and meets him at a drive-in movie the following evening.

Alfred confides to Natalie that her warmth and generosity have made him realize what a sham his marriage is. They share a kiss, but Natalie still believes they must end this relationship before it goes any further.

Upon returning to New York, Alfred is immediately summoned to MacHardie&#x27;s office. He is informed that Mary has been having an affair with Dr. Roper. However, the archly conservative MacHardie warns Alfred that he will not tolerate divorce within his firm. MacHardie also assigns him to analyze the Nassau Aircraft Corp., his former firm, as a possible investment.

One night while leaving a party with his wife, Alfred unexpectedly encounters Natalie in front of the hotel. Sensing that Alfred and Natalie are intimate, Mary vindictively calls Roper and makes a date with him. Alfred goes to meet Natalie and tells her that, although he is estranged from Mary, his career prevents him from requesting a divorce.

Alfred begins to investigate Nassau Aircraft&#x27;s business practices. Duffy, who has become unethically involved with Nassau and will reap a financial windfall if MacHardie invests in the company, threatens to blackmail Alfred unless he suppresses his report.

Alfred and Natalie meet for a tryst in a hotel room. Photographers hired by Duffy burst in and captured their indiscretion. Natalie, uncertain if Alfred&#x27;s main concern is to save her reputation or his career, decides to leave. Mary suggests to her husband that they share an open marriage, seeing whomever they please. The scandalous photos are delivered to Alfred at his home.

At work the next day, MacHardie ushers in Mary to celebrate Alfred&#x27;s surprise promotion to partner. Alfred rises and denounce MacHardie&#x27;s hypocrisy of placing success and social position above personal responsibility and happiness. Alfred then issues the uncensored report exposing Duffy&#x27;s duplicity and walks out. Mary runs after him, but it is too late. He leaves her for good and returns to Natalie&#x27;s home for a new life -- with his wedding ring now missing from his finger.

==Cast==
==Release==
The film had its world premiere engagements at the Paramount Theatre and Murray Hill Theatre in New York City on July 15, 1960.

==Reception==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;This is a handsome picture, well-performed and emotionally intriguing ... However, for a drama so sharply and ironically concerned with human foibles, in business, love and marriage, it lacks real culminative power.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; stated that &quot;the more discriminating film-goer will find &#x27;From the Terrace&#x27; seriously deficient. Whether the fault lies with O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s basic material or Ernest Lehman&#x27;s screenplay is difficult to assay by a reviewer who skipped the novel ... On the assumption that Lehman followed the O&#x27;Hara story closely, the blame must be placed squarely on the novelist, for &#x27;From the Terrace&#x27; builds up to one big cliche.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has been bolstered a degree above soap opera by its creators and does make a point of sorts against modern materialism&quot;, though &quot;one is left with the feeling that its makers were not able to compress the portions that they have used into a drama of much consequence or climax&quot;. Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;an interminable essay on the horrors of money, love, and sex&quot;, with a story that &quot;has more gaps than a dial phone&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; was positive, declaring it &quot;Outstanding entertainment ... It is loaded with brilliant dialogue, expert acting, human interest, suspense, and some comic touches.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a seriously deficient film. After a long prologue devoted to providing a motivation for Alfred&#x27;s obsessive pursuit of wealth (in the course of which Myrna Loy&#x27;s thorough portrayal of alcoholic misery becomes a stiff price to pay for what amounts to very meagre enlightenment), the film builds up to a shapeless monument of banality.&quot; John McCarten wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;Mr. Robson&#x27;s direction is, except for the first few scenes, unimaginative. But then, the screenplay Mr. Lehman has come up with would hardly inspire anybody.&quot;

Joanne Woodward later admitted to having &quot;affection&quot; for the film &quot;because of the way I looked like Lana Turner.&quot; Her glamorous costumes were designed by Travilla.

The film holds a score of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews.

<text>Henry Nettleship (5 May 1839 – 10 July 1893) was an English classical scholar.
==Life==
Nettleship was born at Kettering, and was educated at Lancing College, Durham School and Charterhouse schools, and gained a scholarship for entry to Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1858. In 1861, he was elected to a fellowship at Lincoln, which he vacated on his marriage in 1870 to Matilda Steel, eldest daughter of his colleague Rev. T.H. Steel at Harrow. In 1868, he became an assistant master at Harrow, but in 1873 he returned to Oxford, and was elected to a fellowship at Corpus. In 1878 he was appointed to succeed Edwin Palmer as the Corpus Professor of Latin, and held the post until his death.

In 1879, Nettleship sat on the committee which was formed to create an Oxford women&#x27;s college &quot;in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.&quot; This resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall (later Somerville College).

He had a son, Henry Melvill (who died aged 20) and a daughter, Edith.

==Works==
Nettleship had always been interested in Virgil, and a good deal of his time was devoted to his favourite poet. After John Conington&#x27;s death in 1869, he saw his edition of Virgil through the press, and revised and corrected subsequent editions of the work. In 1875, he had undertaken to compile a new Latin lexicon for the Clarendon Press, but the work proved more than he could accomplish, and in 1887 he published some of the results of twelve years of labour in a volume entitled &quot;Contributions to Latin Lexicography&quot;, a genuine piece of original work.

In conjunction with John Edwin Sandys, Nettleship revised and edited Oskar Seyffert&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Classical Antiquities&quot;, and he contributed to a volume entitled &quot;Essays on the Endowment of Research&quot; an article on &quot;The Present Relations between Classical Research and Classical Education in England,&quot; in which he pointed out the great value of the professorial lecture in Germany.

In his views on the research question, he was a follower of Mark Pattison, whose essays he edited in 1889 for the Clarendon Press. In &quot;Lectures and Essays on Subjects connected with Latin Literature and Scholarship&quot;, Nettleship revised and republished some of his previous publications. A second series of these, published in 1895, and edited by F. Haverfield, contained a memoir by Mrs M. Nettleship.

==Legacy==
In 1895 Nettleship&#x27;s widow Matilda donated his library to the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (AEW) where it formed a shared collection for all women students. Based in the attics of the Clarendon Building, it later moved to Jowett Walk and then became the library of the Society of Oxford Home-Students (later St Anne&#x27;s College) in 1934. In the present day, the library at St Anne&#x27;s College is referred to as the Nettleship Collection.

<doc id="209308" wikidata="Q3712245" url="?curid=209308" title="Djadochtatheriidae">
<text>Djadochtatheriidae is a family of fossil mammals within the extinct order Multituberculata. Remains are known from the Upper Cretaceous of Central Asia. These animals lived during the Mesozoic, also known as the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot;. This family is part of the suborder of Cimolodonta. The taxon Djadochtatheriidae was named by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Jørn Hurum in 1997.

Multituberculates are a rather diverse group in terms of locomotion and diet. Forms like &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; and &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; were hopping, jerboa-like omnivores (and this is probably the ancestral condition for the group, given that &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; also had this lifestyle), while &quot;Mangasbaatar&quot; was a robust, digging herbivore.

<doc id="209309" wikidata="Q801125" url="?curid=209309" title="London Bridge station">
<text>London Bridge is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Southwark, south-east London. It occupies a large area on three levels immediately south-east of London Bridge, from which it takes its name. The main line station is the oldest railway station in London fare zone 1 and one of the oldest in the world having opened in 1836. It is one of two main line termini in London to the south of the River Thames (the other being Waterloo) and is the fourth-busiest station in London, handling over 50 million passengers a year.

The station was originally opened by the London and Greenwich Railway as a local service. It subsequently served the London and Croydon Railway, the London and Brighton Railway and the South Eastern Railway, thus becoming an important London terminus. It was rebuilt in 1849 and again in 1864 to provide more services and increase capacity. Local services from London Bridge began to be electrified in the beginning of the 20th century, and had spread to national routes by the 1930s. The station was extensively rebuilt by British Rail during the 1970s, along with a comprehensive re-signalling scheme and track alignment. It was further redeveloped in the 2010s to better accommodate the Thameslink route which provides a connection to Gatwick Airport, Luton Airport and Crossrail.

The National Rail station is served by Southeastern services from Charing Cross and Cannon Street to destinations in southeast London, Kent and East Sussex and is a terminus for many Southern commuter and regional services to south London and numerous destinations in South East England. Thameslink services from Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough to Brighton and other destinations in Sussex and Kent began serving the station in 2018. The London Underground station is served by the Jubilee and Northern lines.

==Location==
The main line station is one of 19 UK stations managed by Network Rail. It has a ticket hall and entrance area with its main frontage on Tooley Street, and other entrances on Borough High Street and within the main line station concourse. It is one of two mainline London termini south of the River Thames, the other is Waterloo.

The London Underground station is on the Jubilee line and the Bank branch of the Northern line. River buses use the nearby London Bridge City Pier.

==History==
London Bridge station was opened on 14 December 1836, making it the oldest London railway terminus that is still running. It was not the earliest station in the London metropolitan area, as the London and Greenwich Railway had opened stations at Spa Road (in Bermondsey) and on 8 February 1836. The completion of the line into London Bridge was postponed because of delays in constructing a bridge at Bermondsey Street. From 10 October 1836, trains were able to operate as far as the east end of this bridge, with passengers having to walk the last . The station has had several changes of ownership and complete rebuilds since opening.

===London and Greenwich Railway station===

The original station had four tracks and was wide and long. It was approached through a pair of iron gates. Three tracks led into two platforms as a stub end of a viaduct. The station was entirely exposed to the weather until a tarred canvas roof was erected in 1840. Sixteen columns and fourteen beams from this structure were retrieved in 2013 and given to the Vale of Rheidol Railway in Aberystwyth, Wales for use in a planned railway museum.

Before completing the train shed, the London and Greenwich Railway entered into an agreement with the proposed London and Croydon Railway for the latter to use its tracks from Corbett&#x27;s Lane, Bermondsey, and to share its station. However, the Greenwich railway had underestimated the cost of building the long viaduct leading to London Bridge and was not able to build a sufficiently large station for the traffic for both companies, and so in July 1836 it sold some land adjacent to its station (then still under construction) to the Croydon railway to build their own independent station.

===London and Croydon Railway station===

The London and Brighton Railway and the South Eastern Railway (SER) were also planning routes from London to Brighton and Dover respectively, and the British Parliament decided that the London and Greenwich line should become the entry corridor into London from South East England. The two railways were therefore required to share the route of the London and Croydon Railway from near Norwood (which in turn shared the route of the London and Greenwich Railway from Bermondsey to London Bridge). As a result, the London and Croydon Railway obtained powers in the (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. xx) to enlarge the station it was then constructing at London Bridge, before it had opened for traffic.

The London and Croydon Railway opened its line and began using its station on 5 June 1839; the London and Brighton Railway joined it on 12 July 1841, followed by the South Eastern Railway on 26 May 1842. It was soon found that the viaduct approaching London Bridge would be inadequate to deal with the traffic generated by four railways, so it was widened by the Greenwich Railway between 1840 and 1842, doubling the number of tracks to four. The new lines, intended for the Croydon, Brighton and South Eastern trains, were situated on the south side of the existing Greenwich line, whereas their station was to the north of the London Bridge site, leading to an awkward and potentially dangerous crossing of one another&#x27;s lines. The directors of the companies involved decided to exchange sites; the London and Greenwich Railway would take over the newly completed London and Croydon Railway station, whilst a new joint committee of the Croydon, Brighton and South Eastern companies would demolish the first station and build a new one on its site.

===Joint station===

Plans for a large new station were drawn up, designed jointly by Lewis Cubitt, John Urpeth Rastrick and Henry Roberts. Drawings were published in the Illustrated London News and George Bradshaw&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the London and Brighton Railway&quot; 1844. They show &#x27;a quasi-Italianate building with a picturesque campanile&#x27;. It opened for business in July 1844 while only partially complete, but events were taking place which would mean that the bell tower would never be built, and the new building would only last five years.

In 1843 the SER and Croydon railway companies became increasingly concerned by the high tolls charged by the London and Greenwich Railway for the use of the station approaches, and gained Parliamentary approval to build their own independent line into south London to a new station at Bricklayers Arms, which was vaguely described as a &quot;West End terminus&quot;. This line opened on 1 May 1844 and most of the services from these two companies were withdrawn from London Bridge, leaving only the Greenwich and Brighton companies using London Bridge station. The Greenwich company was on the brink of bankruptcy and so was forced to lease its lines to the SER, which took effect from 1 January 1845. The next year the Croydon and Brighton companies, along with other small railways, merged to form the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR). Consequently, there were only two companies serving London Bridge. The LB&amp;SCR used the unfinished joint station until it was demolished in 1849 and a larger building constructed.

===South Eastern Railway station===

The SER took over the second London and Greenwich station (which had been built for the London and Croydon Railway) and sought to develop that site rather than continue to invest in the former joint station, which became the property of the LB&amp;SCR. The SER station was therefore rebuilt and enlarged between 1847 and 1850, to a design by Samuel Beazley. At the same time yet further improvements were made to the station approaches, increasing the number of tracks to six, which entirely separated the lines of the two railways. Once these extensions were complete the SER closed its passenger terminus at Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms and converted the site into a goods depot in 1852.

London Bridge station remained the London terminus of the SER until 1864 when its station was again rebuilt. Five of the existing platforms were converted into a through station to enable the extension of the main line into central London and the opening of Charing Cross railway station, and in 1866 to Cannon Street station. In 1899 the SER entered into a working amalgamation with the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR) to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee. Junctions were laid to enable trains through London Bridge to reach the LC&amp;DR stations at Holborn Viaduct and St Pauls.

===London Brighton and South Coast Railway station===
The LB&amp;SCR took over the unfinished joint station, which they demolished in 1849 and opened a temporary station in 1850. This was rebuilt and enlarged in 1853–4 to deal with the additional traffic from the lines to Sydenham and . A three-storey box-like structure in Italian style was erected, with the name of the railway emblazoned on the top parapet.
In 1859 the LC&amp;DR applied to the LB&amp;SCR for running powers from Sydenham to London Bridge, but was refused. However, some ticketing arrangement was made between the two companies as the LC&amp;DR advertised connections to and from London Bridge in its timetables in &quot;The Times&quot; and Bradshaw&#x27;s Railway Guide for July 1861. This arrangement was short-lived pending the construction of the LC&amp;DR line to Holborn Viaduct.

The LB&amp;SCR also built the &quot;Terminus Hotel&quot; at the station in 1861. It was designed by Henry Currey, architect for St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, and had 150 public rooms over seven stories. It was unsuccessful because it was on the south bank of the river, so was turned into offices for the railway in 1893. It was destroyed by bombing in 1941.

An act of Parliament of 1862 gave the LB&amp;SCR power to enlarge the station further. Over the next few years under the direction of new Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the company built four more platform-faces in an adjoining area to the south of its existing station to cope with additional traffic generated by the completion of the South London Line and other suburban lines to Victoria station. This had a single-span trussed-arch roof measuring , and was designed by J. Hawkshaw and Banister. During the first decade of the twentieth century LB&amp;SCR station at London Bridge was again enlarged, but overall London Bridge station remained a &quot;sprawling confusion&quot;.

The chaotic nature of the station at the turn of the century was described in John Davidson&#x27;s poem, &quot;London Bridge&quot;:

The South London Line from London Bridge to Victoria was electrified in 1909 with an experimental overhead system. It was successful and other suburban services were electrified including the line to Crystal Palace in 1912. Because of World War I, the line to Croydon was not electrified until 1920.

===Southern Railway station===

The Railways Act 1921 led to the Big Four grouping in 1923. All of the railways of southern England combined to form the Southern Railway (SR), bringing the London Bridge complex under single ownership. The wall that divided the Chatham and Brighton stations was partially knocked through in 1928 to provide an easier interchange between stations. This allowed a greater range of platforms to be used for the increasingly frequent suburban rail services to London Bridge.

Between 1926 and 1928 the Southern Railway electrified the SE&amp;CR suburban lines at London Bridge using a third rail system, adapting the existing LB&amp;SCR routes to it at the same time. The first electric services ran on 25 March 1928 from London Bridge to Crystal Palace via Sydenham, followed by a peak hour service to Coulsdon North on 17 June. This was followed by electric services to Epsom Downs via West Croydon, Crystal Palace via Tulse Hill, and Streatham Hill, and to Dorking North and Effingham Junction via Mitcham on 3 March 1929. At the same time as electrification, the SR installed colour light signalling. The Southern Railway electrified the Brighton Main Line services to Brighton and the South Coast, providing a full service to on 17 July 1932. This was followed by a full electric service to Brighton and West Worthing on 1 January 1933, followed by services to Seaford, and on 7 July 1935 and to and on 3 July 1938.

By the 1930s, a regular feature of London Bridge traffic was a glut of commuter services all departing at or shortly after 5:00 pm. A typical timetable included 12-car services to Brighton, Eastbourne and Littlehampton, all between 5:00 and 5:05. &quot;The fives&quot; continued to run until the mid-1970s.

Both the London Bridge stations were badly damaged by bombing in the London Blitz in December 1940 and early 1941. The shell of the two stations was patched up but the former Terminus Hotel, then used as railway offices, was rendered unsafe and demolished.

===British Railways station===

British Railways (BR) took over responsibility for the station in 1948 following nationalisation of the railways. They did not consider London Bridge a priority at first, and the war-torn damage of the station remained into the 1960s. Electrification of the lines into London Bridge continued during the 1950s and 1960s, with the final steam service running in 1964, when the line to Oxted and Uckfield was replaced by diesel / electric multiple units. The very last scheduled steam train was the 4.50am to Tonbridge via Redhill on 4 January 1964 hauled by an N class locomotive.

By the early 1970s the station could no longer cope with the volume of traffic. Between 1972 and 1978, BR significantly redeveloped the station and its approaches. This included a £21 million re-signalling scheme that consolidated 16 signal boxes into a new London Bridge Area Signalling Centre and a new station concourse designed by N. D. T. Wikeley, regional architect for the Southern Region. This was opened 14 December 1978. New awnings were added over the former SER platforms, but the arched Brighton roof was left. It was described by &quot;The Oxford companion to British Railway History&quot; as &quot;one of the best modern station reconstructions in Britain&quot;.
Patronage to London Bridge tailed off from a peak in the early 1970s. The station remained popular for through routes to the City and the West End, but the number of terminal trains declined significantly by the early 1980s. The bridge over the station&#x27;s north end became Grade II listed in January 1988, while Platforms 9–16 (the former LB&amp;SCR side) became listed the same that December.

In 1991, a &quot;Thameslink 2000&quot; project was proposed that would improve services between London Bridge and the Great Northern lines. It was originally hoped the work would be complete by 1997. A £500 million refurbishment programme was announced by Railtrack in 1999, which would have seen the station complex rotated by 90 degrees, and large amount of shopping space added.

===Thameslink Programme===
The station was comprehensively redeveloped between 2009 and 2017 with the rebuilding of all platforms, the addition of two major new street-level entrances, and changes to passenger concourses and retail facilities. The Shard opened next to the station in 2012. It included a new entrance and roof for the terminal level concourse, and a larger bus station was constructed in front of the building.

This was followed by a major transformation programme known as &quot;Masterplan&quot;, linked to the Thameslink programme.

Work began in 2012 with the terminal platforms adjacent to St Thomas Street, reducing the number from nine to six and extending them to accommodate longer 12-car trains. Through platforms were increased from six to nine, all of which catered for 12-car trains. In the redeveloped station, Charing Cross services were assigned four new dedicated platforms (6, 7, 8 and 9), and Thameslink services to platforms 4 and 5. The existing platforms for Cannon Street services on the north side of the station were also rebuilt.

During the works, Charing Cross trains did not call at the station for most of 2015–16 as the platforms were rebuilt, followed by Cannon Street trains from 2016 to 2017. Thameslink services to/from the Thameslink core did not stop between 2015 and May 2018, when an all day service with significantly enhanced frequency began as the programme of works was completed.
As part of the rebuilding works, the listed northern wall of the terminus train-shed was demolished and replaced with a new retaining wall, and the listed bays of the roof over the terminating platforms were dismantled and stored. Each of the rebuilt platforms has its own full length platform canopy.

The footbridge dating from the 1970s that linked platforms for passenger interchange was also demolished, replaced by an interchange concourse underneath the platforms accessed by lift, stairs and escalator. This required the demolition of brick vaults between Stainer and Weston Streets, which were pedestrianised and became part of the new concourse. A wider route was created through the Western Arcade to Joiner Street and the underground station by relocating existing shops in to renovated barrel vaults. Two major new street level entrances were opened to the south on St Thomas Street, and to the north, on Tooley Street. This required demolishing the 1893 SER office building.

The refurbished station was officially opened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge on 9 May 2018. The total estimated value of the project was around £1 billion. In July 2019, the refurbished station made the shortlist for the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.

In 2020 the Thameslink lines at London Bridge were one of the few locations in the UK to use a digital signalling system.

In October 2022 a rescued Victorian-era church pipe organ, nicknamed &quot;Henry&quot;, was installed on the station concourse. The organ is free for public use.

==National Rail station==

The station&#x27;s platform configuration is:
* Platforms 1, 2 and 3 serve trains to/from and southeast London and Kent.
* Platforms 4 and 5 serve Thameslink trains between the Brighton main line and the Thameslink core via .
* Platforms 6–9 serve trains to/from to southeast London, Kent and East Sussex.
* Platforms 10–15 are terminal platforms, which serve mainly Southern services toward south London and the south coast

All platforms are bi-directional, trains to London Charing Cross can run from platforms 3-9, as well as trains to London Blackfriars and the Thameslink core. Trains to London Cannon Street can also depart from platform 4 if necessary.

The platforms are linked together by a large street-level concourse, offering a ticket office, retail facilities and waiting areas, with entrances on St Thomas Street and Tooley Street. In addition, an upper level entrance gives direct access to platforms 10–15.

===Services===
London Bridge is one of the busiest stations in the UK, with an estimated 63.1 million passenger entries/exits in 2019/20. However, as with other stations, patronage dropped dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated usage figure fell 78% in 2020/21 to 13.8 million, although it rose in the ranking by one place to the third busiest in the country, behind and Victoria, both also in London.

==London Underground station==
The Underground station is between Southwark and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and between Borough and Bank on the Bank branch of the Northern line. In , it was the station on the network with million users. It is the only station on the London Underground network with &quot;London&quot; in its name (while the NR termini are named, for instance, &quot;London Waterloo&quot; the Underground station is simply named &quot;Waterloo&quot;).

There are two platforms on each line and two main sets of escalators to and from the Tooley Street ticket hall. All four platforms are directly accessible from the Borough High Street entrance/exit. There is an emergency exit to Joiner Street.

===Northern line===
The first underground station at London Bridge was part of the second section of the City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR). The company had been formed on 28 July 1884 with the intention of constructing a line under the Thames from to Stockwell via Elephant and Castle and Kennington, which opened on 18 December 1890. No station was provided at London Bridge; the first station south of the river was at Borough. King William Street was found to be badly placed owing to a steep incline towards the station from underneath the Thames, which limited its capacity.

When the decision was made to extend the C&amp;SLR northwards to Moorgate, a new pair of tunnels was constructed from north of Borough station on a new alignment providing a more convenient route and the opportunity to open a station at London Bridge. The tunnels to King William Street and the station were closed and the extension and London Bridge station opened on 25 February 1900.

The station entrance was originally at Three Castles House on the corner of London Bridge Street and Railway Approach, but has since been moved to Borough High Street and Tooley Street. The original entrance remained standing until March 2013 when it was demolished.
In the aftermath of the King&#x27;s Cross fire in 1987, an independent report recommended that London Underground investigate &quot;passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action&quot;. As a consequence, the congested Northern line platforms were rebuilt during the late 1990s, increasing the platform and circulation areas for the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension.

The station is arranged for right-hand running because it is in a stretch of the Northern line (from just south of Borough to just south of ) where the northbound line is to the east of the southbound, instead of to the west.

===Jubilee line===
The Jubilee line station is between and . It opened on 7 October 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension, although trains had been running through non-stop from the previous month. It took months of major engineering works to relocate buried services in the surrounding streets to enable the Jubilee line&#x27;s construction. A new ticket hall was created in the arches under the main-line station, with entrances at Joiner Street and Borough High Street.

During excavations a variety of Roman remains were found, including pottery and fragments of mosaics; some of these are now on display in the station. The Jubilee line platforms have been fitted with platform screen doors in common with all other below-ground stations on the extension.

There is a facing crossover to the west of the station enabling trains to terminate here.

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 17, 21, 35, 43, 47, 133, 141, 149, 343, 344, 381, 388 and night routes N21, N133, N199, N343 and N381 serve the station and bus station.

==Accidents and incidents==

There have been several recorded accidents at London Bridge station, though relatively few of these have caused fatalities. The most serious accidents were:
* On 1 February 1884, the 12:05 pm London Bridge to Victoria, hauled by LB&amp;SCR Terrier No.71 &quot;Wapping&quot;, collided with a D1 tank which was fouling the exit from the platform. Two carriages derailed.
* On 27 November 1895, a local train hauled by LB&amp;SCR Terrier No. 70 &quot;Poplar&quot; collided with the buffer stops.
* In August 1926, a F1 class locomotive overran the buffers and crashed into a brewery.
* On 9 July 1928, B2X class locomotive No. B210 was in a sidelong collision with an electric multiple unit after the driver of B210 misread signals. Two people were killed and nine were injured, six seriously.
* On 23 January 1948, a train formed of a 6PAN and a 6PUL unit, which formed that day&#x27;s 7:30 am service from coupled with the 8:50 am from Seaford, was allowed to draw up to the inner home signal, where it should have stopped. Instead, it overran the signal and collided at a speed of between with an empty stock which had formed the 8:20 am from and was waiting to depart London Bridge&#x27;s platform 14 for . This train was formed of two 6PAN units. The train that was struck was forced through the buffers and demolished a bookstall. Two train crew and one passenger were killed and 34 people were injured.
* On 11 April 1989, a passenger train arriving from collided with the buffers. Six people were injured.
* On 28 February 1992, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded at the station, injuring 29 people.
* On 3 June 2017, the station was closed for several hours during a terrorist attack on London Bridge and in nearby Borough Market.
* On 29 November 2019, the station was closed for several hours during a terrorist attack on London Bridge where two people were fatally stabbed.

<doc id="209311" wikidata="Q1431451" url="?curid=209311" title="H engine">
<text>An H engine is a piston engine comprising two separate flat engines (complete with separate crankshafts), most often geared to a common output shaft. The name &quot;H engine&quot; is due to the engine blocks resembling a letter &quot;H&quot; when viewed from the front. The most successful &quot;H&quot; engine in this form was the Napier Dagger and its derivatives. The name was also applied to engines of the same basic layout, but rotated through 90 degrees—most famously the Napier Sabre series. A variation on the &quot;H&quot; theme were the Fairey Prince (H-16) &amp; Fairey P.24 Monarch, where the two engines retained separate drives, driving Contra-rotating propellers through separate concentric shafts. Although successful, they only existed in prototype form.

The H engine is a relatively rare layout, with its main use being in aircraft engines during the 1930s and 1940s. The 1966 Lotus 43 Formula One car used a BRM 16-cylinder H engine, and an 8-cylinder H engine was used for powerboat racing in the 1970s.

== Design ==

The benefits of an H engine are the ability to share common parts with the flat engine upon which it is based, and the good engine balance which results in less vibration (which is difficult to achieve in many other types of four-cylinder engines).

However, H engines are relatively heavy and have a high centre of gravity. The latter is not only due to the second crankshaft being located near the top of the engine, but also the engine must be high enough off the ground to allow clearance underneath for the exhaust pipes.

The U engine layout uses a similar concept, placing two straight engines side-by-side.

=== Formula One racing engines ===
The British Racing Motors (BRM) H-16 Formula One engine won the 1966 US Grand Prix in a Lotus 43 driven by Jim Clark. It was also used by the unsuccessful 1966 BRM P83 car driven by Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart. As a racing-car engine it was hampered by a high center of gravity, and it was heavy and complex, with gear-driven twin overhead cams for each of four cylinder heads, two gear-coupled crankshafts, and mechanical fuel injection.

=== Motorcycle engines ===

The Brough Superior Golden Dream motorcycle, first shown in 1938. A 1,000 cc H-4 design and a few units were produced in early 1939. Any development planned was interrupted by World War II and subsequent years of austerity.

Wooler built a motorcycle prototype with a similar configuration to the Brough Superior Golden Dream and exhibited it at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1948 and again in 1951. This was replaced by a flat-four engined prototype at the 1953 show.

=== Powerboat racing engines ===

German firm Konig, who specialised in racing outboard motors, built a few 1000cc H-8s in the 1970s, which were basically two of their VC500 flat fours mounted one above the other, with the direction of rotation reversed on one of them. Each half of the engine was a water cooled 2-stroke with rotating disc valve driven by a toothed belt via two 45/90 degree pulleys, plus two siamesed expansion chamber exhausts, fed by two single choke carbs. Both cylinders at each end of each engine fired at the same time, hence the siamesed exhausts for each pair.

== Other engines named &quot;H&quot; ==
Subaru has marketed its flat-four and flat-six engines as &quot;H4&quot; and &quot;H6&quot; respectively. The letter &quot;H&quot; in this case refers to &quot;horizontally-opposed&quot;, an alternative term for flat engines; these engines can also be said to look like a &quot;H&quot; or conjoined &quot;H&quot;s, albeit from the top and in schematic form.

The Saab H engine is a straight-four engine produced from 1981 to 2009. The letter &quot;H&quot; represents &quot;high compression&quot;.
