<doc id="199690" wikidata="Q6624535" url="?curid=199690" title="List of jazz bassists">
<text>This list of jazz bassists includes performers of the double bass and since the 1950s, and particularly in the jazz subgenre of jazz fusion which developed in the 1970s, electric bass players.
The most influential jazz double bassists from the 1940s and 1950s include bassist Jimmy Blanton (1918–1942) (a member of the Duke Ellington band); Oscar Pettiford (1922–1960), who is considered by bassists and musicologists to be the first bebop bassist and the transitional link from the swing era to bebop. Ray Brown (1926–2002), known for backing a number of beboppers, including alto virtuoso Charlie Parker; Milt Hinton (1910–2000) and George Duvivier (1920–1985), who are the two most recorded bassists in jazz history, their respective careers spanning many eras and genres; a singular creative force was Wilbur Ware (1923–1979) legendary bassist with Monk and others, hard bop bassist Ron Carter (born 1937); and Paul Chambers (1935–1969), a member of the Miles Davis Quintet.
In the experimental post 1960s eras, which saw the development of free jazz and jazz-rock fusion, some of the influential bassists included Charles Mingus (1922–1979) and free jazz and post-bop bassist Charlie Haden (1937–2014).

In the post-1970s era of jazz-rock fusion, the electric bass became an important jazz instrument; virtuoso Stanley Clarke (born 1951) played both the double bass and the electric bass. Fusion performer Jaco Pastorius (1951–1987) contributed to the development of a new approach to the fretless electric bass, adding a creative use of harmonics and chords, both while a member of the band Weather Report and in his solo recordings.

In the 1990s and 2000s, one of the new &quot;young lions&quot; for jazz bass was Christian McBride (born 1972).
In mid to late 2000s, another new &quot;young lion&quot; for jazz bass emerged: Miles Mosley (born 1980) a member of the acclaimed Los Angeles collective, the West Coast Get Down.

<text>[[jazz drumming|Jazz drummer]]s play percussion (predominantly the drum set) in jazz, jazz fusion, and other jazz subgenres such as latin jazz. The techniques and instrumentation of this type of performance have evolved over the 1900s, influenced by jazz at large and the individual drummers within it. Jazz required a method of playing percussion different from traditional European styles, one that was easily adaptable to the different rhythms of the new genre, fostering the creation of jazz drumming&#x27;s hybrid technique. As each period in the evolution of jazz—swing and bebop, for example—tended to have its own rhythmic style, jazz drumming continued to evolve along with the music. In the 1970s and 1980s, jazz drumming incorporated elements of rock and Latin styles.

<text>Carl Douglas McCoy (born 15 January 1963) is a British singer who is the frontman for the gothic rock band Fields of the Nephilim.

== Biography ==
McCoy frequently uses mystical and occult references in his lyrics. Samples of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s voice were featured on &quot;Elizium&quot;.

McCoy owns a graphics company, Sheerfaith, which has supplied art and design for all of his musical projects. Sheerfaith has also produced artwork for other projects, such as for the Storm Constantine book &quot;Hermetech&quot; and Andrew Collins&#x27; &quot;21st Century Grail&quot;. He is a 3D artist, a longtime user of LightWave 3D.

McCoy appeared as the nomad in the film &quot;Hardware&quot; (1990), directed by Richard Stanley, who had previously directed a number of videos for Fields of the Nephilim.

== Personal life ==
McCoy comes from a religious background; he grew up in England with his mother, who was a devout member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. McCoy would later deal with this, often critically, in many of his songs such as &quot;Chord of Souls&quot;. He has talked in interviews about his belief in paganism.

== Vocal style ==
McCoy&#x27;s vocal style has been described as sounding like he &#x27;gargles with gravel.&#x27; He attributes this to a childhood laryngeal burn: &quot;I only sang the way I sang because I burnt my throat when I was a kid. I got hot food stuck down there and my throat got singed. I couldn’t talk for four weeks, but the effects lasted forever!&quot;

<doc id="199701" wikidata="Q865760" url="?curid=199701" title="Type system">
<text>In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a &quot;type&quot; (for example, integer, floating point, string) to every &quot;term&quot; (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various language constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term. 

Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other data types, such as &quot;string&quot;, &quot;array of float&quot;, &quot;function returning boolean&quot;.

Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language&#x27;s original type syntax and grammar. 

The main purpose of a type system in a programming language is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs due to type errors. The given type system in question determines what constitutes a type error, but in general, the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values of which that operation does not make sense (validity errors). 

Type systems allow defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of both. 

Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, and providing a form of documentation.

== Usage overview ==
An example of a simple type system is that of the C language. The portions of a C program are the function definitions. One function is invoked by another function. 

The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of parameters that are passed to the function&#x27;s code. The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it. 

During a computer program&#x27;s execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function. The invoked function&#x27;s code accesses the values and makes use of them. 

If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function. 

The C compiler checks the types of the arguments passed to a function when it is called against the types of the parameters declared in the function&#x27;s definition. If the types do not match, the compiler throws a compile-time error or warning.

A compiler may also use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many C compilers the &quot;float&quot; data type, for example, is represented in 32 bits, in accord with the IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers. They will thus use floating-point-specific microprocessor operations on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).

The depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the &quot;typing&quot; of the language. A programming language may further associate an operation with various resolutions for each type, in the case of type polymorphism. Type theory is the study of type systems. The concrete types of some programming languages, such as integers and strings, depend on practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation, and language design.

== Fundamentals ==
Formally, type theory studies type systems. A programming language must have the opportunity to type check using the &quot;type system&quot; whether at compile time or runtime, manually annotated or automatically inferred. As Mark Manasse concisely put it:
Assigning a data type, termed &quot;typing&quot;, gives meaning to a sequence of bits such as a value in memory or some object such as a variable. The hardware of a general purpose computer is unable to discriminate between for example a memory address and an instruction code, or between a character, an integer, or a floating-point number, because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might &quot;mean&quot;. Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that to the programmable hardware to form a &quot;symbolic system&quot; composed of that hardware and some program.

A program associates each value with at least one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many subtypes. Other entities, such as objects, modules, communication channels, and dependencies can become associated with a type. Even a type can become associated with a type. An implementation of a &quot;type system&quot; could in theory associate identifications called &quot;data type&quot; (a type of a value), &quot;class&quot; (a type of an object), and &quot;kind&quot; (a &quot;type of a type&quot;, or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing can go through, on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.

When a programming language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this comes at a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.

A programming language compiler can also implement a &quot;dependent type&quot; or an &quot;effect system&quot;, which enables even more program specifications to be verified by a type checker. Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual &quot;region&quot; of code is associated with an &quot;effect&quot; component describing &quot;what&quot; is being done &quot;with what&quot;, and enabling for example to &quot;throw&quot; an error report. Thus the symbolic system may be a &quot;type and effect system&quot;, which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.
Whether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system renders program behavior illegal if it falls outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:
* &quot;Abstraction&quot; (or &quot;modularity&quot;) – Types enable programmers to think at a higher level than the bit or byte, not bothering with low-level implementation. For example, programmers can begin to think of a string as a set of character values instead of as an array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express interfaces between two of &quot;any&quot;-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.
* &quot;Documentation&quot; – In more expressive type systems, types can serve as a form of documentation clarifying the intent of the programmer. For example, if a programmer declares a function as returning a timestamp type, this documents the function when the timestamp type can be explicitly declared deeper in the code to be an integer type.

Advantages provided by compiler-specified type systems include:
* &quot;Optimization&quot; – Static type-checking may provide useful compile-time information. For example, if a type requires that a value must align in memory at a multiple of four bytes, the compiler may be able to use more efficient machine instructions.
* &quot;Safety&quot; – A type system enables the compiler to detect meaningless or invalid code. For example, we can identify an expression codice_1 as invalid, when the rules do not specify how to divide an integer by a string. Strong typing offers more safety, but cannot guarantee complete &quot;type safety&quot;.

===Type errors===
A type error occurs when an operation receives a different type of data than it expected. For example, a type error would happen if a line of code divides two integers, and is passed a string of letters instead of an integer. It is an unintended condition which might manifest in multiple stages of a program&#x27;s development. Thus a facility for detection of the error is needed in the type system. In some languages, such as Haskell, for which type inference is automated, lint might be available to its compiler to aid in the detection of error.

Type safety contributes to program correctness, but might only guarantee correctness at the cost of making the type checking itself an undecidable problem (as in the Halting problem). In a &quot;type system&quot; with automated type checking, a program may prove to run incorrectly yet produce no compiler errors. Division by zero is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker which only runs at compile time does not scan for division by zero in most languages; that division would surface as a runtime error. To prove the absence of these defects, other kinds of formal methods, collectively known as program analyses, are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing &quot;the type of non-zero numbers&quot;). In addition, software testing is an empirical method for finding errors that such a type checker would not detect.

== Type checking ==
The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types—&quot;type checking&quot;—may occur at compile time (a static check) or at run-time (a dynamic check).

If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly, more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information, one can refer to the process as &quot;strongly typed; i&quot;f not, as &quot;weakly typed&quot;. 

The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.

=== Static type checking ===

Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program&#x27;s text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.

Static type checking can be considered a limited form of program verification (see type safety), and in a type-safe language, can also be considered an optimization. If a compiler can prove that a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.

Static type checking for Turing-complete languages is inherently conservative. That is, if a type system is both &quot;sound&quot; (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs) and &quot;decidable&quot; (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), then it must be &quot;incomplete&quot; (meaning there are correct programs, which are also rejected, even though they do not encounter runtime errors). For example, consider a program containing the code:

:codice_2

Even if the expression codice_3 always evaluates to codice_4 at run-time, most type checkers will reject the program as ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the codice_5 branch will not be taken. Consequently, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.

A number of useful and common programming language features cannot be checked statically, such as downcasting. Thus, many languages will have both static and dynamic type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and dynamic checks verify the rest.

Many languages with static type checking provide a way to bypass the type checker. Some languages allow programmers to choose between static and dynamic type safety. For example, historically C# declares variables statically, but C# 4.0 introduces the codice_6 keyword, which is used to declare variables to be checked dynamically at runtime. Other languages allow writing code that is not type-safe; for example, in C, programmers can freely cast a value between any two types that have the same size, effectively subverting the type concept.

=== Dynamic type checking and runtime type information ===
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a &quot;type tag&quot; (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) can also be used to implement dynamic dispatch, late binding, downcasting, reflective programming (reflection), and similar features.

Most type-safe languages include some form of dynamic type checking, even if they also have a static type checker. The reason for this is that many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. If the program tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as downcasting, then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.

By definition, dynamic type checking may cause a program to fail at runtime. In some programming languages, it is possible to anticipate and recover from these failures. In others, type-checking errors are considered fatal.

Programming languages that include dynamic type checking but not static type checking are often called &quot;dynamically typed programming languages&quot;.

=== Combining static and dynamic type checking ===
Some languages allow both static and dynamic typing. For example, Java and some other ostensibly statically typed languages support downcasting types to their subtypes, querying an object to discover its dynamic type and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. Another example is C++ RTTI. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different &#x27;kinds&#x27; of data, such as disjoint unions, runtime polymorphism, and variant types. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to dynamic typing implementations. 

Objects in object-oriented languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) is equal to either the object&#x27;s run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the Liskov substitution principle, which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept is also known as subsumption or subtype polymorphism. In some languages subtypes may also possess covariant or contravariant return types and argument types respectively.

Certain languages, for example Clojure, Common Lisp, or Cython are dynamically type checked by default, but allow programs to opt into static type checking by providing optional annotations. One reason to use such hints would be to optimize the performance of critical sections of a program. This is formalized by gradual typing. The programming environment &quot;DrRacket&quot;, a pedagogic environment based on Lisp, and a precursor of the language Racket is also soft-typed.

Conversely, as of version 4.0, the C# language provides a way to indicate that a variable should not be statically type checked. A variable whose type is codice_6 will not be subject to static type checking. Instead, the program relies on runtime type information to determine how the variable may be used.

In Rust, the type provides dynamic typing of types.

=== Static and dynamic type checking in practice ===
The choice between static and dynamic typing requires certain trade-offs.

Static typing can find type errors reliably at compile time, which increases the reliability of the delivered program. However, programmers disagree over how commonly type errors occur, resulting in further disagreements over the proportion of those bugs that are coded that would be caught by appropriately representing the designed types in code. Static typing advocates believe programs are more reliable when they have been well type-checked, whereas dynamic-typing advocates point to distributed code that has proven reliable and to small bug databases. The value of static typing increases as the strength of the type system is increased. Advocates of dependent typing, implemented in languages such as Dependent ML and Epigram, have suggested that almost all bugs can be considered type errors, if the types used in a program are properly declared by the programmer or correctly inferred by the compiler.

Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use (which is necessary for static verification, either through declaration or inference) it can produce optimized machine code. Some dynamically typed languages such as Common Lisp allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason.

By contrast, dynamic typing may allow compilers to run faster and interpreters to dynamically load new code, because changes to source code in dynamically typed languages may result in less checking to perform and less code to revisit. This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.

Statically typed languages that lack type inference (such as C and Java prior to version 10) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This can serve as added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler to prevent it from drifting out of synchrony, and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include Haskell, Scala, OCaml, F#, Swift, and to a lesser extent C# and C++), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.

Dynamic typing allows constructs that some (simple) static type checking would reject as illegal. For example, &quot;eval&quot; functions, which execute arbitrary data as code, become possible. An &quot;eval&quot; function is possible with static typing, but requires advanced uses of algebraic data types. Further, dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code and prototyping, such as allowing a placeholder data structure (mock object) to be transparently used in place of a full data structure (usually for the purposes of experimentation and testing).

Dynamic typing typically allows duck typing (which enables easier code reuse). Many languages with static typing also feature duck typing or other mechanisms like generic programming that also enable easier code reuse.

Dynamic typing typically makes metaprogramming easier to use. For example, C++ templates are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent Ruby or Python code since C++ has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more boilerplate code for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as metaclasses and introspection are often harder to use in statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to generate new types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by dynamic programming languages; many of these are dynamically typed, although &quot;dynamic typing&quot; need not be related to &quot;dynamic programming languages&quot;.

=== Strong and weak type systems ===
Languages are often colloquially referred to as &quot;strongly typed&quot; or &quot;weakly typed&quot;. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot;.

=== Type safety and memory safety ===
A third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language is by the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists use the term &quot;type-safe language&quot; to describe languages that do not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.

Computer scientists use the term &quot;memory-safe language&quot; (or just &quot;safe language&quot;) to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will check array bounds, or else statically guarantee (i.e., at compile time before execution) that array accesses out of the array boundaries will cause compile-time and perhaps runtime errors.

Consider the following program of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe:
var x := 5; 
var y := &quot;37&quot;; 
var z := x + y; 
In this example, the variable will have the value 42. Although this may not be what the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number (e.g. &quot;Hello World&quot;), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation. This is for languages where the type system is not sufficiently advanced to precisely specify the validity of operations on all possible operands. But if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.

Now consider a similar example in C:
int x = 5;
char y[] = &quot;37&quot;;
char* z = x + y;
printf(&quot;%c\n&quot;, *z);
In this example will point to a memory address five characters beyond , equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by . This is memory that the program is not expected to access. In C terms this is simply undefined behaviour and the program may do anything; with a simple compiler it might actually print whatever byte is stored after the string &quot;37&quot;. As this example shows, C is not memory-safe. As arbitrary data was assumed to be a character, it is also not a type-safe language.

In general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.

=== Variable levels of type checking ===
Some languages allow different levels of checking to apply to different regions of code. Examples include:
* The codice_8 directive in JavaScript and Perl applies stronger checking.
* The codice_9 in PHP on a per-file basis allows only a variable of exact type of the type declaration will be accepted, or a codice_10 will be thrown.
* The codice_11 in VB.NET allows the compiler to require a conversion between objects.

Additional tools such as lint and IBM Rational Purify can also be used to achieve a higher level of strictness.

=== Optional type systems ===
It has been proposed, chiefly by Gilad Bracha, that the choice of type system be made independent of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be &quot;plugged&quot; into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code more fragile. The requirement that the type system does not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.

Optional typing is related to, but distinct from, gradual typing. While both typing disciplines can be used to perform static analysis of code (static typing), optional type systems do not enforce type safety at runtime (dynamic typing).

== Polymorphism and types ==
The term &quot;polymorphism&quot; refers to the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or to the ability of different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an associative array once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism &quot;generic programming&quot;. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of abstraction, modularity and (in some cases) subtyping.

== Specialized type systems ==
Many type systems have been created that are specialized for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for out-of-band static program analysis. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal type theory and are only available as part of prototype research systems.

The following table gives an overview over type theoretic concepts that are used in specialized type systems.
The names range over terms and the names formula_1 range over types.
The following notation will be used:
* formula_2 means that formula_3 has type formula_4;
* formula_5 is that application of formula_3 on formula_7;
* formula_8 (resp. formula_9) describes the type which results from replacing all occurrences of the type variable (resp. term variable ) in formula_10 by the type (resp. term ).

=== Dependent types ===
Dependent types are based on the idea of using scalars or values to more precisely describe the type of some other value. For example, formula_11 might be the type of a formula_12 matrix. We can then define typing rules such as the following rule for matrix multiplication:

: formula_13

where , , are arbitrary positive integer values. A variant of ML called Dependent ML has been created based on this type system, but because type checking for conventional dependent types is undecidable, not all programs using them can be type-checked without some kind of limits. Dependent ML limits the sort of equality it can decide to Presburger arithmetic.

Other languages such as Epigram make the value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general proof of decidability is undecidable, so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy way out in the form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an infinite loop when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.

=== Linear types ===
Linear types, based on the theory of linear logic, and closely related to uniqueness types, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large immutable values such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as codice_12) can be optimized &quot;under the hood&quot; into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating referential transparency. They are also used in the prototype operating system Singularity for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory in order to prevent race conditions. The Clean language (a Haskell-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.

=== Intersection types ===
Intersection types are types describing values that belong to &quot;both&quot; of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting &quot;either&quot; signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.

Intersection types are useful for describing overloaded function types: for example, if &quot; → &quot; is the type of functions taking an integer argument and returning an integer, and &quot; → &quot; is the type of functions taking a float argument and returning a float, then the intersection of these two types can be used to describe functions that do one or the other, based on what type of input they are given. Such a function could be passed into another function expecting an &quot; → &quot; function safely; it simply would not use the &quot; → &quot; functionality.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the intersection of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the most derived type. The intersection of sibling types is empty.

The Forsythe language includes a general implementation of intersection types. A restricted form is refinement types.

=== Union types ===
Union types are types describing values that belong to &quot;either&quot; of two types. For example, in C, the signed char has a -128 to 127 range, and the unsigned char has a 0 to 255 range, so the union of these two types would have an overall &quot;virtual&quot; range of -128 to 255 that may be used partially depending on which union member is accessed. Any function handling this union type would have to deal with integers in this complete range. More generally, the only valid operations on a union type are operations that are valid on &quot;both&quot; types being unioned. C&#x27;s &quot;union&quot; concept is similar to union types, but is not typesafe, as it permits operations that are valid on &quot;either&quot; type, rather than &quot;both&quot;. Union types are important in program analysis, where they are used to represent symbolic values whose exact nature (e.g., value or type) is not known.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the union of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the ancestor type. The union of sibling types is a subtype of their common ancestor (that is, all operations permitted on their common ancestor are permitted on the union type, but they may also have other valid operations in common).

=== Existential types ===
Existential types are frequently used in connection with record types to represent modules and abstract data types, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface. For example, the type &quot;T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }&quot; describes a module interface that has a data member named &quot;a&quot; of type &quot;X&quot; and a function named &quot;f&quot; that takes a parameter of the &quot;same&quot; type &quot;X&quot; and returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); }
* floatT = { a: float; f: (float → int); }

These types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T. Given a value &quot;t&quot; of type &quot;T&quot;, we know that &quot;t.f(t.a)&quot; is well-typed, regardless of what the abstract type &quot;X&quot; is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to a particular implementation, while clients that use only values of the interface type—the existential type—are isolated from these choices.

In general it&#x27;s impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type ∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its intended type, e.g.:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); } as ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }

Although abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for quite some time, it wasn&#x27;t until 1988 that John C. Mitchell and Gordon Plotkin established the formal theory under the slogan: &quot;Abstract [data] types have existential type&quot;. The theory is a second-order typed lambda calculus similar to System F, but with existential instead of universal quantification.

=== Gradual typing ===
In a type system with Gradual typing, variables may be assigned a type either at compile-time (which is static typing), or at run-time (which is dynamic typing). This allows software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language. Gradual typing uses a special type named &quot;dynamic&quot; to represent statically unknown types; gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called &quot;consistency&quot; that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.

== Explicit or implicit declaration and inference ==
Many static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require &quot;type declarations&quot;: the programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskell&#x27;s, perform &quot;type inference&quot;: the compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function that adds and together, the compiler can infer that and must be numbers—since addition is only defined for numbers. Thus, any call to elsewhere in the program that specifies a non-numeric type (such as a string or list) as an argument would signal an error.

Numerical and string constants and expressions in code can and often do imply type in a particular context. For example, an expression might imply a type of floating-point, while might imply a list of integers—typically an array.

Type inference is in general possible, if it is computable in the type system in question. Moreover, even if inference is not computable in general for a given type system, inference is often possible for a large subset of real-world programs. Haskell&#x27;s type system, a version of Hindley–Milner, is a restriction of System Fω to so-called rank-1 polymorphic types, in which type inference is computable. Most Haskell compilers allow arbitrary-rank polymorphism as an extension, but this makes type inference not computable. (Type checking is decidable, however, and rank-1 programs still have type inference; higher rank polymorphic programs are rejected unless given explicit type annotations.)

== Decision problems ==
A type system that assigns types to terms in type environments using typing rules is naturally associated with the decision problems of type checking, typability, and type inhabitation.

* Given a type environment formula_14, a term formula_15, and a type formula_10, decide whether the term formula_15 can be assigned the type formula_10 in the type environment.
* Given a term formula_15, decide whether there exists a type environment formula_14 and a type formula_10 such that the term formula_15 can be assigned the type formula_10 in the type environment formula_14.
* Given a type environment formula_14 and a type formula_10, decide whether there exists a term formula_15 that can be assigned the type formula_10 in the type environment.

== Unified type system ==
Some languages like C# or Scala have a unified type system. This means that all C# types including primitive types inherit from a single root object. Every type in C# inherits from the Object class. Some languages, like Java and Raku, have a root type but also have primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types. Raku automatically converts primitive types to objects when their methods are accessed.

== Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping ==
A type checker for a statically typed language must verify that the type of any expression is consistent with the type expected by the context in which that expression appears. For example, in an assignment statement of the form codice_13,
the inferred type of the expression &quot;codice_14&quot; must be consistent with the declared or inferred type of the variable codice_15. This notion of consistency, called &quot;compatibility&quot;, is specific to each programming language.

If the type of &quot;codice_14&quot; and the type of codice_15 are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are &quot;equal&quot; (or &quot;equivalent&quot;). Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different &quot;equational theories&quot; of types vary widely, two extreme cases being &quot;structural type systems&quot;, in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and &quot;nominative type systems&quot;, in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type (&quot;i.e.&quot;, types must have the same &quot;name&quot; in order to be equal).

In languages with subtyping, the compatibility relation is more complex: If codice_18 is a subtype of codice_19, then a value of type codice_18 can be used in a context where one of type codice_19 is expected (covariant), even if the reverse is not true. Like equivalence, the subtype relation is defined differently for each programming language, with many variations possible. The presence of parametric or ad hoc polymorphism in a language may also have implications for type compatibility.

<text>Germantown is a historic unincorporated rural community in Fauquier County, Virginia, United States. It is located in and around current-day C. M. Crockett Park, which contains the popular local fishing destination of Germantown Lake. Chief Justice John Marshall was born in Germantown. Archeological sites relating to the settlement are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Many inhabitants from Germantown came from Germany, e.g. Siegen, east of Bonn. In 1718 twelve German emigrant families left the employ of Governor Alexander Spotswood and the mining settlement of Germanna for a parcel of land in modern southern Fauquier County. The parcel was divided equally between the settlers: Melchior Brombach, Joseph Coons, Harman Fishback, John Fishback, Peter Hitt, Jacob Holtzclaw, John Hoffman, John Kemper, John Joseph Martin, Jacob Rector, John Spilman, and Tillman Weaver. All the homes were built on the southern side of Licking Run which flowed through each farm.

Each landowner also donated 10 areas to form a glebe where the first church, parsonage, and school in Fauquier County were constructed. German Rolling Road was constructed by the settlers to enable them to reach the market of Falmouth. A saw mill and a grist mill also operated in this town as well. The mill pond lies under Germantown Lake, a 109 acre lake that was created in 1985, and which was named in honor of the settlement. This is where future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States John Marshall was born in 1755.

By the time of the American Revolution the prosperous settlers had all acquired other land and the settlement was defunct. Therefore, Germantown is sometimes called a lost German colony.

<text>A string literal or anonymous string is a literal for a string value in the source code of a computer program. Modern programming languages commonly use a quoted sequence of characters, formally &quot;bracketed delimiters&quot;, as in codice_1, where , codice_2 is a string literal with value codice_3. Methods such as escape sequences can be used to avoid the problem of delimiter collision (issues with brackets) and allow the delimiters to be embedded in a string. There are many alternate notations for specifying string literals especially in complicated cases. The exact notation depends on the programming language in question. Nevertheless, there are general guidelines that most modern programming languages follow.

== Syntax ==

=== Bracketed delimiters ===
Most modern programming languages use bracket delimiters (also balanced delimiters)
to specify string literals. Double quotations are the most common quoting delimiters used:

 &quot;Hi There!&quot;

An empty string is literally written by a pair of quotes with no character at all in between:

Some languages either allow or mandate the use of single quotations instead of double quotations (the string must begin and end with the same kind of quotation mark and the type of quotation mark may or may not give slightly different semantics):

 &#x27;Hi There!&#x27;

These quotation marks are &quot;unpaired&quot; (the same character is used as an opener and a closer), which is a hangover from the typewriter technology which was the precursor of the earliest computer input and output devices.

In terms of regular expressions, a basic quoted string literal is given as:
This means that a string literal is written as: &quot;a quote, followed by zero, one, or more non-quote characters, followed by a quote&quot;. In practice this is often complicated by escaping, other delimiters, and excluding newlines.

==== Paired delimiters ====
A number of languages provide for paired delimiters, where the opening and closing delimiters are different. These also often allow nested strings, so delimiters can be embedded, so long as they are paired, but still result in delimiter collision for embedding an unpaired closing delimiter. Examples include PostScript, which uses parentheses, as in codice_4 and m4, which uses the backtick (`) as the starting delimiter, and the apostrophe (&#x27;) as the ending delimiter. Tcl allows both quotes (for interpolated strings) and braces (for raw strings), as in codice_5 or codice_6; this derives from the single quotations in Unix shells and the use of braces in C for compound statements, since blocks of code is in Tcl syntactically the same thing as string literals – that the delimiters are paired is essential for making this feasible.

The Unicode character set includes paired (separate opening and closing) versions of both single and double quotations:
 “Hi There!”
 ‘Hi There!’
 „Hi There!“
 «Hi There!»

These, however, are rarely used, as many programming languages will not register them (one exception is the paired double quotations which can be used in Visual Basic .NET). Unpaired marks are preferred for compatibility, as they are easier to type on a wide range of keyboards, and so even in languages where they are permitted, many projects forbid their use for source code.

=== Whitespace delimiters ===
String literals might be ended by newlines.

One example is MediaWiki template parameters.


There might be special syntax for multi-line strings.

In YAML, string literals may be specified by the relative positioning of whitespace and
indentation.

 - title: An example multi-line string in YAML
 body : |
 This is a multi-line string.
 &quot;special&quot; metacharacters may
 appear here. The extent of this string is
 represented by indentation.
=== No delimiters ===

Some programming languages, such as Perl and PHP, allow string literals without any delimiters in some contexts. In the following Perl program, for example, codice_7, codice_8, and codice_9 are string literals, but are unquoted:

 %map = (red =&gt; 0x00f, blue =&gt; 0x0f0, green =&gt; 0xf00); 

Perl treats non-reserved sequences of alphanumeric characters as string literals in most contexts. For example, the following two lines of Perl are equivalent:

$y = &quot;x&quot;;
$y = x;
=== Declarative notation ===

In the original FORTRAN programming language (for example), string literals were written in so-called &quot;Hollerith&quot; notation, where a decimal count of the number of characters was followed by the letter H, and then the characters of the string:

 35HAn example Hollerith string literal

This declarative notation style is contrasted with bracketed delimiter quoting, because it does
not require the use of balanced &quot;bracketed&quot; characters on either side of the string.

Advantages:
* eliminates text searching (for the delimiter character) and therefore requires significantly less overhead
* avoids the problem of delimiter collision
* enables the inclusion of metacharacters that might otherwise be mistaken as commands
* can be used for quite effective data compression of plain text strings

Drawbacks:
* this type of notation is error-prone if used as manual entry by programmers
* special care is needed in case of multi byte encodings
This is however not a drawback when the prefix is generated by an algorithm as is most likely the case.

=== Constructor functions ===

C++ has two styles of string, one inherited from C (delimited by codice_10), and the safer codice_11 in the C++ Standard Library. The codice_11 class is frequently used in the same way a string literal would be used in other languages, and is often preferred to C-style strings for its greater flexibility and safety. But it comes with a performance penalty for string literals, as codice_11 usually allocates memory dynamically, and must copy the C-style string literal to it at run time.

Before C++11, there was no literal for C++ strings (C++11 allows codice_14 with the codice_15 at the end of the literal), so the normal constructor syntax was used, for example:
* 

all of which have the same interpretation. Since C++11, there is also new constructor syntax:
* 

== Delimiter collision ==
When using quoting, if one wishes to represent the delimiter itself in a string literal, one runs into the problem of &quot;delimiter collision.&quot; For example, if the delimiter is a double quote, one cannot simply represent a double quote itself by the literal codice_16 as the second quote is interpreted as the end of the string literal, not as the value of the string, and similarly one cannot write codice_17 as the middle quoted portion is instead interpreted as outside of quotes. There are various solutions, the most general-purpose of which is using escape sequences, such as codice_18 or codice_19, but there are many other solutions.

Paired quotes, such as braces in Tcl, allow nested strings, such as codice_20 but do not otherwise solve the problem of delimiter collision, since an unbalanced closing delimiter cannot simply be included, as in codice_21.

===Doubling up===
A number of languages, including Pascal, BASIC, DCL, Smalltalk, SQL, J, and Fortran, avoid delimiter collision by &quot;doubling up&quot; on the quotation marks that are intended to be part of the string literal
itself:
 &#x27;This Pascal string&quot;contains two apostrophes&quot;&#x27;
 &quot;I said, &quot;&quot;Can you hear me?&quot;&quot;&quot;
===Dual quoting===
Some languages, such as Fortran, Modula-2, JavaScript, Python, and PHP allow more than one quoting delimiter; in the case of two possible delimiters, this is known as dual quoting. Typically, this consists of allowing the programmer to use either single quotations or double quotations interchangeably – each literal must use one or the other.
 &quot;This is John&#x27;s apple.&quot;
 &#x27;I said, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;&#x27;
This does not allow having a single literal with both delimiters in it, however. This can be worked around by using several literals and using string concatenation:

 &#x27;I said, &quot;This is &#x27; + &quot;John&#x27;s&quot; + &#x27; apple.&quot;&#x27;

Python has string literal concatenation, so consecutive string literals are concatenated even without an operator, so this can be reduced to:

 &#x27;I said, &quot;This is &#x27;&quot;John&#x27;s&quot;&#x27; apple.&quot;&#x27;
===Delimiter quoting===

C++11 introduced so-called &quot;raw string literals&quot;. They consist, essentially of
:codice_22,
that is, after codice_23 the programmer can enter up to 16 characters except whitespace characters, parentheses, or backslash, which form the &quot;end-of-string-id&quot; (its purpose is to be repeated to signal the end of the string, &quot;eos id&quot; for short), then an opening parenthesis (to denote the end of the eos id) is required. Then follows the actual content of the literal: Any sequence characters may be used (except that it may not contain a closing parenthesis followed by the eos id followed a quote), and finally – to terminate the string – a closing parenthesis, the eos id, and a quote is required.
The simplest case of such a literal is with empty content and empty eos id: codice_24.
The eos id may itself contain quotes: is a valid literal (the eos id is codice_10 here.)
Escape sequences don&#x27;t work in raw string literals.

D supports a few quoting delimiters, with such strings starting with codice_26 plus an opening delimiter and ending with the respective closing delimiter and codice_10. Available delimiter pairs are codice_28, codice_29, codice_30, and codice_31; an unpaired non-identifier delimiter is its own closing delimiter. The paired delimiters nest, so that is a valid literal; an example with the non-nesting codice_32 character is .
Similar to C++11, D allows here-document-style literals with end-of-string ids:
:codice_33
In D, the &quot;end-of-string-id&quot; must be an identifier (alphanumeric characters).

In some programming languages, such as sh and Perl, there are different delimiters that are treated differently, such as doing string interpolation or not, and thus care must be taken when choosing which delimiter to use; see different kinds of strings, below.

===Multiple quoting===
A further extension is the use of &quot;multiple quoting&quot;, which allows the author to choose which characters should specify the bounds of a string literal.

For example, in Perl:

qq^I said, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;^
qq@I said, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;@
qq§I said, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;§
all produce the desired result. Although this notation is more flexible, few languages support it; other than Perl, Ruby (influenced by Perl) and C++11 also support these. A variant of multiple quoting is the use of here document-style strings.

Lua (as of 5.1) provides a limited form of multiple quoting, particularly to allow nesting of long comments or embedded strings. Normally one uses codice_34 and codice_35 to delimit literal strings (initial newline stripped, otherwise raw), but the opening brackets can include any number of equal signs, and only closing brackets with the same number of signs close the string. For example:

local ls = [=[
This notation can be used for Windows paths: 
local path = 


Multiple quoting is particularly useful with regular expressions that contain usual delimiters such as quotes, as this avoids needing to escape them. An early example is sed, where in the substitution command codice_36 the default slash codice_32 delimiters can be replaced by another character, as in codice_38 .

===Constructor functions===
Another option, which is rarely used in modern languages, is to use a function to construct a string, rather than representing it via a literal. This is generally not used in modern languages because the computation is done at run time, rather than at parse time.

For example, early forms of BASIC did not include escape sequences or any other workarounds listed here, and thus one instead was required to use the codice_39 function, which returns a string containing the character corresponding to its argument. In ASCII the quotation mark has the value 34, so to represent a string with quotes on an ASCII system one would write

&quot;I said, &quot; + CHR$(34) + &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; + CHR$(34)

In C, a similar facility is available via codice_40 and the codice_41 &quot;character&quot; format specifier, though in the presence of other workarounds this is generally not used:

char buffer[32];
snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, &quot;This is %cin quotes.%c&quot;, 34, 34);
These constructor functions can also be used to represent nonprinting characters, though escape sequences are generally used instead. A similar technique can be used in C++ with the codice_11 stringification operator.

== Escape sequences ==

Escape sequences are a general technique for representing characters that are otherwise difficult to represent directly, including delimiters, nonprinting characters (such as backspaces), newlines, and whitespace characters (which are otherwise impossible to distinguish visually), and have a long history. They are accordingly widely used in string literals, and adding an escape sequence (either to a single character or throughout a string) is known as escaping.

One character is chosen as a prefix to give encodings for characters that are difficult or impossible to include directly. Most commonly this is backslash; in addition to other characters, a key point is that backslash itself can be encoded as a double backslash codice_43 and for delimited strings the delimiter itself can be encoded by escaping, say by codice_44 for &quot;. A regular expression for such escaped strings can be given as follows, as found in the ANSI C specification:
meaning &quot;a quote; followed by zero or more of either an escaped character (backslash followed by something, possibly backslash or quote), or a non-escape, non-quote character; ending in a quote&quot; – the only issue is distinguishing the terminating quote from a quote preceded by a backslash, which may itself be escaped. Multiple characters can follow the backslash, such as codice_45, depending on the escaping scheme.

An escaped string must then itself be lexically analyzed, converting the escaped string into the unescaped string that it represents. This is done during the evaluation phase of the overall lexing of the computer language: the evaluator of the lexer of the overall language executes its own lexer for escaped string literals.

Among other things, it must be possible to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant, plus there must be some way to specify the escape character itself. Escape sequences are not always pretty or easy to use, so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. Escape sequences, however, solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret escape sequences. When an escape character is inside a string literal, it means &quot;this is the start of the escape sequence&quot;. Every escape sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an escape sequence varies. The escape character is on the top/left of the keyboard, but the editor will translate it, therefore it is not directly tapeable into a string. The backslash is used to represent the escape character in a string literal.

Many languages support the use of metacharacters inside string literals. Metacharacters have varying interpretations depending on the context and language, but are generally a kind of &#x27;processing command&#x27; for representing printing or nonprinting characters.

For instance, in a C string literal, if the backslash is followed by a letter such as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;n&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, then this represents a nonprinting &quot;backspace&quot;, &quot;newline&quot; or &quot;tab&quot; character respectively. Or if the backslash is followed by 1-3 octal digits, then this sequence is interpreted as representing the arbitrary code unit with the specified value in the literal&#x27;s encoding (for example, the corresponding ASCII code for an ASCII literal). This was later extended to allow more modern hexadecimal character code notation:

&quot;I said,\t\t\x22Can you hear me?\x22\n&quot;

Note: Not all sequences in the list are supported by all parsers, and there may be other escape sequences which are not in the list.

===Nested escaping===
When code in one programming language is embedded inside another, embedded strings may require multiple levels of escaping. This is particularly common in regular expressions and SQL query within other languages, or other languages inside shell scripts. This double-escaping is often difficult to read and author.

Incorrect quoting of nested strings can present a security vulnerability. Use of untrusted data, as in data fields of an SQL query, should use prepared statements to prevent a code injection attack. In PHP 2 through 5.3, there was a feature called magic quotes which automatically escaped strings (for convenience and security), but due to problems was removed from version 5.4 onward.

=== Raw strings ===
A few languages provide a method of specifying that a literal is to be processed without any language-specific interpretation. This avoids the need for escaping, and yields more legible strings.

Raw strings are particularly useful when a common character needs to be escaped, notably in regular expressions (nested as string literals), where backslash codice_46 is widely used, and in DOS/Windows paths, where backslash is used as a path separator. The profusion of backslashes is known as leaning toothpick syndrome, and can be reduced by using raw strings. Compare escaped and raw pathnames in C#:

 &quot;The Windows path is C:\\Foo\\Bar\\Baz\\&quot;
 @&quot;The Windows path is C:\Foo\Bar\Baz\&quot;

Extreme examples occur when these are combined – Uniform Naming Convention paths begin with codice_43, and thus an escaped regular expression matching a UNC name begins with 8 backslashes, codice_48, due to needing to escape the string and the regular expression. Using raw strings reduces this to 4 (escaping in the regular expression), as in C# codice_49.

In XML documents, CDATA sections allows use of characters such as &amp; and &lt; without an XML parser attempting to interpret them as part of the structure of the document itself. This can be useful when including literal text and scripting code, to keep the document well formed.

&lt;![CDATA[ if (path!=null &amp;&amp; depth&lt;2) { add(path); } ]]&gt;
==Multiline string literals==
In many languages, string literals can contain literal newlines, spanning several lines. Alternatively, newlines can be escaped, most often as codice_50. For example:

echo &#x27;foo
bar&#x27;

and

echo -e &quot;foo\nbar&quot;

are both valid bash, producing:
 foo
 bar
Languages that allow literal newlines include bash, Lua, Perl, PHP, R, and Tcl. In some other languages string literals cannot include newlines.

Two issues with multiline string literals are leading and trailing newlines, and indentation. If the initial or final delimiters are on separate lines, there are extra newlines, while if they are not, the delimiter makes the string harder to read, particularly for the first line, which is often indented differently from the rest. Further, the literal must be unindented, as leading whitespace is preserved – this breaks the flow of the code if the literal occurs within indented code.

The most common solution for these problems is here document-style string literals. Formally speaking, a here document is not a string literal, but instead a stream literal or file literal. These originate in shell scripts and allow a literal to be fed as input to an external command. The opening delimiter is codice_51 where codice_52 can be any word, and the closing delimiter is codice_52 on a line by itself, serving as a content boundary – the codice_54 is due to redirecting stdin from the literal. Due to the delimiter being arbitrary, these also avoid the problem of delimiter collision. These also allow initial tabs to be stripped via the variant syntax codice_55 though leading spaces are not stripped. The same syntax has since been adopted for multiline string literals in a number of languages, most notably Perl, and are also referred to as &quot;here documents,&quot; and retain the syntax, despite being strings and not involving redirection. As with other string literals, these can sometimes have different behavior specified, such as variable interpolation.

Python, whose usual string literals do not allow literal newlines, instead has a special form of string, designed for multiline literals, called &quot;triple quoting&quot;. These use a tripled delimiter, either codice_56 or codice_16. These literals are especially used for inline documentation, known as docstrings.

Tcl allows literal newlines in strings and has no special syntax to assist with multiline strings, though delimiters can be placed on lines by themselves and leading and trailing newlines stripped via codice_58, while codice_59 can be used to strip indentation.

==String literal concatenation==

A few languages provide string literal concatenation, where adjacent string literals are implicitly joined into a single literal at compile time. This is a feature of C, C++, D, Ruby, and Python, which copied it from C. Notably, this concatenation happens at compile time, during lexical analysis (as a phase following initial tokenization), and is contrasted with both run time string concatenation (generally with the codice_60 operator) and concatenation during constant folding, which occurs at compile time, but in a later phase (after phrase analysis or &quot;parsing&quot;). Most languages, such as C#, Java and Perl, do not support implicit string literal concatenation, and instead require explicit concatenation, such as with the codice_60 operator (this is also possible in D and Python, but illegal in C/C++ – see below); in this case concatenation may happen at compile time, via constant folding, or may be deferred to run time.

===Motivation===
In C, where the concept and term originate, string literal concatenation was introduced for two reasons:
* To allow long strings to span multiple lines with proper indentation in contrast to line continuation, which destroys the indentation scheme; and
* To allow the construction of string literals by macros (via stringizing).

In practical terms, this allows string concatenation in early phases of compilation (&quot;translation&quot;, specifically as part of lexical analysis), without requiring phrase analysis or constant folding. For example, the following are valid C/C++:

char *s = &quot;hello, &quot; &quot;world&quot;;
printf(&quot;hello, &quot; &quot;world&quot;);

However, the following are invalid:

char *s = &quot;hello, &quot; + &quot;world&quot;;
printf(&quot;hello, &quot; + &quot;world&quot;);

This is because string literals have array type, codice_62 (C) or codice_63 (C++), which cannot be added; this is not a restriction in most other languages.

This is particularly important when used in combination with the C preprocessor, to allow strings to be computed following preprocessing, particularly in macros. As a simple example:

char *file_and_message = __FILE__ &quot;: message&quot;;

will (if the file is called a.c) expand to:

char *file_and_message = &quot;a.c&quot; &quot;: message&quot;;

which is then concatenated, being equivalent to:

char *file_and_message = &quot;a.c: message&quot;;

A common use case is in constructing printf or scanf format strings, where format specifiers are given by macros.

A more complex example uses stringification of integers (by the preprocessor) to define a macro that expands to a sequence of string literals, which are then concatenated to a single string literal with the file name and line number:

#define STRINGIFY(x) #x
#define TOSTRING(x) STRINGIFY(x)
#define AT __FILE__ &quot;:&quot; TOSTRING(__LINE__)
Beyond syntactic requirements of C/C++, implicit concatenation is a form of syntactic sugar, making it simpler to split string literals across several lines, avoiding the need for line continuation (via backslashes) and allowing one to add comments to parts of strings. For example, in Python, one can comment a regular expression in this way:

re.compile(&quot;[A-Za-z_]&quot; # letter or underscore
 &quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]*&quot; # letter, digit or underscore


===Problems===
Implicit string concatenation is not required by modern compilers, which implement constant folding, and causes hard-to-spot errors due to unintentional concatenation from omitting a comma, particularly in vertical lists of strings, as in:

l = [&#x27;foo&#x27;,
 &#x27;bar&#x27;
 &#x27;zork&#x27;]

Accordingly, it is not used in most languages, and it has been proposed for deprecation from D and Python. However, removing the feature breaks backwards compatibility, and replacing it with a concatenation operator introduces issues of precedence – string literal concatenation occurs during lexing, prior to operator evaluation, but concatenation via an explicit operator occurs at the same time as other operators, hence precedence is an issue, potentially requiring parentheses to ensure desired evaluation order.

A subtler issue is that in C and C++, there are different types of string literals, and concatenation of these has implementation-defined behavior, which poses a potential security risk.

== Different kinds of strings ==
Some languages provide more than one kind of literal, which have different behavior. This is particularly used to indicate raw strings (no escaping), or to disable or enable variable interpolation, but has other uses, such as distinguishing character sets. Most often this is done by changing the quoting character or adding a prefix or suffix. This is comparable to prefixes and suffixes to integer literals, such as to indicate hexadecimal numbers or long integers.

One of the oldest examples is in shell scripts, where single quotes indicate a raw string or &quot;literal string&quot;, while double quotes have escape sequences and variable interpolation.

For example, in Python, raw strings are preceded by an codice_64 or codice_65 – compare codice_66 with codice_67 (though, a Python raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Python 2 also distinguishes two types of strings: 8-bit ASCII (&quot;bytes&quot;) strings (the default), explicitly indicated with a codice_68 or codice_69 prefix, and Unicode strings, indicated with a codice_70 or codice_71 prefix. while in Python 3 strings are Unicode by default and bytes are a separate codice_72 type that when initialized with quotes must be prefixed with a codice_68.

C#&#x27;s notation for raw strings is called @-quoting.

@&quot;C:\Foo\Bar\Baz\&quot;

While this disables escaping, it allows double-up quotes, which allow one to represent quotes within the string:

@&quot;I said, &quot;&quot;Hello there.&quot;&quot;&quot;
C++11 allows raw strings, unicode strings (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32), and wide character strings, determined by prefixes. It also adds literals for the existing C++ codice_74, which is generally preferred to the existing C-style strings.

In Tcl, brace-delimited strings are literal, while quote-delimited strings have escaping and interpolation.

Perl has a wide variety of strings, which are more formally considered operators, and are known as quote and quote-like operators. These include both a usual syntax (fixed delimiters) and a generic syntax, which allows a choice of delimiters; these include:

&quot; &quot;&quot; `` // m// qr// s/// y///
q{} qq{} qx{} qw{} m{} qr{} s{}{} tr{}{} y{}{}
REXX uses suffix characters to specify characters or strings using their hexadecimal or binary code. E.g.,
&#x27;20&#x27;x
&quot;0010 0000&quot;b
&quot;00100000&quot;b

all yield the space character, avoiding the function call codice_75.

== String interpolation ==

In some languages, string literals may contain placeholders referring to variables or expressions in the current context, which are evaluated (usually at run time). This is referred to as &quot;variable interpolation&quot;, or more generally string interpolation. Languages that support interpolation generally distinguish strings literals that are interpolated from ones that are not. For example, in sh-compatible Unix shells (as well as Perl and Ruby), double-quoted (quotation-delimited, &quot;) strings are interpolated, while single-quoted (apostrophe-delimited, &#x27;) strings are not. Non-interpolated string literals are sometimes referred to as &quot;raw strings&quot;, but this is distinct from &quot;raw string&quot; in the sense of escaping. For example, in Python, a string prefixed with codice_64 or codice_65 has no escaping or interpolation, a normal string (no prefix) has escaping but no interpolation, and a string prefixed with codice_78 or codice_79 has escaping and interpolation.

For example, the following Perl code:
$name = &quot;Nancy&quot;;
$greeting = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
print &quot;$name said $greeting to the crowd of people.&quot;;
produces the output:

 Nancy said Hello World to the crowd of people.

In this case, the metacharacter character ($) (not to be confused with the sigil in the variable assignment statement) is interpreted to indicate variable interpolation, and requires some escaping if it needs to be outputted literally.

This should be contrasted with the codice_80 function, which produces the same output using notation such as:

printf &quot;%s said %s to the crowd of people.&quot;, $name, $greeting;

but does not perform interpolation: the codice_81 is a placeholder in a printf format string, but the variables themselves are outside the string.

This is contrasted with &quot;raw&quot; strings:

print &#x27;$name said $greeting to the crowd of people.&#x27;;

which produce output like:

 $name said $greeting to the crowd of people.

Here the $ characters are not metacharacters, and are not interpreted to have any meaning other than plain text.

== Embedding source code in string literals ==

Languages that lack flexibility in specifying string literals make it particularly cumbersome to write programming code that generates other programming code. This is particularly true when the generation language is the same or similar to the output language.

For example:
* writing code to produce quines
* generating an output language from within a web template;
* using XSLT to generate XSLT, or SQL to generate more SQL
* generating a PostScript representation of a document for printing purposes, from within a document-processing application written in C or some other language.

Nevertheless, some languages are particularly well-adapted to produce this sort of self-similar output, especially those that support multiple options for avoiding delimiter collision.

Using string literals as code that generates other code may have adverse security implications, especially if the output is based at least partially on untrusted user input. This is particularly acute in the case of Web-based applications, where malicious users can take advantage of such weaknesses to subvert the operation of the application, for example by mounting an SQL injection attack.

==Early life==
Broderick was born in Manhattan, the only son of Patricia ( Biow), a playwright, actress, and painter, and James Broderick, an actor and World War II veteran. His mother was Ashkenazi Jewish, a descendant of emigrants from Germany and Poland. His father was a Catholic of Irish and English descent. He has two sisters. Broderick attended grade school at City and Country School in Manhattan and high school at the private Walden School, also in Manhattan. He received acting training at HB Studio.

==Career==
===Early career===
Broderick&#x27;s first major acting role came in an HB Studio workshop production of playwright Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;On Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, playing opposite his father, a friend of Foote&#x27;s. This was followed by a supporting role as Harvey Fierstein&#x27;s gay adopted son, David, in the off-Broadway production of Fierstein&#x27;s &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;; then, a good review by &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Mel Gussow brought him to the attention of Broadway. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; interview:

He was replaced on Torch Song by Jon Cryer, who &quot;closely resembled&quot; Broderick.

He followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the Neil Simon &quot;Eugene Trilogy&quot; including the plays &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; and &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his role in &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;. Broderick is a founding member of Naked Angels. Cryer also became a standby and replacement for Broderick on this role.

===Success in films===
Broderick&#x27;s first film role as Michael McPhee in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Max Dugan Returns&quot; was also written by Neil Simon, but his first big hit film was &quot;WarGames&quot;, a summer hit in 1983, in which he played the main role of Seattle teen hacker David Lightman. Broderick next played Philippe Gaston in &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, in 1985.

Broderick then won the role of the charming, clever slacker in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. At the age of 23, Broderick played the titular high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, plays hooky and explores Chicago. A 1980s comedy favorite, the film is one of Broderick&#x27;s best-known roles (particularly with teenage audiences). Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in &quot;Project X&quot;. In 1988, Broderick played Harvey Fierstein&#x27;s ill-fated lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;.

He starred in the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot; alongside Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington, and received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the American Civil War officer Robert Gould Shaw, whom Broderick physically resembled.

In the 1990s, Broderick appeared as Clark Kellogg in &quot;The Freshman&quot; in 1990, was the voice of adult Simba in Disney&#x27;s 1994 animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and voiced Tack the Cobbler in Miramax&#x27;s controversial version of &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;, which had originally been intended as a silent role and was fully released in 1995.

He also played Dr. Niko Tatopoulos in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and the title character in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; in 1999.

===Broadway===
Broderick returned to Broadway as a musical star in the 1990s, winning a Tony Award for his performance in &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. Broderick then starred alongside Nathan Lane in the Mel Brooks 2001 stage version of &quot;The Producers&quot; which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold &quot;Leo&quot; Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail that turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another Tony Award but lost to his co-star Nathan Lane. The musical went on to win the most Tony Awards in history with 12 wins. Broderick and Lane reprised their roles in the 2005 film adaptation of the same name.

Broderick starred in a 2004 off-Broadway production of the award-winning Larry Shue play &quot;The Foreigner&quot; as the witty Charlie Baker. He was reunited with his co-star from &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Producers&quot;, Nathan Lane, in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, which opened on Broadway in October 2005. He appeared on Broadway as a college professor in &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;, running April 10 through June 28, 2009.

He returned to the Broadway stage in Spring 2012 to star in the musical &quot;Nice Work If You Can Get It&quot;, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall. He notably starred in the 2015 Broadway adaptation of &quot;Sylvia&quot;, a play by A.R. Gurney directed by Daniel J. Sullivan.

Broderick made his West End debut in &quot;The Starry Messenger&quot; in May 2019, co-starring with Elizabeth McGovern.

In 2022, Broderick returned to Broadway in a revival of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; where he starred alongside his wife Sarah Jessica Parker. In 2024, the production transferred to the Savoy Theatre, London.

===Later films and television===
Broderick starred with Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy and Alan Alda in the comedy &quot;Tower Heist&quot; in 2011. In 2018, it was announced that he was cast in the main role of Michael Burr in the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

In 2023, Broderick played the role of Laird Becker in the comedy film &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot;, and appeared as himself in two episodes of the Hulu comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;. His performance in the latter earned him a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Broderick and actress Sarah Jessica Parker married on May 19, 1997, in an Episcopal ceremony officiated by his sister, Rev. Janet Broderick Kraft.

Parker and Broderick have a son, and twin daughters via surrogacy.

Although the couple live in the West Village, they spend a large amount of time at their second home in Kilcar, a village in County Donegal, Ireland, where Broderick spent his summers as a child. They also have a house in The Hamptons.

Broderick is a political liberal.

===Ancestry===
In March 2010, Broderick was featured in the NBC program &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; He said his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in &quot;Glory&quot;, as he discovered his paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a Union soldier. A veteran of the Battle of Gettysburg, Martindale, who belonged to the 20th Connecticut, was killed in the aftermath of the Battle of Atlanta and interred in an unnamed grave at the Marietta National Cemetery. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick&#x27;s research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, was a highly decorated combat medic in World War I, having earned his distinctions during the Meuse–Argonne offensive.

===1987 car crash===
On August 5, 1987, while driving a rented car outside Tempo, Northern Ireland, Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with another car. The driver, Anna Gallagher, 28, and her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, were both killed instantly. He was vacationing with Jennifer Grey, whom he had begun dating during the filming of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. He suffered a fractured leg and ribs, a concussion, and a collapsed lung. Grey&#x27;s injuries included severe whiplash, which later required surgery to avoid paralysis. Broderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he had been in the wrong lane: &quot;What I first remember is waking up in the hospital, with a very strange feeling going on in my leg.&quot; He was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and faced up to five years in prison, but was convicted of the lesser charge of careless driving and fined £100 (US$175).

The victims&#x27; family called the verdict &quot;a travesty of justice&quot;. The victims&#x27; brother/son, Martin Doherty, later forgave Broderick amid plans to meet him in 2003. In February 2012, when Broderick was featured in a multi-million-dollar Honda commercial that aired during the Super Bowl, Doherty said the meeting had still not taken place and that Broderick &quot;wasn&#x27;t the greatest choice of drivers, knowing his past&quot;.

<text>John Taylor (24 August 1578 – December 1653) was an English poet who dubbed himself &quot;The Water Poet&quot;.

==Biography==
John Taylor was born in the parish of St. Ewen&#x27;s, near South Gate, Gloucester on 24 August 1578.

His parentage is unknown, as the parish registers did not survive the Civil War. He did, however, attend elementary school and grammar school there. His grammar school education may have taken place at the Crypt School in Gloucester, however Taylor never finished his formal education due to difficulties with his Latin studies.

In the early 1590s, after his attempt at grammar school he moved from his home to south London, probably Southwark, to begin an apprenticeship as a waterman. His occupation was one deemed unpopular by the literary elite of London. Watermen were known to be drunkards, and often gossips and liars, who attempted to cheat patrons into a higher wage for their service. This occupation would be crafted into an image for Taylor later in his career.

After his waterman apprenticeship he served (1596) in the fleet of the Earl of Essex, and participated in the Capture of Cádiz in that year, and in a voyage to the island of Flores in the Azores in 1597.

He spent much of his life as a Thames waterman, a member of the guild of boatmen that ferried passengers across the River Thames in London, in the days when the London Bridge was the only passage between the banks. His occupation was his gateway into the literary society of London, as he ferried patrons, actors, and playwrights across the Thames to the Bankside theatres. In 1620, Taylor claimed almost 20,000 men lived by this trade, including dependents and servants, and in 1641, he believed there were over 40,000 in the company itself. He became a member of the ruling oligarchy of the guild, serving as its clerk; it is mainly through his writings that history is familiar with the watermen&#x27;s disputes of 1641–42, in which an attempt was made to democratize the leadership of the Company. He details the uprisings in the pamphlets &quot;John Taylors Manifestation ...&quot; and &quot;To the Right Honorable Assembly ... (Commons Petition)&quot;, and in &quot;John Taylors Last Voyage and Adventure&quot; of 1641.

Taylor discusses the watermen&#x27;s disputes with the theatre companies (who moved the theatres from the south bank to the north in 1612, depriving the ferries of traffic) in &quot;The True Cause of the Watermen&#x27;s Suit Concerning Players&quot; (written in 1613 or 1614). The move of theatres from the south bank to the north took a huge toll on Taylor&#x27;s income, and despite at that time being in the company of the King&#x27;s Watermen, he could not sway the king to prevent the move.

He also addresses the coachmen, in his tract &quot;An Arrant Thief&quot; (1622); recent development of horse-drawn carriages with spring suspension, and use of them for hire on land, had taken much trade away from the watermen. &quot;An Arrant Thief&quot; says:

&lt;poem&gt;All sorts of men, work all the means they can,
To make a Thief of every waterman :
And as it were in one consent they join,
To trot by land i&#x27; th&#x27; dirt, and save their coin.
Carroaches, coaches, , and Flanders mares,
Do rob us of our shares, our wares, our fares :
Against the ground, we stand and knock our heels,
Whilst all our profit runs away on wheels ;
And, whosoever but observes and notes,
The great increase of coaches and of boats,
Shall find their number more than e&#x27;er they were,
By half and more, within these thirty years.
Then watermen at sea had service still,
And those that staid at home had work at will :
Then upstart Hell-cart-coaches were to seek,
A man could scarce see twenty in a week ;
But now I think a man may daily see,
More than the wherrys on the Thames can be.
When Queen Elizabeth came to the crown,
A coach in England then was scarcely known,
Then &#x27;twas as rare to see one, as to spy
A Tradesman that had never told a lie.&lt;/poem&gt;

Taylor was also the first poet to mention the deaths of William Shakespeare and Francis Beaumont in print, in his 1620 poem, &quot;The Praise of Hemp-seed&quot;. Both had died four years earlier.

&lt;poem&gt;In paper, many a poet now survives
Or else their lines had perish&#x27;d with their lives.
Old Chaucer, Gower, and Sir Thomas More,
Sir Philip Sidney, who the laurel wore,
Spenser, and Shakespeare did in art excell,
Sir Edward Dyer, Greene, Nash, Daniel.
Sylvester, Beaumont, Sir John Harrington,
Forgetfulness their works would over run
But that in paper they immortally
Do live in spite of death, and cannot die.&lt;/poem&gt;
He was a prolific poet, with over one hundred and fifty publications in his lifetime. Many were gathered into the compilation &quot;All the Workes of John Taylor the Water Poet&quot; (London, 1630; facsimile reprint Scholar Press, Menston, Yorkshire, 1973); augmented by the Spenser Society&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Works of John Taylor ... not included in the Folio edition of 1630&quot; (5 volumes, 1870–78). Although his work was not sophisticated, he was a keen observer of people and styles in the seventeenth century, and his work is often studied by social historians. An example is his 1621 work &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Motto&quot;, which included a list of then-current card games and diversions:

&lt;poem&gt;The prodigall&#x27;s estate, like to a flux,
The Mercer, Draper, and the Silkman sucks:
The Tailor, Millainer, Dogs, Drabs, and Dice,
Trey-trip, or Passage, or the Most-at-thrice.
At Irish, Tick tackle, Doublets, Draughts, or Cheese,
He flings his money free with carelessnesse:
At Novum, Mainchance, Mischance (chuse ye which),
At One-and-Thirty, or at Poor-and-Rich,
Ruffe, Slam, Trump, Whisk, Hole, Sant, New Cut.
Unto the keeping of four knaves he&#x27;ll put
His whole estate at Loadum or at Gleeke,
At Tickle-me-quickly, he&#x27;s a merry Greek;
At Primifisto, Post and Payre, Primero,
Maw, Whip-her ginney, he&#x27;s a lib&#x27;ral hero;
At My-sow-pigged: but (reader never doubt ye)
He&#x27;s skilled in all games except Looke about ye.
Bowles, Shove groat, Tennis, no game comes amiss,
His purse a nurse for anybody is;
Caroches, Coaches and Tobacconists,
All sorts of people freely from his fists,
His vaine expenses daily suck and soake,
And he himself sucks only drink and smoake.
And thus the Prodigall himself alone
Gives sucke to thousands and himself sucks non.&lt;/poem&gt;

He achieved notoriety by a series of eccentric journeys: for example, he travelled from London to Queenborough in a paper boat with two stockfish tied to canes for oars, described in &quot;The Praise of Hemp-Seed&quot;, which was re-enacted in 2006. From his journey to Scotland in 1618, on which he took no money, Taylor published his &quot;Pennyless Pilgrimage&quot;. (Ben Jonson walked to Scotland in the same year.) He is one of the few credited early authors of a palindrome: in 1614, he wrote &quot;Lewd did I live, &amp; evil I did dwel&quot;. He wrote a poem about Thomas Parr, a man who supposedly lived to the age of 152 and died visiting London in 1635. He was also the author of a constructed language called &quot;Barmoodan&quot;.

Many of Taylor&#x27;s works were published by subscription; i.e., he would propose a book, ask for contributors, and write it when he had enough subscribers to undertake the printing costs. He had more than sixteen hundred subscribers to &quot;The Pennylesse Pilgrimage; or, the Moneylesse Perambulation of John Taylor, alias the Kings Magesties Water-Poet; How He TRAVAILED on Foot from London to Edenborough in Scotland, Not Carrying any Money To or Fro, Neither Begging, Borrowing, or Asking Meate, Drinke, or Lodging&quot;, published in 1618. Those who defaulted on the subscription were chided the following year in a scathing brochure entitled &quot;A Kicksey Winsey, or, A Lerry Come-Twang&quot;, which he issued in the following year.

&lt;poem&gt;By wondrous accident perchance one may
Grope out a needle in a load of hay;
And though a white crow be exceeding rare,
A blind man may (by fortune) catch a hare.
— &quot;A Kicksey Winsey&quot;, part VII&lt;/poem&gt;

===Death===
Taylor died in London in December 1653 aged 75. He was buried on 5 December at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. His widow, Alice, died in January 1658.

== Reception and influence ==
Despite having been one of the most widely read poets in Stuart England, there is a disparity between Taylor&#x27;s contemporary acclaim and his modern obscurity. His volume of work was immense, resulting in almost 220 titles by 1642. The reach of his work had been broad, due to its use of the vernacular and his many genres, including satires, moral essays, funeral elegies (including an elegy for James I), and travel literature. Taylor ferried himself between the educated elite and the urban working class, bridging a gap in early modern readership that valued quality over quantity. This &quot;cultural amphibian&quot; of a poet struggled with his own cultural identity, remaining on the sidelines of the educated elite, but firmly tied to his occupation as a waterman, which defined his career in literature. This struggle highlights for scholars the gap in readership and literary culture between the elite and working classes in early modern London.

Despite his poor grasp of Latin, John Taylor aspired to be like his idols Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson, and was heavily criticised by Jonson throughout his career for his lack of grace in his language. Despite failing to enter fully into the world of London&#x27;s literary elite, Taylor developed a sense of authorial personality which survives his work, and may have been the genesis of the &quot;celebrity&quot; of author, as he carefully crafted his public image throughout his career, beginning with his reworking of his otherwise frowned-upon occupation as a waterman into a name for himself as the King&#x27;s &quot;Water-Poet&quot;. Taylor provided a style of writing that was not bound by the constructs of classical learning, as most poets of the time would have been products of their grammar school education, whether they intended it or not. John Taylor&#x27;s development of travel literature, which came into popularity in the 1500s, solidified his career and public image, and his travels were often funded through bets made by the public as to whether he would complete his journey.

&lt;poem&gt;He entertained no gout, no ache he felt,
The air was good and temperate where he dwelt;
While mavisses and sweet-tongued nightingales
Did chant him roundelays and madrigals.
Thus living within bounds of nature&#x27;s laws,
Of his long-lasting life may be some cause.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Reliant Kitten is a small four-wheeled economy car which was manufactured from 1975 to 1982 in saloon, van and estate variants by the Reliant Motor Company in Tamworth, England. It was Reliant&#x27;s second attempt at selling in the small car economy market after the 1960s Reliant Rebel.

The Kitten is based around the design of the original 1970s Reliant Robin and was the first production car to use Reliant&#x27;s 850 cc engine.

Even though UK production ended in 1982 the whole production assembly was sold to Indian firm Sipani Automobiles where production ran until the mid 1990s.

== Development and history ==
The Kitten was Reliant&#x27;s second attempt to sell into the general small car market, the previous attempt in the 1960s was the Reliant Rebel and Reliant at the time told Ogle design to make the Rebel look completely different to the Reliant Regal 3/25 it was based on (but keep the same doors and windscreen) but for the new Kitten design Reliant told Ogle to keep as much of the Robin as they could to keep production costs down by parts sharing, as Reliant knew sales would be lower than the current Robin.

The Kitten was originally going to use the 750 cc Reliant engine that was currently fitted to the Reliant Robin but after driving prototypes, it was soon decided the 750 cc engine was not acceptable, so it was decided to tune the engine; but after engineers researched this they found that by changing the crank and rods the 750 cc engine could become a 850 cc engine without changing the liners or pistons, which again saved production costs. This new engine 850 cc engine developed and could also be used in the Robin as an upgrade.

The chassis design of the Kitten from mid section backwards is essentially the same as that of the three-wheeled Reliant Robin using leaf springs and a solid rear axle, from the middle forwards the car is significantly different, with the engine moved forward and instead of using suspension from another manufacture Reliant-designed (but Lotus-inspired) double wishbone front suspension. Moving the engine forward increased driver and front passenger room, compared with the three-wheeled cars. 

Prototypes of the Kitten were shown to the public in 1974 with some criticism that the Kitten looked like a &quot;4 wheeled Robin&quot; and because of this the car had a quick front end redesign with the round headlights replaced with the square lucas headlamps shared with the Austin Allegro and a black light panel and black bumpers front and rear. This earlier front end design would be used later on for Van models as the 7&quot; round headlamps were significantly cheaper than the square lucas lamps. 

The Kitten launched in 1975 as a Saloon and Estate model with a large range of optional extras and a choice of black or tan interiors, it was also one of the first small UK cars to be sold as standard with radial tyres.

In October 1976 a new de luxe version of the Kitten, branded as the Kitten DL, was announced. Improvements included revised springs and dampers and a different anti-roll bar. But mainly the DL model was an interior improvement package. It included more comfortable seats which reclined and tilted – and were available in brown or black cloth – a stronger door design with chrome interior handles, vinyl door cards incorporating map pockets, a parcel shelf, volt meter and oil pressure gauges. The car also had a radio with twin speakers, Gemini alloy wheels, additional carpets, front and rear fog lights and in some cases rear reversing lights, the biggest claim was the Kitten DL was the first UK small car to come with a rear wiper as standard, something car journalists noted at the time similar to the Kitten&#x27;s bigger brother the Scimitar GTE.
On 1 December 1977, a van version of the Kitten was announced. It shared the profile of the Kitten Estate but used the prototype nose of the original Kitten saloon, which had Lucas round headlamps. The new car had blank panels in place of the windows behind the B-pillar, thus making a van. Other changes included a black vinyl interior with an optional rear bench seat which folded flat. The van could be had with or without a front passenger seat. With the seat, the van had an interior volume of ; without the seat, volume increased to . A number of the vans &quot;ended up with windows fitted as it was cheaper to buy [the van] than the estate&quot;.

After production problems with the Robin caused a drop in sales and loss of staff, Reliant decided to close down the Kitten production line and focus on Robin production, this meant after 1978 the Kitten became a &quot;special order&quot; vehicle only. If a customer wanted a Kitten they would now need to order at a Reliant dealer and wait for the car to be built by taking staff off the Robin production line, it also meant Kittens were no longer made in general batches and kept in stock at dealers.
In 1982, after selling 4551 Kittens, &quot;small numbers&quot; of which had been built in left hand drive for export, the last Kitten rolled off the production line. It was &quot;not replaced&quot; by a new car but &quot;The all new Reliant Fox&quot; went into production in 1983. The Fox had similar mechanicals to the Kitten, but was a four-wheeled pickup with hard tops available to also make it into an estate or van type vehicle.

A number of Kittens were still sold in 1983 and 1984 from dealer built kits, lots of spares were left in stock at Reliant and since the Reliant Fox used the same chassis as the Kitten a number of vehicles were built by dealers for customers as the Fox didn&#x27;t appeal to the same market since it was a van, these cars are easy to spot as they use the Fox&#x27;s 12 inch wheels and are usually registered on Q registration plates.

Though Reliant had ended production of the Kitten in the UK it was expected to sell the imported Sipani Dolphin in the UK but this plan was quickly scrapped after Reliant saw the quality of the vehicles Sipani was producing.

== The Sipani Dolphin and Montana ==

1982 was not the end of production of the Kitten, though, as large numbers were built as CKD kits in Bangalore by Sipani Automobiles Ltd. Renamed the Dolphin, these cars had only slight changes, such as front grille and wheel trims. However, two-door cars were not particularly popular in India as laws restricted the sale of such vehicles in half of the country. As a result, Sipani produced the Montana, a larger five-door hatchback with a more modern appearance. The cars were successful rally cars in India and were seen as a popular home-grown choice of vehicle. Sipani carried on producing vehicles built around the Kitten design and mechanicals into the 1990s.

A preservation society exists called the Reliant Kitten Register.

==Journalists impressions==

&quot;Classic and Sportscar&quot; magazine noted that the car&#x27;s speed and fuel economy gave it real kitten-like performance, with a taxi-like turning circle&quot; but that it was more expensive than rival cars from other manufacturers, which could build larger numbers of vehicles. In a letter to the editor of &quot;Motorsport&quot; magazine in 1976, a Dr Robert Elliot-Porter wrote that he had driven his Kitten on a round-trip on a motorway and averaged . He called it &quot;a car of which the British can be proud,&quot; adding that he had driven his Kitten more than in 10 months of ownership. Both he and his wife owned Kittens. Automotive writer Craig Cheetham opined that Reliants in general appealed to &quot;the older generations among Britain&#x27;s population&quot; because of the car&#x27;s durability and that &quot;the average buyers&quot; of the Kitten &quot;were well into their sixties&quot;.

<text>were the final years of the Edo period when the Tokugawa shogunate ended. Between 1853 and 1867, under foreign diplomatic and military pressure, Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy known as and changed from a feudal Tokugawa shogunate to the modern empire of the Meiji government. The major ideological-political divide during this period was between the pro-imperial nationalists called and the shogunate forces, which included the elite swordsmen.

Although these two groups were the most visible powers, many other factions attempted to use the chaos of to seize personal power. Furthermore, there were two other main driving forces for dissent: first, growing resentment on the part of the (or outside lords), and second, growing anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of Matthew C. Perry. The first related to those lords whose predecessors had fought against Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, after which they had been permanently excluded from all powerful positions within the shogunate. The second was to be expressed in the phrase , or &quot;revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians&quot;. The turning point of the Bakumatsu was during the Boshin War and the Battle of Toba–Fushimi when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.

== Background ==
=== Frictions with foreign powers ===
Frictions with foreign shipping led Japan to take defensive actions from the beginning of the 19th century. Western ships were increasing their presence around Japan due to whaling activities and the trade with China. They were hoping for Japan to become a base for supply or at least a place where shipwrecks could receive assistance. The incident in Nagasaki Harbour where the Royal Navy frigate HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot; demanded supplies from the harbour chief in 1808 shocked the Tokugawa government, who ordered the ports to be even more tightly guarded. In 1825, the was issued by the shogunate, prohibiting any contacts with foreigners; it remained in place until 1842.

Meanwhile, Japan endeavoured to learn about foreign sciences through (&quot;Western studies&quot;). To reinforce Japan&#x27;s capability to carry on the orders to repel Westerners, some such as the Nagasaki-based Takashima Shūhan managed to obtain weapons through the Dutch at Dejima, such as field guns, mortars and firearms. Domains sent students to learn from Takashima in Nagasaki, from Satsuma Domain after the intrusion of an American warship in 1837 in Kagoshima Bay, and from Saga Domain and Chōshū Domain, all southern domains mostly exposed to Western intrusions. These domains also studied the manufacture of Western weapons. By 1852 Satsuma and Saga had reverberatory furnaces to produce the iron necessary for firearms.

Following the &quot;Morrison&quot; incident involving the &quot;Morrison&quot; under Charles W. King in 1837, Egawa Hidetatsu was put in charge of establishing the defense of Tokyo Bay against Western intrusions in 1839. After the humiliating defeat suffered by Qing China in the First and Second Opium Wars, many Japanese officials realized that their traditional methods would be no match for western powers. To deal with Western powers on equal terms, Western guns were studied and demonstrations made in 1841 by Takashima Shūhan to the Tokugawa government.

A national debate was already taking place about how to better avoid foreign incursions. Some such as Egawa claimed that it was necessary to use the foreigners&#x27; techniques to repel them. Others, such as argued that only traditional Japanese methods should be employed and reinforced. Egawa argued that just as Confucianism and Buddhism had been introduced from abroad, it made sense to introduce useful Western techniques. A theoretical synthesis of &quot;Western knowledge&quot; and &quot;Eastern morality&quot; would later be accomplished by Sakuma Shōzan and Yokoi Shōnan, in view of &quot;controlling the barbarians with their own methods&quot;.

After 1839, however, traditionalists tended to prevail. Students of Western sciences were accused of treason (), put under house arrest (Takashima Shūhan), forced to commit ritual suicide (Watanabe Kazan, Takano Chōei), or even assassinated as in the case of Sakuma Shōzan.

== Perry Expedition (1853–54) ==

When Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay (Tokyo Bay) in July 1853, the shogunate was thrown into turmoil. Commodore Perry was fully prepared for hostilities if his negotiations with the Japanese failed, and threatened to open fire if the Japanese refused to negotiate. He gave them two white flags, telling them to hoist the flags when they wished a bombardment from his fleet to cease and to surrender. To demonstrate his weapons, Perry ordered his ships to attack several buildings around the harbor. The ships of Perry were equipped with new Paixhans shell guns, capable of destroying buildings by delivering explosive shells at high velocity.

=== Japan&#x27;s response ===

In response to the Perry Expedition and increasing incursions of foreign warships into Japanese territorial waters, several modern sailing frigates, including and , were constructed on orders of the Tokugawa shogunate by the Satsuma Domain. The was built from 1853 to 1854 at Sakurajima in what is now Kagoshima Prefecture in accordance with a Dutch blueprint. Furthermore, fortifications were established at Odaiba in Tokyo Bay in order to protect Edo from an American incursion. Industrial developments also commenced soon afterwards in order to build modern cannons. A reverbatory furnace was established by Egawa Hidetatsu in Nirayama to cast cannons.

The American fleet returned in 1854. The chairman of the senior councillors, Abe Masahiro, was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to national security, Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors, who wanted to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor, who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the feudal rulers, who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe compromised by accepting Perry&#x27;s demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or Treaty of Kanagawa) maintained the prohibition on trade but opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American whaling ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in Shimoda, a seaport on the Izu Peninsula, southwest of Edo. In February 1855, the Russians followed suit with the Treaty of Shimoda.

The resulting damage to the shogunate was significant. Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the shogunate. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the , had consulted with the and , further undermining the already weakened .

In the Ansei Reform (1854–1856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the shogunate acquired its first steam warship, the , which was used for training, and opened the Nagasaki Naval Training Center with Dutch instructors, while a Western-style military school was established at Edo. In 1857, it acquired its first screw-driven steam warship, the . Scientific knowledge grew swiftly from the existing foundation of Western learning ().

Opposition to Abe increased within circles, which opposed opening shogunate councils to the , and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by Hotta Masayoshi (1810–1864). At the head of the dissident faction was Tokugawa Nariaki, who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school—based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles—had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, and the turning back of the West.

Japanese historian Motohiko Izawa stated in his book, &quot;The United States simply aimed to conduct business, which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing for Japan. In fact, one could even say it was appealing. However, among the senior officials of the Shogunate, there was a trauma from the Nagasaki Harbour Incident. They probably adopted a hardline stance as a result of assuming that Americans were no different from the British.&quot;

== Earthquakes ==
The years 1854–1855 saw a dramatic series of earthquakes, known as the Ansei great earthquakes, with 120 major and minor tremors recorded over a less than two-year period including the 8.4 magnitude 1854 Tōkai earthquake on 23 December 1854, the 8.4 magnitude 1854 Nankai earthquake occurring the following day, and the 6.9 magnitude 1855 Edo earthquake, which struck what is today modern Tokyo, on 11 November 1855. Shimoda on the Izu Peninsula was struck by the Tōkai earthquake and a subsequent tsunami, and because the port had just been designated as the prospective location for a US consulate, some construed the natural disasters as demonstration of the displeasure of the gods. As the earthquakes were blamed by many Japanese on a giant catfish (&quot;Namazu&quot;) thrashing about, Ukiyo-e prints depicting &quot;namazu&quot; became very popular during this time.

== Treaties imposed upon Japan ==
Following the nomination of Townsend Harris as the U.S. Consul in 1856 and two years of negotiation, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed in 1858 and put into application from mid-1859. During the negotiations, Harris had convinced the Japanese negotiators to sign the treaty on the basis it was the best possible terms a Western power would offer.

The most important points of the Treaty were:

* exchange of diplomatic agents.
* Edo, Kobe, Nagasaki, Niigata, and Yokohama&#x27;s opening to foreign trade as ports.
* ability of United States citizens to live and trade at will in those ports (only opium trade was prohibited).
* a system of extraterritoriality that provided for the subjugation of foreign residents to the laws of their own consular courts instead of the Japanese law system.
* fixed low import-export duties, subject to international control
* ability for Japan to purchase American shipping and weapons (three American steamships were delivered to Japan in 1862).

Japan was also forced to apply any further conditions granted to other foreign nations in the future to the United States, under the &quot;most favoured nation&quot; provision. Several foreign nations soon followed suit and obtained treaties with Japan (the Ansei Five-Power Treaties, with the United States (Harris Treaty) on July 29, 1858, the Netherlands (Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Netherlands and Japan) on August 18, Russia (Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Russia and Japan) August 19, the United Kingdom (Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce) on August 26, and France (Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan) on October 9).

Trading houses were quickly set up in the open ports.

== Crisis ==

=== Collapse of the Japanese economy ===


The opening of Japan to uncontrolled foreign trade brought massive economic instability. While some prospered, many others went bankrupt. Unemployment rose, as well as inflation. Coincidentally, major famines also increased the price of food drastically. Incidents occurred between brash foreigners and the Japanese.

Japan&#x27;s monetary system, based on Tokugawa coinage, also broke down. Traditionally, Japan&#x27;s exchange rate between gold and silver was 1:5, whereas international rates were of the order of 1:15. This led to massive purchases of gold by foreigners, and ultimately forced the Japanese authorities to devalue their currency. There was a massive outflow of gold from Japan, as foreigners rushed to exchange their silver for &quot;token&quot; silver Japanese coinage and again exchange these against gold, giving a 200% profit to the transaction. In 1860, about 4 million ryōs thus left Japan, that is about 70 tons of gold. This effectively destroyed Japan&#x27;s gold standard system, and forced it to return to weight-based system with International rates. The Bakufu instead responded to the crises by debasing the gold content of its coins by two thirds, so as to match foreign gold-silver exchange ratios.

Foreigners also brought cholera to Japan, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

=== Political and social crisis ===

Hotta lost the support of key Daimyōs, and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the &quot;bakufu&quot;, rejected Hotta&#x27;s request, resulting in his resignation, and embroiling Kyoto and the Emperor in Japan&#x27;s internal politics for the first time in centuries. When the &quot;shōgun&quot; died without an heir, Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, Tokugawa Yoshinobu (or Keiki), for &quot;shōgun&quot;, a reformist candidate favored by the &quot;shinpan&quot; and &quot;tozama daimyōs&quot;. The &quot;fudai&quot; won the power struggle, however, installing the 12 year old Tokugawa Iemochi as &quot;shōgun&quot; whom it was perceived Tairō Ii Naosuke would have influence over, ultimately placing Nariaki and Yoshinobu under house arrest, and executing Yoshida Shōin (1830–1859, a leading &quot;sonnō-jōi&quot; intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu) known as the Ansei Purge.

Tairō Ii Naosuke, who had signed the Harris Treaty and tried to eliminate opposition to Westernization with the Ansei Purge, was himself murdered in March 1860 in the Sakuradamon incident. A servant of the French Minister was attacked at the end of 1860. On 14 January 1861, Henry Heusken, Secretary to the American mission, was attacked and murdered. On 5 July 1861, a group of samurai attacked the British Legation, resulting in two deaths. During this period, about one foreigner was killed every month. The Richardson Affair occurred in September 1862, forcing foreign nations to take decisive action in order to protect foreigners and guarantee the implementation of Treaty provisions. In May 1863, the US legation in Edo was torched.

During the 1860s, peasant uprisings and urban disturbances multiplied. A &quot;World renewal&quot; movement appeared, as well as religious festivals and protests such as the Eejanaika.

From 1859, the ports of Nagasaki, Hakodate and Yokohama became open to foreign traders as a consequence of the Treaties. Foreigners arrived in Yokohama and Kanagawa in great numbers, giving rise to trouble with the samurai. Violence increased against the foreigners and those who dealt with them. Murders of foreigners and collaborating Japanese soon followed. On 26 August 1859, a Russian sailor was cut to pieces in the streets of Yokohama. In early 1860, two Dutch captains were slaughtered, also in Yokohama. Chinese and native servants of foreigners were also killed.

== Initial efforts to revise the imposed treaties ==
Several missions were sent abroad by the Bakufu, in order to revise the commercial treaties. However, these efforts remained largely unsuccessful. A Japanese Embassy to the United States was sent in 1860, on board the &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; and the USS &quot;Powhattan&quot;. A First Japanese Embassy to Europe was sent in 1862. A Second Japanese Embassy to Europe would be sent in December 1863, with the mission to obtain European support to reinstate Japan&#x27;s former closure to foreign trade, and especially stop foreign access to the harbor of Yokohama. The Embassy ended in total failure as European powers did not see any advantages in yielding to its demands.

== Sonnō Jōi (1863–66) ==

Belligerent opposition to Western influence further erupted into open conflict when the Emperor Kōmei, breaking with centuries of imperial tradition, began to take an active role in matters of state and issued, on March 11 and April 11, 1863, his .

The Mōri clan of Chōshū, under Lord Mōri Takachika, followed on the order, and began to take actions to expel all foreigners from the date fixed as a deadline (May 10, Lunar calendar). Openly defying the shogunate, Mōri ordered his forces to fire without warning on all foreign ships traversing Shimonoseki Strait.

Under pressure from the Emperor, the Shogun was also forced to issue a declaration promulgating the end of relations with foreigners. The order was forwarded to foreign legations by Ogasawara Zusho no Kami on June 24, 1863:

Edward Neale, the head of the British Legation, responded on very strong terms, equating the move with a declaration of war:

=== Foreign military interventions against ===
American influence, which had been of high importance in the beginning, waned after 1861 due to the advent of the American Civil War (1861–1865) that monopolized all available U.S. resources. This influence would be replaced by that of the British, the Dutch and the French.

The two ringleaders of the opposition to the were from the Satsuma (present day Kagoshima prefecture) and Chōshū (present-day Yamaguchi prefecture) provinces, two of the strongest anti-shogunate domains in Edo-period Japan. Satsuma military leaders Saigō Takamori and Okubo Toshimichi were brought together with Katsura Kogoro of Chōshū, notably through the efforts of Sakamoto Ryōma. As the former happened to be directly involved in the murder of Richardson, and the latter in the attacks on foreign shipping in Shimonoseki, and as the declared itself unable to placate them, Allied forces decided to mount direct military expeditions.

In the morning of July 16, 1863, under sanction by Minister Pruyn, in an apparent swift response to the attack on the &quot;Pembroke&quot;, the U.S. frigate USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; under Captain McDougal sailed into the strait and single-handedly engaged the U.S.-built but poorly manned fleet. For almost two hours before withdrawing, McDougal sank one Japanese vessel and severely damaged the other two, along with some forty Japanese casualties, while the &quot;Wyoming&quot; suffered extensive damage with fourteen crew dead or wounded.

On the heels of McDougal&#x27;s engagement, two weeks later a French landing force of two warships, the &quot;Tancrède&quot; and the &quot;Dupleix&quot;, and 250 men under Captain Benjamin Jaurès swept into Shimonoseki and destroyed a small town, together with at least one artillery emplacement.

In August 1863, the Bombardment of Kagoshima took place, in retaliation for the Namamugi incident and the murder of the English trader Richardson. The Royal Navy bombarded Kagoshima and sunk several ships. Satsuma however later negotiated and paid 25,000 pounds, but did not remit Richardson&#x27;s killers, and in exchange obtained an agreement by Great Britain to supply steam warships to Satsuma. The conflict actually became the starting point of a close relationship between Satsuma and Great Britain, which became major allies in the ensuing Boshin War. From the start, the Satsuma Province had generally been in favour of the opening and modernization of Japan. Although the Namamugi Incident was seen as unfortunate, it was taken not to be characteristic of Satsuma&#x27;s policy, and was instead branded as an example of anti-foreign sentiment, as a justification to a strong Western show of force.

Naval forces from Great Britain, France, the Netherlands and the United States, planned an armed reaction against Japanese acts of violence against the citizens with the Bombardment of Shimonoseki. The Allied intervention occurred in September 1864, combining the naval forces of the four nations, against the powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; Mōri Takachika of the Chōshū Domain based in Shimonoseki, Japan. This conflict proved inopportune for America, which in 1864, was already torn by its own civil war.

Following these successes against the imperial movement in Japan, the shogunate was able to reassert a certain level of primacy at the end of 1864. The traditional policy of &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; was reinstated, and remnants of the rebellions of 1863–64 as well as the &quot;Shishi&quot; movement were brutally suppressed throughout the land.

The military interventions by foreign powers also proved that Japan was no military match against the Allies. The &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement thus lost its initial impetus. The structural weaknesses of the Bakufu however remained an issue, and the focus of opposition would then shift to creating a strong government under a single authority.

=== Mito Rebellion ===

On 2 May 1864, the Mito rebellion erupted against the power of the shogunate in the name of the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot;. The Shogunate managed to send an army to quell the revolt, which ended with the surrender of the rebels on 14 January 1865.

=== First Chōshū Expedition ===

In the Kinmon Incident on 20 August 1864, troops from Chōshū Domain attempted to take control of Kyoto and the Imperial Palace in order to pursue the objective of &quot;Sonnō Jōi&quot;. This also led to a punitive expedition by the Tokugawa government, the First Chōshū expedition.

=== Hyōgo Naval Expedition ===

As the Bakufu proved incapable to pay the $3,000,000 indemnity demanded by foreign nations for the intervention at Shimonoseki, foreign nations agreed to reduce the amount in exchange for a ratification of the Harris Treaty by the Emperor, a lowering of customs tariffs to a uniform 5%, and the opening of the harbours of Hyōgo (modern Kōbe) and Osaka to foreign trade. In order to press their demands more forcefully, a squadron of four British, one Dutch and three French warships were sent to the harbour of Hyōgo in November 1865. Other displays of force were made by foreign forces, until the Emperor finally agreed to change his total opposition to the Treaties, by formally allowing the &quot;shōgun&quot; to handle negotiations with foreign powers. An agreements providing for the tariff revision was signed in June 1866.

These conflicts led to the realization that head-on conflict with Western nations was not a solution for Japan. As the Bakufu continued its modernization efforts, Western &quot;daimyōs&quot; (especially from Satsuma and Chōshū) also continued to modernize intensively in order to build a stronger Japan and to establish a more legitimate government under Imperial power.

=== Second Chōshū Expedition ===
The shogunate led a second punitive expedition against Chōshū from June 1866, but the shogunate was defeated by the more modern and better organized troops of Chōshū. The new &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu managed to negotiate a ceasefire due to the death of the previous &quot;shōgun&quot;, but the prestige of the shogunate was nevertheless seriously affected.

This reversal encouraged the Bakufu to take drastic steps towards modernization.

== The downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate (1867–69) ==



=== Modernization ===

During the last years of the &quot;bakufu&quot;, or &quot;bakumatsu&quot;, the &quot;bakufu&quot; took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti-Western sentiment throughout the country.

Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral Enomoto Takeaki. The French naval engineer Léonce Verny was hired to build naval arsenals, such as Yokosuka and Nagasaki. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, the Japanese navy of the &quot;shōgun&quot; already possessed eight western-style steam warships around the flagship &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot;, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the Boshin War, under the command of Admiral Enomoto. A French Military Mission to Japan was established to help modernize the armies of the Bakufu. Japan sent a delegation to and participated in the 1867 World Fair in Paris.

Tokugawa Yoshinobu (informally known as Keiki) reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and &quot;shōgun&quot; following the unexpected death of Tokugawa Iemochi in mid-1866. In 1867, Emperor Kōmei died and was succeeded by his second son, Mutsuhito, as Emperor Meiji. Tokugawa Yoshinobu tried to reorganize the government under the Emperor while preserving the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s leadership role, a system known as &quot;kōbu gattai&quot;. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chōshū &quot;daimyōs&quot;, other &quot;daimyōs&quot; called for returning the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s political power to the emperor and a council of &quot;daimyōs&quot; chaired by the former Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;. With the threat of an imminent Satsuma-Chōshū led military action, Yoshinobu moved pre-emptively by surrendering some of his previous authority.

=== Boshin War ===
After Keiki had temporarily avoided the growing conflict, anti-shogunal forces instigated widespread turmoil in the streets of Edo using groups of &quot;rōnin&quot;. Satsuma and Chōshū forces then moved on Kyoto in force, pressuring the Imperial Court for a conclusive edict demolishing the shogunate. Following a conference of &quot;daimyōs&quot;, the Imperial Court issued such an edict, removing the power of the shogunate in late 1867. The Satsuma, Chōshū, and other &quot;han&quot; leaders and radical courtiers, however, rebelled, seized the imperial palace, and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868. Keiki nominally accepted the plan, retiring from the Imperial Court to Osaka at the same time as resigning as &quot;shōgun&quot;. Fearing a feigned concession of the shogunal power to consolidate power, the dispute continued until culminating in a military confrontation between Tokugawa and allied domains with Satsuma, Tosa and Chōshū forces, in Fushimi and Toba. With the turning of the battle toward anti-shogunal forces, Keiki then quit Osaka for Edo, essentially ending both the power of the Tokugawa and the shogunate that had ruled Japan for over 250 years.

Following the Boshin War (1868–1869), the &quot;bakufu&quot; was abolished, and Keiki was reduced to the ranks of the common &quot;daimyōs&quot;. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the &quot;bakufu&quot; naval forces under Admiral Enomoto Takeaki continued to hold out for another six months in Hokkaidō, where they founded the short-lived Republic of Ezo. This defiance ended in May 1869 at the Battle of Hakodate, after one month of fighting.

<doc id="199746" wikidata="Q940574" url="?curid=199746" title="Reliant Fox">
<text>The Reliant Fox is a small four-wheeled glass-fibre utility vehicle manufactured between 1983 and 1990 by the Reliant Motor Company in Tamworth, England. It used Reliant&#x27;s own 848cc aluminium inline four-cylinder engine and a galvanised chassis based on that of the Reliant Kitten.

The Fox was one of several small four-wheeled economy vehicles produced by Reliant, a manufacturer well known for its three-wheeled cars and trucks. The Fox could be configured as a pickup with a hard or soft top, an estate car, a van or a convertible, as desired.

== Development ==
Reliant had exported technology and designs to several companies and in several countries, including those of the Reliant Robin and Reliant TW9 (aka The Ant) to MEBEA in Greece. But in the case of the Fox, a &quot;reverse&quot; course was followed. In the late 1970s MEBEA attempted to develop a &quot;passenger-utility&quot; vehicle, a type then very popular in Greece, as laws allowed such cars to be taxed as &quot;commercial vehicles&quot; at a rate lower than passenger cars. Because of the law, several companies built such vehicles in Greece, including &quot;Namco&quot;, &quot;Autokinitoviomihania Ellados&quot;, &quot;MAVA&quot;, &quot;Automeccanica&quot; and others. MEBEA, which had already built the Robin under licence, modified the four-wheel chassis of the Kitten to carry greater weight and developed the prototype of the light utility vehicle which would become the Fox, complete with glass-fibre reinforced body.

For the body design, the Fox appears to have been inspired by an Italian car, the Fiore 127 Gypsy (which was based on the Fiat 127).

In order to produce the Fox, however, MEBEA had to deal jump the hurdle of obtaining &quot;type certification&quot;. The process was particularly complex for locally developed &quot;passenger cars&quot;, but less so for other types of vehicles. Thus, &quot;MEBEA did what other Greek companies had also done&quot;: it found a partner abroad to obtain type certification, for which the procedure was much easier for vehicles that were already certified in another country. Reliant was the obvious choice and it played a significant role in the final development and certification of the version.

After the Fox was no longer being built in Greece, Reliant reused the design for itself instead of shelving it. The UK version had many details changed from the Greek version, with Reliant reportedly spending £500,000 on modifications for the domestic version. Reliant started producing the Fox in its Tamworth factory in 1983, as an &quot;informal successor&quot; to the Kitten. 
After UK production ended in 1990, a restyle was planned, using the hatchback from the forthcoming Robin and a front end design similar to that of the Reliant Metrocab. But this never got further than the drawing board stage.

== Production ==
Greece

The car was produced in Greece as the MEBEA Fox beginning in 1979. When the law favouring such &quot;passenger-utility&quot; cars was changed in 1983, sales declined and production ended after about 3000 Foxes had been built. That number may have been &quot;inflated&quot; by the manufacturer, though, as automotive historian Labros S. Skartis writes that the true production number may have been closer to 1000.

The UK

After production ended in Greece, the Fox was built in the UK until 1990. According to the Reliant Kitten Register, which keeps track of all small four-wheeled Reliants, &quot;Fox production topped the 1000 mark between 1983 and 1988&quot;, a number that conflicts with the &quot;just over 600&quot; claimed by The Reliant Motor Club as having been built between 1983 and 1990.

Relatively few Foxes seem to have survived. &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine reported in 2017 that official motor vehicle registration data for 2015 showed just one Fox on the road in the UK, but noted that this figure could be higher as it did not include Foxes on SORN (Statutory Off Road Notice). However, another website says that in 2017, UK vehicle registration data showed 37 Foxes licensed for road use and 123 on full- or part-time SORN.

Mebea Fox

The Mebea Fox was created around the Reliant Kitten chassis and its low weight, glass-fibre body, 10-inch wheels and 145 X 10 tyres helped make it a &quot;fun in the sun vehicle&quot;, similar to those made by other manufacturers. Like the Kitten, it used the standard Reliant 848cc engine. The Greek Fox weighed 521 kg (1146 lbs) and had a rear axle ratio of 3.55:1.

Reliant Fox

In 1983, the first year of UK production, the Fox used Reliant&#x27;s usual 848cc aluminium inline four-cylinder engine of 40 hp, which drove the rear wheels through an all-synchromesh four-speed manual gearbox. The rear axle ration was 4.1:1, which allowed the vehicle to carry a 380 kg (840 lb) payload in a &quot;surprisingly large loadspace&quot; measuring 1180 mm (46.5 in) in length by 1250 mm (49.0 in) in width. The body was &quot;rust free GRP&quot; and the chassis &quot;rust resistant galvanised steel&quot;. The Fox&#x27;s overall length was 3380 mm (133 in), its width was 1540 mm (60.5 in) and it rolled on 155 X 12SR radial tyres. Reliant noted that its 7.62 m (25 ft) turning circle was the same as that of a London taxicab, making it &quot;equally at home making deliveries in city traffic or out on the farm&quot;. The Fox handbook gives its unladen weight as 640 kg (1410 lbs).

The Fox went on sale in the UK in May 1983, after being shown at the 1982 British Motor Show. Reliant hoped that it would &quot;fill a niche&quot; left by the British Motor Corporation taking the Mini Moke out of production.

The UK version of the Fox had a number of modifications from the Greek version, the most noticeable of which was that the front of the vehicle gained a &quot;skirt&quot; for better aerodynamics at speed. Wheels were 12-inches in diameter instead of 10-inches and the brakes had also had some alterations.

Beginning in its second year of production, 1984, the Fox used the Reliant HT-E &quot;economy&quot; engine, as was fitted to the Reliant Rialto, and which was known as the &quot;yellow top&quot; because of its colour. While still displacing 848cc, it produced 37.5 bhp instead of the 40 bhp from Reliant&#x27;s standard &quot;red top&quot; engine.

The yellow top also had more low-end torque and by lowering the Fox&#x27;s rear axle ratio to 4.1:1, it was able to pull additional weight. Heavier springs and a more robust tie bar on the front suspension were added to make the vehicle more suited to commercial uses. The top speed of the Fox was 78 mph and it was able to attain 60 mpg with the yellow top engine. However, a second website quotes much lower mpg for the Fox. Fuelly.com has compiled information on Foxes driven in real world conditions and found a 1984 model that delivers 37.8 mpg and a 1985 that returns 35.4 mpg. Both vehicles are in regular usage.
The Reliant Tempest 850 two-seater sports car and the Vantique van were built on Kitten or Fox chassis, as either kit cars or factory-built, after the Kitten and Fox went out of production. Other vehicles built on Kitten/Fox running gear are the Cipher, the Jimp, the Salamander, the Asquith van and the Liege sports car.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Funabashi has increased rapidly over the past century.

==History==
The name &quot;Funabashi&quot; is mentioned in the Kamakura period chronicle &quot;Azuma Kagami.&quot; However, the name itself is even more ancient, dating from before the Nara period and the Yamatotakeru mythology. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic period and shell middens from the Jōmon period in the area, indicating continuous inhabitation for thousands of years. A number of Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in the area claim to have been founded in the Nara period or Heian period. During the Muromachi periods, the area was controlled by the Chiba clan. During the Sengoku period, the Chiba clan fought the Satomi clan to the south, and the Late Hōjō clan to the west. After the defeat of the Chiba clan, the area came within the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the area prospered as a post town on the river crossing of the Tone River, and was largely retained as &quot;tenryō&quot; under the direct control of the Shogunate and administered through a number of . The area was also a favored hunting grounds for the Shōgun. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, Funabashi was the location of a minor skirmish between Tokugawa loyalists under Enomoto Takeaki and the pro-Imperial forces of Okayama Domain and Satsuma Domain, during which most of the town burned down.

After the abolition of the han system, the area eventually became part of Chiba Prefecture. Funabashi Town was one of several towns and villages created on April 1, 1889, under Inba District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area developed rapidly due to its proximity to Tokyo and the presence of numerous military facilities in the area. On April 1, 1937, Funabashi was elevated to city status through merger with neighboring Katsushika Town and Yasakae, Hoden and Tsukada Villages. The new city was host to numerous military installations in World War II, and was bombed in the air raids on Japan in 1945.

The city developed rapidly in the postwar period, with the development of industries, public housing developments and port facilities. With the annexation of neighboring Ninomiya Town in 1953, the population exceeded 100,000. The population exceeded 300,000 in 1969 and 500,000 in 1982. Funabashi was designated a core city on April 1, 2005, with increased local autonomy from the central government. The population exceeded 600,000 in 2006.

==Government==
Funabashi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 50 members. Funabashi contributes seven members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Chiba 4th district and the Chiba 14th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Funabashi is a regional commercial center and, due to its numerous train connections, a bedroom community for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. Approximately 34.5% of the working population commutes to Tokyo, per the 2015 census.

<text>Frans Gunnar Bengtsson (4 October 1894 – 19 December 1954) was a Swedish novelist, essayist, poet and biographer. He was born in Tåssjö (now in Ängelholm Municipality) in Scania and died at Ribbingsfors Manor in northern Västergötland.

==Literary career==
Bengtsson began as a poet, with his debut work &quot;Tärningkast&quot; (Throwing Dice) published in 1923. In 1929, he published his first essay collection titled &quot;Litteratörer och Militärer&quot; (Writers and Warriors) with contributions on François Villon, Walter Scott, Joseph Conrad, and Stonewall Jackson; he would publish four more collections during the rest of his career. His essays mainly dealt with literary and historical subjects. A selection was translated into English in 1950 and published as &quot;A Walk to an Ant Hill and Other Essays&quot;.

His biography on the Swedish king Charles XII (&quot;Karl XII:s levnad&quot;) 1932 is his magnum opus. He describes the king through excerpts from contemporary diaries by officers and common soldiers, and from a wealth of quotes from the published literature. Bengtsson&#x27;s work draws heavily on the biography of Charles XII by Voltaire published in 1731, thirteen years after the king’s death.

Later, Bengtsson became widely known for his Viking saga novel &quot;Röde Orm&quot; (&quot;The Long Ships&quot;), published in two parts in 1941 and 1945. The hero Orm, later called Röde Orm (Red Snake) because of his red beard, is kidnapped as a boy onto a raiding ship and leads an exciting life in the Mediterranean area around the year AD 1000. Later, he makes an expedition eastward into Gardarike. &quot;The Long Ships&quot; was later adapted into a film. The novel was the inspiration for the name of the wireless technology Bluetooth.

Bengtsson once said: &quot;Joan of Arc, Charles XII, and Garibaldi are the persons I would like to meet - for them the truth was more important than intrigues.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bengtsson studied at the University of Lund from 1912, but spent a lot of his time writing poetry and playing chess rather than studying. He graduated with a licentiate degree in English literature in 1930. Bengtsson married Gerda Fineman in 1939 and the couple had a son.

<text>The Red River, also known as the Hong River (; ; Chữ Nôm: 瀧紅) and ( &quot;Main River&quot;; Chữ Nôm: 瀧丐) in Vietnamese, and the  (, &quot;&quot;) in Chinese, is a -long river that flows from Yunnan in Southwest China through northern Vietnam to the Gulf of Tonkin. According to C. Michael Hogan, the associated Red River Fault was instrumental in forming the entire South China Sea at least as early as 37 million years before present. The name red and southern position in China are associated in traditional cardinal directions. The river is relatively shallow, and carries a lot of reddish silt along its way, appearing red brown in colour.

== Geography ==
The Red River begins in China&#x27;s Yunnan province in the mountains south of Dali. Main headstreams Leqiu River, Xi River and Juli River confluence at Nanjian where they form the Lishe River. The Lishe River meets with another headstream, the Yijie River at Hongtupo, Chuxiong Prefecture. It flows generally southeastward, passing through Yi and Dai ethnic minority areas before leaving China through Yunnan&#x27;s Honghe Autonomous Prefecture. It enters Vietnam at Lào Cai province and forms a portion of the international border between China and Vietnam. The river, known as Thao River for this upper stretch, continues its southeasterly course through northwestern Vietnam before emerging from the mountains to reach the midlands. Its main tributaries, the Black River (Da River) and Lô River join in to form the very broad Hồng near the city of Việt Trì, Phú Thọ province.

Downstream from Việt Trì, the river and its main distributaries, the Đuống River, Kinh Thầy River, Bạch Đằng River and the Thái Bình river system spread out to form the Red River Delta. The Red River flows past the Vietnamese capital Hanoi before emptying into the Gulf of Tonkin. Its estuary is an important Ramsar site and forms the main part of the Xuân Thủy National Park.

The reddish-brown heavily silt-laden water gives the river its name. The Red River is notorious for its violent floods with its seasonally wide volume fluctuations. Intense seasonal floods are made worse by erosion, development, and pollution. The delta is a major agricultural area of Vietnam with vast area devoted to rice. The land is protected by an elaborate network of dikes and levees. 

==As a travel and transportation route==

In the 19th century, the Red River was thought to be a lucrative trade route to China. The late 19th-century French explorers were able to travel up the Red River until Manhao in South Yunnan, and then overland toward Kunming.

The Red River remained the main commercial travel route between the French Indochina and Yunnan until the opening of the Kunming–Haiphong Railway in 1910. Although French steamers would be able to go as far upstream as Lao Cai during the rainy season, during the dry season (November to April) steamship would not go upstream of Yên Bái; thus, during that part of the year goods were moved by small vessels (junks).

Thanks to the river, Haiphong was in the early 20th century the sea port most easily accessible from Kunming. Still, the travel time between Haiphong and Kunming was reckoned by the Western authorities at 28 days: it involved 16 days of travel by steamer and then a small boat up the Red River to Manhao (425 miles), and then 12 days overland (194 miles) to Kunming.

Manhao was considered the head of navigation for the smallest vessels (&quot;wupan&quot; 五版); so Yunnan&#x27;s products such as tin would be brought to Manhao by pack mules, where they would be loaded to boats to be sent downstream. On the Manhao to Lao Cai section, where the current may be quite fast, especially during the freshet season, traveling upstream in an &quot;wupan&quot; was much more difficult than downstream. According to one report, one could descend from Manhao to Lao Cai in just 10 hours, while sailing in the reverse direction could take 10 days, and sometimes as much as one month.

==Dams==
Several hydroelectric dams have been constructed on the Red River in Yunnan:
* Da Wan Dam
* Dachunhe I Dam
* Dachunhe II Dam
* Nansha Dam, near Nansha Town, Yuanyang County
* Madushan Dam, near Manhao Town, Gejiu City

Many more dams exist on the Red River&#x27;s tributaries, both in Yunnan and in Vietnam. One of the earliest of them is the Thác Bà Dam in Vietnam, constructed in 1972, which forms the Thác Bà Lake.

<doc id="199772" wikidata="Q5158403" url="?curid=199772" title="Concept testing">
<text>Concept testing (to be distinguished from pre-test markets and test markets which may be used at a later stage of product development research) is the process of using surveys (and sometimes qualitative methods) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the market. It is important not to confuse concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing, as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

==Questionnaires==

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting cognitive interviewing. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest, quasi-simplex, or mutlitrait-multimethod models.
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).

==Concept testing==

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

==Presentation modes==

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic, comparative, or proto-monadic. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

* Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
* Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
* Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
* Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

&quot;Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed.&quot; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to &#x27;norms databases&#x27;. These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be &#x27;monadic&#x27; concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain &#x27;new&#x27; concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst&#x27;s &#x27;Concept Check&#x27;, Acupoll&#x27;s &#x27;Concept Optimizer&#x27;, Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a &#x27;simulator&#x27; tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

Volumetric concept testing

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide &#x27;approximate&#x27; sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include &#x27;Acupoll Foresight&#x27; and Decision Analyst&#x27;s &#x27;Conceptor&#x27;.

Some models (more properly referred to as &#x27;pre-test market models&#x27; or &#x27;simulated test markets&#x27;) gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

<doc id="199773" wikidata="Q26422" url="?curid=199773" title="Salween River">
<text>The Salween is a Southeast Asian river, about long, flowing from the Tibetan Plateau south into the Andaman Sea. The Salween flows primarily within southwest China and eastern Myanmar (Burma), with a short section forming the border of Burma and Thailand. Throughout most of its course, it runs swiftly through rugged mountain canyons. Despite the river&#x27;s great length, only the last are navigable, where it forms a modest estuary and delta at Mawlamyine. The river is known by various names along its course, including the Thanlwin (named after &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot; sp., an olive-like plant that grows on its banks) in Burma and the Nu Jiang (or Nu River, named after Nu people) in China. The commonly used spelling &quot;Salween&quot; is an anglicisation of the Burmese name dating from 19th-century British maps.

Due to its great range of elevation and latitude coupled with geographic isolation, the Salween basin is considered one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the world, containing an estimated 25 percent of the world&#x27;s terrestrial animal species and thousands of plant species. Along its course the Salween provides water for agriculture and supports abundant fisheries, especially in the delta region. The Salween basin is home to numerous ethnic minority groups, whose ancestors largely originated in the Tibetan Plateau and northwest China. Starting about 5,000 years ago, people began migrating south along the river, establishing small kingdoms and city-states.

During the last 1,000 years, the Salween has defined various frontiers of the Burmese empires to the west, the Kingdom of Siam to the south, and Imperial China to the east, with the Shan States along the middle Salween being a frequently contested area. In the 19th century, the British Empire invaded Burma with Mawlamyine serving as the colonial capital for many decades. Since Burmese independence in 1948, the Salween basin has been a battleground for several fronts of the Burmese Civil War, with large areas in Shan State and Karen State (Kayin State) contested between the Burmese military and local ethnic militias.

The Salween is one of the least fragmented large river systems in Asia, with only a few small dams in the headwaters of the river and on tributaries. The river has extremely high hydropower potential, with a fall of more than from its source. Since the 1970s, the Burmese and Thai governments have sought to build massive hydroelectric dams along the river. China also planned to dam the upper Salween, but in 2016 these plans were dropped in favor of establishing a national park. The future of dam projects in Myanmar and Thailand remains uncertain.

==Geography and naming==
The Salween basin includes about , of which 48 percent is in China, 44 percent in Burma, and 8 percent in Thailand. The basin is extremely long and narrow, situated between the Irrawaddy and Brahmaputra river systems on the west and the Mekong system on the east, and sharing a shorter boundary with the Yangtze system to the north. With a mean elevation of , the Salween basin includes numerous glaciated mountain ranges, and the river flows for much of its length at high elevation. In China, the Salween basin is situated in Tibet Autonomous Region and Yunnan. In Burma the Salween flows through Shan State, Karenni State, Karen State and Mon State. In Thailand the Salween borders only on Mae Hong Son Province, with tributaries extending into Chiang Mai, Tak and Kanchanaburi Province.

The average flow rate at the China–Burma border is .
Along the Burma–Thailand border the Salween carries an average annual flow of . The estimated flow rate at the mouth is . About 89 percent of the annual flow occurs in the monsoon season (mid-May through November), and only 11 percent in the remainder of the year.

The average volume of sediment in the Salween Delta is around 180 million tonnes per year.

The population of the Salween basin is estimated at 24 million, or 76 persons/km2. About 10 million people live adjacent or close to the river proper. People of the Salween basin represent a large diversity of ethnic groups. In China, the Salween basin is home to Blang, Derung, Lisu, Nu, Palaung (De&#x27;ang), Shan, Tibetan and Wa. In Burma and Myanmar, the major ethnic groups include Akha, Lahu, Lisu, Hmong, Kachin, Karen, Karenni, Kokang, Pa&#x27;O, Shan and Yao. The highest population densities are in Mon State (300 people/km2) and Yunnan (100 people/km2), while the lowest population density is in Tibet (5 people/km2).

===Upper Salween (China)===

The Salween originates in the Tanggula Mountains in the central Tibetan Plateau. The headwaters are located near Dengka Peak, east of Tanggula Pass. The highest source is Jiangmeiergang Galou glacier, above sea level. The various headwater streams flow southwest through high mountain valleys and accumulate in Cona Lake, at . Downstream of the lake, the Tibetan section of the river is called &quot;Gyalmo Nagqu&quot;, &quot;black river&quot;. In Tibet the river flows mostly within Nagqu prefecture.

From Cona Lake, the river flows south and turns east near Nagqu Town, where the Chalong hydroelectric station is situated. Further east, the river is dammed at the smaller Jiquan hydroelectric station. As of 2017, these are the only two dams on the Salween River proper. Continuing east, it is joined by the Ka, Suo and Ga rivers, all flowing from the southern slope of the Tanggula Mountains. In Biru County, the river begins a series of turns south and southeast, passing through Nyingchi prefecture. Shortly before entering Yunnan, it is joined from the east by the Yu River, its longest tributary within China.

The Tibetan portion of the Salween basin is lightly populated, especially in the frigid headwater regions where precipitation is scarce and river flow depends almost entirely on glacier melt. The upper Salween basin includes more than of glaciers.

In Yunnan, the Salween is known as the Nujiang () or &quot;Nu River&quot;, after the indigenous Nu people, but also translating literally to &quot;angry river&quot;. (The character is only a homophone, due to Chinese having no phonetic script.) For more than the Salween runs parallel to, and west of the headwaters of the Mekong and Yangtze, separated by high mountain ridges of the Hengduan Mountains. The Gaoligong Mountains west of the Salween form the border between China and Burma. Between the Salween and Mekong rivers around the Tibet–Yunnan boundary are the Meili Xue Shan, which include Kawagarbo, the highest peak in the Salween basin at .

Much of the river within Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a World Heritage Site. Forming canyons up to deep, this section is often called the &quot;Grand Canyon of the East&quot;.

Continuing south, the river crosses the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau via a series of deep canyons broken by wider valleys. In Longling County it is joined by the Kuke River and turns west, entering Burma. The total length of the river in China is , not including a short segment along the China–Burma border. By the time it leaves China the Salween has descended more than from its source.

===Lower Salween (Burma and Thailand)===

In Burma the Salween river is officially known as &quot;Thanlwin&quot;; in Shan State, which the river enters immediately upon leaving China, it is also known as &quot;Nam Khone&quot;. Turning south, the river slices a winding course through the vast upland region known as the Shan Hills. This area is characterized by a complex, broken topography of small mountain ranges, plateaus and cliffs, through which the Salween has cut an extensive series of gorges. As the Salween flows south and descends in elevation, it travels from temperate to subtropical and finally tropical climate zones, with yearly precipitation ranging from in the Shan Hills area. The total length of the river in Burma and Thailand is .

In Shan State and Karenni State (Kayah State) the river is joined by several large tributaries, including the Nanding River and Hka River from the east, and the Pang, Teng, and Pawn Rivers from the west. The Pang River is noted for its extensive limestone formations near the confluence with the Salween, where it breaks into a myriad of cataracts, channels and islets known as &quot;Kun Heng&quot;, &quot;Thousand Islands&quot;. Inle Lake, the second largest lake in Burma and a World Biosphere Reserve, drains into the Salween by way of the Pawn River.

Further south, the river enters Karen State (Kayin State) and forms the border between Burma and Thailand for about . In Thailand the river is known as &quot;Salawin&quot;; much of the Thai side of the border is part of Salawin National Park and the Salawin Wildlife Sanctuary. At the south end of the border section it is joined by the northwest-flowing Moei River, which forms the Burma–Thailand border south of this point. In Karen State, the river flows through karst limestone hills where numerous caves and unusual rock formations line the banks, particularly around the city of Hpa-An.

The Salween emerges from the mountains into the coastal plain near Hlaingbwe Township. Near the coast, annual rainfall is as high as , supporting dense tropical rainforest as well as a productive rice industry. The river flows for a further before terminating at a modestly sized delta and estuary in Mawlamyine in Mon State. The Salween is tidally influenced up to inland. Here it is joined by the Gyaing River from the east and the Ataran river from the southeast. The Thanlwin Bridge, the second longest bridge in Burma, connects Mawlamyine to Mottama. The combined river then breaks into the Dayebauk (north) and Mawlamyine (south) channels, forming Bilugyun Island before emptying into the Gulf of Martaban.

==Geology==
The present course of the Salween began to form about 5 million years ago as the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia, resulting in the uplift of the Himalaya mountains and the Tibetan Plateau. Prior to the Himalaya orogeny, what are now the upper Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong and Yangtze rivers may have all flowed into the Red River, emptying into the South China Sea. The landscape was hilly but not particularly rugged, with average elevations of or less. As the continents converged, a complex jumble of mountains arose, breaking the ancestral Red into different drainage systems, with the Yangtze heading east towards the Pacific, and the Mekong and Salween flowing south into what is now Thailand&#x27;s Chao Phraya River. About 1.5 million years ago, volcanic activity diverted the Salween west towards the Andaman Sea, roughly creating the modern path of the river.
The parallel modern courses of the upper Salween, Mekong and Yangtze are located where the eastern Tibetan Plateau intersects the uplands of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The mountain ranges separating these rivers are individual terranes (crustal fragments) that accreted separately to the Asian continent – forming a basin and range landscape with drainage running from north to south – then compressed together such that the rivers flow only apart in places. As the mountains continued to rise, the rivers incised into the landscape along parallel fault zones, creating the deep canyons of the present day. The Nujiang fault zone stretches over along the river in Yunnan.

The formation of the Himalayas blocked drainage from the Tibetan Plateau south towards the Indian Ocean, forcing drainage north of the mountains east towards the Yangtze river. This east-flowing river, the predecessor of the modern Yarlung Tsangpo river, was repeatedly captured into drainages to the south, finding various routes to the sea via the Red, Mekong, Salween and Irrawaddy rivers. The combined Salween–Yarlung Tsangpo drainage would have been much longer than the modern Salween, stretching an additional west across the Tibetan Plateau. Ultimately the Yarlung Tsangpo was captured by the Brahmaputra River in present-day India. The Salween may once have had additional tributaries above its present source, but due to the uplift of the Himalaya blocking moisture from the Indian Ocean, these tributaries dried up, leaving the numerous terminal lakes scattered across Nagqu today.

The Salween carries an estimated 108 to 237 million tonnes of sediment per year. About 92 percent of sediment is delivered to the ocean during the monsoon season. The Salween delta is physically contiguous with the Irrawaddy and Sittaung deltas. The Irrawaddy–Sittaung–Salween delta is relatively stable, with the coastline advancing an average of per year between 1925 and 2006. Sediment accumulation is largely balanced out by subsidence and transport by ocean currents. However, proposed dams along the Salween would trap much of the sediment with potential detrimental impacts to coastal erosion.

==Ecology==
The Salween basin is home to thousands of species of plants, with the highest plant diversity found in Yunnan&#x27;s Three Parallel Rivers region. The Three Parallel Rivers protected areas include the Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve and the Nu Jiang Reserve within the Salween basin; the Gaoligongshan reserve has more than 4,300 plant species. The Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests, situated along the Nu River in western Yunnan, span elevations of and range from subtropical broadleaf evergreen to subalpine conifer forests. The rare &quot;Taiwania&quot;, one of the largest conifers in Asia, is found here along with more than twenty other conifer species. Due to its rugged and inaccessible terrain, this is considered one of the most intact large forest regions in China. The Mekong–Salween divide forms a significant floral and faunal barrier as well as a rain shadow, and has been regarded as a major driver of plant speciation in the region.
Around the Burma–China border, the Salween flows through the Northern Indochina subtropical forests ecoregion, which consists largely of subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forests, with pine forests at higher elevations and tropical forests at the lower margins. Further south in Burma and Thailand, the Salween basin includes the Kayah-Karen montane rain forests, where the karst limestone landscape of cliffs, sinkholes and caverns lends itself to a multitude of forest types. Limestone soils host drought deciduous forests, while dipterocarp–dominant tropical forests occur on granitic soils. Montane deciduous forests are widespread in the Shan Hills. Mangrove forests occur in the Salween delta, especially on Bilugyun Island.

The basin supports about 151 fish species, with 77 of those found in the upper Salween. The Salween has numerous cyprinid species, including the endangered &quot;Garra cryptonema&quot; and &quot;Akrokolioplax bicornis&quot; which are endemic to the basin. Inle Lake in Shan State, designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2015, provides habitat for numerous endemic fish species. The Thousand Islands area at the Salween–Pang confluence, as well as the confluence of the Salween and Moei rivers, are also identified as critical fish habitat. The Salween shares most of its fish species with the nearby Irrawaddy and Sittaung Rivers. The river also hosts a number of invasive exotic fish which were introduced for commercial purposes. In addition to fish, the Salween provides habitat for 92 amphibian species. The Salween has the greatest diversity of turtles of any river in the world. The endangered Giant Asian pond turtle and Big-headed turtle are found here.

The Salween basin includes up to 25% of the world&#x27;s terrestrial animal species. About one-half of all animal species in China can be found in the upper Salween, which provides habitat for endangered species including the snow leopard and black snub-nosed monkey. The remote jungles of the Salween basin in Burma and Thailand, particularly in Kayin and Shan states, are home to dozens of large mammal species including the Indochinese tiger, clouded leopard, Asiatic black bear, sun bear, eastern hoolock gibbon, and the Sunda pangolin. Limestone caves along the Salween in Thailand are home to numerous bat species, including the endemic Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat, the smallest known bat species in the world. The Nam San Valley along the Shan reach of the river provides habitat for the critically endangered white-rumped vulture and the slender-billed vulture. In the Salween delta, wetlands provide habitat for fishing cat, Asian small-clawed otter and Siamese crocodile, among other species.

==Economic uses==
===Agriculture===
Along its lower course the Salween sustains both flood and irrigated agriculture. The Salween delta is a major rice-growing area; it is the single most productive agricultural region in the Salween basin and home to over 500,000 people. Rice paddies are highly dependent on the river&#x27;s annual flooding, bringing deposits of rich sediment. Other crops grown in the Salween basin include maize, wheat, chili, cotton, potatoes, groundnut, sesame, pulses, betel, tea, and various vegetables. Certain areas of the floodplain are suitable for both farming and fishing, such as the seasonal Daw Lar Lake upstream of Hpa-An, where crops are grown on islands in the lake during the dry season. Following the annual harvest, the land is used for grazing livestock. In the rainy season fish migrate from the Salween River to spawn in the lake, and are caught in large numbers as the water level recedes at the end of the season. The Salween generally floods in July–September and reaches its lowest around October–December. Compared to Burma&#x27;s principal rice growing region, the Irrawaddy delta, the Salween delta floods more erratically, and is prone to drought for 1–2 years out of five.
Approximately of land are irrigated in the Salween basin, with 50 percent in Burma, 42 percent in China and 8 percent in Thailand. About 97 percent is irrigated with surface water, and the rest with groundwater. Total water withdrawals amount to less than 3 percent of the river flow at . In recent years rubber, sugarcane and corn have become major cash crops, with the majority of this production exported to China. From 1998 to 2010, the area cultivated for rubber in Mon State increased fivefold, accompanied by significant deforestation.

Further upstream, the river provides a water source for numerous remote villages. With arable land limited by mountainous terrain, farming occurs primarily on the seasonally flooded river banks and islands. However, forest land has been increasingly converted to agriculture, which has led to sedimentation and other water quality issues. The higher elevation valleys are used for grazing, particularly in Tibet, where yaks, sheep, goats, horses and cattle are raised. Forests along the Salween in eastern Burma are home to dozens of medicinal plants crucial to the production of traditional herbal medicines. Some medicinal plants are cultivated, while others are harvested wild in the forest. Many wild species are threatened by deforestation and agricultural conversion.

===Fishing===

The Salween estuary and delta is a particularly rich fishery, with the complex network of tidal channels providing a diversity of habitats for freshwater, brackish and marine fishes. Subsistence fishing is predominant along the inland channels and bays, while a large commercial fishery is supported offshore. The most important commercial species include Nga pone na (Paradise threadfin) and Nga pyat (Coitor croaker). Prawns and shrimps are important in the local diet. Villages further upstream also depend on Salween fish, with Inle Lake being a particularly rich fishery.

Overfishing combined with lack of regulation has become an issue in the 21st century, with catches in the lower Salween declining as much as 60 percent at some villages. The use of large &quot;bag nets&quot; that result in excessive bycatch, as well as the use of illegal poisons by commercial fishermen, have also contributed to the decline. Increased sedimentation from upstream logging has made the estuary shallower and reduced its productivity, in turn reducing the rate of fish migration and spawning. The Burmese government has made efforts to address the issues, including seasonal fishing bans first implemented in 2012, but these laws have been rarely enforced. An alternative approach, using small, self-enforced community-based reserves where fishing is not allowed, has successfully protected fish populations and species diversity in northern Thailand.

===Logging and mining===
Forests along the Salween are prime sources of tropical hardwoods including teak, pyinkadoe (red ironwood) and padauk (Burmese rosewood). Logging in the Burmese part of the basin first occurred on a large scale during the British colonial period in the 19th century. Clearcutting has destabilized soils along the river and raised sediment loads. Due to the lack of good roads across most of the basin, the majority of timber is transported via waterways during the rainy season. In China, some forests in western Yunnan were intensively logged until the 1990s, when logging was banned there due to environmental impacts.

The rate of deforestation has increased sharply in the 21st century, particularly in Shan, Karenni and Karen states. Before 2010, armed conflicts made it difficult for logging companies to access many of these areas. After a 2010 peace agreement signed between ethnic militias and the Myanmar Union Government, commercial logging was able to increase dramatically in Karenni State. The Burmese government has banned the cutting of teak, but illegal logging for teak has persisted, driven by strong demand abroad. On the Thai side of the river, illegal logging has been ongoing since the 1990s in Salawin National Park.

In Karen State, limestone quarrying for cement production along the river has increased in the 21st century. There is also increasing sand and gravel mining in the lower river. As of 2015 the Burmese government was seeking international investment in the mining sector, and new policies could lead to considerable increase in mining activity along the river.

==History==

Human presence along the upper Salween River dates to at least 31,000–39,000 years ago. Archeological evidence includes stone tools and animal remains discovered along the river bank in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.

The Mon are some of the earliest inhabitants of the Salween basin within Burma, migrating south from China around 3000 BCE, and settling in the Salween delta and adjacent coastal areas. Agriculture was first practiced in the Salween and Irrawaddy basins around the first century BCE. Ancestors of the Karen migrated down the Salween River area from the Tibetan Plateau and northwest China starting around 1000 BCE. Tai peoples, ancestors of the Shan, began moving into the Shan Hills area of the middle Salween from Yunnan around 1000 CE and established multiple independent kingdoms, often known as the Shan States.

The Nu people, originating in the Tibetan Plateau, may have inhabited the areas of the Salween (Nu) and Mekong (Lancang) in modern day China as early as 2000 BCE. The Wa people, who today inhabit parts of the Salween basin on both sides of the China–Burma border, migrated south along the river from Tibet around 500–300 BCE. The Lisu people, also originating in Tibet, arrived in Yunnan sometime before 1000 CE. Chinese records begin to mention Lisu in the late Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). The Lisu originally inhabited areas further east in Yunnan, but over centuries they were pushed north and west towards the Salween as more Han people settled in Yunnan.

===Expansion of empires===
Martaban (now Mottama) in the Salween Delta was a major trading port on the Maritime Silk Road as early as 200 BCE. By the 6th century CE, the Thaton Kingdom (one of the early Mon kingdoms) ruled the Salween Delta and surrounding coasts from the capital of Thaton. From 738–902 CE, the kingdom of Nanzhao controlled Yunnan and parts of northern Burma, with the Salween forming its southwestern boundary with the Burmese Pyu city-states. Tang China had several overland trade routes with Burma via Nanzhao, which it was allied with at times. One route started from Yinsheng (around present-day Jingdong, Yunnan) and headed west then south along the Salween River, reaching the Indian Ocean at Martaban. Another crossed the Salween around present day Baoshan, heading west towards India.

In the 1060s King Anawrahta expanded the boundaries of the Pagan Kingdom (First Burmese Empire) from its origins in the Irrawaddy valley, conquering Thaton and the other Mon kingdoms in the Salween delta. In the late 1100s King Narapatisithu (Sithu II) conquered most of the Shan States, extending Burmese rule to the western bank of the Salween river from the delta as far north as Yunnan. For almost 500 years, the lower Salween defined the frontier between Burma and the Ayutthaya Kingdom (Siam).

In the late 1200s, the Pagan Kingdom collapsed after invasions of the Mongol Empire. The Mongols had also conquered the Dali Kingdom (Nanzhao&#x27;s successor). In 1287 the Hanthawaddy Kingdom emerged in the Salween and Irrawaddy deltas. Martaban served as the Hanthawaddy capital between 1287 and 1364. Along the mountainous middle reaches of the Salween River, former Shan vassal states regained their independence. Starting around 1380, Ming China annexed Yunnan and conquered some of the eastern Shan states. From 1436-49, Chinese armies crossed the Salween to wage the Luchuan–Pingmian campaigns against the Shan state of Mong Mao. These wars were an expensive failure for the Ming, and triggered tribal uprisings that fragmented Chinese power in the region.

The Toungoo dynasty emerged in Burma during the 1500s, conquering much of Southeast Asia by 1565 to create the First Toungoo Empire (Second Burmese Empire). King Tabinshwehti captured and destroyed Martaban in 1541. Under the subsequent rule of Bayinnaung, an 800,000-strong army crossed the Salween in 1548 and invaded Siam. This was the first time Burmese rule had been extended east of the Salween river. Subsequently, Bayinnaung moved north up the Salween, subjugating all the independent Shan states by 1557. These victories were enabled in part by the acquisition of firearms from Dutch and Portuguese traders who first reached these coasts around 1511. European mercenaries also fought in some of these battles. At Martaban the Portuguese established a trading post, one of the first European settlements in the area.
In the 1640s, the last years of the Ming dynasty, geographer Xu Xiake explored the Salween River country and determined that the upper Salween, Mekong and Red rivers (previously believed to be part of the same river system) were in fact separate. After the rise of the Qing dynasty China entered a new period of western expansion. In 1717 the Dzungar Khanate conquered Tibet, and China sought to expel them from the region. In 1718 the Qing sent an army but were unsuccessful in reaching Tibet, reaching only as far as the Salween River where they were defeated by Dzungar troops in the Battle of the Salween River. In response, the Qing sent a larger force to Tibet in 1720, driving out the Dzungars and establishing Qing rule of Tibet.

As the Qing pushed into Yunnan, the indigenous Lisu people were driven further west, eventually settling along the Salween in and around Nujiang Prefecture. Although China had been expanding into the area since Ming times, the greatest influx of settlers was around 1700 to 1850. At the same time, Tibet was expanding its influence into western Yunnan. Tibetan parties raided down the Salween valley and took slaves from the indigenous Nu and Derung populations, which were not well politically organized and unable to offer much resistance. On the other hand, the Lisu fiercely resisted efforts to take slaves and land.

In the 1590s Siam had captured the Tenasserim coast, and the Salween delta again became the border with Burma. For more than a hundred years this remained a disputed area, changing hands several times between the Burmese and Siamese. Burmese rule returned to the Salween delta in the 1750s with the expansion of the Konbaung dynasty. Starting in 1759, Martaban served as a launching point for several invasions of Siam, which led to the collapse of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The Burmese were unable to maintain lasting control over territories east of the river, although Burma regained the Tenasserim coast from Siam in a 1793 treaty.

===British rule and World War II===

After the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824, the Konbaung dynasty ceded coastal areas of Burma to the British Empire, including the whole Tenasserim coast south of the Salween River. Due to its strategic location, Mawlamyine (anglicized as Moulmein) served as the capital of British Burma from 1826 until 1852 and as a gateway for overland trade into Yunnan. It became the center of a lucrative timber industry, particularly in teak. Logs were floated down the Salween River to meet oceangoing ships in Mawlamyine port. Forests in the lower Salween basin were extensively logged until the 1890s. Contemporary British maps labeled the river as &quot;Salween&quot;, an anglicization of the Burmese name &quot;Thanlwin&quot;.

At the start of the 20th century, there was still great uncertainty regarding the true sources of the river and how far west it extended into the Himalayas; some believed the upper Brahmaputra River (the Yarlung Tsangpo) might be the true source of the Irrawaddy, Salween or Mekong. In 1935-36, British geographer Ronald Kaulback walked the length of the Salween River from Burma to eastern Tibet, producing some of the first comprehensive maps of the river&#x27;s course. Kaulback allegedly found giant footprints in the snow while attempting to locate the source of the Salween. His report was one of several that popularized the myth of the Yeti in Europe during the 1930s.
During World War II the Japanese Empire invaded Burma, starting at Mawlamyine in January 1942. The Japanese army, numbering 18,000 against 7,000 British defenders, quickly captured Mawlamyine, forcing the British to retreat across the Salween to Martaban. On February 10–11 the Japanese crossed the Salween and the British fled, unprepared for a siege. The Japanese blockaded the Burma Road constructed in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, forcing the British to transport military supplies to China by air across the eastern Himalayas (&quot;The Hump&quot;). The retreating Allied army (primarily Chinese) stopped the Japanese advance at the Salween River on May 5, 1942. After blowing all the bridges crossing the river, the Chinese took defensive positions on the east bank along a front, at which point the fighting reached a stalemate.

From 1944–1945, Allied forces launched the Salween Campaign to retake Burma and reopen the Burma Road. During the initial offensive on May 11, 1944, about 40,000 troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF), led by American General Joseph Stilwell and assisted by US army air forces, crossed the Salween on rubber rafts and attacked the Japanese position west of the river. About 17,000–19,000 Chinese and 15,000 Japanese were killed in the resulting battle, from which the Chinese emerged victorious. In the following days, additional CEF troops crossed the river bringing the total to 100,000, before pushing west into Japanese-held territory. The Salween Campaign concluded on January 20, 1945 with the fall of Wanding. By August 1945 the Allies had retaken Burma from the Japanese.

===1948–present===
In 1948, Burma declared independence from the British Empire. Soon afterwards, ethnic minorities in the Salween River region, including the Kachin, Karen, Mon, and Shan, sought independence, with armed conflicts between these groups and the Burmese military continuing to the present day. The Karen National Union and Mon National Defense Organization took control of the lower Salween River valley, including Mawlamyine and Thaton, in September 1948. However, they were soon pushed out, leading to four years of confused fighting. In 1952, a new Karen state (today&#x27;s Kayin State) was created, with the capital at Hpa-An on the Salween north of Mawlamyine, but the insurgency continued.

In 1950 Chinese Nationalist troops invaded Shan State after being defeated by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, with the aim of creating an independent state from which to retake mainland China. With the help of US forces, the Chinese attempted several times to take land on the west side of the Salween River, but were pushed back by the Burmese army. Although the KMT campaign was unsuccessful, many people of Chinese descent continue to live in the area east of the river. These events contributed to political instability in Shan State. By 1958 several insurgencies had become established in eastern Shan State, including one led by the exiled Communist Party of Burma (CPB, or &quot;White Flag Communists&quot;). This area, part of the Golden Triangle, became a center for illegal opium production during the 1960s. Opium trafficking remains a major source of funding for insurgents.
In the 1970s the Burmese and Thai governments began planning for hydroelectric dams on the Salween River, largely within Shan and Karen-majority areas. Starting in 1979 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand conducted feasibility studies for hydropower and irrigation diversions on the river. Salween development plans gained momentum in 1988, when the SPDC seized power in Burma and sought cross-border economic development with Thailand and China. That same year, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan presented an economic vision for the Salween border region – from a &quot;battlefield into a marketplace&quot;.

In addition to the revenues from electricity production, the SPDC saw dam construction as &quot;part of a strategy to remove ethnic armed groups&quot; from the area. In the years following, the military junta stepped up its attacks in the region, destroying villages and forcing over 500,000 Shan, Kachin and Karen refugees to flee the country, mostly to Thailand. The Salween creates a formidable barrier for refugees, due to its wide fast current, and only small wooden boats are available for crossing it.
 About 150,000 refugees are housed in official camps in Thailand, while hundreds of thousands of more live in illegal camps.

Thailand&#x27;s Salawin National Park was established in 1994. Before that, thousands of refugees had already settled in this area and the adjacent Salawin Wildlife Sanctuary, with more moving in during the years following. The Thai government has made some efforts to remove them, but due to the vast size of the park, enforcement has been difficult. In 1997 a scandal was uncovered in which logs cut on the Thai side of the river were floated across the river to Burma, stamped &quot;exported from Burma&quot; and floated back to the Thai side, where officials inspected the &quot;imported&quot; timber and approved their sale. Refugees in camps within the parks were implicated in the scandal and forced to relocate. However, &quot;observers of forced evictions have stated that the eviction of Thai-Karen villagers from forest reserves is not done to protect the forests but so that [illegal] logging activities can continue without hindrance and with fewer witnesses.&quot;

After the end of military rule in 2011 the Burmese government signed ceasefire agreements with 14 ethnic militias. However, protests followed by armed conflict soon broke out again around the sites of proposed dams, particularly at the Mong Ton (Tasang Dam) in Shan State and the Hatgyi Dam in Karen State. Residents along the Salween River contend the dams would bring no economic benefits locally – as most of the electricity would be exported abroad – while their homes and traditional lands would be flooded with little to no compensation.

Local organizations, including the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network (KESAN), have pushed for the establishment of a &quot;Salween Peace Park&quot; that would manage the river&#x27;s natural resources sustainably via community forests, wildlife sanctuaries, fishery conservation and protected indigenous lands. The park would cover more than along the Salween River and its tributaries in Burma. The proposal was inaugurated in December 2018.

==Dams==
===Burma and Thailand===
Seven dams have been proposed along the main stem of the Salween in Burma and Thailand, with a combined capacity exceeding 20,000 megawatts of electricity – comparable to that of China&#x27;s Three Gorges Dam. The reservoirs would flood of the total river length in Burma, as well as the downstream ends of several tributaries. Electricity generated by these dams would be exported primarily to China and Thailand. In May 2005, a formal Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Burma and Thailand to jointly develop hydropower projects along the Salween River. Since then, a number of Chinese and Thai companies have partnered to develop these projects. In 2015, the newly elected National League for Democracy (NLD) government was expected to downsize or cancel the dam projects. However, the NLD soon announced the projects would go ahead.

The Mong Ton or Tasang Dam is the largest of the planned dams. The dam would be high, and produce up to 7,110 megawatts. The reservoir would flood , splitting Shan State nearly in two. The Hatgyi Dam in downstream Kayin State would be smaller, but would have a more significant impact on the river flow. In addition to producing power, the Hatgyi dam would divert up to 30 percent of the Salween flow during certain seasons into the Ping River, part of Thailand&#x27;s Chao Phraya basin, to benefit agriculture in central Thailand. A smaller alternative to the Salween diversion would be a diversion of the Yuam River (a tributary of the Salween via the Moei River) to the Ping. Tunnels up to long would have to be constructed.

There are numerous concerns surrounding the potential impact of the dams, particularly the effect on agriculture in the Salween delta due to a reduction in the annual floods and sediment supply that maintain soil fertility. Water would be released based on power demand rather than agricultural needs, potentially causing water shortages and saline intrusion in the delta. In addition, there would be numerous ecological impacts, as the dams would block fish migration, and necessitate considerable deforestation to clear the areas to be flooded. The dams would also be located in an area with high earthquake risk.

The Weigyi and Dagwin dams originally slated for the Burma–Thailand border, which would have flooded parts of Salawin National Park, have been suspended since 2015. Five other dams remain in the planning or pre-construction stages. In 2016 the Burmese government announced its intention to complete the remaining dams by 2031.

===China===

In 2000, China initiated the West-East Power Transfer development scheme, to develop large-scale hydropower dams on its western rivers. The Salween (Nu) River basin within China has an estimated 36,400 megawatts of hydropower potential. The power would be exported to southeastern China, particularly the Guangzhou megalopolis. This included thirteen dams on the mainstem of the Nu, with a total capacity of 21,320 megawatts, and a number of small to medium-size projects on tributaries. The tallest mainstem dam, Songta, would be high. In 2003 the Yunnan Huadian Nu River Hydropower Company was created after an agreement between the Yunnan provincial government and the Huadian Group.

The proposal to develop the Nu River, one of China&#x27;s last free-flowing rivers, was met with large protests from local residents as well as from international environmental organizations. If constructed, the dams would have displaced some 56,000 people. In addition, in 2003 the UNESCO World Heritage Committee had voted to list Yunnan&#x27;s Three Parallel Rivers region as a World Heritage Site. Many of the proposed dams fell within this area. In 2004 Premier Wen Jiabao temporarily suspended plans to build dams on the main stem of the river, although a number of hydropower projects on tributaries were ultimately built. In addition, the Chalong and Jiquan hydroelectric projects were built on the uppermost section of the Salween in Tibet. After Wen&#x27;s term of office ended in 2013, power companies made a renewed push for construction of the Nu River dams.

The Yunnan provincial government first proposed a Nu River Grand Canyon National Park in 2007, but did not begin development of this proposal until 2014. In January 2016, Yunnan suspended small hydropower development as well as mining along the Nu River and in May approved the establishment of the national park. In December 2016, China&#x27;s State Energy Administration formally dropped the Nu River dams from its hydropower development plans. A major factor in the cancellation of the dams was the risk of earthquakes along the Nu River fault zone.

<text>John Henry &quot;J.H.&quot; Taylor (19 March 1871 – 10 February 1963) was an English professional golfer and one of the pioneers of the modern game of golf. Taylor is considered to be one of the best golfers of all time. He was a significant golf course architect. Taylor helped to found the British PGA, the world&#x27;s first, and became respected for his administrative work. He also wrote two notable golf books.

==Biography==
Taylor was born in Northam, Devon. He was a member of the fabled Great Triumvirate of the sport in his day, along with Harry Vardon and James Braid, and he won The Open Championship five times. Born into a working-class family, and orphaned as a boy, he began work as a caddie and labourer at the Royal North Devon Golf Club, near Westward Ho!, at the age of eleven. He was employed as a caddie and houseboy by the Hutchinson family and was tasked to carry the bag of Horace Hutchinson. He became a professional golfer at 19, and was employed by Burnham &amp; Berrow Golf Club, the Winchester (later Royal Winchester) Golf Club – while there winning in successive years the first two of his Open Championships – then the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, before eventually moving to the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club from 1899 until his retirement in 1946.

In 1901, Taylor was a co-founder and the first chairman of the British Professional Golfers&#x27; Association. This was the first association for professional golfers in the world. Bernard Darwin wrote that Taylor &quot;had turned a feckless company into a self-respecting and respected body of men&quot;.

Taylor was a factor in the Open Championship from age 22 in 1893, until age 55, when he tied for 11th place in 1926. His five Open victories all took place before the First World War.

Open Championship wins:
* 1894 – Royal St George&#x27;s
* 1895 – St Andrews
* 1900 – St Andrews
* 1909 – Royal Cinque Ports
* 1913 – Royal Liverpool Golf Club

Taylor captained the 1933 Great Britain Ryder Cup team to a win over the United States, and remains the only captain on either side never to have played in any of the matches.

Taylor was also involved in designing courses across England including York Golf Club in 1903, Hindhead Golf Club in 1904, Andover Golf Club in 1907, Frilford Heath&#x27;s Red Course in 1908, Hainault Golf Club&#x27;s Upper Course in 1909, Heaton Park Golf Club (Manchester) in 1912, Hainault Golf Club&#x27;s Lower Course in 1923, Bigbury Golf Club in South Devon in 1926, Pinner Hill Golf Club (Middlesex) 1927, Axe Cliff Golf Club (Seaton, Devon) in 1920s and Batchwood Hall Golf Club (St Albans) in 1935. He is attributed with being the inventor of the &#x27;dogleg&#x27;, although holes of that form had existed on many courses before Taylor began golf course design (for example No. 7 at Old Course at St Andrews and No. 4 at Prestwick Golf Club). He was made an honorary member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1949, and was president of Royal Birkdale, whose course he had designed, in 1957.

A housing development in his hometown of Northam was named in his honour (JH Taylor Drive).

<doc id="199775" wikidata="Q839248" url="?curid=199775" title="Chinglish">
<text>Chinglish is slang for spoken or written English language that is either influenced by a Chinese language, or is poorly translated. In Hong Kong, Macau, Guangdong and Guangxi, the term &quot;Chinglish&quot; refers mainly to Cantonese-influenced English. This term is commonly applied to ungrammatical or nonsensical English in Chinese contexts, and may have pejorative or deprecating connotations. Other terms used to describe the phenomenon include &quot;Chinese English&quot;, &quot;China English&quot;, &quot;Engrish&quot; and &quot;Sinicized English&quot;. The degree to which a Chinese variety of English exists or can be considered legitimate is still up for debate.

==Terminology==

The English word &quot;Chinglish&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Chinese&quot; and &quot;English&quot;. The Chinese equivalent is &quot;Zhōngshì Yīngyǔ&quot; ().

Chinglish can be compared with other interlanguage varieties of English, such as Britalian (from Italian), Czenglish (from Czech), Denglisch (German), Dunglish (Dutch), Franglais (French),
Greeklish (Greek), Manglish (Malaysia), Runglish (Russian),
Spanglish (Spanish), Swenglish (Swedish), Hunglish (Hungarian), Hebrish (Hebrew), Engrish (Japanese), Hinglish (Hindi), Konglish (Korean), Taglish (Tagalog), Bislish (Visayan), Singlish (in Singapore), Ponglish (Polish) and Tinglish (Thai).

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the noun and adjective.
 Chinglish, &quot;n. and a. colloq.&quot; (freq. &quot;depreciative&quot;). Brit. /ˈtʃɪŋglɪʃ/, U.S. /ˈtʃɪŋ(g)lɪʃ/. Forms: 19– Chinglish, 19– Chenglish [rare]. [Blend of Chinese &quot;n&quot;. and English &quot;n&quot;. Compare earlier Japlish &quot;n&quot;., Spanglish &quot;n&quot;. Compare also Hinglish &quot;n.2&quot;, Singlish &quot;n.2&quot;]

A. &quot;n&quot;. A mixture of Chinese and English; esp. a variety of English used by speakers of Chinese or in a bilingual Chinese and English context, typically incorporating some Chinese vocabulary or constructions, or English terms specific to a Chinese context. Also: the vocabulary of, or an individual word from, such a variety. Cf. Singlish n.2

B &quot;adj&quot;. Of or relating to Chinglish; expressed in Chinglish.
This dictionary cites the earliest recorded usage of &quot;Chinglish&quot; (noted as a jocular term) in 1957 and of &quot;Chinese English&quot; in 1857. However, &quot;Chinglish&quot; has been found to date from as early as 1936, making it one of the earliest portmanteau words for a hybrid variety of English. Other colloquial portmanteau words for Chinese English include: &quot;Chenglish&quot; (recorded from 1979), &quot;Chinlish&quot; (1996), &quot;Chinenglish&quot; (1997), &quot;Changlish&quot; (2000) and &quot;Chinelish&quot; (2006).
Chinglish commonly refers to a mixture of English with Modern Standard Mandarin, but it occasionally refers to mixtures with Cantonese, Shanghainese and Taiwanese Hokkien.

Chinglish contrasts with some related terms. Chinese Pidgin English was a lingua franca that originated in the 17th century. &quot;Zhonglish,&quot; a term for Chinese influenced by English, is a portmanteau of () and &quot;English&quot;.

Some peculiar Chinese English cannot be labeled Chinglish because it is grammatically correct, and Victor Mair calls this emerging dialect &quot;Xinhua English or New China News English&quot;, based on the Xinhua News Agency. Take for instance, this headline: &quot;China lodges solemn representation over Japan&#x27;s permission for Rebiya Kadeer&#x27;s visit&quot;. This unusual English phrase literally translates the original Chinese (), combining &quot;put forward; raise; pose bring up&quot;, &quot;serious; stern; unyielding; solemn&quot;, and &quot;mutual relations; negotiation; representation&quot;. &quot;Pure Chinese&quot; is an odd English locution in a Web advertisement: &quot;/ CONFUCIUS INSTITUTE/ Teach you pure Chinese.&quot; This () is Chinese for the Confucius Institute, but Mair notes that &quot;pure Chinese&quot; curiously implies &quot;impure Chinese&quot;.

One author divides Chinglish into &quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;ornamental&quot; categories. &quot;Instrumental Chinglish is actually intended to convey information to English speakers. Ornamental Chinglish is born of the fact that English is the lingua franca of coolness. Meaning aside, any combination of roman letters elevates a commodity – khaki pants, toilet paper, potato chips – to a higher plane of chic by suggesting that the product is geared toward an international audience.&quot;

== History ==

English first arrived in China in 1637, when British traders reached Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou (Canton). In the 17th century, Chinese Pidgin English originated as a lingua franca for trade between British people and mostly Cantonese-speaking Chinese people. This proto-Chinglish term &quot;&quot; originated as a Chinese mispronunciation of the English word &quot;&quot;. Following the First and Second Opium War between 1839–1842, Pidgin English spread north to Shanghai and other treaty ports. Pidgin usage began to decline in the late 19th century when Chinese and missionary schools began teaching Standard English. In 1982, the People&#x27;s Republic of China made English the main foreign language in education. The spelling of words in Chinese education follows British English standards, while the pronunciation in the tape recording adheres to American English. Current estimates for the number of English learners in China range from 300 to 500 million.

Chinglish may have influenced some English expressions that are &quot;calques&quot; or &quot;loan translations&quot; from Chinese Pidgin English, for instance, &quot;lose face&quot; derives from . Some sources claim &quot;long time no see&quot; is a Chinglish calque from . More reliable references note this jocular American English phrase &quot;used as a greeting after prolonged separation&quot; was first recorded in 1900 for a Native American&#x27;s speech, and thus more likely derives from American Indian Pidgin English.

Chinese officials carried out campaigns to reduce Chinglish in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the Expo 2010 in Shanghai.
Soon after Beijing was awarded the 2008 Summer Olympics in 2001, the Beijing Tourism Bureau established a tipster hotline for Chinglish errors on signs, such as emergency exits at the Beijing Capital International Airport reading &quot;No entry on peacetime&quot;. In 2007, the Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Program (BSFLP) reported they had, &quot;worked out 4,624 pieces of standard English translations to substitute the Chinglish ones on signs around the city&quot;, for instance, &quot;Be careful, road slippery&quot; instead of &quot;To take notice of safe: The slippery are very crafty.&quot; BSFLP chairperson Chen Lin said, &quot;We want everything to be correct. Grammar, words, culture, everything. Beijing will have thousands of visitors coming. We don&#x27;t want anyone laughing at us.&quot; Reporting from Beijing, Ben Macintyre lamented the loss of signs like &quot;Show Mercy to the Slender Grass&quot; because, &quot;many of the best examples of Chinglish are delightful, reflecting the inventiveness that results when two such different languages collide&quot;. The Global Language Monitor doubted that Beijing&#x27;s attempt to eradicate Chinglish could succeed, noting that &quot;attempting to map a precise ideogram to any particular word in the million-word English lexicon is a nearly impossible task&quot;, and pointing out that the Games&#x27; official website contained the phrase &quot;we share the charm and joy of the Olympic Games&quot; (using &quot;charm&quot; as a transitive verb).

In Shanghai, for Expo 2010, a similar effort was made to replace Chinglish signs. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article by Andrew Jacobs reported on accomplishments by the Shanghai Commission for the Management of Language Use. &quot;Fortified by an army of 600 volunteers and a politburo of adroit English speakers, the commission has fixed more than 10,000 public signs (farewell &quot;Teliot&quot; and &quot;urine district&quot;), rewritten English-language historical placards and helped hundreds of restaurants recast offerings.&quot; James Fallows attributed many Shanghai Chinglish errors to &quot;rote reliance on dictionaries or translation software&quot;, citing a bilingual sign reading &quot; Translate server error&quot; (; means &quot;dining room; restaurant&quot;). While conceding that &quot;there&#x27;s something undeniably Colonel Blimp-ish in making fun of the locals for their flawed command of your own mother tongue&quot;, Fallows observed a Shanghai museum with &quot;Three Georges Exhibit&quot; banners advertising a Three Gorges Dam exhibit, and wrote, &quot;it truly is bizarre that so many &quot;organizations&quot; in China are willing to chisel English translations into stone, paint them on signs, print them on business cards, and expose them permanently to the world without making any effort to check whether they are right.&quot; On a Chinese airplane, Fallows was given a wet wipe labeled &quot;Wet turban needless wash&quot;, translating (). Shanghai&#x27;s Luwan District published a controversial &quot;Bilingual Instruction of Luwan District for Expo&quot; phrasebook with English terms and Chinese characters approximating pronunciation: &quot;Good morning! ()&quot; [pronounced ] (which could be literally translated as &quot;ancient cat tranquility&quot;) and &quot;I&#x27;m sorry ()&quot; [] (which is nonsensical).

Chinglish is pervasive in present-day China &quot;on public notices in parks and at tourist sites, on shop names and in their slogans, in product advertisements and on packages, in hotel names and literature, in restaurant names and on menus, at airports, railway stations and in taxis, on street and highway signs – even in official tourist literature.&quot;
The Global Language Monitor predicts Chinglish will thrive, and estimates that roughly 20 percent of new English words derive from Chinglish, for instance, shanzhai () meaning &quot;counterfeit consumer goods; things done in parody&quot; — Huang Youyi, president of the China Internet Information Center, predicts that linguistic purism could be damaged by popular Chinese words of English origin (such as &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;LOL&quot;). &quot;If we do not pay attention and we do not take measures to stop Chinese mingling with English, Chinese will no longer be a pure language in a couple of years.&quot;

Specifying Chinglish to mean &quot;Chinese words literally translated into English&quot;, an experiment in linguistic clarity conducted by Han and Ginsberg (2001) found that mathematical terms are more readily understandable in Chinglish than English. English words for mathematics typically have Greek and Latin roots, while corresponding Chinese words are usually translations of neologisms from Western languages; thus quadrilateral (from Latin &quot;quadri-&quot; &quot;four&quot; and &quot;latus&quot; &quot;sided&quot;) is generally less informative than Chinese ). For example, compare the semantic clarity of English axiom, Chinese , and Chinglish (literal translation) &quot;universal-principle&quot;; median, , and &quot;centre-number&quot;; or trapezoid, , and &quot;ladder-figure&quot;. The study involved three groups of mathematics teachers who rated the clarity of 71 common mathematical terms. Group 1 with native speakers of Chinese judged 61% of the Chinese terms as clear; Group 2 with native speakers of English judged 45% of the English terms as clear. Group 3 with English-speaking teachers (both native and nonnative speakers) judged the comparative clarity of English and Chinglish word pairs: more clear for 42.3% of the Chinglish and 5.6% of the English, equally clear for 25.4% of the Chinglish-English pairs, and neither clear for 19.7%.

In 2017, the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China introduced the national standard for its English translations to replace Chinglish. This took effect on 1 December of that year.

== Features ==
Chinglish is the combination of the Chinese culture and the English language. China English has linguistic characteristics that are different from the normative English in all linguistic levels, including phonology, lexicon, syntax, and discourse.

At the phonological level, Chinglish does not differentiate between various vowel qualities because they don&#x27;t exist in Chinese. As a result, there is no contrast between the two sounds for Chinglish speakers. For example, &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;chip&quot; would be the same pronunciation. Another phonological feature is that speakers are unaware of the &quot;graduation&quot; of words which are said in different tones depending on the context. The word &quot;for&quot; is stressed and said differently in the phrases &quot;what is it for?&quot; and &quot;this is for you.&quot; To a Chinglish speaker, the two are the same. Chinglish speakers use Chinese phonological units to speak English, and retain the syllable timing of Chinese in place of the stress timing of English which together gives them a notable accent.

At the lexical level, China English manifests itself through many ways such as transliteration and loan translations. Transliteration has brought many interesting words and expressions from the Chinese language into English. Speakers are able to merge the two because of pinyin, a Latin alphabet used to write Chinese. In loan translations, Chinese words have been translated directly into English. This phenomenon can be found in a lot of compound words like red bean, bean curd, and teacup. The other way that loan translations are made is when speakers translate Chinese terms into English. These words come from the Chinese culture and are ideas, thoughts, or expressions that do not exist in English. For example, &quot;spring rolls&quot; would otherwise not have meaning in English if not for Chinglish speakers making it a loan translation to describe the food. In addition, speakers use subordinate conjunctions differently and also exhibit copula absence in their speech. Examples include &quot;Because I am ill, so I can&#x27;t go to school&quot; and &quot;The dress beautiful.&quot;

As Chinese grammar does not distinguish between definite and indefinite articles, Chinese speakers struggle with when to use or not use the English definite article &quot;the&quot;.

At the syntactic level, Chinese thinking has influenced Chinglish speakers to utilize a different sequence and structure to make sentences. For English speakers, a common sequence is subject → predicate → object → adverbial (&quot;John entered the room quietly&quot;). On the other hand, the Chinese sequence is subject → adverbial → predicate → object (&quot;Lijing quiet enter room&quot;). Chinese speakers tend to leave the most important information (the topic) at the end of the sentence, while English speakers present it at the start.

Linguists and language teachers employ error analysis to fathom Chinglish. Liu et al. list four characteristic features of Chinglish mistranslations,
*Cultural meanings. The English idiom &quot;work like a horse&quot; means &quot;work hard&quot;, but in China horses are rarely used as draft animals and the equivalent Chinese expression uses &quot;cattle&quot;.
*Problems of direct translation. Some Chinglish menus translate as &quot;bean curd&quot;, which &quot;sounds very unappetizing&quot; to English speakers, instead of &quot;tofu&quot;.
*Wordiness. Unnecessary words and convoluted sentences are hallmarks of Chinglish translation. For example, the Civil Aviation Administration of China announced, &quot;CAAC has decided to start the business of advance booking and ticketing&quot;, which could simply say &quot;CAAC now accepts advance booking and ticketing.&quot;
*Wrong word order. A host in Shenyang toasted a group of foreign investors with &quot;Up your bottoms!&quot; instead of &quot;Bottoms up!&quot;
Chinglish reflects the influence of Chinese syntax and grammar. For instance, Chinese verbs are not necessarily conjugated and there is no equivalent article for English &quot;the&quot;, both of which can create awkward translations.

==Causes==

Chinglish has various causes, most commonly erroneous Chinese dictionaries, translation software, and incorrect English as a foreign language textbooks. Other causes include misspelling, mediocre English-language teaching, sloppy translation, and reliance on outdated translation technology. Liu, Feather and Qian warn that

Common causes include:
* Lack of inclusion of native English speakers in the translation or editing process
* Word-for-word dictionary translation: rigidly substituting Chinese words with English ones from dictionaries, without considering the impact of polysemy
* Use of machine translation without post-editing
* Competently translated text which has been subsequently edited by non-native speakers
* Linguistic differences and mother tongue interference
* Different thinking patterns and culture
* Outdated Chinese-English dictionaries and textbook-style English
* Mediocre English-language teaching and lack of English-language environment

==Vocabulary==

Some similar words are generally confused by most Chinglish speakers, for example &quot;emergent&quot; instead of &quot;emergency&quot; or &quot;urgent&quot;, because of incorrect entries in dictionaries.

In Chinglish, &quot;I know&quot; is generally used instead of the term &quot;I see&quot;, when used to tell others that you understand what they said.

&quot;See&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, and &quot;look&quot; all refer to in Chinese. For example, means &quot;to see a film&quot; or &quot;to watch a movie&quot;, means &quot;to read a book&quot;, means &quot;to look at me&quot;. Because of that, Chinglish speakers use &quot;look&quot; instead of &quot;see&quot;, &quot;watch&quot;, or &quot;read&quot;. The same phenomena can be found in the use of &quot;speak&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, and &quot;talk&quot; . The expression &quot;Can you say Chinese?&quot; () would mean &quot;Do you speak Chinese?&quot;

Another misuse of vocabulary is &quot;to turn on/off&quot; and &quot;open/close&quot;. Chinese speakers use to refer to turning off things like electrical appliances or to close a door or window. Accordingly, a Chinglish speaker might say &quot;close the light&quot; rather than &quot;turn off the light&quot;. In the same way, refers to turning those things on, or to open a door or window. As a result, they would say &quot;open the TV&quot; instead of &quot;turn on the TV&quot;.

==Examples==

Collections of Chinglish are found on numerous websites (see below) and books. Owing to the ubiquity of Chinglish mistakes throughout the Sinophone world, the following examples will exclude common misspellings (e.g., &quot;energetically Englsih-friendly environment&quot;) and typographical errors (a bilingual bus sign reading &quot; To unknow&quot;; means &quot;to; toward&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;) that can occur anywhere in the English-speaking world.
*Add oil. A commonly used Chinglish expression for , an encouragement and supporting expression.
*Slip carefully (sometimes: Carefully slip and fall down). A common mistranslation of &quot;Caution. Wet floor.&quot; means &quot;floor&quot; when pronounced as but is a suffix to an adverb when pronounced as , respectively. The phrase can be transliterated as &quot;caution, the floor (is) wet&quot; or &quot;(to) carefully slip&quot;.
*To take notice of safe: The slippery are very crafty. A comparable sign in a Beijing garage reads ().
*Workshop for concrete agitation appears on a sign in a Sichuan factory. (), which combines meaning &quot;stir; mix; agitate&quot; and &quot;house; room&quot;, translates as &quot;mixing room&quot;.
*Spread to fuck the fruit is a Chinese supermarket sign mistranslation of &quot;sǎn gānguǒ&quot; (). Victor Mair noted the fuck translation of () was &quot;fairly ubiquitous in China&quot;, and discovered this complicated Chinglish error resulted from machine translation software misinterpreting () as (). In written Chinese, sometimes a single simplified Chinese character is used for multiple traditional Chinese characters: () is the simplified form of two words () and (). Mair&#x27;s research revealed that the popular Chinese-English Jinshan Ciba dictionary (2002 edition) and Jinshan Kuaiyi translation software systematically rendered every occurrence of as &quot;fuck&quot; (later editions corrected this error). Two comparable Chinglish mistranslations of &quot;dry&quot; as &quot;do; fuck&quot; are: The shrimp fucks the cabbage for (), and fuck the empress mistakes &quot;gàn hòu&quot; () for (), with () as the Simplified form of ().

*Please steek gently appears on a Taipei government building door. This form of Chinglish uses obscure English terms, namely, Scottish English &quot;steek&quot; &quot;enclose; close; shut&quot; instead of the common word.
*Bumf Box for (), employs the British English word , originally a shortened form of meaning &quot;toilet paper&quot;, now used to mean &quot;useless documents&quot;.
*Braised enterovirus in Clay Pot appears on a Chinese menu for (), which is a stuffed sausage popular in Sichuanese-Hunanese cuisine. This example occurred following the Enterovirus 71 epidemic in China, and mistranslates () as ().
*Fried enema on a menu mistranslates (). The &quot;Jinshan Ciba&quot; dictionary confused the cooking and medical meanings of &quot;guanchang&quot; &quot;(make) a sausage; (give) an enema&quot;.
*A weak &#x27;pyridaben carbazole&#x27; sound is found on translated instructions for a photographic light, &quot;Install the battery into the battery jar, when heard a weak &#x27;pyridaben carbazole&#x27; sound the installation is completed.&quot; The original Chinese has an onomatopoetic term () rendered into () and ().
*4 Uygur theater is printed on the bilingual instructions for a Chinese 4-D film about dinosaurs. The Chinese term () uses &quot;tie up; maintain, uphold; estimate&quot; that commonly transcribes foreign names such as ().
*Exterminate Capitalism Lobster Package was the Chinglish rendering of () on a menu mentioned by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Victor Mair analyzed the linguistic impossibility of rendering &quot;Taotie&quot; () &quot;a mythical beast; glutton; greedy person&quot; as &quot;exterminate capitalism&quot; and concluded somebody &quot;mischievously provided an absurd translation, perhaps with the intention of poking fun at the Chinese Communist system which has given rise to such luxurious and fancy dining practices as reflected in pretentious menus of this sort.&quot;
* is a mistranslation, albeit a substantially intelligible one (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;[I] do not want [what is happening to happen]&quot;) of &quot;Nooooo-!&quot; exclaimed by Darth Vader in a bootleg version of &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, a phrase which has since become an internet meme. A bootleg copy of the film entitled &quot;Star War – The third gathers: Backstroke of the West&quot; was bought in China, and featured erroneous English subtitles that were machine translated back from a Chinese translation of the original English, i.e. a re-translation, which was posted online due to its humorous use of poor English. Having gone viral, the phrase has spread as a meme used on messageboards online. The mistranslation is an example of translation decay following an English translation to Chinese, which is then re-translated back into English; the exclamation &quot;no&quot; would be correctly translated as in Chinese, however since can also mean &quot;want&quot;, and is used as a negation particle, can also be translated as &quot;do not want&quot;. As an example, the phrase correctly translates to &quot;I (do not) want to go&quot;, however the discussion translates to &quot;Do you want to eat?&quot;/&quot;No.&quot; as well. Other humorous mistranslations from this movie include &quot;They&#x27;re all over me&quot; as &quot;He is in my behind&quot;, &quot;The Jedi Council&quot; as &quot;The Presbyterian Church&quot;, and the notorious phrase &quot;May the force be with you&quot; as &quot;The wish power are together with you&quot;.

*Go straight on public is a mistranslation of &quot;Public washroom outside on the second floor.&quot;
*Note that the level of gap, which is a sentence fragment, is how signs on Shanghai&#x27;s ferry docks render &quot;Mind the gap&quot;, the phrase that spread from the London Underground to worldwide use.

*Don&#x27;t stampede is featured on signs in lavatories to inform users that using a sitting toilet like a squatting toilet is prohibited.
*Mustard Silk is a mistranslation of &quot;shredded pickled vegetables&quot;, (literally, &quot;pickled mustard shred.&quot;) The product was employed by China Eastern Airlines.
*Civilization tour is found on signs on boats on the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang as a mistranslation for

<text>Tlaxcala ( , , ), officially Tlaxcala de Xicohténcatl, is the capital city of the Mexican state of Tlaxcala and seat of the municipality of the same name. The city did not exist during the pre-Hispanic period but was laid out by the Spanish as a center of evangelization and governance after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The city was designated as a diocese but eventually lost that status to Puebla as its population declined. The city still has many of its old colonial structures, including the former Franciscan monastery, and newer civic structures like the Xicohtencatl Theatre.

==History==

The name Tlaxcala most likely comes from a Nahuatl phrase which means “place of corn bread.” The Aztec glyph for the Mesoamerican dominion is two hills from which emerge a pair of hands making a tortilla.

The site of the modern city did not have a settlement for most of the pre Hispanic era. The area was ruled by a coalition of four dominions called Tepeticpac, Ocotelolco, Tizatlan and Quiahuiztlan which united in the 14th century to defend themselves against the Aztecs and other enemies. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Tlaxcala was one of the most important areas of Mesoamerica with commercial ties to the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean as well as Central America.

As the Aztec Empire grew, it conquered Tlaxcala&#x27;s neighbors but left the dominion in order to perform annual ritual combat called the “flower wars” which aimed to not conquer but capture soldiers for sacrifice. The conquest of the surrounding area also cut off Tlaxcala&#x27;s commerce. This remained the case until the arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century. Hernán Cortés took advantage of this situation, enlisting the Tlaxcalans as allies against the Aztecs, giving them a base to attack from and regroup after the La Noche Triste when they were initially expelled from Tenochtitlan.

Despite the military alliance of the Tlaxcalans, they did not have a single capital. After the Spanish conquest terminated, the Europeans selected the current site to solidify their hold on the Tlaxcalans as well as have a base for evangelization. The most likely time that the city was founded was spring of 1522. Tlaxcala was the fifth diocese to be established in the Americas and the second in Mexico after Yucatán. The first bishop was Julian Garces and the seat was established in 1527. However, since there was a cathedral in the city of Puebla and not in Tlaxcala, the seat was moved to Puebla in 1539 and has remained there since. The original territory of the diocese included the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Tabasco, Hidalgo and Guerrero, but as new diocese were erected, the territory reduced to the present, states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. In 1903, the name of the Diocese of Tlaxcala was changed to the Diocese of Puebla.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Tlaxcala area was heavily populated but with epidemics, emigrations and the construction of the Nochistongo canal to drain the Valley of Mexico, most of the indigenous population disappeared. A document of 1625 states that there were 300,000 in the city in the 16th century but only 700 remained by that time it was written. The city was begun in 1537 with the construction of the San Francisco monastery. The city became the center of Tlaxcala identity during the colonial period. Its commerce was originally centered in the main square but was eventually moved to the outskirts of town. One important project that was traded here was the cochineal insect, used to make red dye. When New Spain was divided into five major provinces, Tlaxcala became the capital of one of them, with roughly the same dimensions as the pre Hispanic coalition of dominions. Tlaxcala was promised certain rights as an ally during the Conquest. When a number of these were not met, a codex was produced here called the Lienzo de Tlaxcala as a complaint to the Spanish Crown. However, despite the complaints, most of the indigenous eventually lost their lands around the city and lost many of their commerce rights in it.

In 1692, a revolt occurred against Governor Manuel de Bustamante y Bustillo due to the scarcity of grain.

The city of Tlaxcala became a municipality in 1813, under the Spanish Constitution of 1812.

French forces were forced out of the city in 1867 after which Tlaxcalan forces went with Porfirio Díaz to liberate Puebla and after that, Querétaro and Mexico City.

During the end of the 19th century, the politics of the city were dominated by Próspero Cahuantzi, who promoted public works such as kiosks, streets, public markets, bridges and government buildings. The city changed from oil lamps to electric light in the historic center, the state government palace was remodeled and the Xicohtencatl Theatre was built. Electricity for the city was generated through a hydroelectric works in a canal on the Los Negros River.

After the Mexican Revolution, the city recovered and began to grow again, reaching a population of 6,000 by 1927. In the mid 20th century, public education was enhanced at the middle and high school levels. More public works were undertaken to give the city the appearance it has today.

==The city==

The city center is compact and filled with colonial era building painted in colors such as burnt umber, salmon pink and mustard yellow. Most of these buildings are centered on the main square called the Plaza de la Constitución. This square measures on each side and was established when the Spanish laid out the city in 1524. The current name was given in 1813 to honor the Cádiz Constitution as well as the Mexican constitutions of 1857 and 1917. In the center of this square is the Santa Cruz Fountain which was donated to the city by Philip IV in 1646. There is also a kiosk which was constructed in the 19th century.

The Portal Hidalgo is on the east side of the main square, built as commercial space in 1550. It is still used as such today although the structures have been modified since then as seen in the differences in the columns and sizes of the arches. The city hall was moved from its centuries old home in the “Casas Reales” to this complex. The interior is dominated by the city council chamber (Salón de Cabildos) along with various municipal offices. On the lower level inside its section of the arches, there is a cultural space called “La Tlaxcalteca” which sells regional handcrafts and other goods as well as books about Tlaxcala&#x27;s history.

===Historic buildings===
The Capilla Real de Indias or Royal Indian Chapel was built in the 16th century as a church for indigenous nobility. At the end of the 18th century, a fire destroyed the nave and much of the rest collapsed as a result of an earthquake. The ruins remained abandoned until the structure was restored in 1984 to house the state&#x27;s judicial branch.

The Casa de Piedra (&quot;Stone House&quot;) is located on the southwest corner of the main plaza. It was built in the 16th century as a notary office and home. Its name comes from the solid gray sandstone used in its construction, unique to the area.

;Franciscan monastery
The former Franciscan monastery was built between 1537 and 1542, located on a hill on the edge of the historic center, away from the main square. It was one of the first four to be built by the Franciscans in the Americas, accredited to Martín de Valencia. The layout of the complex is unusual with the cloister on the left or north side of the church. The church still has its original roof made from large beams of wood. The main nave of the church has one of the few examples of Moorish art in the Americas. It has a large atrium and various chapels, with only two of the atrium chapels remaining. There is a tower located on the outside wall away from the main building. The east atrium is historically important as the site of the first evangelist plays performed in Nahuatl starting in 1537. Today, this cloister area is the Regional Museum of Tlaxcala. The main gateway to the monastery has the coat-of-arms of Castillas and the year 1629, mostly likely to mark the centennial of the monastery&#x27;s founding. The after its use as a monastery ended, the cloister was used as a military barracks, a hospital and a prison. Only some of its original murals remain. It has been the home of the Regional Museum since 1981. The museum contains five halls dedicated to the history of the state from the pre-Hispanic period to the 19th century and it has two halls for temporary exhibits. The museum also hosts conferences and cultural events. Other services include those related to research. The museum is operated by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) .

The Jorge Aguilar “El Ranchero” Bullring is on a site next to the former monastery. It was one of the first established in Tlaxcala in 1788. In 1817, the current structure was built of adobe and stone. The popularity of the sport spurred a number of ranches dedicated to raising bulls including the Tepeyahualco, Piedras Negras and Mimiahuapan. It is located next to the former monastery and also serves as the site for the annual Tlaxcala Fair.

The State Government Palace is the most important civic construction from the 16th century. It has three sections. The east wing was known as the Casas Reales, the center Casas Consistoriales and the west wing as the Alhóndiga. The building is used for state government offices. The interior contain a number of murals by Desiderio Hernández Xochitiotzin, which depict the history of Tlaxcala.

;San José parish church

The San José parish church was originally called the parish of San Juan y San José (Saints John and Joseph), constructed during the 18th century in Baroque style. This site was once the cathedral of the Diocese of Tlaxcala, but this has since been merged with Puebla, with its seat in the city of Puebla. The building has orange walls with cobalt blue Talavara ceramic tiles and a façade decorated in mortar work. The main entrance is an arch supported by pilasters and flanked by columns. The upper part of the façade has a choral window also flanked by columns. The left hand tower has one level with arches, flanked by Tuscan pilasters topped by a small dome covered in Talavera tile. In 1864, the cupola and roof were destroyed by an earthquake. The current ones with Talavera tile are from the reconstruction. The interior is decorated in Neoclassical style with a Latin cross layout although there are still some Baroque and Churrigueresque altars. The main altar is Neoclassical but with an altarpiece which is Baroque. The upper choir area has an elaborate wood railing. On each side of the area below the choir area there are two Churrigueresque altars. In the two side chapels there are oil paintings by Manuel Caro as well as two holy water fonts of sculpted stone that has images of the god Camaxtli and the Spanish coat of arms.

The former municipal palace was constructed in the middle of the 16th century as a place for the representatives of the four Tlaxcala dominions to meet. It has two levels with arches on the lower level of the façade. The main entranceway has three arches with reliefs over stone columns. The upper level of the façade has a seal and a pediment with clock. The interior has a terrace with three arches supported by Tuscan columns. The main stairway has a relief depicting Xicohtencatl Axayacatzin as well as reliefs of the four Tlaxcalan leaders at the time of the Spanish arrival.

The Former Legislative Palace is now home to the state&#x27;s Secretary of Tourism. It was built in the 19th century with a façade of gray sandstone supported by pilasters with capitols. The building functioned as the site of the state&#x27;s legislature from 1901 to 1982.
The Xicohtencatl Theatre was built in 1873 with one of its early main productions being a re-enactment of the Battle of Puebla. Built during the Porfirio Díaz period, it was remodeled after the Mexican Revolution to Neoclassical from 1923 to 1945. The latest restoration of the building occurred in 1984 done by the Instituto Tlaxcalteca de Cultura. It has a sandstone façade, which is principally in Neoclassical style. This façade has twelve pilasters with Corinthian capitols that mark off the windows, doors and niches. The lower level has three entrances and the upper level has three balconies with arches. The interior has a ceiling with a large soffit with an Art Nouveau style painting by John Fulton representing the Muses along with Tlaxcala landscapes.

The Tlaxcala Museum of Art was inaugurated in 2004, located in a building constructed in the 19th century in the historic center. This building originally was a hospital and later jail. When it was restored and converted to its current use, the façade and layout of the building was left intact with only minor changes. The museum has six main halls for permanent exhibits and five for temporary ones.

The Culture Palace is a late Neoclassical building which was begun in 1939. It has a brick façade with a woven mat design interspersed with ornamental gray sandstone. It was originally built to be the middle and preparatory school for the state, but later it was converted into a department of the Universidad Autónoma de Tlaxcala and finally in 1991, housed the Tlaxcala Cultural Institute.

The Stairway of the Heroes was initially called the “Stairway of Independence” both of which refer to the busts of figures such as Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, José María Morelos and Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez. Busts from persons later in Mexico&#x27;s history were added such as those of Francisco I. Madero, Ricardo Flores Magón, Emiliano Zapata, Francisco Villa, Venustiano Carranza as well as Domingo Arenas, who was a Tlaxcalan figure from the Mexican Revolution.
Plaza Xicohténcatl was created in the late 20th century for a weekend arts and crafts market. In the colonial period, the area was used for the sale of slaves according to some historians. Calzada de San Francisco is a pedestrian street at the southeast side of the plaza, filled with ash trees and paved with blocks of sandstone. As the road leads up to the former monastery, it ends at a gate with three arches.

La Chichita is the name of a fountain found at the intersection of Vicente Guerrero and Porfirio Díaz streets. It is fed by a natural water flow and used to be the source of potable water for the surrounding area.

;Tizatlán Open Chapel
The Tizatlán Open Chapel was built in the 16th century over a pyramid platform which was part of the palace of Xicohtencatl the Elder. This building appears in the Tlaxcala Codex from 1550. Hernán Cortés placed a cross here along with indigenous leaders Maxixcatzin and Xicohtencatl. There are still fragments of murals depicting the baptism of Jesus, the Three Wise Men and of God, the Father, surrounded by angels playing musical instruments. Adjoining this is the Tizatlán archeological site, in which still remain six semicircular columns, two altars with paintings similar to those of the Borgia Codex, where the gods Tezcatlipoca and Tlahuizcalpantecutli appear.

The Chapel of the Well of the Miraculous Water (Capilla del Pocito de Agua Milagrosa) is a small building at a fresh water spring. It began as a wall built to protect the spring at the end of the 17th or beginning of the 18th century. The chapel building dates from between 1892 and 1896 but the entrance arch is older. It has an octagonal layout. One of the walls contains an oil by Isauro G. Cervantes from 1913 and the rest of the walls have murals with Biblical scenes related to water done by Desiderio Hernández Xochitiotzin and Pedro Avelino. Traditionally, red pottery ducks are sold in the small atrium as object of devotion or for healing.

The Chapel of San Nicolasito was originally constructed of wood in the 16th century dedicated to Nicholas of Tolentino. In the 19th century the chapel was reconstructed to what is now one of the side chapels. Little by little it was enlarged to its present size.

The San Esteban Temple was constructed from sandstone in the 20th century in Neoclassical style. Its atrium serves as a cemetery and its interior has a mural depicting the baptism of the four indigenous lords of Tlaxcala in the 16th century.

The San Buenaventura Atempan hermitage was constructed around the time that Cortés was building the brigantines to invade Tenochtitlan. At that time, the structure was in a very rural area. Over the centuries it was abandoned and crumbled with only some of the walls remaining. Some of its images and other objects can now be found at a new temple nearby.

===Events===

The city celebrates Carnival starting the Friday before Ash Wednesday, with the burning of an effigy to represent “bad humor” accompanied by funeral music. The following day, the queen of the carnival is selected. The main parade with floats occurs on Tuesday. During the long weekend there are various other events such as dance contests and recitals of traditional dance such as that of the Huehues from the community of Acuitlapilco. On Ash Wednesday, ceremonies end with a hanging of an effigy called “La Octava del Carnaval” Often the image is satirical, and of a person considered worthy of criticism.

<text>TT Seawise Giant—earlier Oppama; later Happy Giant, Jahre Viking, Knock Nevis, and Mont—was a ULCC supertanker and the longest self-propelled ship in history. It was built in 1974–1979 by Sumitomo Heavy Industries in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. The ship possessed the greatest deadweight tonnage ever recorded. Fully laden, her displacement was 657,019 tonnes.

At the time she was built, she was the heaviest self-propelled ship of any kind. With a laden draft of 24.6 m (81 ft) and a length of 458.45 m (1,504.10 ft), she was incapable of navigating the English Channel, the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Overall, she is generally considered the largest self-propelled ship ever built. In 2013 her overall length was surpassed by 30 m by the floating liquefied natural gas installation &quot;Shell Prelude&quot; (FLNG), a monohull barge design long and 600,000 tonnes displacement. &quot;Seawise Giant&#x27;s&quot; engines were powered by Ljungström turbines.

She was damaged in an airstrike in 1988 during the Iran–Iraq War, but was later repaired and restored to service. The vessel was converted to a floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) in 2004, moored off the coast of Qatar in the Persian Gulf at the Al Shaheen Oil Field.

The vessel was sold to Indian ship breakers, and renamed &quot;Mont&quot; for a final journey in December 2009. After clearing Indian customs, the ship sailed to Alang Ship Breaking Yard, Alang, Gujarat, where she was beached for scrapping, which was completed in 2010.

== History ==
&quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was ordered in 1974 and delivered in 1979 by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. (S.H.I.) at Oppama shipyard in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan, as a 418,611-ton Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC). The vessel remained unnamed for a long time, and was identified by her hull number, 1016. During sea trials, 1016 exhibited severe vibration problems while going astern. The Greek owner refused to take delivery and the vessel was subject to a lengthy arbitration proceeding. Following settlement, the vessel was sold and named &quot;Oppama&quot; by S.H.I.

The shipyard exercised its right to sell the vessel and a deal was brokered with Hong Kong Orient Overseas Container Line founder C. Y. Tung to lengthen the ship by several metres and add 146,152 tonnes of cargo capacity through jumboisation. Two years later the ship was relaunched as &quot;Seawise Giant&quot;. &quot;Seawise&quot;, a pun on &quot;C.Y.&#x27;s&quot;, was used in the names of other ships owned by C.Y. Tung, including &quot;Seawise University&quot;.

After the refit, the ship had a capacity of , a length overall of and a draft of . It had 46 tanks, and of deck space. When &quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was fully loaded, her 25 meter/81 foot draft was too deep for the ship to safely navigate the relatively shallow waters of the English Channel. The rudder weighed 230 tons, and the propeller weighed 50 tons.

&quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was damaged in 1988 during the Iran–Iraq War by an Iraqi Air Force attack while anchored off Larak Island, Iran on 14 May 1988 and carrying Iranian crude oil. The ship was struck by 2 Exocet missiles. Fires ignited aboard the ship and on oil that escaped into the surrounding water, which blazed out of control. Contrary to some more recent online reports, the vessel did not sink; images of the burnt-out but still afloat vessel have been published online. 

After the fires were extinguished, the remaining cargo was discharged to other tankers. The ship was declared a constructive total loss, which means the ship was intact but so damaged that it would cost more to repair it than the value of the repaired vessel.

Shortly after the Iran–Iraq war ended, a Norwegian investment firm managed by Finanshuset bought the damaged vessel, which had by then been towed to a lay-up location off Labuan. The manager was Norman International AS, a Norwegian ship manager that was subsequently dissolved in 1992. The vessel was subsequently towed from Labuan to Singapore and repaired at the Keppel Corporation. The ship was renamed &quot;Happy Giant&quot;, in line with Norman International’s tradition of naming tankers with the prefix «Happy» and bulkers with the prefix «Norman». She re-entered service in October 1991.

Jørgen Jahre bought the tanker in 1991 for US$39 million and renamed her &quot;Jahre Viking&quot;. From 1991 to 2004, she was owned by various Norwegian investment firms and flew the flag of Norway.

In 2004, the tanker was purchased by First Olsen Tankers, renamed &quot;Knock Nevis&quot;, and converted into a permanently moored storage tanker in the Qatar Al Shaheen Oil Field in the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Knock Nevis&quot; was renamed &quot;Mont&quot; and reflagged to Sierra Leone by new owners Amber Development for a final voyage to India where she was scrapped at Alang by Priya Blue Industries. The vessel was beached on 22 December 2009. Due to the length and the size of the vessel, scrapping only finished at the end of 2010. The ship&#x27;s 36 tonne anchor was saved and donated to the Hong Kong Maritime Museum in 2010. It was later moved to a Hong Kong Government Dockyard building on Stonecutters Island.

== Size record ==
&quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was the longest ship ever constructed, at , longer than the height of many of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings, including the Petronas Towers.

Despite a great length, &quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was not the largest ship by gross tonnage, ranking sixth at 260,941 GT, behind the crane ship &quot;Pioneering Spirit&quot; and the four 274,838 to 275,276 GT &quot;Batillus&quot;-class supertankers. She was the longest and largest by deadweight: 564,763 tonnes.

&quot;Seawise Giant&quot; was featured on the BBC series &quot;Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s Extreme Machines&quot; while sailing as &quot;Jahre Viking&quot;. According to her captain, S. K. Mohan, the ship could reach up to in good weather. It took for the ship to stop from that speed, and the turning circle in clear weather was about .

<text>Konglish (; ), more formally Korean-style English (; ) comprises English and other foreign language loanwords that have been appropriated into Korean, and includes many that are used in ways that are not readily understandable to native English speakers. A common example is the Korean term &quot;hand phone&quot; for the English &quot;mobile phone&quot;. Konglish also has direct English loanwords, mistranslations from English to Korean, or pseudo-English words coined in Japanese that came to Korean usage. Sociolinguistically, South Koreans use English to denote luxury, youth, sophistication, and modernity.

The term is a portmanteau of the names of the two languages and was first recorded earliest in 1975. Other less common terms include: &quot;Korlish&quot; (recorded from 1988), &quot;Korenglish&quot; (1992), &quot;Korglish&quot; (2000) and &quot;Kinglish&quot; (2000). 
The use of Konglish is widespread in South Korea as a result of US cultural influence, but it is not familiar to North Koreans.

== Overview==
A possible explanation behind South Korea&#x27;s acceptance and rapid integration of English into the Korean language and culture may lie in the overall South Korean attitude towards globalization. English-learning has become prevalent in South Korean society, which Joseph Sung-Yul Park, in his 2009 paper, attributes to three primary developments and qualities - necessitation, externalization, and self-deprecation. Park believes necessitation stems from the general Korean belief that learning English is a must to succeed in the globalizing world, whereas externalization refers to treating English as the language of the so-called &quot;other&quot;, opposite to the Korean identity. Finally, self-deprecation refers to Park&#x27;s belief that Koreans think that they are viewed by the world to not be competent in their usage of English.

The English language has become so interpenetrated into the Korean language that English makes up over 90% of the loanwords in the Korean lexicon today, and there continue to be debates among Korean linguists over whether establishing the national language of South Korea as English would be a prudent decision in the globalizing world. In fact, Harkness attributes this development in South Korean society as a sign of South Korean ambivalence towards its engagement with the rest of the world to an extent.

On the contrary, however, North Korea has undergone a systematic purging of its language, eliminating its reliance on foreign influences. In fact, language is viewed not only as a useful tool to further its propaganda, but also as a &#x27;weapon&#x27; to reinforce its ideology and the &quot;building of socialism&quot;. Today, the North Korean language, which was officially established as &quot;Munhwaŏ&quot;, or &quot;cultured language&quot;, in 1966, consists of nativized Sino-Korean vocabulary and has eliminated foreign loan words from the North Korean lexicon. These steps first included its decolonization process in an attempt to re-establish a unique &quot;North Korean&quot; identity, eliminating the Japanese language and culture that had deeply penetrated the Korean peninsula during the decades of Japanese annexation. Additionally, it continued to resist adopting loan words from foreign sources, especially when it came to English - thus, there are barely, if any, &quot;Konglish&quot; terms in the North Korean language.

== History ==
Korea became a colony of Japan between 1910 and 1945. During the colonial period, Japanese was the main language through which English terms of communication were imported into Korea, especially at times when teaching and speaking Korean was prohibited. As Japan actively imported Western culture and technology in the years that followed, the earliest English loanwords evolved gradually through this Japanese influence. For example, one of the well-known words is which originates from the word &quot;coffee&quot;. After the Second World War, U.S. culture and language had a deeper influence on Koreans with the arrival of the U.S. army. The popularity of the use of English in the Korean language also increased. According to data at the time, up to 10% of Korean vocabulary came from and was changed from English. Thus, Konglish was adopted with increasing usage during the years of U.S. presence in Korea.

== Category ==
Konglish is relatively understudied and also varies in definition across individuals. However, some experts would agree that its formation parallels that of pidgins and creoles but that it cannot be defined as those categories because it is not yet its own category of English, but it is rather a subcategory of Korean that is conceptualized in the form of English words and phrases, which have been integrated with Korean.

Konglish is ambiguous in its category of linguistics but is similar to the definition of Platt&#x27;s &quot;New Englishes&quot;, which is distinguished from erroneous or temporary forms of English. Konglish aligns with the standards of &quot;New Englishes&quot; by being developed through the education system in an area in which English is not the native language spoken by most of the population, used for a range of functions among the speakers, and has been localized by adopting some language feature of its own such as intonation patterns and expressions.

== Laterals ==
Many Koreans who immigrate to the United States and learn English have a distinct Korean-English variation, especially in early stages of acquisition. One reason this is so is due to distinct laterals between English and Korean languages, which affects the articulatory and acoustic characteristics of the languages. American English is often described as having &quot;dark&quot; variants, which involves a primary alveolar contact gesture as well as a secondary dorsal retraction gesture. In most cases, English in America is spoken with very little anterior contact in the mouth, and instead uses the narrowed upper pharyngeal area with a retracted tongue dorsum. The Korean lateral on the other hand is considered to be &quot;light&quot; in its acoustic and articulatory characteristics. The two gestures that make up the Korean lateral include tongue tip closure and palatalization, which involves the raising of the tongue body.

According to the Speech Learning Model, learning a second language is easier in later stages of acquisition for laterals that are more different than similar because one can recognize the differences in speech sounds more clearly. This is true for Koreans learning English, as they use distinct articulatory tongue shapes, using a low tongue body and a heavily retracted tongue dorsum for their English word-final lateral, similar to native English speakers.

In loanwords used in Konglish, the dark English lateral is often mapped onto the loanwords Koreans use, showing that Koreans see these loanwords as separate from purely Korean, even though it is used in everyday life.

== Examples ==
These two lists of Konglish terms, the second being loan words that arrived via Japanese influence, are intended to contain Konglish terms not readily understandable to a native English speaker, similar to &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; terms in the Japanese language. Many Konglish terms were invented by Koreans through non-standard abbreviations or combinations of English words or by applying a new meaning or usage to a common English word.

While English words may have reached Korea via globalization, modernization, etc.) social and linguistic factors had an impact in the shift of meaning of the words introduced as they were propagated through the community. An example of a Korean false friend is the word &quot;&quot;, which sounds like &quot;meeting&quot; in English but means &quot;blind date&quot;.

A trend in the naming of apartment buildings in Seoul is blending English words together because developers believe this will enhance the luxury brand image of the properties. Some examples of apartment names with blended English words include: Luxtige, Blesstige, Tristige and Forestige, XI; these words are combinations of luxury, bless, prestige, trinity, forest, extra and intelligence.


=== Loanwords from Japan ===
Many loanwords entered into Korean from Japan, especially during the Japanese forced occupation, when the teaching and speaking of Korean was prohibited. Those Konglish words are loanwords from, and thus similar to, Wasei-eigo used in Japan.

A simple example would be how the meaning of the English word &quot;cunning&quot; changes when used in a Konglish sentence. In South Korea, &quot;keonning&quot; means cheating, as the loanword was adapted from Japanglish &quot;kanningu&quot; (), which means &quot;cheating&quot;. Konglish words may or may not have a similar meaning to the original word when used, and a well-known brand name can become a generalized trademark and replace the general word: older Korean people tend to use the word &quot;babari&quot; (&quot;Burberry&quot;) or &quot;babari-koteu&quot; (&quot;Burberry coat&quot;), which came from Japanese &quot;bābari-kōto&quot; (meaning &quot;gabardine raincoat&quot;) to refer to all trench coats. Coats made by Burberry are called &quot;beobeori-koteu&quot; (), rather than &quot;babari-koteu&quot; in Korean (as the brand name, entered to Korean language directly from English, is &quot;Beobeori&quot;). Some examples such as &quot;Burberry&quot; and &quot;fighting&quot; can be considered pseudo-anglicisms as they follow certain traits: use native words in conjunction with an English suffix like -ting or -ism to create a word that does not exist in the English language. The word &quot;fighting&quot; (화이팅)is an instance of this. Words like&quot; Burberry&quot; (바바리) are invented through other means due to social or cultural elements. The use of &quot;Burberry&quot;(바바리) over trench coats can be compared to Kleenex’s usage over tissue.

Compared to Japanese, both English and Korean have more vowels and permit more coda consonants. Oftentimes when Japanized English words enter into the Korean language, the &quot;original&quot; English words from which the Japanglish words were derived are reverse-traced, and the words undergo de-Japanization (sometimes with hypercorrection).


=== Pseudo-Konglish loanwords ===
Some foreign-origin words such as &quot;areubaiteu&quot; (, , &#x27;part-time&#x27;), a loanword from German &quot;&quot; (, &#x27;work&#x27;), are sometimes mistakenly considered as Konglish and are corrected into &quot;accurate&quot; English loanword forms such as &quot;pateutaim&quot; (, ).

== Debate ==
There is some debate around whether Konglish is harmful or helpful. Some argue that Konglish has limited benefit to South Korea&#x27;s international competitiveness, and potentially negatively impacts the Korean language. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn&#x27;t trump getting the message across.

Some argue Konglish can lead to misunderstandings. Native English speakers can be confused by Konglish terms that are used differently from their English analogues. This can have an impact on tourism. When Incheon Airport was first opened, more than 49 English-language signs were found to contain errors.

Some also argue that Konglish exacerbates linguistic divides in Korea. For example, North–South differences in the Korean language. Konglish exclusive to South Korea can be difficult to understand for North Korean defectors integrating into South Korean society. There is also the possibility of rural–urban differences in the usage of Konglish.

Konglish has perhaps been supported by flaws in the education system. Underqualified Korean teachers may perhaps use Konglish in the classroom.

<doc id="199780" wikidata="Q784882" url="?curid=199780" title="Democracy in America">
<text> (; published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the second in 1840) is a classic French work by Alexis de Tocqueville. In the book, Tocqueville examines the democratic revolution that he believed had been occurring over the previous several hundred years.

In 1831, Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont were sent by the French government to study the American prison system. In his later letters, Tocqueville indicates that he and Beaumont used their official business as a pretext to study American society instead. They arrived in New York City in May of that year and spent nine months traveling the United States, studying the prisons and collecting information on American society, including its religious, political, and economic character. The two also briefly visited Canada, spending a few days in the summer of 1831 in what was then Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec) and Upper Canada (modern-day Ontario).

Tocqueville and Beaumont returned to France in February 1832 and submitted their report, (&quot;On the Penitentiary System in the United States and its Application in France&quot;), the next year. Tocqueville eventually extrapolated this work into the book Democracy in America, which was first published in Paris in two volumes. In the work, Tocqueville holds a critical lens to early 19th Century socioeconomic affairs in the United States. He notes the influence of American government and religious history on its entrepreneurial and relatively egalitarian culture. However, Tocqueville criticizes the moral, spiritual, artistic, and interpersonal costs of a society where social mobility and restlessness are organizing expectations. Ultimately, since its publication, the work has had a dramatic impact on American (as well as broader Western) thought and education; especially in history, political science, and the social sciences.

==Purpose==
Tocqueville begins his book by describing the change in social conditions taking place. He observed that over the previous seven hundred years the social and economic conditions of men had become more equal. The aristocracy, Tocqueville believed, was gradually disappearing as the modern world experienced the beneficial effects of equality. Tocqueville traced the development of equality to a number of factors, such as granting all men permission to enter the clergy, widespread economic opportunity resulting from the growth of trade and commerce, the royal sale of titles of nobility as a monarchical fundraising tool, and the abolition of primogeniture.

Tocqueville described this revolution as a &quot;providential fact&quot; of an &quot;irresistible revolution,&quot; leading some to criticize the determinism found in the book. However, based on Tocqueville&#x27;s correspondences with friends and colleagues, Marvin Zetterbaum, Professor Emeritus at University of California Davis, concludes that the Frenchman never accepted democracy as determined or inevitable. He did, however, consider equality more just and therefore found himself among its partisans. Given the social state that was emerging, Tocqueville believed that a &quot;new political science&quot; would be needed, in order to:

[I]nstruct democracy, if possible to reanimate its beliefs, to purify its motives, to regulate its movements, to substitute little by little the science of affairs for its inexperience, and knowledge of its true instincts for its blind instincts; to adapt its government to time and place; to modify it according to circumstances and men: such is the first duty imposed on those who direct society in our day.

The remainder of the book can be interpreted as an attempt to accomplish this goal, thereby giving advice to those people who would experience this change in social states. Tocqueville&#x27;s message is somewhat beyond the American democracy itself, which was rather an illustration to his philosophical claim that democracy is an effect of industrialization. This explains why Tocqueville does not unambiguously define democracy and even ignores the intents of the Founding Fathers of the United States regarding the American political system:

==Main themes==

===Puritan founding===
Tocqueville begins his study of the U.S. by explaining the contribution of the Puritans. According to him, the Puritans established the U.S. democratic social state of equality. They arrived equals in education and were all middle class. In addition, Tocqueville observes that they contributed a synthesis of religion and political liberty in America that was uncommon in Europe, particularly in France. He calls the Puritan Founding the &quot;seed&quot; of his entire work.

===Federal constitution===
Tocqueville believed that the Puritans established the principle of sovereignty of the people in the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The American Revolution then popularized this principle, followed by the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which developed institutions to manage popular will. While Tocqueville speaks highly of the U.S. Constitution, he believes that the mores, or &quot;habits of mind&quot; of the American people play a more prominent role in the protection of freedom. These include:

* Township democracy
* Mores, laws, and circumstances
* Tyranny of the majority
* Religion and beliefs
* The family
* Individualism
* Associations
* Self-interest rightly understood
* Materialism

===Situation of women===
Tocqueville was one of the first social critics to examine the situation of U.S. women and to identify the concept of separate spheres. The section &quot;Influence of Democracy on Manners Properly So Called&quot; of the second volume is devoted to his observations of women&#x27;s status in U.S. society. He writes: &quot;In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways that are always different.&quot;

He argues that the collapse of aristocracy lessened the patriarchal rule in the family where fathers would control daughters&#x27; marriages, meaning that women had the option of remaining unmarried and retaining a higher degree of independence. Married women, by contrast, lost all independence &quot;in the bonds of matrimony&quot; as &quot;in America paternal discipline [by the woman&#x27;s father] is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict.&quot; Yet despite this lack of independence, he believed America would &quot;raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man&quot; and praised America for having more legal protections for women than in France. Tocqueville believed women would be contributors to America&#x27;s prosperity and strength despite the limitations of the time, stating:

As for myself, I do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence, I have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position; and if I were asked, ... to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply,—to the superiority of their women.

== Summary ==
The primary focus of &quot;Democracy in America&quot; is an analysis of why republican representative democracy has succeeded in the United States while failing in so many other places. Tocqueville seeks to apply the functional aspects of democracy in the United States to what he sees as the failings of democracy in his native France.

Tocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States, discussing possible threats &quot;to&quot; democracy and possible dangers &quot;of&quot; democracy. These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into &quot;soft despotism&quot; as well as the risk of developing a tyranny of the majority. He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its separation from the government, a separation all parties found agreeable. He contrasts this to France, where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious, which he relates to the connection between church and state.

Insightful analysis of political society was supplemented in the second volume by description of civil society as a sphere of private and civilian affairs, mirroring Hegel. Tocqueville observed that social mechanisms have paradoxes, as in what later became known as the Tocqueville effect: &quot;social frustration increases as social conditions improve&quot;. He wrote that this growing hatred of social privilege, as social conditions improve, leads to the state concentrating more power to itself. Tocqueville&#x27;s views on the United States took a darker turn after 1840, however, as made evident in Craiutu and Jennings&#x27; &quot;Tocqueville on America after 1840: Letters and Other Writings&quot;.

==Impact==
&quot;Democracy in America&quot; was published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the other in 1840. It was immediately popular in both Europe and the United States, while also having a profound impact on the French population. By the twentieth century, it had become a classic work of political science, social science, and history. It is a commonly assigned reading for undergraduates of American universities majoring in the political or social sciences, and part of the introductory political theory syllabus at Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton and other institutions. In the introduction to his translation of the book, Harvard Professor Harvey C. Mansfield calls it &quot;at once the best book ever written on democracy and the best book ever written on America.&quot;

Tocqueville&#x27;s work is often acclaimed for making a number of astute predictions. He anticipates the potential acrimony over the abolition of slavery that would tear apart the United States and lead to the American Civil War, as well as the eventual superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which exploded after World War II and spawned the Cold War.

Noting the rise of the industrial sector in the American economy, Tocqueville argued that an industrial aristocracy would rise from the ownership of labor. He warned that &#x27;friends of democracy must keep an anxious eye peeled in this direction at all times&#x27;, observing that the route of industry was the gate by which a newfound wealthy class might potentially dominate, although he himself believed that an industrial aristocracy would differ from the formal aristocracy of the past.

In spending several chapters lamenting the state of the arts in America, he fails to envision the literary renaissance that would shortly arrive in the form of such major writers as Edgar Allan Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman. Equally, in dismissing the country&#x27;s interest in science as limited to pedestrian applications for streamlining the production of material goods, he failed to imagine America&#x27;s burgeoning appetite for pure scientific research and discovery. 

According to Tocqueville, democracy had some unfavorable consequences: the tyranny of the majority over thought, a preoccupation with material goods, and isolated individuals. &quot;Democracy in America&quot; was interpreted differently across national contexts. In France and the United States, Tocqueville&#x27;s work was seen as liberal, whereas both progressives and conservatives in the British Isles interpreted his work as supporting their own positions.

Tocqueville&#x27;s book can be compared with &quot;Letters on the English&quot; (1733) by Voltaire in how it flatteringly explains a nation to itself from the perspective of an outsider. Voltaire based his book on his experiences living in Great Britain as his compatriot Tocqueville did a century later in America, and according to the National Constitution Center, &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s passages on the spirit of commerce, religious diversity, religious freedom, and the English form of government also greatly influenced American thinking&quot;.

<doc id="199785" wikidata="Q5099002" url="?curid=199785" title="Chill Out (Black Uhuru album)">
<text>Chill Out is an album by reggae band Black Uhuru, released in 1982. The album was recorded at Channel One Studios in Jamaica and produced by Sly and Robbie. Featuring The Revolutionaries, an influential session group, &quot;Chill Out&quot;, together with its dub companion &quot;The Dub Factor&quot;, is widely considered a classic of reggae music.

==Reception==
&quot;Chill Out&quot; peaked at #146 on the Billboard chart.

Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Jo-Ann Greene said:

Arguably the best of Black Uhuru&#x27;s electrofied albums, even if its predecessor &quot;Red&quot; was the bigger sell, &quot;Chill Out&quot; is a seminal blend of styles and cultures... The sound is extremely dense, but the producers still found plenty of space for Black Uhuru&#x27;s sublime vocals. Over, under, and around the band, the electronic effects whoosh, pulling the album from its island roots, and planting it firmly in an international environment. This is most notable on the title track, which blends rootsy rhythms with a dance beat, and urban stylings with a tinge of world music... On &quot;Chill Out&quot;, the vocalists, band, and producers came together as one, and created more than a masterpiece; the album remains a stunning legacy for all involved.

<doc id="199789" wikidata="Q2259751" url="?curid=199789" title="Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Black Star">
<text>Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Black Star (often referred to as Black Star) is the debut studio album by American hip hop duo Black Star, composed of rappers Talib Kweli and Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def). The album was released on September 29, 1998, to critical acclaim. The title is a reference to the Black Star Line, a shipping line founded by Pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey. The album deals with modern-day issues, philosophical ideas, and life in Brooklyn, New York City as the two artists know it.

==Background==
The album came to fruition from the chemistry between the two emcees. Both planned to release their solo albums around the same time, but they postponed their individual projects and decided instead to collaborate on a full-length LP. The album&#x27;s cover was designed by artist Brent Rollins.

== Music and lyrics ==
The late jazz musician Weldon Irvine played the keys on the album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Astronomy,&quot; which interprets the word &quot;black&quot; in a positive way, and contains similes such as &quot;Black, like my baby girl&#x27;s hair&quot;. The next song, and first single, &quot;Definition&quot;, is a stern response to hip hop&#x27;s fascination with death, and a dedication to slain emcees Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. As the chorus goes, &quot;One two three/Mos Def and Talib Kweli/We came to rock it on to the tip top/Best alliance in hip hop, Y-O/I said, one two three/It&#x27;s kinda dangerous to be a MC/They shot 2Pac and Biggie/Too much violence in hip hop, Y-O&quot;. The chorus is also a play on Boogie Down Productions&#x27; anti-gun song &quot;Stop the Violence&quot;, as well as &quot;Remix For P Is Free&quot; from their album Criminal Minded. &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot; is a re-imagined version of Slick Rick&#x27;s original, which features Mos Def cautioning overly materialistic pursuits.

&quot;Brown-Skin Lady&quot; is an affectionate tribute to brown-skinned women. The song encourages black and brown women to be proud of their hair and complexion, and to not be influenced by Western beauty standards. Kweli rhymes, &quot;We&#x27;re not dealin&#x27; with the European standard of beauty tonight/Turn off the TV and put the magazine away/Look in the mirror tell me what you see/I see the evidence of divine presence.&quot;

&quot;Thieves in the Night&quot; was inspired by author Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;. In the album&#x27;s liner notes, Kweli explains that the paragraph &quot;struck me as one of the truest critiques of our society, and I read that in high school when I was 15 years old. I think it is especially true in the world of hip hop, because we get blinded by these illusions.&quot; The excerpt interpolated in the song is as follows: &quot;And fantasy it was, for we were not strong, only aggressive; we were not free, merely licensed; we were not compassionate, we were polite; not good but well-behaved. We courted death in order to call ourselves brave, and hid like thieves from life.&quot; And the version on the track: &quot;Not strong, only aggressive/Not free, we only licensed/Not compassionate, only polite (now who the nicest?)/Not good but well-behaved/Chasin&#x27; after death so we could call ourselves brave, still livin&#x27; like mental slaves/Hiding like thieves in the night from life/Illusions of oasis making you look twice.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Black Star&quot; was voted the 24th best album of 1998 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, a poll of American critics nationwide published annually by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, wrote in a contemporary review that Mos Def and Talib Kweli &quot;devise a hip hop imaginary where hater players lose their girls-not-bitches to MCs so disinterested they give &#x27;em right back. The rhymes are the selling point. But the subculture that cares most about these words is what you&#x27;ll come back to.&quot; According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; writer Colin Larkin, the album abandoned &quot;the negativity of gangsta rap&quot; in favor of &quot;a highly intelligent and searching examination of black culture, harking back to the classic era of rap epitomized by Public Enemy and KRS-One. The album&#x27;s sparse, hard-hitting rhythms were also in marked comparison to the overblown productions of Puff Daddy, which dominated the rap mainstream.&quot;

<doc id="199791" wikidata="Q1754106" url="?curid=199791" title="Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)">
<text>Blind Faith is the only studio album by the English supergroup Blind Faith, originally released in the United States on 9 August 1969 on Atco Records, and in the United Kingdom on 22 August 1969 on Polydor Records and in Europe. It topped the album charts in the UK, Canada and US, and was listed at No. 40 on the US Soul Albums chart. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

== Background ==
The band contained two-thirds of the popular power trio Cream, in Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton, working in collaboration with British star Steve Winwood of the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic, along with Ric Grech of Family. They began to work out songs early in 1969, and in February and March the group was at Morgan Studios in London, although the first few almost-finished songs did not show up until they were at Olympic Studios in April and May under the direction of producer Jimmy Miller.

The recording of their album was interrupted by a tour of Scandinavia, then a US tour from 11 July (Newport) to 24 August (Hawaii), supported by Free, Taste and Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. Although a chart topper, the LP was recorded hurriedly and side two consisted of just two songs, one of them a 15-minute jam entitled &quot;Do What You Like&quot;. Nevertheless, the band produced two hits, Winwood&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot; and Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot;.

== Album cover ==
The cover was a photo by Bob Seidemann of a topless 11-year-old girl, Mariora Goschen, holding a silver-painted model of an aircraft, sculpted for the album shoot by Mick Milligan. The cover was mildly controversial in the British press, with some seeing the model airplane as phallic. The American record company issued the album with an alternative cover, with a photograph of the band on the front, as well as the original cover.

The cover art was created by Seidemann, a friend and former flatmate of Clapton, who is primarily known for his photos of Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. In the mid-1990s, in an advertising circular intended to help sell lithographic reprints of the famous album cover, he explained his thinking behind the image.

Seidemann wrote that he approached a girl, reported to be 14 years old, on the London Underground, asking her to model for the cover. He eventually met her parents, but she proved to be too old for the effect he wanted. Instead, the model he used was her younger sister, Mariora Goschen, who was reported to be 11 years old. Goschen recalled that she was coerced into posing for the picture. &quot;My sister said, &#x27;They’ll give you a young horse. Do it! She was instead paid £40.

The image, which Seidemann titled &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, became the inspiration for the name of the band itself, which had been unnamed when the artwork was commissioned. According to Seidemann: &quot;It was Eric who elected to not print the name of the band on the cover. The name was instead printed on the wrapper, when the wrapper came off, so did the type.&quot; That had been done previously for several other albums.

In America, Atco Records used a cover based on elements from a flyer for the band&#x27;s Hyde Park concert of 7 June 1969.

== Release history ==
The album was released on vinyl in 1969 on Polydor Records in the UK and Europe, and on Atco Records in the US. Polydor released a compact disc in 1986, adding two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;Exchange and Mart&quot; and &quot;Spending All My Days&quot;, recorded by Ric Grech for an unfinished solo album, supported by George Harrison, Denny Laine, and Trevor Burton.

An expanded edition of the album was released on 9 January 2001, with previously unreleased tracks and &#x27;jams&#x27; included. The studio electric version of &quot;Sleeping in the Ground&quot; had previously been released on the four-disc boxed set for Clapton, &quot;Crossroads&quot; (released 1988, recorded 1963–1987, including several previously unreleased live or alternate studio recordings). The bonus disc of jams does not include bassist Grech, who had yet to join the band, but includes a guest percussionist, Guy Warner. Two live tracks from the 1969 Hyde Park concert not included here, &quot;Sleeping in the Ground&quot; and a cover of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;, are also available on Winwood&#x27;s four-disc retrospective &quot;The Finer Things&quot;.

== Reception ==

Commercially, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; charted at number one in both the US and the UK.

The album met with a mixed response from critics. Reviewing in August 1969 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau found none of the songs exceptional and said, &quot;I&#x27;m almost sure that when I&#x27;m through writing this I&#x27;ll put the album away and only play it for guests. Unless I want to hear Clapton—he is at his best here because he is kept in check by the excesses of Winwood, who is rapidly turning into the greatest wasted talent in music. There. I said it and I&#x27;m glad.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ed Leimbacher said of the quality, &quot;not as much as I&#x27;d hoped, yet better than I&#x27;d expected.&quot; His colleagues at the magazine—Lester Bangs and John Morthland—were more impressed, especially Bangs in his appraisal of Clapton: &quot;[With] Blind Faith, Clapton appears to have found his groove at last. Every solo is a model of economy, well- thought-out and well-executed with a good deal more subtlety and feeling than we have come to expect from Clapton.&quot;

Retrospective appraisals have been positive. According to &quot;Stereo Review&quot; in 1988, &quot;for 20 years this has been a cornerstone in any basic rock library.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder regarded the album as &quot;one of the jewels of the Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and Ginger Baker catalogs&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; was ranked 14th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 40 Greatest One Album Wonders&quot;, which described &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot; and &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; as &quot;incredible&quot;.

<text>Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico. It is the northwesternmost of the 32 federal entities of Mexico. Before becoming a state in 1952, the area was known as the North Territory of Baja California (). It has an area of (3.57% of the land mass of Mexico) and comprises the northern half of the Baja California peninsula, north of the 28th parallel, plus oceanic Guadalupe Island. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean; on the east by Sonora, the U.S. state of Arizona, and the Gulf of California; on the north by the U.S. state of California; and on the south by Baja California Sur.

The state has an estimated population of 3,769,020 as of 2020, significantly higher than the sparsely populated Baja California Sur to the south, and similar to San Diego County, California, and Imperial County, California, to its north. Over 75% of the population lives in Mexicali (the state&#x27;s capital city), Ensenada, or Tijuana (the state&#x27;s largest city). Other important cities include San Felipe, Rosarito, and Tecate.

Baja California is the 12th-largest state by area in Mexico. Its geography ranges from beaches to forests and deserts. The backbone of the state is the Sierra de Baja California, where Picacho del Diablo, the highest point of the peninsula, is located. This mountain range effectively divides the weather patterns in the state. In the northwest, the weather is semi-dry and Mediterranean. In the narrow center, the weather changes to be more humid due to altitude. It is in this area where a few valleys can be found, such as the Valle de Guadalupe, the major wine-producing area in Mexico. To the east of the mountain range, the Sonoran Desert dominates the landscape. In the south, the weather becomes drier and gives way to the Vizcaíno Desert. The state is also home to numerous islands off both of its shores. Baja California is also home to Guadalupe Island, the westernmost point of Mexico. The Coronado Islands, Todos Santos islands, and Cedros Island are also on the Pacific shore. On the Gulf of California, the largest island is Angel de la Guarda Island, separated from the peninsula by the deep and narrow Canal de Ballenas.

==History==
===Prehistory and Spanish colonial era===
The first people came to the peninsula at least 11,000 years ago. At that time, two main native groups are thought to have been present on the peninsula – the Cochimí in the south, and several groups belonging to the Yuman language family in the north, including the Kiliwa, Paipai, Kumeyaay, Cocopa, and Quechan. These peoples were diverse in their adaptations to the region. The Cochimí of the peninsula&#x27;s Central Desert were generalized hunter-gatherers who moved frequently; however, the Cochimí on Cedros Island off the west coast developed a strong maritime economy. The Kiliwa, Paipai, and Kumeyaay in the better-watered northwest were also hunter-gatherers, but that region supported denser populations and a more sedentary lifestyle. The Cocopa and Quechan of northeastern Baja California practiced agriculture in the floodplain of the lower Colorado River.

Another group of people was the Guachimis, who came from the north and created much of the UNESCO World Heritage-recognized Sierra de Guadalupe cave paintings. Not much is known about them except that they lived in the area between 100BC and 1300AD.

Europeans reached the present state of Baja California in 1539, when Francisco de Ulloa its east coast on the Gulf of California and explored the peninsula&#x27;s west coast at least as far north as Cedros Island. Hernando de Alarcón returned to the east coast and ascended the lower Colorado River in 1540, and Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo (or João Rodrigues Cabrilho ) completed the reconnaissance of the west coast in 1542. Sebastián Vizcaíno again surveyed the west coast in 1602, but outside visitors during the following century were few.

The Jesuits founded a permanent mission colony on the peninsula at Loreto in 1697. During the following decades, they gradually extended their sway throughout the present state of Baja California Sur. In 1751–1753, the Croatian Jesuit mission-explorer Ferdinand Konščak made overland explorations northward into the state of Baja California. Jesuit missions were subsequently established among the Cochimí at Santa Gertrudis (1752), San Borja (1762), and Santa María (1767).

After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the short-lived Franciscan administration (1768–1773) resulted in one new mission at San Fernando Velicatá. More importantly, the 1769 expedition to settle Alta California under Gaspar de Portolà and Junípero Serra resulted in the first overland exploration of the northwestern portion of the state.

The Dominicans took over management of the Baja California missions from the Franciscans in 1773. They established a chain of new missions among the northern Cochimí and western Yumans, first on the coast and subsequently inland, extending from El Rosario (1774) to Descanso (1817), just south of Tijuana below the Palóu Line.

In 1804, the Spanish crown divided California into Alta (&#x27;Upper&#x27;) and Baja (&#x27;Lower&#x27;) California at the line separating the Franciscan missions in the north from the Dominican missions in the south.
The colonial governors were José Joaquín de Arillaga (1804–1805), Felipe de Goicoechea (1806–1814),
and José Darío Argüello (1814April 11, 1822).

===Post-independence, 1821–present===
====Early republic====
Mexican liberals were concerned that the Roman Catholic Church retained too much power in the post-independence period and sought to undermine it by mandating the secularization of missions in 1833. In the aftermath of the Mexican American War (1846–1848) and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States gained sovereignty over territory previously held first by New Spain and then Mexico, most of which was sparsely settled. Alta California was incorporated into the U.S., and during the California Gold Rush, quickly gained enough population to be admitted to the union as a state. Baja California gains control of where is now the cities of Tijuana, Mexicali, and Tecate from Alta California after the treaty and remained under Mexican control. In 1853, soldier of fortune (mercenary) William Walker captured La Paz, declaring himself president of the Republic of Baja California. The Mexican government forced his retreat after several months.

====Era of Porfirio Díaz====
When liberal army general Porfirio Díaz came to power in 1876, he embarked on a major program to develop and modernize Mexico.

*1884: Luis Huller and George H. Sisson obtain a concession covering much of the present state in return for promises to develop the area.
*1905: The &quot;Magonista&quot; revolution, an anarchist movement based on the writings of Ricardo Flores Magón and Enrique Flores Magón, begins.
*1911: Mexicali and Tijuana are captured by the Mexican Liberal Party (, PLM), but soon surrender to Federal forces.

====Postrevolutionary Mexico====
*1917: On 11 December, &quot;[a] prominent Mexican, close friend of President Carranza&quot; offered to U.S. Senator Henry Ashurst to sell Baja California to the U.S. for &quot;fifty million dollars gold&quot;.
*1931: Baja California is further divided into Northern and Southern territories.
*1952: The &quot;North Territory of Baja California&quot; becomes the 29th state of Mexico, Baja California. The southern portion (below 28°N) remains a federally administered territory.
*1974: The &quot;South Territory of Baja California&quot; becomes the 31st state, Baja California Sur.
*1989: Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the National Action Party (PAN) becomes the first non-Institutional Revolutionary Party governor of Baja California and the first opposition governor of any state since the Revolution. Baja California would acquire a reputation as a stronghold for PAN into the 2010s. 

==Geography==
Baja California encompasses a territory within the Californias region of North America, which exhibits diverse geography for a relatively small area. The Peninsular ranges of the California cordillera run down the geographic center of the state. The most notable ranges of these mountains are the Sierra de Juárez and the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir. These ranges are the location of forests reminiscent of Southern California&#x27;s San Gabriel Mountains. Picacho del Diablo is the highest peak on the peninsula. Valleys between the mountain ranges are located within a climate zone that is suitable for agriculture. Such valleys include the Valle de Guadalupe and the Valle de Ojos Negros, areas that produce citrus fruits and grapes. The mineral-rich mountain range extends southwards to the Gulf of California, where the western slope becomes wider, forming the Llanos del Berrendo on the border with Baja California Sur. The mountain ranges located in the center and southern part of the state include the Sierra de La Asamblea, Sierra de Calamajué, Sierra de San Luis and the Sierra de San Borja.
Temperate winds from the Pacific Ocean and the cold California Current make the climate along the northwestern coast pleasant year-round. As a result of the state&#x27;s location on the California Current, rains from the north barely reach the peninsula, thus leaving southern areas drier. South of the El Rosario River, the state changes from a Mediterranean landscape to a desert one. This desert exhibits diverse succulent species that flourish in part due to the coastal fog.

To the east, the Sonoran Desert enters the state from both California and Sonora. Some of the highest temperatures in Mexico are recorded in or nearby the Mexicali Valley. However, with irrigation from the Colorado River, this area has become a true agricultural center. The Cerro Prieto geothermal province is near Mexicali as well (this area is geologically part of a large pull apart basin); it produces about 80% of the electricity consumed in the state and enough additional power to export to California. Laguna Salada, a saline lake below sea level lying between the rugged Sierra de Juárez and the Sierra de los Cucapah, is also in the vicinity of Mexicali. The state government has recently been considering plans to revive Laguna Salada. The highest mountain in the Sierra de los Cucapah is Cerro del Centinela or Mount Signal. The Cucapah are the primary indigenous people from the mountains north to Yuma, Arizona.
There are numerous islands on the Pacific shore. Guadalupe Island is located in the extreme west of the state&#x27;s boundaries and is the site of large colonies of sea lions. Cedros Island exists in the southwest of the state&#x27;s maritime region. The Todos Santos islands and Coronado Islands are located off the coasts of Ensenada and Tijuana, respectively. All of the islands in the Gulf of California on the Baja California side belong to the municipality of Mexicali.

Baja California obtains much of its water from the Colorado River. Historically, the river drained into the Colorado River Delta and then flowed into the Gulf of California, but due to large demands for water in the American Southwest, less water now reaches the Gulf. The Tijuana metropolitan area also relies on the Tijuana River as a source of water. Much of rural Baja California depends predominantly on wells, a few dams and even oases. Tijuana also purchases water from San Diego County&#x27;s Otay Water District. Potable water is the largest natural resource issue of the state.

===Climate===

Baja California&#x27;s climate varies from Mediterranean to arid. The Mediterranean climate is found in the northwestern corner of the state, where the summers are dry and mild and the winters cool and rainy. This climate is observed in areas from Tijuana to San Quintín and nearby interior valleys. The cold oceanic California Current often creates a low-level marine fog near the coast. The fog occurs along any part of the Pacific coast of the state.
The change of altitude towards the Sierra de Baja California creates an alpine climate in this region. Summers are cool, while winters can be cold with below freezing temperatures at night. It is common to see snow in the Sierra de Juárez, Sierra de San Pedro Mártir and in the valleys in between the two ranges from December to April. Due to orographic effects, precipitation is much higher in the mountains of northern Baja California than on the western coastal plain or eastern desert plain. Pine, cedar and fir forests are found in the mountains.

The east side of the mountains produces a rain shadow, creating an extremely arid environment. The Sonoran Desert region of Baja California experiences hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. The Mexicali Valley (which is below sea level) experiences the highest temperatures in Mexico, frequently surpassing in mid-summer, and exceeding on some occasions.

Further south along the Pacific coast, the Mediterranean climate transitions into a desert climate, but it is milder and not as hot as along the gulf coast. Transition climates, from Mediterranean to desert, can be found from San Quintín to El Rosario. Further inland and along the Gulf of California, the vegetation is scarce and temperatures are very high during the summer months. The islands in the Gulf of California also have a desert climate. Some oases can be found in the desert where few towns are located – for instance, Catavina, San Borja and Santa Gertrudis.

===Flora and fauna===
Common trees in the high elevations are the Jeffrey pine, sugar pine and pinon pine. Understory species include manzanita. There is a variety of reptiles, including the western fence lizard, which is at the southern extent of its range. The name of the fish genus &quot;Bajacalifornia&quot; is derived from the Baja California peninsula.

In the main wildlife refuges on the peninsula of Baja California, Constitution 1857 National Park and Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, several coniferous species can be found. The most abundant are Jeffrey pine, &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;, &quot;Pinus cembroides&quot;, &quot;Pinus quadrifolia&quot;, &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot;, &quot;Juniperus&quot;, &quot;Arctostaphylos pringlei&quot; subsp. &quot;drupacea&quot;, &quot;Artemisia ludoviciana&quot; and &quot;Adenostoma sparsifolium&quot;. Baja California shares many plant species with the Laguna Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains in southwest California. The lower elevations of the Sierra de Juárez are characterized by chaparral and desert shrub. Guadalupe Island and its surrounding waters, off the Pacific coast, has been designated the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve to preserve endangered marine and terrestrial species of animals and plants. 

The fauna in the parks include a large number of mammals, primarily mule deer, bighorn sheep, cougars, bobcats, ringtail cats, coyotes, rabbits, squirrels and more than 30 species of bats. The park is also home to many avian species like bald eagles, golden eagles, falcons, woodpeckers, black vultures, crows, and several species of Sittidae and duck.


===2010 earthquakes===

At 3:40:41 pm PDT on Easter Sunday, 4 April 2010, a 7.2 (on the moment magnitude scale) magnitude northwest-trending strike-slip earthquake hit the Mexicali Valley, with its epicenter southwest of the city of Guadalupe Victoria, Baja California. The main shock was felt as far as the Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas, and in Yuma. At least a half-dozen aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.0 and 5.4 were reported, including a 5.1-magnitude shaker at 4:14 am that was centered near El Centro. As of 6:31am PDT on 5 April 2010, two people were confirmed dead.

==Government==

=== Municipalities of Baja California ===

Baja California is subdivided into seven &quot;municipios&quot; (&#x27;municipalities&#x27;): Ensenada, Mexicali, Tecate, Tijuana, Rosarito, San Quintín and San Felipe.

== Politics ==
===State elections===

In Baja California, state elections are held every two years (every three years prior to 2019) for the positions of state governor, 25 state deputies of the Congress of Baja California, and 5 municipal mayors. Of the 25 state deputies, 17 are elected by relative majority in each of the electoral districts, while another 8 are elected by proportional representation. The 17 deputies elected by relative majority may be re-elected for up to four consecutive terms, while the other 8 deputies can only serve one term.

During the 2019 Baja California state election, Jaime Bonilla Valdez of the Morena-led Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition won by a margin of 27.58% to become the governor of Baja California. In addition, 21 out of 25 state deputy positions and all 5 municipal mayoral positions were won by candidates aligned with the Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition.

During the 2021 Baja California state election, Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda of the Morena-led Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition won by a margin of 17.49% to become the first female governor of Baja California. Of the state&#x27;s 25 local deputies, 13 were won by Morena-aligned candidates, followed in a distant second place by candidates of the Solidarity Encounter Party (PES), National Action Party (PAN), and Labor Party (PT) with 3 seats each. All 5 municipal mayoral positions were again won by Morena-aligned candidates.

In the 2024 Baja California state election, Morena gained an extra seat in the State Congress.

===Federal elections===

During the 2018 Mexican general election, the presidential vote of Baja California was won by a landslide of almost 44% by Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the Morena party. Out of the 8 federal deputies representing Baja California in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, 5 were won by Morena candidates, 2 were won by Social Encounter Party candidates, and 1 was won by a Labor Party candidate. The next Mexican general election is scheduled for 2024.

During the 2021 Mexican legislative election, six of the eight federal deputies representing Baja California in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies were won by Morena candidates, with the other two being won by candidates of the Labor and Ecologist Green parties. The next legislative elections are scheduled for 2024.

==Demographics==



Although the state is more European in ancestry, it has historically seen sizable East and Southeast Asian immigrant population. Mexicali has a large Chinese community, as well as many Filipinos who arrived to the state during the eras of Spanish Philippines and American rule (1898–1946) in much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Tijuana and Ensenada were major ports of entry for East Asians entering the U.S. ever since the first Asian Americans were present in California.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.71% of Baja California&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

Since 1960, large numbers of migrants from southern Mexican states have arrived to work in agriculture (especially the Mexicali Valley and nearby Imperial Valley, California, U.S.) and manufacturing. The cities of Ensenada, Tijuana, and Mexicali grew as a result of migrants, primarily those who sought U.S. citizenship. Those temporary residents awaiting their entry into the United States are called , which is derived from the Spanish word , meaning &#x27;fleet&#x27;.

There is also a sizable immigrant community from Central and South America, and from the United States and Canada. An estimated 200,000+ American expatriates live in the state, especially in coastal resort towns such as Ensenada, known for affordable homes purchased by retirees who continue to hold U.S. citizenship. San Felipe, Rosarito and Tijuana also have a large American population (second largest in Mexico after Mexico City), particularly for their cheaper housing and proximity to San Diego.

Some 60,000 Oaxacans live in Baja California. Some 40% of them lack proper birth certificates.

According to a Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Conacyt) investigator, a little under a million people were classified as &quot;poor&quot; in the state, up from 2008 when there were roughly 810,000. Exactly who these people are, whether locals, interstate or international migrants, was not explained.

==Education==

Baja California offers one of the best educational programs in the country, with high rankings in schooling and achievement.

The state government provides education and qualification courses to increase the workforce standards, such as school–enterprise linkage programs which help the development of a labor force according to the needs of the industry.

91.60% of the population from six to fourteen years of age attend elementary school. 61.95% of the population over fifteen years of age attends or has already graduated from high school. Public school is available in all levels from kindergarten to university.

The state has 32 universities offering 103 professional degrees. These universities have 19 research and development centers for basic and applied investigation in advanced projects related to biotechnology, physics, oceanography, computer science, digital geothermal technology, astronomy, aerospace, electrical engineering and clean energy, among others. At this educational level, supply is steadily growing. Baja California has developed a need to be self-sufficient in matters of technological and scientific innovation and to be less dependent on foreign countries. Current businesses demand new production processes as well as technology for the incubation of companies. The number of graduate degrees offered, including PhD programs, is 121. The state has 53 graduate schools.

==Economy==
As of 2005, Baja California&#x27;s economy represents 3.3% of Mexico&#x27;s gross domestic product, or US$21.996 billion. Baja California&#x27;s economy has a strong focus on tariff-free export oriented manufacturing (maquiladora). As of 2005, 284,255 people are employed in the manufacturing sector. There are more than 900 companies operating under the federal Prosec program in Baja California.

===Employment===
In 2021, Baja California generated 57,550 new jobs, about 15.2 jobs per 1000 inhabitants, making it the 5th highest in the country and the second highest of any border state behind Nuevo León (86,364 new jobs). The majority of these new jobs were generated in and around the cities of Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada, Playas de Rosarito, and Tecate. Industries that experienced the highest degree of growth in 2021 include transformative industries, transport and communication, commerce, and construction.

As of November 2021, Baja California has the highest employment rate of any state in northern Mexico, with a rate of 96.7%.

===Economic investment===
As of September 2021, Baja California receives the third highest amount of foreign direct investment of any state in Mexico, constituting about 7.7% of the national total and behind only Nuevo León (7.7%) and Mexico City (16.5%). About 81.4% of Baja California&#x27;s foreign domestic investment comes from the United States, of which 50.3% comes from the construction of natural gas pipelines and 8.2% comes car and truck manufacturing.

===Real estate===

The Foreign Investment Law of 1973 allows foreigners to purchase land within the borders and coasts of Mexico by way of a trust handled through a Mexican bank (Fideicomiso). This trust assures to the buyer all the rights and privileges of ownership, and it can be sold, inherited, leased, or transferred at any time. Since 1994, the Foreign Investment Law stipulates that , with the option to petition for a 50-year renewal at any time.

Any Mexican citizen buying a bank trust property has the option to either remain within the trust or opt out of it and request the title in .

Mexico&#x27;s early history involved foreign invasions and the loss of vast amounts of land; in fear of history being repeated, the Mexican constitution established the concept of the &quot;Restricted Zone&quot;. In 1973, in order to bring in more foreign tourist investment, the Bank Trust of Fideicomiso was created, thus allowing non-Mexicans to own land without any constitutional amendment necessary. Since the law went into effect, it has undergone many modifications in order to make purchasing land in Mexico a safer investment.

<text>Potato salad is a salad dish made from boiled potatoes, usually containing a dressing and a variety of other ingredients such as boiled eggs and raw vegetables. It is usually served as a side.

== History and varieties ==
Potato salad is found in several countries in Europe. The German Kartoffelsalat is one of the most famous that spread largely throughout Europe, North America, and later Asia. American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century.

Potato salad is generally served cold or at room temperature. Ingredients often include mayonnaise or a comparable substitute (such as yogurt or sour cream), herbs, and raw vegetables (such as onion and celery). South German-style potato salad is served warm or at room temperature and is made with a vinaigrette (rather than a creamy mayonnaise-based dressing), and typically includes bacon. North German potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. It is typically made with mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg and sweet or sour pickles. The American-style potato salad is likely to have originated from this version. Asian-style potato salad is similar to American-style potato salad, but has a sweeter and eggier flavor. 

British potato salad is served chilled. It is usually made with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, onions, spring onions, and chives. Spices such as allspice and turmeric are sometimes included.

The earliest known American potato salad recipes date back to the mid-19th century and are rooted in German cuisine, which was introduced to the United States by European settlers. Early American potato salad was made from cooked potatoes that were typically dressed with oil, vinegar, and herbs.

== French potato salad ==
In France there are several recipes depending on the region. In Alsace and Lorraine, potato salads are made in a similar way as the German version. In Normandy, salade cauchoise is a potato salad where watercress and celery sticks are added together with a bit of crème fraiche.

== Japanese potato salad ==

A version of potato salad in Japan is known as potesara (or potesala ポテサラ), an English loanword portmanteau. 
It traditionally consists of the primary potato salad ingredients (mashed boiled potatoes, chopped onions) mixed with a dressing of mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and karashi mustard. Carrot, cucumber, ham, and mashed boiled eggs can also be added to the salad as desired.

== Russian potato salad ==
=== Ingredients ===
Olivier salad typically includes potatoes, mayonnaise, boiled eggs, boiled carrots and pickled cucumbers. Sometimes canned corn, peas, boiled parsley root, boiled leek or even apples are added. Chopped parsley is commonly used as a garnish. For seasoning the salad only salt and pepper are necessary.

<doc id="199798" wikidata="Q30092" url="?curid=199798" title="Lumbricus terrestris">
<text>Lumbricus terrestris is a large, reddish worm species thought to be native to Western Europe, now widely distributed around the world (along with several other lumbricids). In some areas where it is an introduced species, some people consider it to be a significant pest for out-competing native worms.

Through much of Europe, it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20 to 25 cm in length when extended.

== Common names ==
Because it is widely known, &quot;L. terrestris&quot; goes under a variety of common names. In Britain, it is primarily called the common earthworm or lob worm (though the name is also applied to a marine polychaete). In North America, the term nightcrawler (or vitalis) is also used, and more specifically Canadian nightcrawler, referring to the fact that the large majority of these worms sold commercially (usually as fishing bait) are from Southern Ontario. In Canada, it is also called the dew worm, or &quot;Grandaddy Earthworm&quot;. In several Germanic languages, it is called variants of &quot;rain worm&quot;, for example in German &quot;Gemeiner Regenwurm&quot; (&quot;common rain worm&quot;) or in Danish &quot;Stor regnorm&quot; (&quot;large rain worm&quot;). In the rest of the world, many references are just to the scientific name, though with occasional reference to the above names.

Although this is not the most abundant earthworm, even in its native range, it is a very conspicuous and familiar earthworm species in garden and agricultural soils of the temperate zone, and is frequently seen on the surface, unlike most other earthworms. It is also used as the example earthworm for millions of biology students around the world, even in areas where the species does not exist. However, &#x27;earthworm&#x27; can be a source of confusion since, in most of the world, other species are more typical. For example, through much of the unirrigated temperate areas of the world, the &quot;common earthworm&quot; is actually &quot;Aporrectodea&quot; (=&quot;Allolobophora&quot;) &quot;trapezoides&quot;, which in those areas is a similar size and dark colour to &quot;L. terrestris&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; is relatively large, pinkish to reddish-brown in colour, generally in length and about in diameter. It has around 120–170 segments, often 135–150. The body is cylindrical in the cross section, except for the broad, flattened posterior section. Head end dark brown to reddish brown lateral, dorsal pigmentation fading towards the back.

The worm has a hydrostatic skeleton and moves by longitudinal and circular muscular contractions. Setae – tiny hair-like projections – provide leverage against the surrounding soil. Surface movements on moist, flat terrain were reported at a speed of 20 m/h and, based on measurements of the length of the trail, nocturnal activity away from the burrow was estimated at up to 19 m during a single surface foray. Such movement is apparent during and after heavy rainfall and usually happens when people become aware of relatively large numbers of earthworms in, for example, urban ecosystems. This form of activity is often considered a way to escape floods and waterlogged burrows. However, this cannot be the case since &quot;L. terrestris&quot;, like other earthworms, can live in oxygenated water for long periods of time, stretching to weeks. Under less severe environmental conditions where air temperature and moisture are sufficient, the worm often moves around on the surface. This may be driven by resource availability or the desire to avoid mating with close relatives.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; is a deep-burrowing earthworm, that is, it builds deep vertical burrows and surfaces to feed, as opposed to burrowing through the soil for its food as species. It removes litter from the soil surface, pulling it down into the mineral layer, and deposit casts of mixed organic and mineral material on the soil surface. It lives in semi-permanent burrows and can reside in or escape to deeper soil layers.

Its activity is limited by temperature and humidity. High soil and night air temperatures inhibit activity, as do low night moisture and dry soil. During such times, particularly in the summer, the worms will retreat to the deepest parts of their burrows. Winter temperatures can also reduce activity, while activity in maritime climates can continue through winter.

&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; can strongly influence soil fungi, creating distinctive micro-habitats called middens, which strongly affect the spatial distribution of plant litter and litter-dwelling animals on the soil surface. In the soil system, &quot;L. terrestris&quot; worm casts have a relationship with plants which can be seen in such scenarios as plant propagation from seed or clone. Worm casts initiate root development, root biomass, and in effect, increase root percentage as opposed to the soil and soil systems without worm casts.

In parts of Europe, notably the Atlantic fringe of northwestern Europe, it is now locally endangered due to predation by the New Zealand flatworm (&quot;Arthurdendyus triangulatus&quot;) and the Australian flatworm (&quot;Australoplana sanguinea&quot;), two predatory flatworms accidentally introduced from New Zealand and Australia. These predators are very efficient earthworm eaters, being able to survive for lengthy periods with no food, so still persist even when their prey has dropped to unsustainably low populations. In some areas, this is having a seriously adverse effect on the soil structure and quality. The soil aeration and organic material mixing previously done by the earthworms has ceased in some areas.

===Diet===
&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; is a detritivore that eats mainly dead leaves on the soil floor and A-horizon mineral soil. Preference is associated with high concentrations of calcium and likely nitrogen. As a result, ash, basswood and aspen are most favored, followed by sugar maple and maple varieties. Oak is less palatable due to its low concentration of calcium, but will be eaten if no higher calcium leaves are available.

While they generally feed on plant material, they have been observed feeding on dead insects, soil micro-organisms, and feces.

===Reproduction===
&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; is an obligatorily biparental, simultaneous hermaphrodite worm, that reproduces sexually with individuals mutually exchanging sperm. Copulation occurs on the soil surface, but partners remain anchored in their burrow and mating is preceded by repeated mutual burrow visits between neighbors. Additionally, when mates separate, one of them can be pulled out of its burrow. Mating frequency is relatively high (once every 7–11 days). The relative size of the mate, the distance from the presumed mates, the chance of being dragged to the surface, and the size-related fecundity all tend to play key roles in the mating behavior of the nightcrawler.

Sperm is stored for as long as 8 months, and mated individuals produce cocoons for up to 12 months after the mating. Fertilization takes place in the cocoon and the cocoon is deposited in a small chamber in the soil adjacent to the parental burrow. After a few weeks, young worms emerge and begin to feed in the soil. In the early juvenile phase, the worms do not develop the vertical burrows typical of adults. Adulthood is likely to require a minimum of one year of development, with reproductive maturity reached in the second year. The natural lifespan of &quot;L. terrestris&quot; is unknown, though individuals have lived for six years in captivity.

==As an invasive species in North America==

&quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; is considered invasive in the north central United States. It does not do well in tilled fields because of pesticide exposure, physical injuries from farm equipment and a lack of nutrients. It thrives in fence rows and woodlots and can lead to reductions in native herbaceous and tree regrowth.

<doc id="199799" wikidata="Q2906621" url="?curid=199799" title="Blind Melon (album)">
<text>Blind Melon is the debut studio album by American rock band Blind Melon, released on September 22, 1992, through Capitol Records. &quot;No Rain&quot; became Blind Melon&#x27;s breakthrough single.

== Background ==
In 1990, lead singer Shannon Hoon moved from Indiana to Los Angeles. Soon he met guitarist Rogers Stevens and bassist Brad Smith, both Mississippi natives who had come to Los Angeles a year earlier. They began playing together and then recruited a second guitarist, Christopher Thorn. The foursome then looked for a drummer in the local area, but months passed and their search was unsuccessful. Stevens and Smith eventually persuaded Glen Graham to come to Los Angeles and join the band.

After Blind Melon recorded a four-song demo called &quot;The Goodfoot Workshop&quot;, Capitol Records became interested and signed them in 1991 although they never released the band&#x27;s demo as an EP. Blind Melon then collaborated with producer David Briggs to put together their first EP titled &quot;The Sippin&#x27; Time Sessions&quot;. However, the record was not released due to &quot;slick and doctored&quot; results that were unanticipated.

In late 1991, Blind Melon decided to leave Los Angeles to record its debut album since they felt the city did not reflect their music style. The band retreated to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, because of its &quot;good music scene&quot;, however they could not find an affordable house big enough there for them and their equipment. The band eventually rented a house at 926 West Trinity Avenue in Durham, North Carolina.

== Production ==
Some recording sessions for the album took place at their Durham, North Carolina, residence, nicknamed the &#x27;Sleepyhouse&#x27;. Thorn stated, &quot;We rehearsed in the house and recorded in the house. We became a much better band in the house, and that&#x27;s where we really developed our sound.&quot; However, Blind Melon recorded the bulk of the album with producer Rick Parashar (who had produced Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;) at London Bridge Studio in Seattle. The recording sessions for &quot;Blind Melon&quot; were completed in the spring of 1992.

&quot;Blind Melon&quot;&#x27;s production is marked by the use of outdated amplifiers and other antiquated studio technology. Modern studio effects were not used in its production as the band wanted to create a pure and &quot;intimate&quot; sounding record. Hoon stated, &quot;We all kind of liked the production that was on a lot of early Stones records, [where] whatever it is you&#x27;re playing is what it&#x27;s going to sound like.&quot;

On the album, Rogers Stevens&#x27;s guitar playing is predominantly heard in the right channel, while Chris Thorn&#x27;s is in the left.

=== Composition ===
The album&#x27;s music style has been described as alternative, southern rock with a &#x27;70s retro-rock feel. Hoon&#x27;s vocals on the record are high-pitched, and &quot;scratchy&quot; sounding. A couple of the songs on &quot;Blind Melon&quot; criticize religion. &quot;Holyman&quot; slams people who maintain that only their religious views are right, and &quot;Dear Ol&#x27; Dad&quot; is about Hoon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend who left him because of religion. The song &quot;Sleepyhouse&quot; is a recollection of a time the band spent at their residence of the same name, and with friends at a yellow house in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The lyrics to &quot;Tones of Home&quot; were written collaboratively.

=== Artwork ===
&quot;Blind Melon&quot;&#x27;s cover art is based on a 1975 photograph of Georgia Graham, Glen Graham&#x27;s younger sister, in a bee costume at a &quot;long-ago&quot; school play. “We were all sitting around in the living room and that picture just jumped out at us. Someone jokingly said, ‘That would make a great album cover.’ ” The cover art further inspired the concept of the &#x27;Bee Girl&#x27; character in the band&#x27;s video for &quot;No Rain&quot;. Samuel Bayer, the video&#x27;s director, selected Heather DeLoach for the &#x27;Bee Girl&#x27; role because she looked similar to Graham&#x27;s sister in the photograph.

In 2021, the band shared this comment by Glen Graham on Facebook: &quot;This photo was taken around 1976 at Joe Cook Jr. High School auditorium in Columbus, MS during a Jazz/Tap/Ballet recital of 4-6 year olds conducted by Mrs. Betty Lott&#x27;s English School of Dance. Blind Melon spent about six weeks in Columbus in the winter of &#x27;91 before moving to what we dubbed the Sleepy House in Durham, NC. During that time, Christopher Thorn spotted the photo in my parents house and suggested using it for the album cover.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that &quot;influences from the &#x27;70s abound, from Shannon Hoon&#x27;s sunny Steve Miller-style vocals to tempo shifts of Jethro Tull-ish trickiness and whole pastures for jamming, jamming and jamming.&quot;

==Legacy and accolades==
In 2022, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Blind Melon&quot; No. 8 on their list of &quot;The 30 greatest rock guitar albums of 1992&quot;.

<text>Baja California Sur, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California Sur, is the least populated state and the 31st and last state to be admitted to Mexico, in 1974. It is also the ninth-largest Mexican state in terms of area.

Before becoming a state on 8 October 1974, the area was known as the &quot;El Territorio Sur de Baja California&quot; (&quot;South Territory of Lower California&quot;). It has an area of , or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico, and occupies the southern half of the Baja California Peninsula, south of the 28th parallel, plus the uninhabited Rocas Alijos in the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered to the north by the state of Baja California, to the west by the Pacific Ocean, and to the east by the Gulf of California. The state has maritime borders with Sonora and Sinaloa to the east, across the Gulf of California.

The state is home to the tourist resorts of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo. Its largest city and capital is La Paz.

==Etymology==

The first European known to have landed in Baja California was a rebel navigator named Fortún Ximénez, who killed his captain and one of envoys of Hernán Cortés, in his sleep, while he led a revolt and ruined entire mission. Ximénez and the accomplice crewmen still in navigation ruined the sail in the peninsula and were hostile with the Indians due their collected giant pearls and because explorers wanted rape the women. This started a brawl with the Indians and Ximénez was murdered. The survivor Spanish navigators withdrew the coast and sailed erratically for several days until they reached the shores of the present-day Jalisco, where they encountered a subaltern of Nuño de Guzmán, who personally did not like Cortés, and requisitioned the ship and took them prisoner reporting mistakenly that peninsula are an island and starting its initial European misconception as an island. After three attempts by Hernán Cortés to colonize the area for Spain, included one mission commanded by himself, someone who also personally did not like Cortés and a writer of the time cites as &quot;Alarcón&quot;, started calling the region as &quot;California&quot;, a mythical island described in the popular novel of the time Las Sergas de Esplandián as a mock against Cortés, creating the tradition of name as it the region. The name California applied to this peninsula along with the areas now known as the state of California and part of the state of Arizona in the United States. 

In 1888, in order to manage the mining in the region, the federal government under Porfirio Diaz divided the peninsula in north and south, creating a federal territory named &quot;El Territorio Sur de Baja California&quot; () and the territory became a state on 8 October 1974, named after the peninsula on which it is found, Baja (Lower) California, with the term &quot;Sur&quot; meaning &quot;south&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===

Japanese archaeologist Harumi Fujita, who has been excavating the Cape Region since 1985, has carbon-dated remains from the Babisuri Shelter on the Isla Espíritu Santo to 40,000 years ago, placing the earliest habitation date in the Archaic period, though the majority of remains indicate indigenous people have constantly occupied the area from between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago. Evidence of early human habitation is found in primitive rock and cave paintings dating to 1700 BCE, created by hunting and gathering societies that lived in rock shelters. The state is one of five areas in the world with important concentrations of cave paintings. These paintings have an identifiable style and tend to be on a monumental scale with some figures as tall as . Most of the animals are painted in silhouette and depicted in movement, often being hunted by people. The best known site is the Great Mural Rock Art, which dates from 1700 BCE, located in the north of the state. Other important sites include Cueva de Palma, San Gregorio, Santa Teresa, Guadalupe, San Francisco, Cabo Pulmo, Santiago and San Borjita. The most important concentrations are in twelve square kilometer zone in the north of the state, centered on the Sierra de San Francisco. In sites near Comondú, Las Palmas and Cocheros, there are also arrowheads, utensils and petroglyphs. Las Palmas contains secondary burials of human bones painted with red ochre.

When the Spanish arrived, there were four main ethnic groups: the Pericúes in the south between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz, the Guaycuras in the area north of the Pericú to Loreto, the Monquis near Loreto and Cochimí in the middle of the peninsula. All were hunter/gatherers without agriculture or metalworking, but produced pottery. They also fished, but only the Pericúes had rafts.

===Colonial era===


The first Spaniard in the area is believed to be Fortún Ximénez, arriving in 1533. He and his crew did not remain long because they sacked the area&#x27;s pearls and abused the women, prompting a violent confrontation with the natives, who killed Ximénez. The remaining crew returned to Mexico City with the pearls and stories of riches.

In 1535, Hernán Cortés navigated into the Gulf of California, which he called the &quot;Sea of Cortés&quot;. He landed in what is now the bay of La Paz, which he named the Santa Cruz Port and Valley. This event is celebrated in La Paz as its founding. However, he did not remain.

Despite various explorations, the remoteness of the region impeded efforts at colonization until the 17th century. In 1697, Jesuit missionary Juan María de Salvatierra established the Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó Mission, the first permanent one of its kind in Baja California Sur. From there the order spread through most of the current state, founding sixteen missions in territory of the current state to work among the Pericú, Guaycura and Cochimí peoples.

During the 18th century, more colonists arrived, bringing diseases that caused a significant decrease in the indigenous population.

In 1768, the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain and the Franciscans took over the missions, continuing the expansion north. In 1773 they were replaced by the Dominicans. A number of these mission churches still survive, including the Loreto Mission, the La Paz Cathedral, the San José del Cabo Mission and the San Javier Mission.

===19th century===

The missions&#x27; influence had waned by the start of the nineteenth century, with most closing. However, many of the mission facilities became the centers for ranching operations and some agriculture. Without the protection of the monks, and the lack of governmental control, the indigenous peoples of this time were abused by the ranchers.

In the early 19th century, Baja California was divided into four municipalities, Loreto, San José del Cabo, San Pedro Mártir and Santa Gertrudis.

The southern peninsula&#x27;s isolation kept it out of the fighting during the Mexican War of Independence. Although this war ended in 1821, the remoteness of the area allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the southern peninsula until 1822. Afterwards, it was divided into four municipalities by Guadalupe Victoria and governor José María Echendía.

Loreto was the original capital of the peninsula but destruction of the town by heavy rains in 1828 forced the government&#x27;s relocation first to San Antonio, birthplace of local deputy Antonio Cota, near the then Port of La Paz, where him proposed translate functions, relocating definitively here months later which has been the capital since, finishing works until 1830.

The United States invaded the peninsula during the Mexican–American War and wanted it as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but the Mexican government succeeded in keeping control of the territory. In 1853, William Walker and 45 other Americans captured La Paz. However, due to lack of official U.S. support they were quickly driven out by Mexican forces.

During the Reform War, Liberal forces under General Manuel Marquez de Leon and others captured La Paz. French forces then invaded the country to support the Conservative cause, and Governor Felix Gilbert recognized Emperor Maximilian. However, Mexican forces under Benito Juarez forced the French out, with Coronel Clodomiro Cota, recapturing the peninsula from the French.

The division of the peninsula into north and south occurred in 1888 by the federal government under Porfirio Diaz.

===20th century to present===
During the regime of Porfirio Diaz (1876 to 1910), the Mexican government invited foreign enterprises to enter the country to develop it. In Baja California, these included mining operations including a major French mine called El Boleo (near Santa Rosalia) and the establishment of maritime routes. This president also divided the peninsula into two parts, each with its own government but the southern half not as a state, naming the territory El Territorio Sur de Baja California ().

The south of the peninsula was not involved in the Mexican Revolution until after the assassination of Francisco I. Madero, when troops were organized in opposition to Victoriano Huerta, his successor under Félix Ortega. These troops defeated federal troops in 1914 and took over La Paz.

From the end of the Mexican Revolution to 1974, the territory had ten governors appointed by the federal government. The division of the peninsula was further formalized in 1931, with a highway extending its length the same year. Infrastructure development remained a priority for the area, with the establishment of schools including the first teachers&#x27; college in 1942, and projects to provide water and electricity.

The southern territory became a state on 8 October 1974, with three municipalities: La Paz, Comondú and Mulegé. Two others have been carved out since then, Los Cabos (1981) and Loreto (1992).

==Geography==

The state is on a narrow peninsula that broke away from the mainland about two million years ago due to tectonic activity. The territory is primarily mountains or mountain ranges and coastal plains. The mountain ranges parallel the coastline and are of volcanic rock. The local name for the main mountain range is the Sierra de la Giganta and the highest peak is the Sierra de la Laguna at 2080m above sea level. The coastal plains are significantly wider on the Pacific side, averaging about 40 km, with much wider plains such as those of Santa Clara, Berrendo and Magdalena y Hiray. These areas are dominated by sedimentary rock, especially limestone of marine origin.

The state is divided into five regions: Central Desert, La Serranía, the Vizcaíno Desert, the Magdalena Plains and Los Cabos. The Central Desert has desert plants, with vegetation springing up during short and irregular rains. The La Serranía is the high mountain areas with significant tree cover, some species of which are commercially valuable. The Vizcaíno Desert runs along the Pacific coast around the Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons; it contains lower mountain ranges such as the San Francisco, San Alberto, Las Tinajas de Murillo and El Serrucho, along with the El Azufre and Las Vírgenes volcanos. The Magdalena Plains is a large, flat area near the Pacific coast, and the Los Cabos region is distinguished by microclimates determined by the geologic change in the area and rain patterns.

The climate of the state is dry, with an average annual temperature of 18–22 °C and average annual rainfall of less than 200mm. The lower elevations are the driest and hottest, with summer daytime temperatures above 40 °C; wintertime temperatures may fall below freezing. The exception to desert conditions is the Los Cabos region, classified as semi-moist because of Pacific hurricane activity affecting the region. In the spring, prevailing winds are from the west and in the summer from the south and southwest. In the fall, they are from the northwest and in the winter from the north and northwest.

Most of the surface water is in the form of seasonal streams, which are fast-flowing and only active during stormy weather. Most of these drain into the Pacific Ocean, with a number flowing south into the Bahía de Ballenas.

The main geological feature of the state is its coastline, which measures 2230 km, making it Mexico&#x27;s longest with 22% of the total. It also has the most islands, mostly in the Gulf of California. There are three in the Pacific, Natividad, Magdalena and Santa Margarita (the largest). In the Gulf of California, they include San Marcos, Coronados, Carmen, Montserrat, Santa Catalina, Santa Cruz, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Partida, Espiritu Santo and Cerralvo. Major bays include Sebastian Vizcaino, Magdalena, La Paz, Asunción, Ballenas, Concepcion and San Carlos. Estuaries and lagoons including those at Puerto Escondido, Nopoló, Balandra as well as the San José estuary at Cabo Colorado, the San Ignacio Lagoon and the Ojo de Liebre.

The ecological system here is considered to be recently evolved with a number of endemic species. The lower elevations are dominated by desert and arid condition plants. This includes the world&#x27;s largest species of cactus, the cardón cactus, which can reach heights of 15m. Other plant species include mesquite, chironola, lechuguilla, nopal and barrel cactus, choyas, paloadan and pitahaya. The higher elevations have forests of pine and holm oak with some deciduous forests, with leaves falling in the dry season, generally no taller than fifteen meters. Wildlife in the desert areas is restricted to birds, reptiles and small-to-medium mammals such as rabbits and coyotes. Upper elevations with more vegetation can have wild sheep, pumas and other wild cats, raccoons, deer, and foxes. Marine species include whales, seals, dolphins, gray whales, manta rays and sea turtles.

Baja California Sur has the largest protected surface area in Mexico, 38.3% of the state in 10 official protected areas: Bahía de Loreto National Park (510,472.2 acres), Cabo Pulmo National Park (17&#x27;570 acres), Espíritu Santo Archipelago National Park (120,228.70 acres), El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve (6,293,255.76 acres), Ojo de Liebre Lagoon Bioshere Reserve (196,026.15 acres), Sierra de la Laguna Biosphere Reserve (277,838.05 acres), Balandra Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (6,209.09 acres) and Cabo San Lucas Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (9,874.42 acres). Also, the islands located in Baja California Sur coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California are protected under Pacific Islands of the Baja California Peninsula Biosphere Reserve with Baja California, and Islands of the Gulf of California Protection Area of Flora and Fauna, which shares with the states of Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora.

==Demographics==

59% of the state&#x27;s population are mestizos, 40% are whites, and 1% are indigenous. As of 2010, 86% of the population lived in urban areas. According to the 2020 Census, 3.3% of Baja California Sur&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.
=== Largest cities===
The average years of schooling for those over 15 years of age is 9.6, above the national average of 8.9. It has a low illiteracy rate of 3%, lower than that of the country (6.1%).
Institutions of higher education include:
*Autonomous University of Baja California Sur (&quot;Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur&quot;, UABCS)
*Instituto Tecnologico de La Paz (ITLP)
*Centro de investigaciones biologicas del noroeste (CIBNOR)
*Centro Interdiciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR)
*Universidad Pedagógica Nacional (UPN)
*Universidad Internacional de la Paz (UNIPAZ)
*Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Los Cabos (ITES)
*Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Ciudad Constitución (ITSCC)
*Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Mulegé (ITESME)


===Political divisions===

The state is the southern part of the Baja California Peninsula, located in the northwest of Mexico, part of the larger The Californias region of North America. With a territory of 73,909 km2, it is about 750 km long and averages about 100 km wide.

The state is divided into five municipalities. Comondú is located in the center of the state with its seat at Ciudad Constitución. It borders the municipalities of Mulegé, Loreto and La Paz with the Pacific Ocean to the west. Mulegé is in the north of the state with its capital in Santa Rosalía, with two other important population centers at Guerrero Negro and Mulegé. It borders the municipalities of Comondú and Loreto with Baja California to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Gulf of California to the east. It accounts for almost 45% of the state&#x27;s territory. The municipality of La Paz is in the south of the state. It is the second largest municipality, accounting for just over 27% of the territory of the state. It borders the municipalities of Comondú and Los Cabos and extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of California. The municipality of Los Cabos is at the southern tip of the state, with its seat at San José del Cabo, and its most populous city is Cabo San Lucas. The municipality is one of the most important tourist destinations in Mexico. The municipality borders that of La Paz to the north, with the rest defined by the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California. The municipality of Loreto is in the center of the state, with the city of Loreto as its seat. It borders the municipalities of Mulegé and Comondú with the Gulf of California to the east.

==Economy==

Traditionally based mostly on tourism, sport fishing, salt production, and mining, in 2012 the GDP of the state accounted for only 0.73% of the country&#x27;s GDP, but grew 3.13% in comparison to the year prior. In 2013, this growth increased to 7.8%. Unemployment in 2013 was 5.1% with employment shifting away from agriculture and fishing to mining and industry (up 19.9%) and commerce (up 4.9%). Today, agriculture, fishing and forestry account for only 3.89% of the state GDP. Commercial species include tuna, sardines, anchovies, clams, snails, oysters, shark, lobsters, abalone, shrimp, and crabs, which are sold both nationally and internationally. Commercial fishing harvests lobster, shrimp, tuna, abalone, and clams. Major crops include garbanzo beans, sorghum, tomatoes, alfalfa, wheat, corn and green chili peppers. Livestock includes pigs, cattle, goats and chickens.

Mining, construction and utilities account for 26.61%. Mining includes plaster (mainly on San Marcos Island), limestone (in Todos los Santos), phosphorus (in San Juan de La Costa and Adolfo LópezMateos, Comondú), copper (in Santa Rosalía), gold and silver (in the Triunfo-San Antonio mine), manganese (in Santa Rosalia and Punta Concepción Bay) and chrome (in San SebastiánVizcaíno and Magdalena bays). There are other minerals not yet routinely mined such as titanium, tungsten, and cobalt. There is some possibility of offshore hydrocarbons. The state also produces salt of 99.7% purity, mostly in the area around Guerrero Negro. There are two major industrial/technology parks: Parque Tecnológico BioHelis and Parque Industrial La Paz Sur. Traditional handcrafts can be found throughout the state and include articles made with seashells, palo chino, choya and cardon cactus. Baskets and other items are woven from palm fronds especially in el Triunfo Los Planes and the Sierra de los Dolores as well as fishing nets. Another important craft is leatherwork, especially the making of gear for horseback riding such as saddles, holsters and chaps along with belts and carrying bags. In addition, scrap metal is converted into various types of knives.

Commerce and services account for 69.5% of the GDP. La Paz was ranked 31st in Mexico by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation in ease of doing business and 23rd as a place to open a business. Major activities of this type include hotel and food service (16.43%) and housing sales and rentals (10.67%), which along with other activities (17.65%) account for 58.37% of the total GDP.

The most dynamic aspect of the economy is tourism, with a number of natural resources suited for this purpose, such as the grey whales that come to the area to breed and the natural rock arch at Land&#x27;s End is frequently photographed. Tourist attractions are divided into three regions: north (Guerrero Negro to Ciudad Constitución), center (La Paz to Todos Santos), and south (Los Barriles to Cabo San Lucas). There are two main resort areas, Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo, both in the southern tip of the peninsula. A highway known as the Corridor links the two towns. Other attractions include deep sea fishing, golf, tennis, motorcycling, scuba diving and snorkeling, with windsurfing at Medano Beach and surfing at Todos Santos, Pescadero East Cape and Scorpion Bay.

Other important activities include fishing and fish farming, alternative energy production, mineral and salt extraction, film production, information and communication technologies, and biotechnology. Local fruits include dates, green papaya in syrup, along with guavas and pitahaya. Santa Rosalia is known for its production of breads.

==Transportation==

As of 2011, the state has 5,651 km of highway, eleven ports (five of which are international), and four international airports.

The peninsula&#x27;s main transport artery is Mexican Federal Highway 1, which runs from the southern end of the peninsula at Cabo San Lucas to the United States-Mexico border at San Ysidro.

Mexican Federal Highway 19 provides an alternate route between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.

A toll road, Mexican Federal Highway 1D, provides an alternate route from Los Cabos International Airport to Cabo San Lucas.

There are also ferries from the east coast of the peninsula to the mainland, with most going to Mazatlán in the state of Sinaloa. This trip takes about thirteen hours. The state&#x27;s main airports are Los Cabos International Airport and Manuel Márquez de León International Airport.

==Media==
Newspapers of Baja California Sur include: &quot;El Peninsular&quot;, &quot;El Periódico&quot;, &quot;El Sudcaliforniano &quot;, and &quot;Tribuna de los Cabos.&quot;

==Culture==

Three of the indigenous cultures remain, the Cochimí, the Guaycura and the Pericú. Traditional music is usually played by trios playing an accordion and two guitars in bands called &quot;cochi&quot;, in styles such as corridos, waltzes, polkas and mazurkas along with norteño. Traditional dress for women includes a semicircular red skirt decorated with local flora, along with a flowered blouse. This is most often seen at festivals where traditional dances such as Las Pitahayas, El Conejo, El Apasionado, El Chaverán, La Yuca, La Cuera, Las Calabazas and El Tupé are performed.
Because of the long coastline, much of the state&#x27;s cuisine is based on seafood, including species not normally eaten in other parts of Mexico such as manta rays. Oregano and a local herb called damiana are common seasonings. The latter is also used as a flavoring for a local liquor. Traditional dishes include breaded and fried clams, machaca and generally accompanied by flour tortillas. 

In a fishing village that was the subject of Siegelman, Haenn, and Basurto’s ethnographic research, jokes/lies, called &quot;mentiras&quot; (meaning jokes, lies, teases, etc. based on context), were used as a social tool to build group solidarity, distinguish between insiders and outsiders, and encourage exclusivity in resource extraction. This is a masculine practice, connected with machismo, that is person- and context-specific. Three general categories of these jokes/lies were identified: jokes between men, exaggerations about fishing accomplishments, and profit-oriented deceptions during fish sales. The jokes between men are bragging stories and half-jokes used for self-aggrandizement and comic relief. Prolonged versions of these jokes can be used as a gullibility test, going on until the listener(s) catch on and the group starts to laugh. This behavior ultimately reinforces bonds between fishermen by manipulating boundaries of inclusion. Exaggerations about fishing accomplishments are lies rather than jokes and are used to maintain their reputations as successful fishermen. This is socially acceptable and even expected from peers. Profit-oriented deceptions during fish sales involve tipping scales toward extra profit when fisheries weigh their catch and understating the amount of gasoline or bait used to deflate the debt to their patrons in an effort to pad their earnings. Buyers are aware that contending with these lies is part of the process so they are often seen as harmless. One of the reasons for these jokes/lies is a commitment to harmony because they are methods to diffuse conflicts including those over fishing resources. Their ambiguity allows social interventions that go awry to be played off and their humor could be used to ease tensions.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms emphasizes the state&#x27;s connection to the sea, including images of silver fish, a silver shell and a blue background. This with a top crown was the arms of the Province of Las Californias, including modern Baja California Sur, Baja California, the American state of California and part of Arizona state.

<text>Parallel Lines is the third studio album by American rock band Blondie, released on September 8, 1978, by Chrysalis Records. An instant critical and commercial success, the album reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in February 1979 and proved to be the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the United States, where it reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in April 1979. In &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was listed at No. 9 in its top pop albums year-end chart of 1979. The album spawned several successful singles, notably the international hit &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;.

==Background==
Blondie&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Plastic Letters&quot; (1977), was their last album produced by Richard Gottehrer, whose sound had formed the basis of Blondie&#x27;s new wave and punk output. During a tour of the west coast of the US in support of &quot;Plastic Letters&quot;, Blondie encountered Australian producer Mike Chapman in California. Peter Leeds, Blondie&#x27;s manager, conspired with Chrysalis Records to encourage Chapman to work with Blondie on new music. Drummer Clem Burke recalls feeling enthusiastic about the proposition, believing Chapman could create innovative and eclectic records. However, lead vocalist Debbie Harry was far less enthusiastic about Chapman&#x27;s involvement as she knew him only by reputation; according to Chapman, her animosity towards him was because &quot;they were New York. [He] was L.A.&quot;. Harry&#x27;s cautiousness abated after she played Chapman early cuts of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; and &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; and he was impressed.

==Recording==
In June 1978 the band entered the Record Plant in New York to record their third album, and first with Chapman. However, Chapman found the band difficult to work with, remembering them as the worst band he ever worked with in terms of musical ability, although praising Frank Infante as &quot;an amazing guitarist&quot;. Sessions with Chris Stein were hampered by his being stoned during recording, and Chapman encouraged him to write songs rather than play guitar. Similarly, according to Chapman, Jimmy Destri would prove himself to be far better at songwriting than as a keyboardist, and Clem Burke had poor timing playing drums. As a result, Chapman spent time improving the band, especially Stein with whom Chapman spent hours rerecording his parts to ensure they were right. Bassist Nigel Harrison became so frustrated with Chapman&#x27;s drive for perfection that he threw a synthesizer at him during recording. Chapman recalls the atmosphere at the Record Plant in an interview for &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;:

Chapman took an unorthodox approach when recording with Harry whom he describes as &quot;a great singer and a great vocal stylist, with a beautifully identifiable voice. However ... also very moody&quot;. Chapman was far more cautious of demanding much from Harry as he saw her as a highly emotional person who would vest these emotions in the songs they made. He remembers Harry disappearing into the bathroom in tears for several hours at a time during recording. During a day of recording, Harry sang two lead parts and some harmonies, less work than she did previously with Gottehrer. This was due to Chapman encouraging her to be cautious about the way she sang, particularly to recognise phrasing, timing and attitude.

Blondie recorded &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; in six weeks, despite being given six months by Terry Ellis, co-founder of Chrysalis Records, to do so. For the drums, a traditional set-up was used and Chapman fitted Neumann microphones to the toms, snare and hi-hat, as well as several above the site. When recording, Chapman would start with the bass track, which was difficult to record at the time, by way of &quot;pencil erasing&quot;. Chapman explained in an interview for &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, &quot;that meant using a pencil to hold the tape away from the head and erasing up to the kick drum. If a bass part was ahead of the kick, you could erase it so that it sounded like it was on top of the kick. That&#x27;s very easy to do these days, but back then it was quite a procedure just to get the bottom end sounding nice and tight.&quot; A combination DI/amp method was used to record Harrison&#x27;s bass and Destri&#x27;s synthesizer. Shure SM57 and AKG 414 microphones were used to capture Infante&#x27;s Les Paul guitar. King Crimson leader Robert Fripp makes a guest appearance on guitar on &quot;Fade Away and Radiate&quot;.

After the basic track was complete, Chapman would record lead and backing vocals with Harry. However, this process was hampered by many songs not being written in time for the vocals to be recorded. &quot;Sunday Girl&quot;, &quot;Picture This&quot; and &quot;One Way Or Another&quot; were all unfinished during the rehearsal sessions. When recording vocal parts, Chapman remembers asking Harry if she was ready to sing, only for her to reply &quot;Yeah, just a minute&quot; as she was still writing lyrics down. Chapman notes that many &quot;classic&quot; songs from the album were created this way.

During the last session at the Record Plant, the band were asleep on the floor only to be awakened at six o&#x27;clock in the morning by Mike Chapman and his engineer Peter Coleman leaving for Los Angeles with the tape tracks. Despite Blondie&#x27;s belief that &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; would resonate with a wider audience, Chrysalis Records was not as enthusiastic; label executives told them to start again, only to be dissuaded by Chapman&#x27;s assurance that its singles would prove popular.

== Music and lyrics ==
According to music journalist Robert Christgau, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was a pop rock album in which Blondie achieved their &quot;synthesis of the Dixie Cups and the Electric Prunes&quot;. Its style of &quot;state-of-the-art pop/rock circa 1978&quot;, as AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann described it, showed Blondie deviating from new wave and emerging as &quot;a pure pop band&quot;. Ken Tucker believed the band had eschewed the &quot;brooding artiness&quot; of their previous albums for more hooks and pop-oriented songs. Chapman later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t make a punk album or a New Wave album with Blondie. I made a pop album.&quot; The album&#x27;s eleven pop songs have refined melodics, and its sole disco song, &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, features jittery keyboards, rustling cymbals by drummer Clem Burke, and a circular rhythm. Burke credited Kraftwerk and the soundtrack to the 1977 film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; as influences for the song and said that he was &quot;trying to get that groove that the drummer for the Bee Gees had&quot;.

Lyrically, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; abandoned what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Arion Berger called the &quot;cartoonish postmodernist referencing&quot; of Blondie&#x27;s previous new wave songs in favor of a &quot;romantic fatalism&quot; that was new for the band. &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; deals with the theme of teen loneliness. Music critic Rob Sheffield said that the lyric &quot;dusty frames that still arrive / die in 1955&quot;, in &quot;Fade Away and Radiate&quot;, is the &quot;best lyric in any rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll song, ever, and it&#x27;s still the ultimate statement of a band that always found some pleasure worth exploiting in the flashy and the temporary.&quot;

== Title and packaging ==
&quot;Parallel Lines&quot; took its name from an unused track written by Harry, the lyrics of which were included in the first vinyl edition of the album. The cover sleeve image was photographed by Edo Bertoglio and was chosen by Blondie&#x27;s manager, Peter Leeds, despite being rejected by the band. The photo shows the male members of the band posing in matching dress suits and smiling broadly in contrast to Harry who poses defiantly with her hands on her hips while wearing a white dress and high heels. According to music journalist Tim Peacock, the cover became &quot;iconic – and instantly recognisable&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
The album was released by Chrysalis in September 1978, to international success. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart the week ending September 23, 1978, at No. 186, reflecting retail sales during the survey period ending September 10, 1978. In the United Kingdom, it entered the albums chart at No.13, eventually reaching the no.1 spot in February 1979 after the band had scored hits with the singles &quot;Picture This&quot; (UK #12), &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot; (UK #5), and &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; (UK #1). &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; was released in the UK as a fourth single from the album in May 1979 and also reached no.1, and &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; became the UK&#x27;s biggest selling album of the year. Blondie embarked on a sold-out tour of the UK and appeared at an autograph signing event for Our Price Records on Kensington High Street; according to Peacock, it &quot;descended into Beatlemania-esque chaos when the band were mobbed by thousands of fans&quot;.

&quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was also a commercial success elsewhere in Europe, Australia, and the United States, where the band had struggled to sell their previous records. &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; became their first number-one hit on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with help from a promotional video directed by Stanley Dorfman depicting Blondie in a performance of the song at a fashionable nightclub in New York. The single was &quot;responsible for turning the band into bona fide superstars&quot;, Peacock said.

== Reception and legacy ==

The album was met with universal acclaim from critics. Writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1978, Robert Christgau said although Blondie still could not write a perfect hit single, the record was a consistent improvement over &quot;Plastic Letters&quot;. Years later, he wrote in &quot;Blender&quot; that it was &quot;a perfect album in 1978&quot; and remained so with &quot;every song memorable, distinct, well-shaped and over before you get antsy. Never again did singer Deborah Harry, mastermind Chris Stein and their able four-man cohort nail the band&#x27;s signature paradoxes with such unfailing flair: lowbrow class, tender sarcasm, pop rock.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Rockwell named &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; the eighth best album of 1978. Daryl Easlea from BBC Music, who felt the record combined power pop and new wave styles, credited Mike Chapman&#x27;s production and flair for pop songwriting for helping make &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; an extremely popular album in the United Kingdom, where it was a number-one hit and charted for 106 weeks during the late 1970s. &quot;Q&quot; magazine called the album &quot;a crossover smash with sparkling guitar sounds, terrific hooks and middle-eights more memorable than some groups&#x27; choruses.&quot;

In a retrospective appraisal of 1970s post-punk albums, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sasha Frere-Jones said &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; may have been &quot;the perfect pop-rock record&quot; and Blondie&#x27;s best album. Christian John Wikane from &quot;PopMatters&quot; later called it &quot;a creative and commercial masterpiece by Blondie ... indisputably one of the great, classic albums of the rock and roll era.&quot; In the opinion of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Scott Plagenhoef, the album popularized &quot;the look and sound of 1980s new wave&quot; with classic songs that showcased the depth and complexity of Harry&#x27;s sexuality and singing. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was also impressed by her singing, which he felt varied from &quot;purring like a kitten and then building to a mean growl&quot;, and cited &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; as the album&#x27;s best track because of her &quot;honey-dipped vocal&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was voted number 57 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Three years later, it was ranked at number 140 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and moved slightly down to number 146 in the 2020 revision; an accompanying essay said the album was &quot;where punk and New Wave broke through to a mass U.S. audience&quot;. It has also been placed at number 18 and 45 on &quot;NME&quot;″s 100 Best Albums of All Time (2003) and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2013) lists, respectively; number 7 on &quot;Blender&quot;″s 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time; number 94 on Channel 4&#x27;s 2005 list of the 100 greatest albums of all time; and number 76 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the best albums from the 1970s.

===Accolades===
In 2024, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Reissues ==
The album was reissued and remastered in 2001 along with Blondie&#x27;s back catalog, and featured four bonus tracks: a 1978 version of &quot;Once I Had a Love&quot;, a live cover of T. Rex&#x27;s song &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On)&quot;, and two live tracks taken from the &quot;Picture This Live&quot; live album.

On June 24, 2008, an expanded 30th Anniversary Edition of the album was released, which featured new artwork and bonus tracks along with bonus DVD. The liner notes once again featured lyrics to the unfinished &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; song. The &quot;Parallel Lines 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; included the 7″ single version of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, the French version of &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; and some remixes, plus a DVD with albums, promo videos and TV performance.

The band also launched a world tour of the same name in 2008 to promote the re-release and celebrate the event.

===Notes===
* The album version of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; was replaced with the disco version (5:50 long) on pressings of the album from March 1979 onward. The original length version of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; appeared on the original US CD release in 1985 (Chrysalis VK 41192, later F2 21192) although the CD artwork proclaimed it was the disco version. Later editions of the Capitol disc had the mistake removed from the inlay but it remained on the disc until its deletion. The 1994 DCC Compact Classics Gold CD release (Capitol Special Markets USA GSZ 1062) features the original version with the disco version as a bonus track.
* A promotional CD of the album was given away free with the British newspaper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; on December 5, 2010, including the bonus tracks &quot;What I Heard&quot; and &quot;Girlie Girlie&quot; from the band&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Panic of Girls&quot;.

<doc id="199804" wikidata="Q4314270" url="?curid=199804" title="Science and technology in the United States">
<text>Science and technology in the United States has a long history, producing many important figures and developments in the field. The United States of America came into being around the Age of Enlightenment (1685 to 1815), an era in Western philosophy in which writers and thinkers, rejecting the perceived superstitions of the past, instead chose to emphasize the intellectual, scientific and cultural life, centered upon the 18th century, in which reason was advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority. Enlightenment philosophers envisioned a &quot;republic of science,&quot; where ideas would be exchanged freely and useful knowledge would improve the lot of all citizens.

The United States Constitution itself reflects the desire to encourage scientific creativity. It gives the United States Congress the power &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&quot; This clause formed the basis for the U.S. patent and copyright systems, whereby creators of original art and technology would get a government granted monopoly, which after a limited period would become free to all citizens, thereby enriching the public domain.

==Early American science==
 
In the early decades of its history, the United States was relatively isolated from Europe and also rather poor. At this stage, America&#x27;s scientific infrastructure was still quite primitive compared to the long-established societies, institutes, and universities in Europe.

Eight of America&#x27;s founding fathers were scientists of some repute. Benjamin Franklin conducted a series of experiments that deepened human understanding of electricity. Among other things, he proved what had been suspected but never before shown: that lightning is a form of electricity. Franklin also invented such conveniences as bifocal eyeglasses. Franklin also conceived the mid-room furnace, the &quot;Franklin Stove&quot;. However, Franklin&#x27;s design was flawed, in that his furnace vented the smoke from its base: because the furnace lacked a chimney to &quot;draw&quot; fresh air up through the central chamber, the fire would soon go out. It took David R. Rittenhouse, another hero of early Philadelphia, to improve Franklin&#x27;s design by adding an L-shaped exhaust pipe that drew air through the furnace and vented its smoke up and along the ceiling, then into an intramural chimney and out of the house.

Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), was among the most influential leaders in early America; during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83), Jefferson served in the Virginia legislature, the Continental Congress, was governor of Virginia, later serving as U.S. minister to France, U.S. secretary of state, vice president under John Adams (1735–1826), writer of the Declaration of Independence and the third U.S. president. During Jefferson&#x27;s two terms in office (1801–1809), the U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory and Lewis and Clark explored the vast new acquisition. 

After leaving office, he retired to his Virginia plantation, Monticello, and helped spearhead the University of Virginia. Jefferson was also a student of agriculture who introduced various types of rice, olive trees, and grasses into the New World. He stressed the scientific aspect of the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804–06), which explored the Pacific Northwest, and detailed, systematic information on the region&#x27;s plants and animals was one of that expedition&#x27;s legacies.

Like Franklin and Jefferson, most American scientists of the late 18th century were involved in the struggle to win American independence and forge a new nation. These scientists included the astronomer David Rittenhouse, the medical scientist Benjamin Rush, and the natural historian Charles Willson Peale.

During the American Revolution, Rittenhouse helped design the defenses of Philadelphia and built telescopes and navigation instruments for the United States&#x27; military services. After the war, Rittenhouse designed road and canal systems for the state of Pennsylvania. He later returned to studying the stars and planets and gained a worldwide reputation in that field.

As United States Surgeon General, Benjamin Rush saved countless lives of soldiers during the American Revolutionary War by promoting hygiene and public health practices. By introducing new medical treatments, he made the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia an example of medical enlightenment, and after his military service, Rush established the first free clinic in the United States.

Charles Willson Peale is best remembered as an artist, but he also was a natural historian, inventor, educator, and politician. He created the first major museum in the United States, the Peale Museum in Philadelphia, which housed the young nation&#x27;s only collection of North American natural history specimens. Peale excavated the bones of an ancient mastodon near West Point, New York; he spent three months assembling the skeleton, and then displayed it in his museum. The Peale Museum started an American tradition of making the knowledge of science interesting and available to the general public.

==Science immigration==
American political leaders&#x27; enthusiasm for knowledge also helped ensure a warm welcome for scientists from other countries. A notable early immigrant was the British chemist Joseph Priestley, who was driven from his homeland because of his dissenting politics. Priestley, who migrated to the United States in 1794, was the first of thousands of talented scientists drawn to the United States in search of a free, creative environment.
Other scientists had come to the United States to take part in the nation&#x27;s rapid growth. Alexander Graham Bell, who arrived from Scotland by way of Canada in 1872, developed and patented the telephone and related inventions. Charles Proteus Steinmetz, who came from Germany in 1889, developed new alternating-current electrical systems at General Electric Company, and Vladimir Zworykin, an immigrant who arrived from Russia to the States in 1919, bringing his knowledge of x-rays and cathode ray tubes and later won his first patent on a television system he invented. The Serbian Nikola Tesla went to the United States in 1884, and would later adapt the principle of the rotating magnetic field in the development of an alternating current induction motor and polyphase system for the generation, transmission, distribution and use of electrical power.

Into the early 1900s, Europe remained the center of science research, notably in England and Germany. From the 1920s onwards, the tensions heralding the onset of World War II spurred sporadic but steady scientific emigration, or &quot;brain drain&quot;, in Europe. Many of these emigrants were Jewish scientists, fearing the repercussions of anti-Semitism, especially in Germany and Italy, and sought sanctuary in the United States. One of the first to do so was Albert Einstein in 1933. At his urging, and often with his support, a good percentage of Germany&#x27;s theoretical physics community, previously the best in the world, left for the United States. Enrico Fermi, came from Italy in 1938, and led the work that produced the world&#x27;s first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Many other scientists of note moved to the U.S. during this same emigration wave, including Niels Bohr, Victor Weisskopf, Otto Stern, and Eugene Wigner.

Several scientific and technological breakthroughs during the Atomic Age were the handiwork of such immigrants, who recognized the potential threats and uses of new technology. For instance, it was German professor Einstein and his Hungarian colleague, Leó Szilárd, who took the initiative and convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt to pursue the pivotal Manhattan Project. Many physicists instrumental to the project were also European immigrants, such as the Hungarian Edward Teller, &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb,&quot; and German Nobel laureate Hans Bethe. Their scientific contributions, combined with Allied resources and facilities helped establish the United States during World War II as an unrivaled scientific juggernaut. In fact, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Operation Alsos and its components, while not designed to recruit European scientists, successfully collected and evaluated Axis military scientific research at the end of the war, especially that of the German nuclear energy project, only to conclude that it was years behind its American counterpart.
When World War II ended, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were all intent on capitalizing on Nazi research and competed for the spoils of war. While President Harry S. Truman refused to provide sanctuary to ideologically committed members of the Nazi party, the Office of Strategic Services introduced Operation Paperclip, conducted under the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency. This program covertly offered otherwise ineligible intellectuals and technicians whitewashed dossiers, biographies, and employment. Ex-Nazi scientists overseen by the JIOA had been employed by the U.S. military since the defeat of the Nazi regime in Project Overcast, but Operation Paperclip ventured to systematically allocate German nuclear and aerospace research and scientists to military and civilian posts, beginning in August 1945. Until the program&#x27;s termination in 1990, Operation Paperclip was said to have recruited over 1,600 such employees in a variety of professions and disciplines.
In the first phases of Operation Paperclip, these recruits mostly included aerospace engineers from the German V-2 combat rocket program, experts in aerospace medicine and synthetic fuels. Perhaps the most influential of these was Wernher von Braun, who had worked on the Aggregate rockets (the first rocket program to reach outer space), and chief designer of the V-2 rocket program. Upon reaching American soil, von Braun first worked on the United States Air Force ICBM program before his team was reassigned to NASA. Often credited as “The Father of Rocket Science,” his work on the Redstone rocket and the successful deployment of the Explorer 1 satellite as a response to Sputnik 1 marked the beginning of the American Space program, and therefore, of the Space Race. Von Braun&#x27;s subsequent development of the Saturn V rocket for NASA in the mid-to late sixties resulted in the first crewed landing on the Moon, the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.
In the post-war era, the U.S. was left in a position of unchallenged scientific leadership, being one of the few industrial countries not ravaged by war. Additionally, science and technology were seen to have greatly added to the Allied war victory, and were seen as absolutely crucial in the Cold War era. This enthusiasm simultaneously rejuvenated American industry, and celebrated Yankee ingenuity, instilling a zealous nationwide investment in &quot;Big Science&quot; and state-of-the-art government funded facilities and programs. This state patronage presented appealing careers to the intelligentsia, and further consolidated the scientific preeminence of the United States. As a result, the U.S. government became, for the first time, the largest single supporter of basic and applied scientific research. By the mid-1950s, the research facilities in the U.S. were second to none, and scientists were drawn to the U.S. for this reason alone. The changing pattern can be seen in the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics and chemistry. During the first half-century of Nobel Prizes – from 1901 to 1950 – American winners were in a distinct minority in the science categories. Since 1950, Americans have won approximately half of the Nobel Prizes awarded in the sciences. See the List of Nobel laureates by country.

The American Brain Gain continued throughout the Cold War, as tensions steadily escalated in the Eastern Bloc, resulting in a steady trickle of defectors, refugees and emigrants. The partition of Germany, for one, precipitated over three and a half million East Germans – the Republikflüchtling – to cross into West Berlin by 1961. Most of them were young, well-qualified, educated professionals or skilled workers – the intelligentsia – exacerbating human capital flight in the GDR to the benefit of Western countries, including the United States.

Technology inflows from abroad have played an important role in the development of the United States, especially in the late nineteenth century. A favorable US security environment that allowed relatively low defense spending. High trade barriers encouraged the development of domestic manufacturing industries and the inflow of foreign technologies.
==American applied science==

During the 19th century Britain, France, and Germany were at the forefront of new ideas in science and mathematics. But if the United States lagged behind in the formulation of theory, it excelled in using theory to solve problems: applied science. This tradition had been born of necessity. Because Americans lived so far from the well-springs of Western science and manufacturing, they often had to figure out their own ways of doing things. When Americans combined theoretical knowledge with &quot;Yankee ingenuity&quot;, the result was a flow of important inventions. The great American inventors include Robert Fulton (the steamboat); Samuel Morse (the telegraph); Eli Whitney (the cotton gin); Cyrus McCormick (the reaper); and Thomas Alva Edison, with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name. His research laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.
Edison was not always the first to devise a scientific application, but he was frequently the one to bring an idea to a practical finish. For example, the British engineer Joseph Swan built an incandescent electric lamp in 1860, almost 20 years before Edison. But Edison&#x27;s light bulbs lasted much longer than Swan&#x27;s, and they could be turned on and off individually, while Swan&#x27;s bulbs could be used only in a system where several lights were turned on or off at the same time. Edison followed up his improvement of the light bulb with the development of electrical generating systems. Within 30 years, his inventions had introduced electric lighting into millions of homes.
Another landmark application of scientific ideas to practical uses was the innovation of the brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright. In the 1890s, they became fascinated with accounts of German glider experiments and began their own investigation into the principles of flight. Combining scientific knowledge and mechanical skills, the Wright brothers built and flew several gliders. Then, on December 17, 1903, they successfully flew the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.
The automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds (Oldsmobile) and Henry Ford (Ford Motor Company) popularized the assembly line in the early 20th century. The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.

An American invention that was barely noticed in 1947 went on to usher in the Information Age. In that year John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter Brattain of Bell Laboratories drew upon highly sophisticated principles of quantum physics to invent the transistor, a key component in almost all modern electronics, which led to the development of microprocessors, software, personal computers, and the Internet. As a result, book-sized computers of today can outperform room-sized computers of the 1960s, and there has been a revolution in the way people live – in how they work, study, conduct business, and engage in research.
World War II had a profound impact on the development of science and technology in the United States. Before World War II, the federal government basically did not assume responsibility for supporting scientific development. During the war, the federal government and science formed a new cooperative relationship. After the war, the federal government became the main role in supporting science and technology. And in the following years, the federal government supported the establishment of a national modern science and technology system, making America a world leader in science and technology.

Part of America&#x27;s past and current preeminence in applied science has been due to its vast research and development budget, which at $401.6bn in 2009 was more than double that of China&#x27;s $154.1bn and over 25% greater than the European Union&#x27;s $297.9bn.

==The Atomic Age and &quot;Big Science&quot;==

One of the most spectacular – and controversial – accomplishments of US technology has been the harnessing of nuclear energy. The concepts that led to the splitting of the atom were developed by the scientists of many countries, but the conversion of these ideas into the reality of nuclear fission was accomplished in the United States in the early 1940s, both by many Americans but also aided tremendously by the influx of European intellectuals fleeing the growing conflagration sparked by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in Europe.
During these crucial years, a number of the most prominent European scientists, especially physicists, immigrated to the United States, where they would do much of their most important work; these included Hans Bethe, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller, Felix Bloch, Emilio Segrè, John von Neumann, and Eugene Wigner, among many, many others. American academics worked hard to find positions at laboratories and universities for their European colleagues.


After German physicists split a uranium nucleus in 1938, a number of scientists concluded that a nuclear chain reaction was feasible and possible. The Einstein–Szilárd letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warned that this breakthrough would permit the construction of &quot;extremely powerful bombs.&quot; This warning inspired an executive order towards the investigation of using uranium as a weapon, which later was superseded during World War II by the Manhattan Project the full Allied effort to be the first to build an atomic bomb. The project bore fruit when the first such bomb was exploded in New Mexico on July 16, 1945.

The development of the bomb and its use against Japan in August 1945 initiated the Atomic Age, a time of anxiety over weapons of mass destruction that has lasted through the Cold War and down to the anti-proliferation efforts of today. Even so, the Atomic Age has also been characterized by peaceful uses of nuclear power, as in the advances in nuclear power and nuclear medicine.

Along with the production of the atomic bomb, World War II also began an era known as &quot;Big Science&quot; with increased government patronage of scientific research. The advantage of a scientifically and technologically sophisticated country became all too apparent during wartime, and in the ideological Cold War to follow the importance of scientific strength in even peacetime applications became too much for the government to any more leave to philanthropy and private industry alone. This increased expenditure on scientific research and education propelled the United States to the forefront of the international scientific community—an amazing feat for a country which only a few decades before still had to send its most promising students to Europe for extensive scientific education.

The first US commercial nuclear power plant started operation in Illinois in 1956. At the time, the future for nuclear energy in the United States looked bright. But opponents criticized the safety of power plants and questioned whether safe disposal of nuclear waste could be assured. A 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania turned many Americans against nuclear power. The cost of building a nuclear power plant escalated, and other, more economical sources of power began to look more appealing. During the 1970s and 1980s, plans for several nuclear plants were cancelled, and the future of nuclear power remains in a state of uncertainty in the United States.

Meanwhile, American scientists have been experimenting with other renewable energy, including solar power. Although solar power generation is still not economical in much of the United States, recent developments might make it more affordable.
==Telecom and technology==

For the past 80 years, the United States has been integral in fundamental advances in telecommunications and technology. For example, AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Laboratories spearheaded the American technological revolution with a series of inventions including the first practical light emitted diode (LED), the transistor, the C programming language, and the Unix computer operating system. SRI International and Xerox PARC in Silicon Valley helped give birth to the personal computer industry, while ARPA and NASA funded the development of the ARPANET and the Internet.
Herman Hollerith was just a twenty-year-old engineer when he realized the need for a better way for the U.S. government to conduct their Census and then proceeded to develop electromechanical tabulators for that purpose. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, and the use of Hollerith&#x27;s electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census. That kick started The Tabulating Machine Company. By the 1960s, the company name had been changed to International Business Machines, and IBM dominated business computing. IBM revolutionized the industry by bringing out the first comprehensive family of computers (the System/360). It caused many of their competitors to either merge or go bankrupt, leaving IBM in an even more dominant position. IBM is known for its many inventions like the floppy disk, introduced in 1971, supermarket checkout products, and introduced in 1973, the IBM 3614 Consumer Transaction Facility, an early form of today&#x27;s Automatic Teller Machines.

In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion; enough to provide one for every person on Earth.

==The Space Age==


During the Cold War, competition for superior missile capability led to the Space Race between the United States and Soviet Union. American Robert Goddard was one of the first scientists to experiment with rocket propulsion systems. In his small laboratory in Worcester, Massachusetts, Goddard worked with liquid oxygen and gasoline to propel rockets into the atmosphere, and in 1926 successfully fired the world&#x27;s first liquid-fuel rocket which reached a height of 12.5 meters. Over the next 10 years, Goddard&#x27;s rockets achieved modest altitudes of nearly two kilometers, and interest in rocketry increased in the United States, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union.

As Allied forces advanced during World War II, both the American and Russian forces searched for top German scientists who could be claimed as spoils for their country. The American effort to bring home German rocket technology in Operation Paperclip, and the bringing of German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun (who would later sit at the head of a NASA center) stand out in particular.

Expendable rockets provided the means for launching artificial satellites, as well as crewed spacecraft. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the United States followed with Explorer 1 in 1958. The first human spaceflights were made in early 1961, first by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and then by American astronaut Alan Shepard.

From those first tentative steps, to the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon and the partially reusable Space Shuttle, the American space program brought forth a breathtaking display of applied science. Communications satellites transmit computer data, telephone calls, and radio and television broadcasts. Weather satellites furnish the data necessary to provide early warnings of severe storms. The United States also developed the Global Positioning System (GPS), the world&#x27;s pre-eminent satellite navigation system. Interplanetary probes and space telescopes began a golden age of planetary science and advanced a wide variety of astronomical work.

On April 20, 2021, MOXIE produced oxygen from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide using solid oxide electrolysis, the first experimental extraction of a natural resource from another planet for human use. In 2024, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.

==Medicine and health care==


As in physics and chemistry, Americans have dominated the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine since World War II. The private sector has been the focal point for biomedical research in the United States, and has played a key role in this achievement.

Maurice Hilleman, a well-known American virologist, is remembered for having developed more than 40 Vaccines, thus creating an important record in the field of medicine. He was responsible for his contribution to the creation of vaccines against the Asian flu of 1957, which broke out in Guizhou, and the Hong Kong flu of 1968, contributing to the preparation and distribution of the vaccine doses that saved the world. He was responsible for the creation of vaccines against measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the US Army for his important work..

As of 2000, for-profit industry funded 57%, non-profit private organizations such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute funded 7%, and the tax-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded 36% of medical research in the United States. However, by 2003, the NIH funded only 28% of medical research funding; funding by private industry increased 102% from 1994 to 2003.

The NIH consists of 24 separate institutes in Bethesda, Maryland. The goal of NIH research is knowledge that helps prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat disease and disability. At any given time, grants from the NIH support the research of about 35,000 principal investigators. Five Nobel Prize-winners have made their prize-winning discoveries in NIH laboratories.

NIH research has helped make possible numerous medical achievements. For example, mortality from heart disease, the number-one killer in the United States, dropped 41 percent between 1971 and 1991. The death rate for strokes decreased by 59 percent during the same period. Between 1991 and 1995, the cancer death rate fell by nearly 3 percent, the first sustained decline since national record-keeping began in the 1930s. And today more than 70 percent of children who get cancer are cured.

With the help of the NIH, molecular genetics and genomics research have revolutionized biomedical science. In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers performed the first trial of gene therapy in humans and are now able to locate, identify, and describe the function of many genes in the human genome.

Research conducted by universities, hospitals, and corporations also contributes to improvement in diagnosis and treatment of disease. NIH funded the basic research on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), for example, but many of the drugs used to treat the disease have emerged from the laboratories of the American pharmaceutical industry; those drugs are being tested in research centers across the country.

<text>San Luis Potosí, commonly referred to as San Luis, or by its initials SLP (Otomi: ), is the capital and the most populous city of the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí. It is the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of San Luis Potosí. The city lies at an elevation of . It has an estimated population of 824,229 in the city proper and a population of approximately 1,221,526 in its metropolitan area, formed with the neighbour city of Soledad de Graciano Sánchez and other surrounding municipalities, which makes the metropolitan area of Greater San Luis Potosí the eleventh largest in Mexico.

The city is in the west-central part of the state of San Luis Potosí, at 22.16°N, 100.98°W. The municipality has an area of . It is part of the macroregion of Bajío.

The city is named after Louis IX of France (also known in Mexico as &quot;San Luis Rey de Francia&quot;, Saint Louis, King of France), who is the city&#x27;s patron saint. &quot;Potosí&quot; was added in reference to the fabulously rich mines of Potosí, Bolivia, discovered some forty years before the city was founded, as the exploitation of silver and gold mines in Cerro de San Pedro, near San Luis, was the main reason for the founding of the city in 1592.

Currently the city is one of the main industrial centers in central Mexico with a prolific manufacturing industry. A number of foreign industries have chosen to invest in San Luis Potosí in the last decades thanks to its strategic location for trade, as the city is located halfway between Mexico City and the United States border, as well as in the middle of the triangle formed by the three largest cities in Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.

Besides its industrial economy, recently the city has been promoted as a touristic destination in central Mexico by state and federal programs. San Luis Potosí&#x27;s historic center displays a remarkable mixture of different artistic styles in many buildings and is a major example of colonial architecture in Mexico. In 2010, the historic center was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site within Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.

==History==

===Pre-colonial period===
In pre-Hispanic times, the territory now occupied by the state of San Luis Potosí included two cultural areas: Mesoamerica and Aridoamerica. While the southern and eastern regions of the state were occupied by Otomi and Huastec kingdoms, its northern and central-west regions, where the city of San Luis now is located, were inhabited by Chichimeca. &quot;Chichimeca&quot; is a generic term given to various nomadic ethnicities which inhabited the northern fringes of the Aztec Empire, which is now northern Mexico. As they were nomadic peoples, they did not build large cities nor have permanent settlements like most Mesoamerican civilizations. They are described by historians as very warlike peoples, living in continual wars among themselves. These tribes spoke different languages but their customs were similar.

After the arrival of Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; and their indigenous allies into the territory now formed by the Mexican nation, it still took them about a century to colonize the northern territories in Aridoamerica. When the settlers founded the first settlements in the region in late 16th century, they had to struggle against constant attacks from Guachichil tribes. Extremely belligerent, these tribes attacked traders who traveled to Zacatecas in newly created routes. Conquistadores and religious missionaries called the place where San Luis now is located &quot;El Gran Tunal&quot; (&quot;Grand Place of Tuna fruit&quot;). Finally, in 1589, peace between Chichimeca peoples and Spanish settlers was reached thanks to efforts made by Miguel Caldera and Brother Diego de la Magdalena, which marked the end of the Chichimeca War.

===Colonial period===
A Franciscan mission was established in the zone in 1583, nine years before the city&#x27;s founding. In early 1592 the mines of Cerro de San Pedro were discovered. The lack of water in Cerro de San Pedro made impossible a new settlement in that specific area, as well as the proper exploitation of the minerals. A short distance away there was a valley where water was abundant. This originated the creation of a new township to facilitate the labors of mining extraction. The legal foundation of the town of San Luis Potosí was made in November 3, 1592, according to a charter commission raised by Viceroy Luís de Velasco and given to Miguel Caldera (considered the historic founder of the city) and Juan de Oñate.

===Independence===
For a time in 1863, during the French invasion of Mexico, San Luis Potosí served as the capital of the republican government, under President Benito Juárez.

The Plan of San Luis Potosí, issued November 20, 1910, was the opening shot of Mexico&#x27;s revolution against the dictator Porfirio Díaz. The 1910 presidential election was stolen when Díaz had his opponent Francisco I. Madero arrested and imprisoned. Madero fled and issued the Plan of San Luis Potosí, declaring the election void and calling upon Mexicans to take up arms against the government.

Today, the downtown is one of plazas and colonial architecture. The &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot; is the site of a cathedral and governor&#x27;s palace (1770). The nearby &quot;Templo de Nuestra Señora del Carmen,&quot; with its colorful tiled domes and famous altars, is considered among Mexico&#x27;s finest churches. In addition, San Luis is home to the bullring Plaza de Toros Fermin Rivera.

Outside the center, a modern industrial city has begun to grow.

The Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí (UASLP) is in the city. Based on a Jesuit College founded in 1624, the Instituto Científico y Literario was raised to the category of a university in 1923, and is recognized as one of Latin America&#x27;s best universities.

===Today===
With a population of approximately one million inhabitants, it is now the twelfth largest metropolitan area in Mexico. The city is a major commercial and industrial center. It lies in an economically advantageous area at the heart of the &quot;triangle&quot; formed by the three largest cities in Mexico: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

In recent years, the city has attracted the attention of European and American investors; its political, social, and economic stability has convinced large multinational companies to assume a presence there
and to buy land, on the outskirts of the city.

Recently, according to a survey conducted by the magazine &quot;The Investor&quot;, San Luis Potosí and its metropolitan area was the third-best place to live in Mexico.


== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
San Luis Potosí features a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) under the Köppen climate classification. Its high altitude means that the city experiences only a handful of hot days each year. While the climate exhibits noticeably cooler (January and February) and warmer periods (April and May) of the year, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year. San Luis Potosí receives, on average, of precipitation annually, mostly seen from May through October. Snowfall is a rare occurrence in the city downtown, even though it is not uncommon in the city outskirts and in the highest parts of the greater San Luis Potosí area to get reports of frost and some snow during the winter.

The last recorded snowfalls occurred in January 1967, December 13, 1997, December 2011, March 2016, and December 8, 2017.

==Local cuisine==
Potosinos (as residents of the city are referred to) are proud of their bright orange &quot;enchiladas potosinas&quot;, often served with refried beans and guacamole.

The nearby town of Santa María del Río provides the state with its sparkling mineral water, &quot;Agua de Lourdes.&quot; The water fills both store shelves and the cocktails of Potosinos, who claim the water can cure a hangover.

==Important buildings==

Besides having hundreds of classically designed buildings, the city is also home to some of the most modern and interesting buildings in Mexico.



In recent years the city has faced a boom in the construction of buildings and museums. Among the most prominent are the Laberinto Museum of Science and Arts, which was an investment of more than $200 million pesos, in 9000 m2 of land in the Tangamanga I Park. The project was designed by architect Ricardo Legorreta and promoted by the governor of San Luis Potosí, Marcelo de los Santos Fraga. It is a museum of aesthetic proportions similar to that of the Papalote Museum of Children in Mexico City, with the addition that the materials used in its construction, especially the quarry, make it a real Potosino manufacturing building. The floor of the museum occupies a total of 6.5 ha, which have gardens with species endemic to the region and a central source. Its interior is divided into a total of six rooms arranged in galleries. Their proportions will allow visitors to make an interactive tour that will switch themes of the art museum with samples of science and technology.

Currently, the two tallest buildings in the city are the EME Building and the Muniz Werger Building. The EME Building was built in 1988 and measures 64 m to the top floor, with the spiral 75 m, with the antenna 98 meters. It has 17 floors, with 10 levels of parking at the street for a capacity of 1500 cars, and it houses mixed offices. The Muniz Werger Building, which measures 58 m for the top floor, 65 m with the spiral, and 80 m with the antenna, has 15 storeys and two elevators. Its construction began in 1991 and finished in 1993, and it is considered the most modern building in the city.

There are currently two buildings under construction and five buildings in the project. Corporate Tangamanga, which measured 41 m, will have 14 floors; its construction began in 2005 and will end in 2008. This building houses offices and mixed Star Medical Tower, 40 m and will have 8 floors.

==Commerce and transportation==
The principal commercial centers of the city are Plaza Tangamanga, Plaza el Dorado, Plaza Sendero, Plaza Citadella and Plaza San Luis.

In the city, various banks also operate, such as, BBVA Bancomer, Banamex, HSBC, Banorte, Santander-Serfin, Actinver, Scotiabank-Inverlat, and BanRegio.

The city&#x27;s transportation consists of a public system, based on urban buses that move throughout the metropolitan area.
Besides, the city contains one of the highest concentrations of taxis.

Ponciano Arriaga International Airport is the city&#x27;s main airway point. It is around from the city&#x27;s downtown and it is the state&#x27;s most important airway terminal.

<text>Child Is Father to the Man is the debut album by Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, released in February 1968. It reached number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart in the United States.

==History==
As a teenager, Al Kooper went to a concert for jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson and this experience inspired Kooper to start a rock band with a horn section. Originally in a band called The Blues Project, Kooper left after band leader Danny Kalb rejected his idea of bringing in a horn section. He then left for the West Coast and found bassist Jim Fielder who believed in the songs that Kooper wrote. Though Kooper had big ideas for his next project, he didn&#x27;t have the money to bring his ideas to fruition. He then threw a benefit for himself and invited several musicians he previously worked with, such as Judy Collins, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, David Blue, Eric Andersen and Richie Havens. Although the performances sold out, the owner of the Cafe Au Go Go added such numerous expenses to the gross receipts that the net receipts after the performance were not enough to get a plane ticket or a taxi to the airport.

He later called Fielder and convinced him to come to New York. He also asked Bobby Colomby, Anderson and Steve Katz, who was his bandmate in his former band The Blues Project. Colomby called Fred Lipsius and the band placed an ad in The Village Voice for more horn players. Within a month, the band assembled an eight piece which also contained Randy Brecker, Jerry Weiss and Dick Halligan. Kooper then asked John Simon to produce them, after being fresh off from producing Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s album &quot;Bookends&quot;. The album was recorded in two weeks in December 1967. Simon asked all of the members to record their material in one take so he could study songs and make useful suggestions to the arrangements. After a brief promotional tour, Colomby and Katz ousted Kooper from the band, which led to &quot;Child is Father to the Man&quot; being the only BS&amp;T album on which Kooper ever appeared. The band would later have two number one albums and several Grammys, although Kooper felt they were playing music that he didn&#x27;t agree with. Despite being asked to leave Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Kooper felt everything worked out well for him and the band.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Child Is Father to the Man&quot; peaked at #47 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart. It failed to generate any Top 40 singles, although &quot;I Love You More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit Her&quot; found some play on progressive rock radio.

In 2012, the album was ranked number 266 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

The title is a quotation from a by Gerard Manley Hopkins, slightly misquoting a poem by William Wordsworth called &quot;My Heart Leaps Up&quot;.

CBS Records released The Rock Machine Turns You On, the first budget sampler LP, in the UK in 1968. The song &quot;My Days Are Numbered&quot; was included as Side Two track one on the album and introduced BST to a much wider audience.

The album was re-released in the UK in 1973, entitled &quot;The First Album&quot; on Embassy Records, a subsidiary of Columbia Records (catalogue number EMB 31028) with an identical track listing and the same picture on the front of the sleeve. The rear had new sleeve notes written by English DJ, Noel Edmonds.

==Reception==
Writing for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote of the album:&quot;Al Kooper&#x27;s finest work, an album on which he moves the folk-blues-rock amalgamation of the Blues Project into even wider pastures, taking in classical and jazz elements (including strings and horns), all without losing the pop essence that makes the hybrid work. This is one of the great albums of the eclectic post-Sgt. Pepper era of the late &#x27;60s, a time when you could borrow styles from Greenwich Village contemporary folk to San Francisco acid rock and mix them into what seemed to have the potential to become a new American musical form... This is the sound of a group of virtuosos enjoying itself in the newly open possibilities of pop music. Maybe it couldn&#x27;t have lasted; anyway, it didn&#x27;t.&quot;

The song &quot;I Love You More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot; found new life from 2002 to 2004, as Late Show with David Letterman band leader Paul Shaffer performed it regularly during the show&#x27;s final full commercial break. The performances became more and more animated over time, including celebrity guests such as Ted Koppel, Nathan Lane, and others draping a cape over a kneeling Shaffer and attempting to lead him off stage before he stormed back to continue the song (a tribute to a similar gimmick employed by James Brown).

<text>Vincebus Eruptum (; pseudo-Latin) is the debut album of American rock band Blue Cheer. Released on January 16, 1968, the album features a heavy-thunderous blues sound, which would later be known as heavy metal.

A commercial and critical success, &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and spawned the number 14 hit cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;. Being an example of hard rock, it is also lauded as one of the first heavy metal albums. Spin magazine placed it at number 22 on their list of the 40 greatest metal albums.

==Background and history==
Blue Cheer&#x27;s debut album was recorded in 1967 at Amigo Studios in North Hollywood, California. In an interview, frontman Dickie Peterson explained that &quot;Some songs I wrote have taken 20 years to really complete. And there are other songs like &#x27;Doctor Please&#x27; or &#x27;Out of Focus&#x27; that I wrote in ten minutes.&quot;

On &quot;Doctor Please&quot; in particular, Peterson explained that &quot;when I wrote the song (in 1967), it was a glorification of drugs. I was going through a lot of &#x27;Should I take this drug or should I not take this drug? Blah, blah, blah.&#x27; There was a lot of soul searching at the time when I wrote that song, and I actually decided to take it. That’s what that song was about and that’s what I sang it about, sort of a drug anthem for me.&quot; On the band&#x27;s cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, Peterson noted that &quot;We kept changing it around and adding/taking bits away. It also has to do with large doses of LSD.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Blue Cheer&#x27;s debut album has widely been held in high regard by critics. Writing for music website AllMusic, Mark Deming described &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; as &quot;a glorious celebration of rock &amp; roll primitivism run through enough Marshall amps to deafen an army&quot;, praising the band&#x27;s &quot;sound and fury&quot; as one of the founding movements of heavy metal. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Alexander Linhardt gave the album nine out of ten points, noting that the album was less structured than its successor, &quot;Outsideinside&quot;. It has been described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as &quot;the epitome of psychedelic rock&quot;, while VH1 called it an &quot;acid rock masterwork&quot;. Martin Popoff was less enthusiastic in his review and called the music &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;equating closer to acid-washed loud and slurring renditions of &#x27;60s rock&quot; than heavy metal, judging the album &quot;a howling mess.&quot;

Online music service Rhapsody included &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; in its list of the &quot;10 Essential Proto-Metal Albums&quot;, suggesting that the band &quot;not only inspired the term &#x27;power trio,&#x27; they practically invented heavy metal.&quot; In 1998, &quot;The Wire&quot; included &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; in their list of &quot;100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)&quot;, calling it a &quot;seminal&quot; album that &quot;snarled rabidly in the face of hippy innocence and soon became a Hells Angels party stomper.&quot; They also note the strong influence the album had on 1990s Japanese noise trios such as High Rise and Musica Transonic.

<text>Modern Life Is Rubbish is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Blur, released in May 1993. Although their debut album &quot;Leisure&quot; (1991) had been commercially successful, Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur&#x27;s status in the UK.

Under threat of being dropped by Food Records, for their next album Blur underwent an image makeover championed by frontman Damon Albarn. The band incorporated influences from traditional British guitar-pop groups such as the Kinks and the Small Faces, and the resulting sound was melodic and lushly produced, featuring brass, woodwind and backing vocalists. Albarn&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; use &quot;poignant humour and Ray Davies characterisation to investigate the dreams, traditions and prejudices of suburban England&quot;, according to writer David Cavanagh.

&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; was a moderate chart success in the UK; the album peaked at number 15, while the singles taken from the album charted in the Top 30. Applauded by the music press, the album&#x27;s Anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated the group&#x27;s fortunes after their post-&quot;Leisure&quot; slump. &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; is regarded as one of the defining releases of the Britpop scene, and its chart-topping follow-ups—&quot;Parklife&quot; and &quot;The Great Escape&quot;—saw Blur emerge as one of Britain&#x27;s leading pop acts.

==Background==
Blur&#x27;s baggy-inspired debut album &quot;Leisure&quot; (1991) was a UK Top 10-charting record that, according to the &quot;NME&quot;, made the band the &quot;acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam&quot;. However, as the baggy scene soon began to fade, Blur were—according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;—&quot;[s]wiftly exposed as bogus trend-hoppers, [and] they duly caught the wrath of the Madchester backlash&quot;. Further, following their fall from public favour, the group found that they were £60,000 in debt, mainly due to mismanagement. Blur hired new manager Chris Morrison and, to recoup losses, were sent by their record label Food to the United States as part of the Rollercoaster tour. To coincide with the start of the tour, Blur released the &quot;Popscene&quot; single; the new release showcased a significant change in musical direction, as Blur traded their shoegaze-derived sound for one influenced by 60s British guitar pop. However, the single failed to break into the UK top 30 which further diminished Blur&#x27;s profile in the UK.

The 44-date tour of the United States left Blur in &quot;complete disarray&quot;, according to writer David Cavanagh. Dismayed by American audiences&#x27; infatuation with grunge and the lacklustre response to their music, the group frequently drank, and members often broke into fist-fights with one another. Homesick, the tour &quot;instilled in the band a contempt for everything American&quot;, Cavanagh later wrote; frontman Damon Albarn, who &quot;started to miss really simple things [about England]&quot;, listened to a tape of the English pop group the Kinks throughout the tour. He later stated the only pleasant memory he had of the tour was his time spent listening to the Kinks&#x27; 1967 single &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;. Upon their return to England, the group discovered that the attention of the music press had shifted to Suede. The newcomers&#x27; success displeased Blur who, in Cavanagh&#x27;s words, &quot;were inclined to feel that every record Suede sold was an affront to human decency&quot;. After many poor live shows, which Blur members often performed while drunk—in particular one at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received performance by Suede on the same bill—Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food.

==Recording==
Damon Albarn, in a 2000 &quot;Mojo&quot; interview, said that &quot;Suede and America fuelled my desire to prove to everyone that Blur were worth it ... There was nothing more important in my life.&quot; He felt the popularity that American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon fade, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Food Records owner David Balfe strongly disagreed, and argued with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur&#x27;s image. After the still-sceptical Balfe relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead to work on their second album with Albarn&#x27;s first choice of producer, XTC leader Andy Partridge. Partridge said he was dissatisfied with the songs, but was &quot;immensely&quot; fond of the band, likening them to XTC circa &quot;Go 2&quot;. He said he agreed to the project &quot;for the wrong reasons, the flattery and the money.&quot;

Blur began working on the album with Partridge at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by David A. Stewart. However, the sessions ended prematurely. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a &quot;disaster&quot;; he added that &quot;as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn&#x27;t ... sexy&quot;. Partridge recalled: &quot;I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, &#x27;This is fantastic, you&#x27;re George Martin and they&#x27;re The Beatles.&#x27; Next day he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit. The band successfully recorded four songs, but were wary about working in the same conditions again. The Partridge-produced tracks were abandoned; three were later included on the 2012 boxed set &quot;Blur 21&quot;.

Work resumed on the album due to a chance meeting with producer Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the band on their 1991 single &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Way&quot;. With Street now producing the album, Blur recorded a mix of material spanning both the period immediately after the release of &quot;Leisure&quot; and their 1992 tour. While the band members were pleased with the recording session results, Balfe, after hearing the songs, told the band they were committing artistic suicide. Although dejected by his response, Blur gave Food the completed album in December 1992. The label rejected the album and instructed the band to record more potential singles. Albarn complied, and on Christmas Day wrote the song &quot;For Tomorrow&quot;. Although &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; sated Food&#x27;s concerns, Blur&#x27;s American label SBK voiced discontent upon hearing the finished tapes of the album. To appease SBK the band recorded &quot;Chemical World&quot;, which Blur thought would increase &quot;Rubbish&quot;″s American appeal. However, Blur refused SBK&#x27;s demand of re-recording the album with American producer Butch Vig, who was popular at the time for his work with Nirvana.

==Music and lyrical themes==
&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; sound is highly influenced by the traditional guitar pop of British bands such as the Kinks, the Jam, the Small Faces and the Who. The album&#x27;s songs explore a number of styles—punk rock (&quot;Advert&quot;), neo-psychedelia (&quot;Chemical World&quot;), and vaudeville music-hall (&quot;Sunday Sunday&quot;). According to music critic Jim DeRogatis, the album “may have been a stylistic mess, but it was valuable psychedelic garbage nonetheless.”

Opening track &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; is, according to &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;quintessential Blur. Damon, perennially bored, never stops singing, and Graham [Coxon] supplie[s] his usual immaculate guitar accompaniment&quot;. While &quot;Oily Water&quot; harked back to the baggy sound of &quot;Leisure&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;Intermission&quot; as &quot;a pub piano knees-up that rinky-dinks along then gets frazzled in guitars and speeded-up drums&quot;. Most of the songs on the album are melodic and lushly produced, often supplemented by a brass section, string arrangements and backing vocals. To offer contrast to the classicist songwriting, AllMusic noted that &quot;Coxon&#x27;s guitar tears each song open, either with unpredictable melodic lines or layers of translucent, hypnotic effects, and his work creates great tension with Alex James&#x27; kinetic bass&quot;.

Deriving from &quot;the biting humor of Ray Davies and the bitterness of Paul Weller&quot;, Albarn&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While &quot;Rubbish&quot; celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, &quot;it was f***ing scary how American everything&#x27;s becoming ... so the whole thing was a f***ing big two fingers up to America&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; summarised the theme of the &quot;thinly-veiled concept album&quot; as a &quot;London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It&#x27;s the Village Green Preservation Society come home to find a car park in its place&quot;.

==Packaging==

The album&#x27;s title derives from stenciled graffiti painted along Bayswater Road in London, created by an anarchist group. For Albarn, the phrase reflected the &quot;rubbish&quot; of the past that accumulated over time, stifling creativity. Albarn told journalist John Harris in 1993 that he thought the phrase was &quot;the most significant comment on popular culture since &#x27;Anarchy in the UK. Due to Blur&#x27;s disdain for America at the time, the album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Britain Versus America&quot;.

The painting of the steam locomotive &quot;Mallard&quot; on the album cover was a stock image that Stylorouge—Blur&#x27;s design consultants—obtained from a photo library in Halifax. According to &quot;Design Week&quot; magazine, the painting by Paul Gribble &quot;evoked the feel of a Just William schoolboy&#x27;s pre-war Britain&quot;. Inside the packaging, there is an oil-on-canvas of the band dressed as mop-top skinheads in a tube train. The album&#x27;s lyric sheets also feature the songs&#x27; chord progressions, hand-written by guitar player Graham Coxon. While Albarn explained that it was an attempt to &quot;[let] people to know that, old-fashioned as it might seem, we write songs&quot;, &quot;Total Guitar&quot; magazine attributed the inclusion of the chords to Coxon&#x27;s &quot;keen[ness] to demystify guitar playing&quot;.

==Release==
To promote &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, Food released &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single in the UK in April 1993. The single, which showcased Blur&#x27;s new sound and attitude, performed moderately well in the charts, reaching number 28. A few weeks later in May 1993, &quot;Modern Life&quot; was released. The announcement of the album&#x27;s release included a press photo that featured the phrase &quot;British Image 1&quot; spraypainted behind Blur members (who were dressed in a mixture of mod and skinhead attire) and a Mastiff. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quiet concerns, Blur subsequently released the &quot;British Image 2&quot; photo, which was &quot;a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party&quot;. The album peaked at number 15 on the UK Album Chart. In the next few months Food further issued two UK Top 30-charting singles—&quot;Chemical World&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sunday&quot;—to support the record; however, &quot;Modern Life&quot; only managed to sell around 40,000 copies at the time. Nonetheless, the mood within the Blur camp was positive, as the band felt they had accomplished something; James told writer David Cavanagh in 2000, &quot;&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; was a successful record because it achieved what we set out to achieve. I thought everything was shit except us&quot;.

&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; was released in the United States by Blur&#x27;s American record label SBK in December 1993—seven months after the album&#x27;s UK release. This delay was because SBK&#x27;s alternative-music department had closed down; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped, &quot;When I asked [SBK] why, they said it was because the girl had left.&quot; Despite fears that &quot;Modern Life&quot;″s overt Englishness would be lost on the American market, SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay. The label largely ignored Morrison&#x27;s arguments that Blur&#x27;s best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio-stations. SBK&#x27;s strategy was to list the album at a developing-artist price (around three dollars less than standard), send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single &quot;Chemical World&quot;. The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought &quot;Leisure&quot;, and eventually open Blur to Top 40 radio. Further, to lessen the anglocentric feel of the record, SBK added additional songs to the track-listing—including &quot;Popscene&quot;. The plan fared poorly, as &quot;Modern Life&quot; had little impact in the US; the album did not chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold only 19,000 copies, a sharp decline compared to the 87,000 units that &quot;Leisure&quot; shifted.

==Contemporary reviews==
Among contemporary reviews, &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Paul Moody was mostly enthusiastic about the record and rated it seven out of ten. While he felt the album had &quot;enough faults to give a surveyor nightmares&quot;, he was impressed that, unlike their peers, &quot;Blur [had] thrown on their old clothes and stormed into No Man&#x27;s Land with all guns blazing&quot;. Moody also praised the improvement in Albarn&#x27;s lyrics, which had hitherto &quot;[made] Eurovision Song Contest entries seem like great works of poetry&quot;. &quot;Q&quot;″s David Roberts, in a favourable four out of five star review, called &quot;Modern Life&quot; &quot;an energised, infectious romp around contemporary little England, by way of an exuberant trawl through a highly-coloured patchwork of its pop past&quot;. Roberts placed Coxon as the leading contender for &quot;the vacant crown of Smiths guitarist] Johnny Marr&quot;.

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, rock critic Greg Kot felt the album was a vast improvement over &quot;Leisure&quot;, which he found &quot;highly derivative&quot; of the Madchester genre. &quot;Nothing on [&quot;Leisure&quot;] prepares the listener for the adventurousness of &quot;Modern Life is Rubbish&quot;,&quot; he wrote, going on to describe the album as &quot;a swirling, intoxicating song cycle that enriches superior popcraft with wiggy studio experiments.&quot; Although they found the album to be &quot;overly lengthy&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; agreed with Kot, dubbing &quot;Modern Life&quot; &quot;a giant leap forward artistically&quot; from &quot;Leisure&quot;. &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; writer Paul Hampel commended Blur for having &quot;taken a bold step [with &quot;Modern Life&quot;] – backward&quot;, and pointed to their attempt at &quot;a communion with past masters of smart, satirical Brit pop&quot;. He concluded his positive review of the album by calling it a &quot;series of pleasant surprises [that] offers numerous signs that great things are to come from Blur&quot;.

==Aftermath and legacy==
In August 1993, Blur set off on the Sugary Tea tour of the UK to promote &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;. Named after a lyric in &quot;Chemical World&quot;, the tour was a success, as Blur reclaimed some of their popularity. A key performance was at that year&#x27;s Reading Festival which, according to David Cavanagh, was &quot;brilliant&quot;. On the tour, Blur performed a number of songs that would end up on the group&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994).

&quot;Parklife&quot; saw Blur expanding upon the themes and sounds they had first explored on &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;; the &quot;NME&quot; described it as &quot; &#x27;Modern Life Is Rubbish&#x27;s&#x27; older brother – bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier&quot;. &quot;Parklife&quot; debuted at number one on the UK charts, and helped Blur emerge as one of Britain&#x27;s most popular acts. As Jim Shelley wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;a year after Blur were dismissed as too mannered, too retrograde and too English, Parklife was embraced for exactly the same reasons&quot;. &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; and &quot;Parklife&quot;, along with &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1995), formed what would be later referred to as the &quot;Life&quot; trilogy of Blur albums revolving around British themes.

&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; remains highly regarded by critics; Ian Wade of BBC Music wrote that the album was Blur&#x27;s &quot;first masterpiece... which established them as worthy of being mentioned alongside their heroes.&quot; It is seen as one of the early, defining releases of Britpop, a genre that would dominate British pop music in the mid-1990s. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Harris called the album &quot;one of the 1990s&#x27; most influential records&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that &quot;&quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; established Blur as the heir to the archly British pop of the Kinks, the Small Faces, and the Jam&quot; and that it &quot;ushered in a new era of British pop&quot;. Mark Redfern wrote in &quot;Under the Radar&quot; magazine that following &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, &quot;[a] whole wave of Britpop bands followed in [Blur&#x27;s] footsteps, and for a while, it was cool to be British again&quot;. In 2007, IGN listed the album at no. 4 in a &#x27;Top 25 Britpop Albums&#x27; list. Their contributor wrote: &quot;With so many seminal albums to their credit, it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint one, but this is the one if you are forced into a corner.&quot; The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===American release===
The American release of &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; features an altered track listing. Blur&#x27;s American label SBK Records preferred the group&#x27;s original demo of &quot;Chemical World&quot;, and included it on the album instead of the Stephen Street-produced version. According to &quot;Select&quot; magazine, this &quot;defeated the object of recording a heavy rock song in the first place&quot;. SBK inserted &quot;Popscene&quot; between &quot;Turn It Up&quot; and &quot;Resigned&quot;; Blur had refused to include &quot;Popscene&quot; on the British version of &quot;Modern Life&quot;, disappointed by the tepid response it received when it was released as a single. &quot;We thought, If you didn’t fucking want it in the first place,&quot; Coxon told &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;you’re not going to get it now&quot;. The American version also features several tracks with a few seconds of silence (tracks 18 to 67 on the CD), followed by two &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; B-sides (&quot;When the Cows Come Home&quot; and &quot;Peach&quot;) as hidden tracks 68 and 69.

=== 2012 reissue ===
Following the release of the &quot;Blur 21&quot; box set, a special edition of the album was released on 7 August 2012, featuring the remastered original album packaged with an additional disc of bonus material.

<text>The merlin (Falco columbarius) is a small species of falcon from the Northern Hemisphere, with numerous subspecies throughout North America and Eurasia. A bird of prey, the merlin breeds in the northern Holarctic; some migrate to subtropical and northern tropical regions in winter. Males typically have wingspans of , with females being slightly larger. They are swift fliers and skilled hunters which specialize in preying on small birds in the size range of sparrows to doves and medium-sized shorebirds. In recent decades merlin populations in North America have been significantly increasing, with some merlins becoming so well adapted to city life that they forgo migration; in Europe, populations increased up to about 2000 but have been steady subsequently. The merlin has for centuries been well regarded as a falconry bird.

==Nomenclature==
The merlin was described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby (as the &quot;pigeon hawk&quot;) in his &quot;Natural history of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; published in 1729–1732. Based on this description, in 1758 Carl Linnaeus included the species in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and introduced the present binomial name &quot;Falco columbarius&quot; with the type locality as &quot;America&quot;. The genus name is Late Latin; &quot;falco&quot; derives from &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot;, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name &quot;columbarius&quot; is Latin for &quot;of doves&quot; from &quot;columba&quot;, &quot;dove&quot;. Thirteen years after Linnaeus&#x27;s description Marmaduke Tunstall recognized the Eurasian birds as a distinct taxon &quot;Falco aesalon&quot; in his &quot;Ornithologica Britannica&quot;. If two species of merlins are recognized, the Old World birds would thus bear the scientific name &quot;F. aesalon&quot;.

The name &quot;merlin&quot; is derived from Old French &quot;esmerillon&quot; via Anglo-Norman &quot;merilun&quot; or &quot;meriliun&quot;. There are related Germanic words derived through older forms such as Middle Dutch &quot;smeerle&quot;, Old High German &quot;smerle&quot; and Old Icelandic &quot;smyrill&quot;. Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, around 1382, mentions &quot;An Egle, &amp; agriffyn, &amp; a merlyon&quot;. The species was once known as &quot;pigeon hawk&quot; in North America. 

Although the merlin&#x27;s name looks and sounds like the name of the wizard Merlin prominent in Arthurian legend, the bird is not named after the wizard. The wizard&#x27;s name is an English cognate of the Welsh name &quot;Myrddin&quot; and is unrelated to the name of the bird.

==Systematics==

The relationships of the merlin are not resolved to satisfaction. In size, shape and coloration, it is fairly distinct among living falcons. The red-necked falcon is sometimes considered more closely related to the merlin than other falcons, but this seems to be a coincidence due to similar hunting habits; it could not be confirmed in more recent studies. Indeed, the merlin seems to represent a lineage distinct from other living falcons since at least the Early Pliocene, some 5 Ma (million years ago). As suggested by biogeography and DNA sequence data, it might be part of an ancient non-monophyletic radiation of &quot;Falco&quot; species from Europe to North America, alongside the ancestors of forms such as the American kestrel (&quot;F. sparvierus&quot;), and the aplomado falcon (&quot;F. femoralis&quot;) and its relatives. A relationship with the red-necked falcon (&quot;F. chicquera&quot;) was once proposed based on their phenetic similarity, but this is not considered likely today. More recently, a genetic link to two tropical African species, grey kestrel &quot;Falco ardosiaceus&quot; and dickinson&#x27;s kestrel &quot;F. dickinsoni&quot; has been found.

In that regard, a fossil falcon from the Early Blancan (4.3–4.8 Ma) Rexroad Formation of Kansas. Known from an almost complete right coracoid (specimen UMMP V29107) and some tarsometatarsus, tibiotarsus and humerus pieces (V27159, V57508-V57510, V57513-V57514), this prehistoric falcon was slightly smaller than a merlin and apparently a bit more stout-footed, but otherwise quite similar. It was part of the Fox Canyon and Rexroad Local Faunas, and may have been the ancestor of the living merlins or its close relative. With its age quite certainly pre-dating the split between the Eurasian and North American merlins, the fossil falcon supports the idea of the merlin lineage originating in North America, or rather the colonization thereof. After adapting to its ecological niche, ancient merlins would have spread to Eurasia again, with gene flow being interrupted as the Beringia and Greenland regions became icebound in the Quaternary glaciation.

===Subspecies===
That the merlin has a long-standing presence on both sides of the Atlantic is evidenced by the degree of genetic distinctness between Eurasian and North American populations. They are probably best considered distinct species, with gene flow having ceased at least a million years ago, but probably more; but more study is required, particularly in the less-sampled subspecies, before a formal split can be made.

By and large, color variation in either group independently follows Gloger&#x27;s Rule. The Pacific temperate rain forest subspecies &quot;F. c. suckleyi&quot; males are almost uniformly black on the upperside and have heavy black blotches on the belly, whereas those of the lightest subspecies, &quot;F. c. pallidus&quot;, have little non-dilute melanin altogether, with gray upperside and reddish underside pattern. Nine subspecies are currently accepted:
American group (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot; sensu stricto)
* &quot;Falco columbarius columbarius&quot; – taiga merlin, boreal merlin, tundra merlin
:Canada and northernmost United States east of Rocky Mountains, except Great Plains. Migratory, winters in S North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and N South America from the Guyanas to the northern Andes foothills. Rarely winters in the northern USA.
* &quot;Falco columbarius richardsonii&quot; – prairie merlin
:Great Plains from Alberta to Wyoming. Resident (some winter dispersal). Paler than &quot;F. c. columbarius&quot;.
* &quot;Falco columbarius suckleyi&quot; – black merlin, coastal forest merlin
:Pacific coast of North America, from S Alaska to N Washington state. Resident (some altitudinal movements).
Eurasian group (&quot;Falco aesalon&quot; if split)
* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon subaesalon&quot; – Icelandic merlin
:Iceland and Faroe Islands. The Faroese population has some gene flow with &quot;F. c. aesalon&quot;. Resident or some winter dispersal to coasts.
* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon aesalon&quot; – Eurasian merlin
:Northern Eurasia from British Isles through Scandinavia to central Siberia. Population of northern Britain shows evidence of gene flow from &quot;F. c. subaesalon&quot;. British Isles population resident or short-distance movement from moors to coasts, rest migratory; winters in Europe and the Mediterranean region to about Iran.

* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon pallidus&quot; – pallid merlin, steppe merlin
:Asian steppes between Aral Sea and Altay Mountains. Migratory, winters in S Central Asia and N South Asia.
* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon insignis&quot; – East Siberian merlin
:Siberia between Yenisei and Kolyma Rivers. Migratory, winters in continental East Asia.
* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon lymani&quot; – Central Asian merlin
:Mountains of eastern Kazakhstan and surrounding countries. Short-distance migrant.
* &quot;Falco columbarius/aesalon pacificus&quot; – Pacific merlin
:Russian Far East to Sakhalin. Migratory, winters in Japan, Korea and nearby.

==Description==

The merlin is long with a wingspan. Compared with most other small falcons, it is more robust and heavily built. Males average at about and females are typically about . There is considerable variation, however, throughout the birds&#x27; range and—in particular in migratory populations—over the course of a year. Thus, adult males may weigh , and females . Each wing measures , the tail measures and the tarsus measures . Such sexual dimorphism is common among raptors; it allows males and females to hunt different prey animals and decreases the territory size needed to feed a mated pair.

The male merlin has a blue-gray back, ranging from almost black to silver-gray in different subspecies. Its underparts are buff- to orange-tinted and more or less heavily streaked with black to reddish brown. The female and immature are brownish-gray to dark brown above, and whitish buff spotted with brown below. Besides a weak whitish supercilium and the faint dark malar stripe—which are barely recognizable in both the palest and the darkest birds—the face of the merlin is less strongly patterned than in most other falcons. Nestlings are covered in pale buff down feathers, shading to whitish on the belly.
The remiges are blackish, and the tail usually has some three to four wide, blackish bands, too. Very light males only have faint and narrow medium-gray bands, while in the darkest birds the bands are very wide, so that the tail appears to have narrow lighter bands instead. In all of them, however, the tail tip is black with a narrow white band at the very end, a pattern possibly plesiomorphic for all falcons. Altogether, the tail pattern is quite distinct though, resembling only that of the aplomado falcon (&quot;F. berigora&quot;) and (in light merlins) some typical kestrels. The eye and beak are dark, the latter with a yellow cere. The feet are also yellow, with black claws.

Light American males may resemble the American kestrel (&quot;F. sparverius&quot;, not a typical kestrel), but merlin males have a gray back and tail rather than the reddish-brown of the kestrels. Light European males can be distinguished from kestrels by their mainly brown wings. In the north of South Asia, wintering males may be confused with the red-necked falcon (&quot;F. chicquera&quot;) if they fly away from the observer and the head (red on top in &quot;F. chicquera&quot;) and underside (finely barred with black in &quot;F. chicquera&quot;) are not visible.
==Ecology==
Merlins inhabit fairly open country, such as willow or birch scrub, shrubland, but also taiga forest, parks, grassland such as steppe and prairies, or moorland. They are not very habitat-specific and can be found from sea level to the treeline. In general, they prefer a mix of low and medium-height vegetation with some trees, and avoid dense forests as well as treeless arid regions. During migration however, they will utilize almost any habitat.

Most of its populations are migratory, wintering in warmer regions. Northern European birds move to southern Europe and North Africa, and North American populations to the southern United States to northern South America. In the milder maritime parts of its breeding range, such as Great Britain, the Pacific Northwest and western Iceland, as well as in Central Asia, it will merely desert higher ground and move to coasts and lowland during winter. The migration to the breeding grounds starts in late February, with most birds passing through the US, Central Europe and southern Russia in March and April, and the last stragglers arriving in the breeding range towards the end of May. Migration to winter quarters at least in Eurasia peaks in August/September, while e.g. in Ohio, just south of the breeding range, &quot;F. c. columbarius&quot; is typically recorded as a southbound migrant as late as September/October. In Europe, merlins will roost communally in winter, often with hen harriers (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;). In North America, communal roosting is rare.
Merlins rely on speed and agility to hunt their prey. They often hunt by flying fast and low, typically less than above the ground, using trees and large shrubs to take prey by surprise. But they actually capture most prey in the air, and will &quot;tail-chase&quot; startled birds. Throughout its native range, the merlin is one of the most able aerial predators of small to mid-sized birds, more versatile if anything than the larger hobbies (which prefer to attack in mid-air) and the more nimble sparrowhawks (which usually go for birds resting or sleeping in dense growth). Breeding pairs will frequently hunt cooperatively, with one bird flushing the prey toward its mate.

The merlin will readily take prey that is flushed by other causes, and can for example be seen tagging along sharp-shinned hawks (&quot;Accipiter striatus&quot;) to catch birds that escape from this ambush predator into the open air. It is quite unafraid, and will readily attack anything that moves conspicuously. Merlins have even been observed trying to &quot;catch&quot; automobiles and trains, and to feed on captive birds such as those snared in the mist nets used by ornithologists. Even under adverse conditions, one in 20 targets is usually caught, and under good conditions almost every other attack will be successful. Sometimes, merlins cache food to eat it later.

In particular during the breeding season, most of the prey are smallish birds weighing . Almost any such species will be taken, with local preferences for whatever is most abundant—be it larks (Alaudidae), pipits (&quot;Anthus&quot;), finches (Fringillidae), house sparrows (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;), other Old World sparrows (Passeridae), northern wheatears (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;), thrushes (&quot;Turdus&quot;), kinglets (Regulidae) or buntings (&quot;Emberiza&quot;)—and inexperienced s always a favorite. Smaller birds will generally avoid a hunting merlin if possible. In the Cayman Islands (where it only occurs in winter), bananaquits were noted to die of an apparent heart attack or stroke, without being physically harmed, when a merlin went at them and they could not escape.

Larger birds (e.g. sandpipers, flickers, other woodpeckers, ptarmigan, other grouse, ducks and even rock doves as heavy as the merlin itself) and other animals—insects (especially dragonflies, moths, grasshoppers, butterflies and beetles), small mammals, (especially bats, shrews, rabbits, voles, lemmings and other small rodents) reptiles (such as lizards and snakes) and amphibians—complement its diet. These are more important outside the breeding season, when they can make up a considerable part of the merlin&#x27;s diet. But for example in Norway, while small birds are certainly the breeding merlin&#x27;s staple food, exceptional breeding success seems to require an abundance of &quot;Microtus&quot; voles.

Corvids are the primary threat to eggs and nestlings. Adult merlins may be preyed on by larger raptors, especially peregrine falcons (&quot;F. peregrinus&quot;), eagle-owls (e.g., great horned owl, &quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), and larger &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks (e.g., northern goshawk, &quot;A. gentilis&quot;). In general however, carnivorous birds avoid merlins due to their aggressiveness and agility. Their desire to drive larger raptors away from their territory is so pronounced that it is an identifying characteristic. Quoting from one popular raptor watching reference, &quot;An observer may use this aggressive tendency for identification purposes and as a means of detection. High-flying merlins often betray themselves and distinguish themselves because they are vigorously harassing another raptor (even ones as large as the Golden Eagle).&quot;

===Reproduction===


Breeding occurs typically in May/June. Though the pairs are monogamous at least for a breeding season, extra-pair copulations have been recorded. Most nest sites have dense vegetative or rocky cover; the merlin does not build a proper nest of its own. Most will use abandoned corvid (particularly &quot;Corvus&quot; crow and &quot;Pica&quot; magpie) or hawk nests which are in conifer or mixed tree stands. In moorland—particularly in the UK—the female will usually make a shallow scrape in dense heather to use as a nest. Others nest in crevices on cliff-faces and on the ground, and some may even use buildings.

Three to six (usually 4 or 5) eggs are laid. The rusty brown eggs average at about . The incubation period is 28 to 32 days. Incubation is performed by the female to about 90%; the male instead hunts to feed the family. Hatchlings weigh about . The young fledge after another 30 days or so, and are dependent on their parents for up to 4 more weeks. Sometimes first-year merlins (especially males) will serve as a &quot;nest helper&quot; for an adult pair. More than half—often all or almost all—eggs of a clutch survive to hatching, and at least two-thirds of the hatched young fledge. However, as noted above, in years with little supplementary food only 1 young in 3 may survive to fledging. The merlin becomes sexually mature at one year of age and usually attempts to breed right away. The oldest wild bird known as of 2009 was recorded in its 13th winter.

==Relationship with humans==

John James Audubon illustrated the merlin in the second edition of &quot;Birds of America&quot; (published in London, 1827–38) as Plate 75, under the title, &quot;Le Petit Caporal – &quot;Falco temerarius&quot;&quot;. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell&#x27;s London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society, where it remains as of January 2009.

William Lewin illustrates the merlin as Plate 22 in volume 1 of his &quot;Birds of Great Britain and their Eggs&quot;, published 1789 in London.

===Use in falconry===
In medieval Europe, merlins were popular in falconry: the Book of St. Albans listed it as &quot;the falcon for a lady&quot;, where it was noted for classic &quot;ringing&quot; (circling rapidly upward) pursuits of the English skylark. Though the merlin is only slightly larger than the American kestrel in dimensions, it averages about one third to one half larger by weight, with this weight mostly being extra muscle that gives it greater speed and endurance than the kestrel. Like the American kestrel, the merlin offers the modern falconer the ability to hunt year round against sparrows and starlings, in urban settings not requiring large tracts of land or hunting dogs, with the additional advantage of being able to reliably take small game birds such as dove and quail during hunting season. A large and exceptionally aggressive female merlin may take prey as large as pigeons and occasionally even small ducks. They also offer an exciting style of flight, generally at closer range than large falcons where it may be more clearly witnessed and enjoyed by the falconer. In addition to horizontal tail-chases in the manner of American kestrels, they will also &quot;ring up&quot; in pursuit of prey that seeks to escape by out-climbing them, and perform high speed diving stoops on prey beneath them in the manner of larger falcons. Quoting from one popular falconry book on the eagerness of merlins to chase a swung lure, &quot;Every stoop, outrun, dodge, and aerial maneuver of a hard flight to real quarry can be duplicated with no risk of loss of the falcon. Merlins regularly flown to the lure take most field quarries with such ease and such assurance as to make the field flight the less interesting and exciting of the two.&quot;

Quoting expert falconer Matthew Mullenix, author of the book &quot;American Kestrels in Modern Falconry&quot;, in an article comparing the American kestrel to the merlin he states &quot;What a merlin gives you is raw power: lots of it. It brings an ability to negate wind as a factor, to stay airborne at a tremendous clip then gear down further at any time for more performance. One merlin can dominate an entire flock of frightened birds, directing its fate as a whole. The flock responds like bait fish to a barracuda and for precisely the same reason. Merlins demonstrate total mastery of their element.&quot; Concerning suitable game for these two species, he states &quot;To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins.&quot;

===Status and conservation===

Altogether, the merlin is not particularly rare, and due to this and its wide range it is considered a species of least concern by the IUCN. Its numbers are—except in the Asian part of its range, where the situation is less well determined—regularly censused. In about every major country it inhabits, many hundreds to many thousands are found, ranging from a &quot;mere&quot; 250–300 pairs in Belarus to perhaps as many as 30,000 pairs of &quot;aesalon&quot; in European Russia as determined in 1993. It is listed on CITES Appendix II and on a local level protected as other birds of prey; while some countries allow to capture merlins, e.g. for falconry, international trade requires an export permit.

By far the most serious long-term threat to these birds is habitat destruction, especially in their breeding areas. Ground-nesting populations in moorland have a preference for tall heather, and are thus susceptible to overmanagement by burning vast tracts instead of creating a habitat mosaic containing old and new growth. Still, the merlin is rather euryoecious (adaptable to various conditions) and will even live in settled areas, provided they have the proper mix of low and high vegetation, as well as sufficient prey (which is usually the case) and nesting sites (which is a common limiting factor).

In North America, the species seems to have been more widespread in the past, or perhaps its range has shifted northwards: &quot;F. c. columbarius&quot; was an uncommon breeding bird in Ohio before the 20th century, but in Seneca County, as early as the 1900s even single adults were rarely seen in the breeding season. It is encountered in Ohio as a passage migrant and rarely as a winter guest, though two recent nestings have been confirmed. Changing land-use in Ohio mainly turned forest into agricultural land and thus is not very likely to have rendered the region inhospitable to the merlin; global warming on the other hand cannot be dismissed as a reason, given that the merlin is essentially a subarctic species that barely ranges even into temperate climes. Also, it may be that the number of merlins wintering in the northern USA has increased during the 20th century.

Perhaps the most frequent cause of accidental death for individuals is collision with man-made objects, particularly during attacks. This may account for almost half of all premature deaths of merlins. In the 1960s and 1970s, organochlorine pesticides were responsible for declines—particularly in Canada—due to eggshell thinning and subsequent brood failure, and compromising the immune system of adults. This has since been remedied with restrictions on the use of DDT and similar chemicals, and numbers have rebounded. Overall, merlin stocks appear globally stable; while they may decline temporarily in places, they will usually increase again eventually, suggesting that this phenomenon is due to the fluctuations of supplementary food stocks discussed above.

<doc id="199822" wikidata="Q550404" url="?curid=199822" title="He-Man">
<text>He-Man is a superhero and the protagonist of the sword and planet &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; franchise, which includes a toy line, several animated television series, comic books, and a feature film. He-Man is characterized by his superhuman strength and in most variations, is the alter ego of Prince Adam. He-Man and his friends attempt to defend the secrets of Castle Grayskull, the planet Eternia, and the rest of the universe from the evil forces of his archenemy Skeletor. He-Man is the twin brother of She-Ra.

The character was created by designer Mark Taylor, who based the character on his childhood drawings. One of Taylor&#x27;s designs was used by Mattel designer Roger Sweet in his pitch to Mattel for a new action figure line. Sweet also chose the name &quot;He-Man&quot; and suggested that it have a twist-action waist. Sweet sculpted and presented three different versions of the figure to Mattel—including a soldier, spaceman, and barbarian—the barbarian version was chosen and developed into the character&#x27;s current form. Afterwards, Sweet was taken off the project and Taylor was assigned principal design duties. 

The television series &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; rapidly increased the selling of Mattel&#x27;s toys and was a hit success in the 1980s, gaining 9 million viewers in its first year in the US alone and being broadcast to at least 37 countries. The massive success of the series led to a feature-length movie in 1985, &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot;, from the same production team, and a shared continuity, spin-off/sister series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;. There was also a primetime, hour-long Christmas special, &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special.&quot;

Since his creation, He-Man has become a gay icon and amassed an LGBT following.

==Development==
In 1976, Mattel&#x27;s CEO Ray Wagner declined a deal to produce a toy line of action figures based on the characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, due to the $750,000 license ($4,008,703.87 in 2023 dollars) required up front. Following the commercial success of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and its related merchandise, Mattel launched &quot;...failed line after failed line, none of which captured the public&#x27;s imagination or made a significant dent in the toy market.&quot; In the race to design the next popular action figure, Roger Sweet — lead designer for Mattel&#x27;s Preliminary Design Department —realized that simplicity was the key to success. According to his 2005 book &quot;Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea&quot;, Sweet knew that if he gave the marketing department something it could sell, he had won 90 percent of the battle. Sweet stated that &quot;to sell this [to Wagner]&quot;, he glued a Big Jim figure—another Mattel toy line—into a battle action pose, added clay to its body, and had plaster casts made. These three prototypes would later go on to become He-Man. Furthermore, to sell this toy, Sweet stated that as a powerful figure, it could be applied to any context because the character had the generic name of He-Man.

==Appearances==
===Comics===

In the illustrated books released with the first series of toys, He-Man is a barbarian from an Eternian tribe. The planet&#x27;s inhabitants were dealing with the aftermath of the Great Wars, which devastated the civilizations that once ruled supreme. The wars left behind advanced machinery and weaponry, known only to select people. The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull gave He-Man some of these weapons, and he set out to defend the secrets of Castle Grayskull from the evil Skeletor. He-Man possessed one-half of the Power Sword; Skeletor had the second half and used it as his main weapon. When joined, the two halves provide the key to Castle Grayskull. In one early illustrated story, He-Man and Skeletor united their two Power Sword halves to form the true Power Sword, defeating Trap Jaw.

====&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2012)====

In June 2012, DC Comics began publishing a six-issue limited series, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, alongside the weekly digital-first series &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;. In &quot;He-Man: The Eternity War&quot;, He-Man is shown as married to Teela.

===Television===
====&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (1983)====

In more than a few comic books and animated series, He-Man&#x27;s (and She Ra&#x27;s) origins had been revised: his true identity was Prince Adam of Eternia, son of King Randor and Queen Marlena (an earthling), who gave birth to twins Prince Adam/He-Man and Princess Adora/She Ra (Adora was abducted by the Evil Horde led by Hordak) and ruled the Kingdom of Eternia on the planet of the same name. The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull endowed Prince Adam with the power to transform into He-Man, which he did by raising his Power Sword and proclaiming, &quot;By the power of Grayskull...&quot; Once the transformation was complete, he would continue, &quot;...I have the power!&quot; The differences between Prince Adam and He-Man were minimal; He-Man had a slightly deeper voice, a different wardrobe, and slightly darker skin and hair.

Prince Adam&#x27;s pet was a cowardly green tiger named Cringer. When Adam became He-Man, he transformed Cringer into a brave armored green tiger named Battle Cat by pointing his sword at him – an ability Adam discovered accidentally during one of his transformations into He-Man. Cringer cowered in fear at seeing what Adam had become; while reassuring him that nothing had changed, Adam pointed the sword of power at Cringer, which sent a bolt of energy toward the tiger and transformed him. Battle Cat served as He-Man&#x27;s steed and fierce fighting companion ever since. In a couple of versions of He-Man, he can use his sword to change into different versions of He-Man depending on the type of battles he is in, and can also use his sword to give friends, allies (as seen in &quot;Revelation&quot; and the new CGI version of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;), and animals besides Cringer power and enhanced abilities.

Adam was friendly with Teela who, unbeknownst to her, was the daughter of the Sorceress and was adopted by Prince Adam&#x27;s mentor Duncan/Man-At-Arms. Adam and Teela grew up together and now, as Captain of the Guard, she was entrusted to protect him. Unaware of his identity as He-Man, she saw Adam as lazy and cowardly, an act he keeps up to prevent people from discovering his secret identity.

Man-At-Arms was He-Man&#x27;s closest companion and the Eternian royal family&#x27;s innovator of technology and weapons. He often unveiled new weapons or devices to help He-Man. Castle Grayskull was the source of He-Man&#x27;s powers, where the Sorceress lived, who granted Adam his transformative abilities and communicated telepathically with him. To protect his family He-Man kept his double identity a secret, sharing it only with Orko, Man-At-Arms, Cringer, and the Sorceress. He-Man&#x27;s archenemy was Skeletor, a blue-skinned sorcerer with a yellow skull for a head. Skeletor was skilled in black magic and all forms of combat, being extremely cunning and intelligent. Skeletor was accompanied by a group of henchmen who aided his evil schemes.

The spin-off series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; revealed that Adam had a twin sister: Princess Adora, a leader of the Great Rebellion against Hordak on the planet Etheria. Adora, like Adam, was given the gift of the power of Grayskull and had her own sword which she used to transform into She-Ra, Princess of Power. He-Man made several appearances in the series.

A decade on from the cancellation of the Filmation cartoon series, Lou Scheimer pitched a sequel series to Mattel in 1995 called &quot;He-Ro: Son of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; in which He-Man was now King of Eternia, married to Teela, and had a son, Dare, who inherited the Sword of Power from him, using it to become the title character He-Ro, leading his comrades into battle against a returned Skeletor. The show was ultimately not picked up, although its premise has been embraced by fans as official canon and influenced the bios for the characters in the Masters of the Universe Classics toy line.

====&quot;He-Man &amp; She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot; (1985)====
====&quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; (1990)====

After the end of the Masters of the Universe toy line, Mattel attempted to revive interest in He-Man by producing a new toy line, entitled &quot;He-Man&quot;. The storyline in the mini-comics packaged with the figures explained that He-Man had left Eternia and pursued Skeletor into the depths of space, who had set his sights on conquering the distant world of Primus, a planet with great technological resources. He-Man was shown to have relinquished the identity of Prince Adam altogether, basing himself on Primus where he led a team of defenders known as the Galactic Guardians. He-Man&#x27;s appearance was retooled for the new toy line, with a space helmet and golden armor added to his attire to give him a more futuristic appearance; his sword was also redesigned.

A cartoon series was produced by Jetlag Productions to accompany the toy line, entitled &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot;. Although generally following the storyline from the mini-comics, this series maintained the double identity of Prince Adam and He-Man. On the planet Primus, Prince Adam posed as a traveling merchant and the nephew of Master Serbian to disguise his secret identity. His transformation oath was altered slightly, to become &quot;By the power of Eternia...&quot;

====&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (2002)====

To tie in with a new line of action figures based upon the original toyline, a new &quot;He-Man&quot; cartoon series was produced in 2002–03 by Mike Young Productions, titled &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and given the marketing subtitle &quot;vs. the Snake Men&quot; in its second season. This series retold the Masters of the Universe story from the beginning. He-Man&#x27;s origin was told in a 90-minute series premiere, in which the 16-year-old Prince Adam was summoned to Castle Grayskull by the Sorceress to assume the identity of He-Man and his role as Eternia’s defender.

The portrayal of his character in this series was consistent with Filmation&#x27;s portrayal, although the character of Prince Adam was brasher and more youthfully energetic than his 1980s counterpart (conveying the image of a teenage boy saddled with the responsibility of defending a planet from evil). The Adam/He-Man character was redesigned, to make the character&#x27;s secret identity more credible.

====&quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot; (2021)====
==== &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (CGI reboot, 2021)====

In December 2019, it was announced that in addition to their other series, Netflix would also be developing a new &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; series using CGI animation. Rob David developing the series, producing it alongside Adam Bonnett, Christopher Keenan, Jeff Matsuda, and Susan Corbin. Bryan Q. Miller serves as story editor on the series. Animation services are being provided by House of Cool and CGCG Inc.

===Film===
====&quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot; (1985 animated film)====
====&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987 film)====
====&quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;====
He-Man and Skeletor both make cameo appearances in the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;.

====Reboot film====
On April 29, 2019, actor Noah Centineo confirmed in an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; that he would be playing He-Man in the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; reboot film, which was due to begin production in July 2019 and set for a 2020 release. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he pulled out of casting two years later. In January 2022, it was announced that Kyle Allen had been cast in the role, with filming to begin that summer. The movie was then canceled by Netflix and acquired by Amazon MGM. Nicholas Galitzine was cast as the character in May 2024.

===Merchandise===
====&quot;Masters of the Universe Classics&quot; (2008)====
This action-figure line combined elements from the He-Man universe into a cohesive storyline with biographies on the figures&#x27; packaging. These biographies suggested that several &quot;He-Men&quot; have come into existence – such as Vikor (based on an early concept design for the vintage He-Man), Oo-Larr (based on the jungle He-Man from the first minicomic. Adam takes over as King of Eternia as King He-Man, marries Teela, and they have a son named Dare.

==Powers and abilities==

He-Man was characterized as possessing super speed, heightened agility, superhuman strength, increased stamina and endurance. The extent of his strength was unknown, but on one occasion he was able to hoist Castle Grayskull and throw it through an interdimensional portal. He-Man also demonstrated his strength by lifting mountains and icebergs and hurling them toward a desired target. On one occasion, he welded a broken metal chain together simply by pushing the links together. In the episode &quot;She-Demon of Phantos&quot;, he was shown to be the only person to break Photanium (claimed by Man-At-Arms to be the strongest metal in the universe). In the comics, he was shown as being able to go one-on-one with pre-Crisis Superman. On the original action figure&#x27;s packaging and in the introductory sequence of the 1980s cartoon series, He-Man is claimed to be &quot;the most powerful man in the universe&quot;. His strength was derived from magical powers within Castle Grayskull. In the Episode of the original series &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;, He-Man was shown pushing a moon of Eternia into a specific orbit, and then later returning it to its original position by hand.

He can remain as He-Man for as long as he wants but if he takes too much damage or uses too much raw force, he will revert to his original form of Adam. In the 2002 series, He-Man is shown enduring the brunt of at least two large explosions, which he survives, but reverts to Adam in the process, suggesting that even He-Man has a limit as to how much abuse he can endure before his superhuman strength and stamina are exhausted. For He-Man to change back to Prince Adam he holds out his power sword, says &quot;Let the power return!&quot;, and then He-Man and Battle Cat would change back into Prince Adam and Cringer. In the 2002 series, He-Man was shown enduring the brunt of the Ram Stone of Zalasia (a gem whose mystic force could pierce any barrier or topple any obstruction). He survived but reverted to Adam in the process. In combat against the snake-god Serpos, He-Man was struck by the giant snake&#x27;s tail and sent crashing into a mountain. When he fell to the ground, he was again in Adam&#x27;s form; this suggested that there was a limit to He-Man&#x27;s strength and stamina.

He-Man&#x27;s prowess is not limited to strength; he is also depicted as being extremely quick and acrobatic. His speed has been demonstrated by running fast enough to escape massive explosions and moving his arms fast enough to counteract the winds of a tornado. He-Man is also shown leaping great heights, usually flipping through the air several times before landing safely on his feet.

It is also suggested that He-Man possesses some form of telepathic powers as well. There were several instances in the original TV series where He-Man was able to communicate and sense the presence of the Sorceress by telepathy. It was also shown that he has the ability to communicate with his sister She-Ra across great distances.

He-Man as a character is largely non-violent, only resorting to combat as a last resort. He used his intellect more often, preferring to outsmart his adversaries; most violent actions typically consisted of body-throws. In accordance with broadcast standards of the period, in the Filmation cartoon, He-Man could not use his sword as an offensive weapon or punch or kick anyone. He was only allowed to destroy robotic enemies. The 1987 film and 2002 series, however, showed him fighting more aggressively. He-Man was depicted as a leader – most noticeably in the film adaptation, where he is referred to as the &quot;leader&quot; of the resistance. Skeletor intended to force him into submission, rather than killing him – fearing that doing the latter would turn He-Man into a martyr who would inspire others to fight.

He-Man&#x27;s primary weapon was his sword, but he also used other weapons (such as a laser-gun in the film and the mini-comics, a battle axe, a shield, and other equipment – including vehicles) while battling his foes. His sword, apparently indestructible, could deflect bolts of energy. His sister Adora&#x27;s Sword of Protection was not entirely indestructible; the stone in the hilt was once damaged, preventing her from transforming. In addition, the sword gave him the ability to transform from Prince Adam into He-Man (and back) by utilizing the powers of Castle Grayskull. He also uses his sword to transform Cringer into Battle Cat. In the earliest versions of the story (for example, the first four minicomics) He-Man&#x27;s primary weapon was an axe, because the sword was intended to serve as a plot device that would only be used in order to gain entry into Castle Grayskull. The breastplate on his power harness was made of an Eternian mineral (Coridite) which helped add to his physical strength. The origin of the power harness was explained in the episode &quot;Evil-Lyn&#x27;s Plot&quot; (written by Paul Dini).

==Gay analysis==
David Chlopecki argues that Prince Adam&#x27;s appearance, such as his pink spandex clothing, conforms to gay stereotypes, while NPR said the character&#x27;s appearance adds to the show&#x27;s gay subtext because He-Man&#x27;s outfit resembles those of leather subculture, and including a bondage harness, which in the 1980s was considered to be homoerotic imagery. Attention has also been paid to Adam&#x27;s transformation into He-Man through his &quot;fabulous powers&quot; and phallic sword.

The character&#x27;s double life has also been noted as queer subtext. According to Battis, Adam&#x27;s need to &quot;hide his true identity as [He-Man]&quot; is one of the show&#x27;s key queer aspects. British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted fan interpretations that the character&#x27;s dual identity represents a man&#x27;s struggle to accept his sexuality; Prince Adam is closeted while He-Man is &quot;out-and-proud&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Johns Hopkins News-Letter&quot;, Matt Johnson described the series&#x27; depiction of He-Man as a &quot;thinly veiled treatise on the state of gay male sexuality in the eighties&quot;.

Adam B. Vary said the original cartoon series contains gay subtext, which the live-action movie &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; almost turns into explicit text, portraying a &quot;tragic unrequited romance between He-Man and Skeletor&quot;, singling out Skeletor&#x27;s &quot;warped obsession&quot; with He-Man and He-Man never showing an interest in women. He-Man&#x27;s relationship with Man-at-Arms has also been acknowledged as being homoerotic.

===Gay icon and fandom===
He-Man&#x27;s homoeroticism resulted in the character and show drawing a gay audience when the cartoon first aired, with the character being now viewed as a gay icon. &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; reported gay men were one of the three core groups that were collectors of He-Man toys at conventions, alongside body builders and law-enforcement. ND Stevenson, the creator, showrunner, and executive producer of &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; (2018–20) has also stated that He-Man—alongside She-Ra—is a gay icon, and the character&#x27;s LGBT fanbase has been credited as helping provide support for the inclusion of openly gay characters in the reboot.

====Sex appeal====
When development on a live-action remake of the film was first-announced, LGBT lifestyle magazine &quot;Out&quot; also described the original series as &quot;one of the gayest ... cartoons of all time&quot;, and said the 1987 film &quot;turn[ed] an entire generation of boys at least a little gay&quot;. &quot;Instinct&quot; magazine&#x27;s Gerald Biggerstaff described the original cartoon as being quite popular with gay men who grew up in the 1980s and 90s, and that for many of them, He-Man &quot;prompted [their] gay awakenings&quot;. In 2003, &quot;HX Magazine&quot; editors compiled a list of must-see television series with attractive male leads, with He-Man as himself and based on his appearance in the 2002 reboot—the only animated character to make the list—being described as the &quot;object of all our childhood wet dreams&quot;. British magazine &quot;Gay Times&quot; compiled a list of cartoon characters their editors were attracted to while growing up; He-Man was at the top of the list, taking note of Dolph Lundgren&#x27;s depiction of him in the live-action film. In the same publication, actor Andrew Hayden-Smith said 2016 he realized he was gay while playing with his He-Man figure as a child, being attracted to the character&#x27;s physique—particularly his pecs.

===Response from Mattel and insiders===
According to Mark Morse, Mattel&#x27;s director of global marketing from 2008 to 2017, by 2018, when a &quot;Laughing Prince Adam&quot; action figure was released, the question of He-Man&#x27;s sexuality and whether a future installment in the franchise should have him be openly gay had not been discussed. In an interview with gay lifestyle online magazine &quot;Queerty&quot;, Rob David and Tim Sheridan, who work on the show &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;, discussed the character&#x27;s homoeroticism and gay fanbase. According to David, who is an executive producer of &quot;Revelation&quot; and Mattel&#x27;s Vice President of Creative Content, Mattel is &quot;very comfortable&quot; with He-Man&#x27;s gay audience and the perception of the character as a gay icon.

<text>Pia Merete Kjærsgaard (; born 23 February 1947) is a Danish politician who was Speaker of the Danish Parliament from 2015 to 2019, and former leader of the Danish People&#x27;s Party.

She is a co-founder of the Danish People&#x27;s Party, and led the party from its creation in 1995 to 2012. She previously led the Progress Party from 1985 until founding the People&#x27;s Party in 1995. She has become one of the best-known politicians in Denmark during recent years, both for her consistent and vocal stance against multiculturalism and immigration, and for her parliamentary support for the center-right governments of Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Lars Løkke Rasmussen from 2001 to 2011. Her success has been an inspiration for anti-immigration and anti-Islamic movements throughout Europe.

On 7 August 2012, Kjærsgaard announced her resignation from the leader position of the Danish People&#x27;s Party. She appointed Kristian Thulesen Dahl as her successor, and he took office on 12 September 2012, promising to maintain the course laid out by Kjærsgaard.

==Early life==
Kjærsgaard was born in Copenhagen to Poul Kjærsgaard, a paint merchant, and Inge Munch Jensen, a housewife. After completing Danish Folkeskole Education in 1963, she attended the Commercial School in Copenhagen (1963–1965). From 1963 to 1967, she worked as a home care assistant for the elderly in Gentofte. From 1978 to 1984, she was employed as an office assistant in connection with insurance and advertising activities. 

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===
Kjærsgaard began her political career as the Progress Party&#x27;s candidate in the Ryvang nomination district (1979–1981), followed by the Ballerup and Gladsaxe nomination district (1981–1983), the Hvidovre nomination district (1983–1984), and finally, the Middelfart nomination district (1984–1995).

In 1984, while still with the Progress Party, she secured her first seat in the Folketing (Danish parliament), representing the Copenhagen County constituency (10 January 1984 – 8 September 1987). She next represented the Funen County constituency (8 September 1987 – 6 October 1995).

In 1995, as things were growing increasingly chaotic and anarchic in the Progress Party, Kjærsgaard broke away to co-found the Danish People&#x27;s Party (DPP). She stood as the DPP candidate in the Glostrup nomination district in 1997, followed by the Hellerup and Gentofte nomination district (1997–2005). As a DPP candidate, she won a seat in the Folketing, representing the Funen County constituency (6 October 1995 – 11 March 1998).

As support for the Progress Party subsequently dwindled away, the DPP grew. By 2001, it had become the third largest party in the Folketing, securing 12% of the vote. In the 2005 election, the DPP&#x27;s share grew to 13.2%, with Kjærsgaard receiving 38,347 &quot;personal votes&quot;, second to only the Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

===Speaker of the Folketing===
On 3 July 2015, following the success of Kjærsgaard&#x27;s party in the June 2015 parliamentary election, she was elected the first female speaker of the Folketing (but not the first female speaker in &quot;parliament&quot; since, in 1950 when Denmark still had a bicameral system, Ingeborg Hansen became the first Danish female parliamentary speaker when she was elected speaker of the Landsting). Kjærsgaard was proposed both by the four parties supporting Lars Løkke Rasmussen&#x27;s new government, and from the opposition by the Social Democrats and the Greenlandic Siumut.

===The Danish People&#x27;s Party===
The Danish People&#x27;s Party advocates a primarily nationalist and nativist platform, and is, in that regard, aligned ideologically with other European far right parties. The DPP&#x27;s platform also includes toughening the criminal code and supporting social welfare policies that have traditionally been championed by the center-left Social Democrats.

The DPP achieved considerable success in the 2001 elections, becoming the third largest party in the Folketing. As such, the DPP was able to provide key parliamentary support for the center-right, Liberal-Conservative minority government led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen. In this capacity the DPP was able to push through many of its platform&#x27;s policies.

In both the 2005 and the 2007 election the DPP kept its position as third largest in the Folketing and was thus able to maintain its substantial role in policy-setting through both the remainder of Anders Fogh Rasmussen&#x27;s Liberal-Conservative government and through that of successor Lars Løkke Rasmussen.

==Political positions==

Kjærsgaard&#x27;s most outspoken political goals are to limit immigration to Denmark, that society should take better care of the elderly, and that Denmark should maintain its sovereignty, especially with regards to the European Union. In the euro referendum of 2000 she campaigned successfully against the adoption of the Euro.

Her view on immigration has often led to her being compared to politicians such as Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and Pim Fortuyn in The Netherlands.

She is also known to be an ardent supporter of Taiwan&#x27;s bid to gain admission to the World Health Organization and the United Nations.

==Controversies==
===Assault and accusations===
In 1998, Kjærsgaard was assaulted by members of an angry mob during a demonstration by the far left autonome movement in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen.

In 1999, accusations of nepotism were levied against the DPP after it was revealed that Kjærsgaard&#x27;s husband, Henrik Thorup, had been paid by the party as an independent consultant for over two years. The accusations came from parties on both sides of the political spectrum. The DPP refused to reveal Thorup&#x27;s salary and defended its actions, claiming that Pia Kjærsgaard&#x27;s husband was the right man for the job and that his employment had nothing to do with his marriage to the party leader.

===Criminal cases===
In 2001, Kjærsgaard, in the DPP&#x27;s weekly newsletter, referred to Muslims as people who &quot;...lie, cheat and deceive.&quot; Kjærsgaard was subsequently reported to the police by Denmark&#x27;s Center for Racial Discrimination, for making racist remarks. Police declined to prosecute Kjærsgaard, stating that there was no reason to believe that her statement violated any laws regarding racism.

In 2002, Kjærsgaard was fined DKK 3,000 for threatening a woman with pepper spray, the use of which is illegal in Denmark. Kjærsgaard said she pulled out the spray after feeling &#x27;intimidated and threatened&#x27; by the woman&#x27;s behaviour. Kjærsgaard subsequently proclaimed her intention to lobby for a change in weapon possession legislation.

In 2003, Kjærsgaard lost a libel suit in the Danish Supreme Court against Karen Sunds, an anti-EU activist, who had characterized Kjærsgaard&#x27;s viewpoints as racist. The Court ruled that Sunds&#x27; remarks had only implied that Kjærsgaard had a negative opinion of immigrants, and were not properly interpreted as an accusation of espousing biologically-grounded racism or Nazi racial theory.

==Personal life==
In 1967, Kjærsgaard married Henrik Thorup, an insurance underwriter. Thorup went on to become a chairperson and regional council member in the DPP, and currently works as a government accountant. The couple has two children, a daughter named Nan and a son named Troels.

<doc id="199824" wikidata="Q1474095" url="?curid=199824" title="Rodgers and Hart">
<text>Rodgers and Hart were an American songwriting partnership between composer Richard Rodgers (1902–1979) and the lyricist Lorenz Hart (1895–1943). They worked together on 28 stage musicals and more than 500 songs from 1919 until Hart&#x27;s death in 1943. Many of their songs are classics of the American songbook.

== History ==
Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were introduced in 1919 while Rodgers was in high school and Hart had already graduated from Columbia University. One of their first collaborations was at Columbia in the 1920 Varsity Show, &quot;Fly With Me&quot;, which also involved Rodgers&#x27; future collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II. After writing together for several years they produced their first successful Broadway musical, &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot;, in 1925, which introduced their hit song &quot;Manhattan&quot; and led to a series of successful musicals and films. They quickly became among the most popular songwriters in America, and from 1925 to 1931 had fifteen scores featured on Broadway. In the early 1930s they moved to Hollywood, where they created several popular songs for film, such as &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot; and &quot;Lover&quot;, before returning to Broadway in 1935 with Billy Rose&#x27;s &quot;Jumbo&quot;. From 1935 to Hart&#x27;s death in 1943, they wrote a string of highly regarded Broadway musicals, most of which were hits.

Many of their stage musicals from the late 1930s were made into films, including &quot;On Your Toes (1936)&quot; and &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1937), though rarely with their scores intact. &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940), termed their masterpiece, has a book by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer John O&#x27;Hara. O&#x27;Hara adapted his own short stories for the show, which featured a title character who is a heel. Critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in his review, &quot;Although it is expertly done, how can you draw sweet water from a foul well?&quot; When the show was revived in 1952 audiences had learned to accept darker material, due in large part to Rodgers&#x27; work with Oscar Hammerstein. The new production had a considerably longer run than the original and was now considered a classic by critics. Atkinson, reviewing the revival, wrote that the musical &quot;renews confidence in the professionalism of the theatre.&quot;

== Analysis ==
&quot;Time&quot; devoted a cover story to Rodgers and Hart on September 26, 1938. The magazine said that their success &quot;rests on a commercial instinct that most of their rivals have apparently ignored&quot;. The article also said their &quot;spirit of adventure.&quot; &quot;As Rodgers and Hart see it, what was killing musicomedy was its sameness, its tameness, its eternal rhyming of June with moon.&quot;

Their songs have long been favorites of cabaret singers and jazz artists. Ella Fitzgerald recorded &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Rodgers &amp; Hart Songbook&quot; and Andrea Marcovicci based one of her cabaret acts entirely on Rodgers and Hart songs.

In their era musicals were revue-like and librettos were little more than excuses for comic turns and music cues. Rodgers and Hart tried to raise the standard of the musical form in general. &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; (1927) was based on Mark Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;A Connecticut Table in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; and &quot;The Boys From Syracuse&quot; (1938) on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Errors.&quot; They used dance significantly in their work, using the ballets of George Balanchine.

== Songs ==
One of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s best known songs, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, was originally called &quot;Prayer.&quot; It was to be sung by Jean Harlow in the 1934 film &quot;Hollywood Party&quot;, and was cut. Hart then wrote a new lyric, intended to be the title song for &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; (1934), which was cut again. A third lyric, &quot;The Bad in Every Man,&quot; was used in the film. At the urging of Jack Robbins, head of MGM&#x27;s music publishing unit, Hart wrote a fourth lyric as a standalone song. Glen Grey and the Casa Loma Orchestra recorded it in 1936, and that version topped the charts for three weeks. Elvis Presley included a haunting version on his self-titled debut album, in 1956. It again was #1 in 1961, this time in the doo-wop style, by The Marcels. Bob Dylan included his Nashville-inflected version of the song on his &quot;Self Portrait&quot; album of 1970.

Frederick Nolan writes that &quot;My Romance&quot; (written for &quot;Jumbo&quot;) &quot;features some of the most elegantly wistful lyrics...[it] is, quite simply, one of the best songs Rodgers and Hart ever wrote.&quot;

Other of their hits include &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love with Love&quot;, &quot;Here In My Arms&quot;, &quot;Mountain Greenery&quot;, &quot;My Heart Stood Still&quot;, &quot;The Blue Room&quot;, &quot;Ten Cents a Dance&quot;, &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;, &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, &quot;Mimi&quot;, and &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot;.
