<doc id="204644" wikidata="Q953630" url="?curid=204644" title="List of bicycle brands and manufacturing companies">
<text>This page lists bicycle brands and manufacturing companies past and present. For bicycle parts, see List of bicycle part manufacturing companies.

Many bicycle brands do not manufacture their own product, but rather import and re-brand bikes manufactured by others (e.g., Nishiki), sometimes designing the bike, specifying the equipment, and providing quality control. There are also brands that have, at different times, been manufacturers as well as re-branders: a company with manufacturing capability may market models made by other (overseas) factories, while simultaneously manufacturing bicycles in-house, for example, high-end models.

Only brands or manufacturers that are notable as a bicycle brand should be included. If no page exists for the company or brand, then the page to be linked to should be created first or a reference provided as to its notability or the entry will probably be removed.

<text>Nelson Piquet Souto Maior (, born 17 August 1952) is a Brazilian former racing driver and businessman, who competed in Formula One from to . Piquet won three Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles, which he won in , , and , and won 23 Grands Prix across 14 seasons.

Piquet had a brief career in tennis before losing interest in the sport and subsequently took up karting and hid his identity to prevent his father discovering his hobby. He became the Brazilian national karting champion in 1971–72 and won the Formula Vee Brazil championship in 1976. With advice from Emerson Fittipaldi, Piquet went to Europe to further success by taking the record number of wins in Formula Three in 1978, beating Jackie Stewart&#x27;s all-time record.

In the same year, he made his Formula One debut with the Ensign team and drove for McLaren and Brabham. In 1979, Piquet moved to the Brabham team and finished the runner-up in 1980 before winning the championship in 1981. Piquet in 1982 was hampered by severe engine unreliability, but he saw a resurgence for 1983 and his second world championship. For 1984–85, Piquet had once again lost chances to win the championship but managed to score three wins during that period. He moved to the Williams team in 1986 and was a title contender until the final round in Australia. Piquet took his third and final championship in 1987 during a heated battle with teammate Nigel Mansell which left the pair&#x27;s relationship sour. Piquet subsequently moved to Lotus for 1988–89 where he experienced his third drop in form. He eventually went to the Benetton team for 1990–91 where he managed to win three races before retiring.

After retiring from Formula One, Piquet tried his hand at the Indianapolis 500 for two years. He also had a go at sports car racing at various points during and after his Formula One career. Piquet is currently retired and runs several businesses in Brazil. He also manages his sons Nelson Jr. and Pedro, who are also professional racing drivers. Piquet has faced several controversies since the 1980s—predominantly for his use of homophobic language—and was banned from the Formula One paddock in 2022.

==Early life and career==
Piquet was born 17 August 1952, in Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil, the son of Estácio Gonçalves Souto Maior (1913–1974), a Brazilian physician. His father moved his family to the new capital, Brasília, in 1960 and became Minister for Health in João Goulart&#x27;s government (1961–64). Piquet had two brothers, Alexis and Geraldo, and a sister Genusa. Piquet was the youngest of the children.

His father wanted Piquet to be a professional tennis player and was given a scholarship at a school in the United States, in Atlanta. Piquet started playing tennis at the age of 11. He won tournaments in Brazil and eventually took a trip to California to test his skill against tougher American players. During his time, he had learned to speak English and greatly matured. His short tennis career saw Piquet to be prized as a good player but not thought sufficiently exciting for the sport, which led him to devote his career to motor racing.

Piquet started kart racing at the age of 14, but because his father did not approve of his racing career, he used his mother&#x27;s maiden name Piquet (of French origin and pronounced as &quot;Pee-Ké&quot;) misspelt as Piket to hide his identity.

Piquet dropped out of a University two years into an engineering course in 1974. He was subsequently employed in a garage to finance his career, since he had no financial support from his family.

Upon returning to Brazil, Piquet and three friends bought a 20 hp cart and participated in Brazilian go-karting (1971 and 1972 national champion) and in the local Formula Super Vee 1976 championship, in which he easily won that season. On the advice of Emerson Fittipaldi, the first Brazilian Formula One world champion who sold the chassis for the Brazilian Formula Vee champion car with his brother, he arrived in European motor sports hailed as a prodigy. In the 1978 British Formula 3 season he broke Jackie Stewart&#x27;s record of the most wins in a season.

==Formula One==
Piquet made his Formula One debut for Ensign in Germany, starting 21st only to retire on lap 31 with a broken engine. After the race, Piquet drove a McLaren of BS Fabrications in the next three races, where he left good impressions. The deal was negotiated when BS Fabrications employees met Piquet when he was driving at Brands Hatch. His best finish was ninth in Italy.

===Brabham (1978–85)===
For the last race in 1978, Piquet moved to the Brabham team; he qualified in 14th and finished 11th. Piquet stayed with Brabham until 1985.

====1979====
In 1979, Piquet competed in his first full season in Formula One. He once again drove for the Brabham team, alongside double world champion, Niki Lauda. The season was difficult for the team, which was accustomed to success. Piquet retired from eleven of the fifteen races in the season. He started off his season being involved in a first-lap pile up and getting injured at the Argentine Grand Prix in Buenos Aires and crashing into Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Williams car at the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos. The first points of his career came at the Dutch Grand Prix, where he finished fourth. He had a huge accident at the Italian Grand Prix; the rear section of his BT48 was completely ripped off at Monza&#x27;s Curva Grande corner after another incident with Regazzoni; Piquet walked away uninjured. But even though the races saw him crash a few times, or retire with a semi-competitive car that had an unreliable engine, in qualifying Piquet performed well, qualifying in the top five several times – often out-qualifying Lauda. Two weeks after the Italian round, Lauda abruptly quit driving before the start of the Canadian Grand Prix, leaving Piquet as the number one driver for Brabham, and leaving him and new recruit Ricardo Zunino to debut the new BT49, which had a Ford-Cosworth DFV engine; Brabham ditched the Alfa Romeo V12&#x27;s in protest to Alfa Romeo entering as a full works team. In the final race, the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Piquet started from the front row and took the fastest lap in the race, clearly showing the new BT49&#x27;s considerable potential.

====1980====

In 1980, Piquet finished a hard-fought 2nd in Argentina behind Alan Jones; the race was held in very hot conditions on a disintegrating track. There were doubts about the legality of the car as it was believed to be underweight. Jones went to see the car which gave the suspicion that ballast had been added to bring the car within the regulations to make it legal. 
Piquet took his first win at the United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California by over 50 seconds from Riccardo Patrese. 5 months later, Piquet scored back to back wins in the Netherlands and Italy. He finished second in the drivers&#x27; standings, 13 points behind title winner Alan Jones. In Canada, Piquet and Jones had contact off the start and Piquet&#x27;s car was damaged and caused a major crash resulting in the race being red flagged. Jones, his Championship rival, continued in the race and joined the restart in the same car. Piquet switched to his qualifying car which had a special engine that was not set up to go the distance, so Piquet retired and Jones won the race and the World Championship from Piquet.

====1981====

The season began with the revocation of the South African Grand Prix&#x27;s status as an FIA-sanctioned event due to the ongoing FISA–FOCA war. With the FISA teams boycotting the race, the FOCA teams staged a non-championship race there in South Africa held in wet conditions which was won by Carlos Reutemann with Piquet second. FISA and FOCA reached an agreement banning movable skirts and requiring a minimum ground clearance, excluding the tyres, of 6 cm.

After a third place in the United States Grand Prix West, Piquet qualified on pole position in his home race, the Brazilian Grand Prix in his birth city of Rio de Janeiro, but quickly faded from contention after starting the race on slick tyres on a soaking wet track. At the next race, the Argentine Grand Prix in Buenos Aires, Brabham got around the ground-clearance rule by devising a suspension system that kept the car at the required height during technical inspection but lowered it onto the ground at speed, allowing it to race once again as a wing car. The superiority of the car was such that Piquet easily swept to victory and even his less experienced Mexican teammate Héctor Rebaque, who could usually be found well down the order, managed to retain second place until he was forced to retire. At the San Marino Grand Prix, almost all the teams adopted the innovation brought to Argentina by Brabham. Piquet won the race despite being caught out by rain.

In the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, after an initial start which was aborted due to an accident involving Siegfried Stohr, his teammate Riccardo Patrese and mechanic Dave Luckett who inexplicably remained on the track at the start to restart Patrese&#x27;s stalled car, Piquet went off again in the lead only to have Jones make contact on lap 10 forcing him to retire, with the race being won by Reutemann. After crashing in Monaco and Spain, Piquet was able to recover at the French Grand Prix at Dijon where he dominated until lap 58, when a sudden storm led to a red flag and the organizers decided to wait until the rain stopped to continue the race. At the restart 45 minutes later, Alain Prost appeared much more competitive after putting on slicks on a drying track, with some mechanical work performed during the break, and won his first Grand Prix with Piquet relegated to third place, behind Prost and McLaren&#x27;s John Watson. In the next race, the British Grand Prix, Reutemann finished second to open up a seventeen-point lead in the standings while Piquet suffered tyre failure and crashed on the straight between Stowe and Club corners.

Piquet won the championship with a great comeback that began when he won the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim while Reutemann was enduring internal conflict with his teammate Alan Jones. After stringing together a series of decent results (even after losing second in Italy due to engine failure on the last lap) whilst Reutemann only scored a few times, Piquet went into the last race of the season only a point behind Reutemann. At the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas, Piquet finished fifth to clinch the championship as Reutemann finished out of the points. Piquet was so dehydrated from the desert heat and exhausted from the anti-clockwise nature of the track that he vomited on himself during the race and had to be lifted out of his car when he returned to the pits.

====1982====
The following year, Piquet was fast but his car proved to be unreliable despite Brabham entering into an alliance with BMW to supply the team with turbocharged engines that although were powerful, were also very unreliable and were the main reason why the car retired from so many races. Aside from the first Grand Prix in South Africa Brabham started the season using the Ford-Cosworth engined BT49D. Piquet won the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro; the extreme heat and immense adhesion of the cars meant that Piquet and other drivers suffered from exhaustion; Piquet fainted while collecting his trophy on the podium. Piquet was later disqualified for his car being underweight from a protest from Renault and Ferrari. Piquet did not drive the BMW-engined BT50 until Belgium, and the low point of the season was Detroit where he failed to qualify due to an engine failure in qualifying. The ruling of Piquet&#x27;s disqualification led to a political attack on the lowering of the minimum weight against Ferrari and Renault who used turbo engines. Ferrari&#x27;s changes to the rear wing at the United States Grand Prix West and the disqualification of Gilles Villeneuve after the race caused the FOCA teams to boycott the San Marino Grand Prix.

His only win was in the Canadian Grand Prix which was also BMW&#x27;s first win in Formula One. In Germany, Piquet arrived to help Didier Pironi after he suffered a career-ending high-speed crash during practice. In the race, Piquet was leading until he collided with Eliseo Salazar whom he physically attacked at the side of the track on live television.
====1983====
Piquet won the opening race in Brazil in the arrow-shaped BT52 and followed this up with a retirement in the United States West Grand Prix. He scored a second place in France and took another second at Monaco also taking the fastest lap. He was 14 points behind Alain Prost with three races left in the season but took back-to-back victories at Monza and Brands Hatch to close to within two points. At the season-ending South African Grand Prix, Prost retired on lap 35 and Piquet cruised to a third-place finish, winning his second world title. It also was the first time a turbocharged car won the championship, and was BMW&#x27;s first and only championship in Formula 1.

====1984====
With the new rule that limited the capacity of the tanks of the cars to 220 liters and forbade race refueling, Piquet started as the title favorite because it was thought that the 4-cylinder BMW would suffer less from the new fuel economy requirement than the 6-cylinder competition. The winter tests seemed to confirm the expectations, and in fact the car showed promise, but the expected results never materialised. The only good thing that came from the tests was the creation of special qualifying engines, which produced more than 900 hp and allowed Piquet to match what was then the record for pole positions in a year: nine, already held by Lauda and Ronnie Peterson.
The season was dominated by the McLaren team who were using TAG-Porsche engines. In Canada, the Brabham team introduced a curious additional radiator on the nose that was mounted on the car that improved reliability. Piquet won the race (after having retired from the previous 6 races, mostly through engine or turbo failure), but the additional radiator heated to the point that Piquet suffered burns on his right foot when pushing the accelerator pedal down; The heat had actually burnt a hole through his boots and he went to the podium barefoot after receiving first aid. He managed take a back-to-back win at Detroit after driving his backup car due to an accident that occurred at the start of the race. These were his only two victories of the year. In Spielberg he could have won as the car of leading Niki Lauda suffered a loss of gears, but Piquet was unaware and did not attack. Piquet finished in 5th place in the championship.

====1985====

Prior to the season, Piquet and Brabham conducted their winter testing at the Kyalami circuit in South Africa, along with the team&#x27;s new tyre supplier Pirelli. It was through this testing that Pirelli came up with the tyre compounds they would use during the season. Unfortunately, unlike the hot conditions in South Africa, most of the European part of the season took place in unseasonably cold weather. This, and the Brabham BT54&#x27;s weight distribution towards the back of the car saw the Pirelli tyres (especially the fronts) largely ineffective and left Piquet often fast, but ultimately uncompetitive.

In 1985, Piquet won a single race, the French Grand Prix at the Paul Ricard Circuit with summer conditions similar to those experienced in testing suiting the tyres, and the powerful BMW turbo engine propelling the Brabham BT54 (of teammate Marc Surer) to the then F1 speed record of on the long Mistral Straight during qualifying. It was Pirelli&#x27;s first victory since returning to Formula One.

However, Piquet was becoming frustrated. He felt as if his loyalty to Brabham was being taken advantage of - his salary was lower than other drivers despite his success with the team - and he was not being informed of some team decisions. The switch to Pirelli tyres had been particularly upsetting: he felt it had been done purely for financial reasons and placed inordinate commitments on him for tyre testing. He was also concerned about financial security when he retired, citing the difficulties faced by Brazilian footballers Pelé and Garrincha after their professional careers ended. However, he was well integrated with the team and enjoyed close relationships with Gordon Murray and his mechanics, making him reluctant to leave.

He had been in contact with McLaren, but was discouraged by the PR duties that came with it: &quot;(Ron Dennis) mentioned so many days a year working for Marlboro... I lost interest. I won&#x27;t waste my life talking to people who don&#x27;t understand racing.&quot; Williams offered him a contract worth three times his Brabham contract, and with the turbocharged Honda engine quickly becoming one of the best on the grid, it was an offer too good to refuse. After some thought, he reluctantly left Brabham after seven seasons and two world championships.

===Williams (1986–87)===

====1986====
A move in to Williams saw Piquet becoming the teammate of one of his fiercest rivals, Nigel Mansell. It was reported that Honda were paying the bulk of his US$3.3 million contract. When Piquet had signed for Williams at 1985 Austrian Grand Prix, Piquet did not regard Mansell as a serious threat, as the Briton had not won a race yet in his fifth year in Formula One (and would win his first race a month later). Piquet had underestimated Mansell, and the Englishman came out of 1985 on a confidence high after winning 2 of the last 3 races in 1985. Both were regarded as high-strung characters with delicate temperaments, and two top drivers in the same team was a recipe for fireworks – and sure enough Mansell and Piquet went head to head for the title. Piquet had wanted to play the role as the number one driver. According to Piquet, the verbal agreement with Frank Williams on this point was clear, and Williams&#x27;s comment that in signing Piquet he had &quot;signed the best driver in the world&quot; seemed to back that up. However, shortly before the beginning of the season, Frank Williams suffered a serious car accident that kept him away from the team for a long time and caused a permanent physical disability. The team was then led by technical director Patrick Head, who was also Mansell&#x27;s race engineer.

Though the two drove what were clearly the best cars on the grid, their rivalry caused each to deprive the other of points, allowing Alain Prost to win one of the closest and most fiercely disputed championships ever in Formula One. The season began well with Piquet dominating the Brazilian Grand Prix and at the next the race, the San Marino Grand Prix, Piquet finished second behind Prost. During the season, fellow Brazilian and former dual-World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi estimated that Piquet could not commit more driving errors early in the season when he was judged as the best driver in the field.

Piquet (and reportedly Honda) left Adelaide following the Australian Grand Prix, fuming that Williams had not honoured their contract and had allowed Mansell to win races instead of ordering him to let the Brazilian by. Had Mansell let Piquet pass to take some extra wins, Piquet could have easily won the championship, instead of the two of them being beaten by Prost in what was an inferior car (though Prost did manage 11 podium finishes, including 4 wins). In this season Piquet won more races (a total of four) than he would in any of his championship-winning campaigns.

====1987====
Piquet made amends in , using political maneuvering and technical skill to gain the upper hand. He was also a very good testing and development driver, and was able to develop the Williams car further to make it even more competitive. At times during the season, the rift between himself and Mansell was evident, as Mansell was showing superior speed in qualifying and races. Piquet had also admitted to &quot;not ever being quite right&quot; after his qualifying crash for Round 2 at Imola. He was ordered by FISA&#x27;s medical chief, Sid Watkins, not to race due to the concussion he suffered when his Williams hit the wall at high speed at the Tamburello curve. He was offered by RAI to join Mario Poltronieri and Clay Regazzoni to comment on the race. Piquet, who had maintained friendly relations within the commentary box, sent Ezio Zermiani. Piquet accepted improvising as a commentator, but beyond the short journalistic experience, Piquet complained at year-end about the fact that the incident had left strong psychological effects in its aftermath which had caused insomnia.

It became obvious that the continued development of the FW11 meant that it was clearly the best car that year, and the 1987 championship was going to be disputed between Piquet and Mansell. Despite winning fewer races than Mansell in 1987, Piquet emerged as world champion. From Detroit to Portugal, he never finished off the podium, racking up points in what he called his &quot;percentage driving policy&quot; in his successful bid to win his third championship. Piquet announced during practice for the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix that he had signed with Lotus as the undisputed number one driver, a position he claimed was promised at Williams from 1986, but was never honored following Frank Williams&#x27; car crash. It was also believed this was a big factor in Honda dropping Williams and moving to McLaren for 1988, despite another year left in the contract. The Japanese company, who paid most of Piquet&#x27;s salary, considered him to be the number one and were privately fuming that Williams management did not rein in Mansell and allow Piquet an easier time.

===Lotus (1988–89)===
====1988====
Piquet and the number 1 went to a stagnating Lotus team in , and his career took a nose dive despite the Camel sponsored Lotus 100T having the same specification Honda V6 turbo that powered the almost totally dominant McLarens of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost - the 100T was a very poor chassis that was riddled with aerodynamic issues, was constantly flexing and was not properly compatible with the engine. Piquet, who had 20 wins and three World Championships following the 1987 season, began to lose his reputation when he had no wins in 1988, losing his number one status to fellow Brazilian Senna, who won eight races and the championship for McLaren (Prost won seven races, while Piquet could only manage three third-place finishes for the season).

In early 1988 he resorted to using the media to attack his rivals and gained a reputation as an outspoken &quot;loose cannon,&quot; such as attacking Mansell and his wife, calling Mansell &quot;an uneducated blockhead&quot; (and insulting his wife&#x27;s looks), and calling fellow Senna &quot;the São Paulo taxi driver&quot; and stating that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t like women.&quot; Piquet retracted his comments when both threatened legal action. He also earned the ire of the Tifosi at the San Marino Grand Prix when he said in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; that Scuderia Ferrari might do better as a team if the boss (Enzo Ferrari) was a younger man instead of the 90-year-old one who rarely attended races due to his age and failing health. Piquet claims he was badly misquoted in the interview, which also had him questioning Prost&#x27;s standing as the best driver in the world. On the official FIA video review of the 1988 season, Piquet left no doubts that the article got it wrong in his comments about Ferrari (saying that at 90, Enzo Ferrari had to be a strong man to run a Formula One team), and that he considered Prost to be the world&#x27;s best driver.

Before the start of the 1988 season, the Rio de Janeiro circuit was renamed in Piquet&#x27;s honor.

====1989====
Piquet had a disappointing 1989 season, driving a Judd V8-powered Lotus which had 125 less hp than the Honda V10s used by McLaren. He did, however, have an excellent (considering the Lotus car’s limitations) fourth place in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone where he overtook theoretically faster cars and was running third until Alessandro Nannini overtook him in the last few laps. He (and teammate Satoru Nakajima) once again had no wins and they both even failed to qualify for the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet&#x27;s first non-qualification since the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix. On what was his last attempt to qualify at Spa, Piquet lost his chance when he was slowed by rookie Frenchman Olivier Grouillard, who had gained a reputation throughout the season as a blocker.

===Benetton (1990–91)===

====1990====

When Lotus informed Piquet during 1989 that they would be using the Lamborghini V12 engine for , he decided to leave the team claiming that there had not been enough development of the V12 during its debut year with Larrousse in 1989 and that the team would be uncompetitive using the Italian engine.

The late season announcement by Lotus meant that there were almost no seats left with one of the top teams (McLaren, Ferrari and Williams), leaving Piquet with the unenviable possibility of not having a drive for 1990. However, the Benetton team had a seat become available when they decided not to retain fill-in driver Emanuele Pirro. After two lacklustre seasons at Lotus, Piquet was forced to sign an incentive based payment-by-results deal with Benetton, who had acquired the services of John Barnard for their 1990 car, the B190 and had exclusive use of the factory Ford-Cosworth HB4 V8 engine. This saw Piquet return to something like his former top form in . 

Despite a handful of lacklustre performances and sometimes being outperformed by fast Italian teammate Alessandro Nannini who was forced into retirement before the Spanish Grand Prix (after his right forearm had to be surgically re-attached following a helicopter crash) Piquet scored two wins in the last two races of the season. The first in Japan was somewhat inherited after Senna had taken out Prost&#x27;s Ferrari at the first turn, and both Gerhard Berger (McLaren) and Mansell (Ferrari) retired. It was his first win since the 1987 Italian Grand Prix. The second was just two weeks later at the last race of the season in Australia when after a great drive, Piquet survived a spirited, but fair, challenge from the V12 Ferrari of Mansell to win what was the 500th World Championship Formula One Grand Prix. His 18 points from the last two races saw him move from seven in the standings (26 points) to finishing third in the championship with 43. Piquet and Gerhard Berger both scored 43 points (Piquet had scored 44 but was forced to drop one point under the &quot;Best 11&quot; rule of the time), but Piquet&#x27;s two wins, where Berger won none, saw him finish third.

====1991====
This was followed by the final win of his F1 career at Montreal in – again at the expense of longtime rival Mansell, whose Williams-Renault stalled past the old pits on the last lap while leading. In late 1991, Piquet&#x27;s teammate Roberto Moreno was replaced by Michael Schumacher, who remained for the rest of the season. He had talked to the Ligier and Ferrari teams about securing a drive, but Piquet then announced his retirement from Formula One in January 1992 to concentrate on his business activities.

==Other racing ventures==

===Indianapolis 500 (1992 - 1993)===
Piquet attempted to race in the Indy car series and was hired by Team Menard to drive in the 1992 Indianapolis 500. He had taken to the track well, and appeared comfortable driving at high speeds despite never before racing on an oval. During practice, Piquet&#x27;s car ran over a metallic piece of debris and drove through turn 3 at full speed. When driving through turn 4, Piquet abruptly took his foot off the pedal to enter the pit lane, which resulted in the car spinning and hitting the wall. Piquet suffered serious foot and ankle injuries and was forced to sit out the race. He returned after rehabilitation in 1993 and managed to qualify. He started in 13th position, but finished in 32nd, dropping out with engine problems after only 38 laps.

===Sports cars (1980-1981, 1996-1997 and 2006)===

Alongside Formula One, Piquet took part in the 1000km Nürburgring in 1980 and 1981 driving a BMW M1. He won the 1981 race alongside the German Hans-Joachim Stuck. However, the race had to be stopped roughly two hours in because of the fatal crash of Herbert Müller after 17 laps of the 14-mile (23 km) course.

In 1996, Piquet competed in the Le Mans 24 Hours driving a McLaren F1 GTR alongside Johnny Cecotto and Danny Sullivan, finishing eighth overall. In the following year, Piquet took part alongside JJ Lehto and Steve Soper, but the car was retired due to an accident that occurred while Lehto was driving. That same year, in December, he won the Mil Milhas Brasileiras driving the McLaren F1 GTR with Johnny Cecotto and Steve Soper.

On 20 January 2006, Piquet won the 50th edition of the Mil Milhas Brasileiras (Brazilian 1,000 miles) at the Interlagos circuit. He drove an Aston Martin DBR9 alongside his son, Nelson Piquet Jr., and drivers Christophe Bouchut and Hélio Castroneves. At the end of the race, an exhausted Piquet was quoted saying to a friend he would &quot;never sit in a cockpit again.&quot;

===Driver management===
Since 2000, he has supported the career of his son, Nelson Piquet Jr., who drove in the F1-feeder category GP2 for 2 seasons, achieving a best championship result of second with four race wins, and was a test driver for Renault F1 in 2007.

During the Crashgate scandal, Piquet pledged to use his wealth to find out why his son had been ordered by the Renault team to crash deliberately during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. He and his son were eventually paid a six-figure sum for costs and libel damages.

==Helmet==

Piquet&#x27;s helmet is white and red with a thick line resembling the seam on a tennis ball (possibly due to his father wanting him to be a tennis player), and teardrop shapes filling in the round areas on the sides and top. The seam and teardrops were usually red or orange with black trim, but some parts were yellow during his Lotus years due to the Camel sponsorship, and reverted to a deep red when he left Lotus for Benetton. His sons Nelson Jr. and Pedro followed his helmet design.

==Business ventures==
Upon leaving motor sport, he founded Autotrac in 1992, a company that provides mobile data messaging and tracking of customers&#x27; trucks by satellite (GPS tracking). This business concluded quite successfully as the pioneer because the freight transportation of Brazil depended on trucks.

Piquet founded a racing team, Piquet Sports, in 2000. The purpose was to help the participation of Nelson Piquet Jr. in Formula Three Sudamericana. It was founded eight months before Nelson Junior turned 16.

Piquet runs some other businesses, based in Brasília.

Nelson Piquet&#x27;s net worth is around US$200 million currently.

==Personal life==
Known as a practical joker, Piquet lived a stereotypically playboy racing driver lifestyle, earning and losing and earning again a series of small fortunes in his business dealings. He remains a competitive driver in sports car racing, albeit more for fun than with serious intent. Never a fan of street circuits (save for Adelaide in Australia), he was critical of the Monaco Grand Prix by famously stating Monaco was like &quot;riding a bicycle around your living room,&quot; but that &quot;a win there was worth two anywhere else.&quot;

Piquet&#x27;s first marriage lasted one year, during which a son was born in 1977. His second produced three children, including Nelson Angelo Piquet and Kelly Piquet. He also has another son from a previous relationship. He has two children with his current wife, including Pedro Estacio Piquet.

On 31 July 2007, Piquet, after repeated speeding and parking offenses, was stripped of his civilian driving licence and ordered by the Brazilian courts to attend a week of lessons in order to &quot;learn good and safe driving conduct&quot;, and to then pass an exam. His wife Viviane received the same sentence. &quot;I think we have to pay for our mistakes,&quot; Piquet told Brazilian media. &quot;It&#x27;s not just a speeding problem, I got tickets for all kinds of reasons, like parking where I shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000 and two racing circuits in Rio de Janeiro (formerly the Jacarepaguá Circuit) and in Brasília have been named &quot;Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet&quot;, though the Rio circuit has since been demolished to make way for venues to be used in the 2016 Summer Olympics, with Rio de Janeiro the host city. Since his retirement, Piquet has been ranked among the greatest Formula One drivers. He was ranked 13th by Autosport in 2009, and 16th by BBC Sport in 2012.

He has Portuguese and French ancestry.

In a 2012 interview on Brazilian TV with himself and former Williams teammate Nigel Mansell, Piquet revealed that he had never been right after his accident at Imola in 1987. The crash caused him to lose some 80% of his depth perception and saw him secretly visit a hospital in Milan every two weeks through the season fearing that if he told his team they would not let him drive. He went on to say that he should have won the championship in 1986 and Mansell should have won in 1987, and that after 1987 he drove for the money as due to his condition he was no longer able to lead races from the front (each of his six wins following his Imola accident were inherited from others dropping out late).

On 11 November 2013, Piquet underwent heart surgery from which he made a complete recovery.

He currently lives in a mansion on a farm in the suburbs of Brasília. Inside the property there is a precious private automobile museum and an airstrip.

==Controversies==

Piquet was known for insulting and slandering other drivers during and after his racing career. In 1988, Piquet made comments in a magazine about his rival Nigel Mansell, calling him an &quot;uneducated blockhead&quot; and describing his wife as &quot;ugly&quot;. He also falsely accused Ayrton Senna of being homosexual and called Enzo Ferrari &quot;senile&quot;, adding to the latter statement that the Ferrari team would have performed better at the time if Ferrari was 30 years younger. Mansell was in particular incensed about the personal attacks on his family which he described as &quot;out of order&quot;, while Senna countered the accusations against his sexuality in a 1990 interview with the Brazilian edition of Playboy where he revealed that he lost his virginity to a prostitute when he was 13 years old. Senna speculated in the same interview that Piquet loathed him because he had previously slept with Piquet&#x27;s then-future wife Despite Senna&#x27;s high-profile relationships with Brazilian television personalities like Xuxa from 1988 to 1990 and Adriane Galisteu at the time of his death in 1994, Piquet continued to publicly refer to Senna as &quot;gay&quot; as late as 2020.

In 2021, during an interview on a Brazilian podcast, Piquet referred to Lewis Hamilton by the Portuguese term &quot;neguinho&quot; when discussing an incident between Hamilton and Max Verstappen at the 2021 British Grand Prix. After the comments resurfaced on social media in 2022, his use of the supposedly racial slur received condemnation from F1 and the community. Piquet later apologised for his remarks, explaining that they were not intended to be racist. Following this apology, new footage revealed Piquet also used homophobic language against Hamilton in a 2016 interview. When asked of his opinion about Keke Rosberg, the 1982 Formula One World Champion, Piquet described him as &quot;a turd that has no value&quot;. He insinuated the reason Lewis Hamilton lost the 2016 Formula One World Championship to Rosberg&#x27;s son, Nico Rosberg, was because Hamilton &quot;must have been getting his ass fucked more often at that time, so things turned rough [for him]&quot;.

In July 2022, Piquet was banned from the F1 paddock as a result of the slanderous statements made against Hamilton. Craig Slater of Sky Sports F1 reported that despite his apology, Piquet, &quot;for the foreseeable future at least, will not be welcome in the Formula 1 paddock&quot;. The British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club also suspended Piquet’s membership, and were expected to terminate his status as an honorary member, following a 7 day notice period. In March 2023, he was ordered by a Brazilian court to pay (approximately ) in moral damages. The ban was lifted by the end of 2024, and Piquet was present at the São Paulo Grand Prix as a guest of Red Bull.

==In popular culture==

Piquet was portrayed by Hugo Bonemer in the 2024 &quot;Senna&quot; miniseries, a dramatization of the life and racing career of Ayrton Senna.

<text>Barthold Georg Niebuhr (27 August 1776 – 2 January 1831) was a Danish–German statesman, banker, and historian who became Germany&#x27;s leading historian of Ancient Rome and a founding father of modern scholarly historiography. By 1810 Niebuhr was inspiring German patriotism in students at the University of Berlin by his analysis of Roman economy and government. Niebuhr was a leader of the Romantic era and symbol of German national spirit that emerged after the defeat at Jena. But he was also deeply rooted in the classical spirit of the Age of Enlightenment in his intellectual presuppositions, his use of philologic analysis, and his emphasis on both general and particular phenomena in history.

==Education==
Niebuhr was born in Copenhagen, the son of Carsten Niebuhr, a prominent German geographer resident in that city. His father provided his early education. By 1794 the precocious young Niebuhr had already become an accomplished classical scholar who read several languages. That year he entered the University of Kiel, where he studied law and philosophy. There he formed an important friendship with Madame Hensler, the widowed daughter-in-law of one of the professors, six years older than himself. He also made the acquaintance of her sister, Amelie Behrens, whom he subsequently married.
In 1796 he left Kiel to become private secretary to the Danish finance minister, Count Schimmelmann, but in 1798 he gave up this appointment and travelled in Great Britain, spending a year at Edinburgh studying agriculture and physics. Of his stay in Great Britain, he said &quot;my early residence in England gave me one important key to Roman history. It is necessary to know civil life by personal observation in order to understand such states as those of antiquity. I never could have understood a number of things in the history of Rome without having observed England.&quot;

In 1799 he returned to Denmark, where he entered the state service; in 1800 he married Amalie Behrens (1773–1815) and settled at Copenhagen. In 1804 he became chief director of the national bank. After the death of his first wife, Niebuhr married (1816) Margarete Henslen (1787–1831), with whom he had one son, Marcus, and three daughters, Amalie, Lucia and Cornelia.

==To Prussia==
In September 1806, he quit the Denmark post for a similar appointment in Prussia. He showed much business ability in his banking work, which he attributed to his life in England and Scotland. He arrived in Prussia on the eve of the catastrophe of Jena. He accompanied the fugitive government to Königsberg, where he rendered considerable service in the commissariat, and was afterwards still more useful as commissioner of the national debt and by his opposition to ill-considered schemes of taxation. He was also for a short time Prussian minister in the Netherlands, where he endeavoured without success to fund a loan. The extreme sensitiveness of his temperament, however, disqualified him for politics; he proved impracticable in his relations with Hardenberg and other ministers, and in 1810 retired for a time from public life, accepting the more congenial appointment of royal historiographer and professor at the university of Berlin.

In 1809 he became a third class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

==Academic and diplomatic career==
He commenced his lectures with a course on the history of Rome, which formed the basis of his great work &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot;. The first edition in two volumes, based upon his lectures, was published in 1811–1812, but attracted little attention at the time owing to the absorbing interest of political events. In 1813 Niebuhr&#x27;s own attention was diverted from history by the uprising of the German people against Napoleon; he entered the Landwehr and ineffectually sought admission into the regular army. He edited for a short time a patriotic journal, the &quot;Prussian Correspondent&quot;, joined the headquarters of the allied sovereigns, and witnessed the battle of Bautzen, and was subsequently employed in some minor negotiations. In 1815 he lost both his father and his wife.

He next accepted (1816) the post of ambassador at Rome. Before his departure for Rome, he married his wife&#x27;s niece. On his way to Rome, he discovered in the cathedral library of Verona the long-lost &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius, afterwards edited by Savigny, to whom he communicated the discovery under the impression that he had found a portion of Ulpian. The reason that Niebuhr visited Verona is a matter of controversy among scholars, with some alleging that he was on a &quot;secret mission&quot; to obtain the Gaius manuscript which others had previously found. The evidence points towards a fortunate coincidence.

During his residence in Rome Niebuhr discovered and published fragments of Cicero and Livy, aided Cardinal Mai in his edition of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot;, and shared in framing the plan of the great work &quot;Beschreibung Roms&quot; (&quot;The Description of the City of Rome&quot;) on the topography of ancient Rome by Christian Charles Josias Bunsen and Ernst Zacharias Platner (1773–1855), to which he contributed several chapters. He also, on a journey home from Italy, deciphered in a palimpsest at the Abbey of St. Gall the fragments of Flavius Merobaudes, a Roman poet of the 5th century. As minister, he brought about the understanding between Prussia and the Pope signalized by the bull &quot;De salute animarum&quot; in 1821. Niebuhr was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.

In 1823 he resigned the position in Rome and established himself at Bonn, where the remainder of his life was spent, with the exception of some visits to Berlin as councillor of state. He here rewrote and republished (1827–1828) the first two volumes of his &quot;Roman History&quot;, and composed a third volume, bringing the narrative down to the end of the First Punic War, which, with the help of a fragment written in 1831, was edited after his death (1832) by Johannes Classen. He also assisted in August Bekker&#x27;s edition of the Byzantine historians (the &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae&quot;), and delivered courses of lectures on ancient history, ethnography, geography, and on the French Revolution.
In February 1830, his house was burned down, but the greater part of his books and manuscripts were saved. France&#x27;s revolution of July in the same year was a terrible blow to him, and filled him with the most dismal anticipations of the future of Europe. Niebuhr died, aged 54, in Bonn. After his death, in 1842, a medal was commissioned to honour his work.

==Evaluation and opinion==
Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; counts among epoch-making histories both as marking an era in the study of its special subject and for its momentous influence on the general conception of history. Leonhard Schmitz, in his 1861 preface to the English version of Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, wrote:&quot;The main results arrived at by the inquiries of Niebuhr, such as his views of the ancient population of Rome, the origin of the plebs, the relation between the patricians and plebeians, the real nature of the ager publicus, and many other points of interest, have been acknowledged by all his successors.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; (1911) continues, &quot;Other alleged discoveries, such as the construction of early Roman history out of still earlier ballads, have not been equally fortunate; but if every positive conclusion of Niebuhr&#x27;s had been refuted, his claim to be considered the first who dealt with the ancient history of Rome in a scientific spirit would remain unimpaired, and the new principles introduced by him into historical research would lose nothing of their importance. He suggested, though he did not elaborate, the theory of the myth, so potent an instrument for good and ill in modern historical criticism. He brought in inference to supply the place of discredited tradition, and showed the possibility of writing history in the absence of original records. By his theory of the disputes between the patricians and plebeians arising from original differences of race he drew attention to the immense importance of ethnological distinctions, and contributed to the revival of these divergences as factors in modern history. More than all, perhaps, since his conception of ancient Roman story made laws and manners of more account than shadowy lawgivers, he undesignedly influenced history by popularizing that conception of it which lays stress on institutions, tendencies and social traits to the neglect of individuals.&quot;

More modern perspectives on Niebuhr&#x27;s work maintain that, although some of his hypotheses were extravagant, and his conclusions mistaken, he introduced a constructive, scientific approach to the critical and sceptical consideration of ancient literary sources, especially with regard to their poetic and mythical embellishments. The influence of scientific racism upon some of his theories has been considered.

==Works==
The first edition of Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; was translated into English by F. A. Walter (1827), but was immediately superseded by the translation of the second edition by Julius Hare and Connop Thirlwall, completed by William Smith and Leonhard Schmitz (last edition, 1847–1851). He wrote &quot;Griechische Heroengeschichte&quot; (“History of Greek Heroes,” 1842; 11th ed. 1896), for his son Marcus; &quot;Geschichte des Zeitalters der Revolution&quot; (“History of the Age of Revolutions”, 1845); &quot;Kleine historische und philologische Schriften&quot; (Minor Historical and Philological Writings, 1828–43). His &quot;Lectures on Ancient History&quot; is familiar in English translation.

<text>Nakhon Ratchasima (, ; , , often called Khorat (, ; , )) (alternate spelling Korat) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in lower northeastern Thailand also called Isan. At it is the country&#x27;s largest province by area, has a population of approximately 2.6 million, and generates about 250 billion baht in GDP, the highest in Isan. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise, from north) Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen, Buriram, Sa Kaeo, Prachinburi, Nakhon Nayok, Saraburi, and Lopburi.

The capital of the province is the city of Nakhon Ratchasima in Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima district, also called &quot;Khorat&quot;.

==Geography==

The province is at the west end of the Khorat Plateau, separated from the Chao Phraya river valley by the Phetchabun and Dong Phaya Yen mountain ranges. Two national parks are in the province: Khao Yai in the west and Thap Lan in the south. Both parks are in the forested mountains of the Sankamphaeng Range, the southern prolongation of the Dong Phaya Yen mountains. The total forest area is or 15.4 percent of provincial area.

Nakhon Ratchasima is a large province on the northeastern plateau and acts as a gateway to other provinces in the northeast. It is from Bangkok and has an area of around . The province is rich in Khmer culture and has a long history.

===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with two other national parks, make up region 1 (Prachinburi) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Thap Lan National Park, 
* Khao Yai National Park, 

==History==

The area around Khorat was already an important centre in the times of the Khmer empire in the 11th century, as can be seen by the temple ruins in Phimai historical park. Nakhon Ratchasima province is one of the provinces where there is still a sizable northern Khmer population.

A new walled city with a surrounding moat, designated as Nakhon Ratchasima, was built in the 17th century by order of the King Narai, as the easternmost &quot;command post&quot;, guarding the kingdom&#x27;s border. Nakhon Ratchasima continued this duty during the Bangkok Period, although it was briefly seized during Lao rebellion (1826–1828) in 1826, in the reign of King Rama III of Siam.

Nakhon Ratchasima has long been the most important political and economic centre in the northeastern region. In the late-19th century, the railroad reached Khorat and it became the junction of two main rail lines in the northeastern, Isan, region. In 1933, Nakhon Ratchasima was the stronghold of the royalist troops in the Boworadet Rebellion, as they fought against the new democratic government in Bangkok. In the 1950s, the Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base was built in Nakhon Ratchasima; from 1961 until 26 February 1976, this facility was also used as a base by the United States Air Force.

Nakhon Ratchasima was the birthplace of Thao Suranari who was born in 1771 and was the savior of Nakhon Ratchasima from King Anouvong&#x27;s army in 1826.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal depicts the revered heroine of Khorat, Thao Suranari (Thai: ท้าวสุรนารี).

A monument to Thao Suranari (real name: &quot;Khunying Mo&quot;; 1771–1852) stands in front of the old &quot;Pratu Chumphon&quot; gate. Also called &quot;The Great Heroine of Khorat&quot;, Kunying Mo was the wife of the Siamese-appointed deputy governor of Nakhon Ratchasima during the reign of King Rama III. In 1826, Khunying Mo managed to repel the Laotian army led by Prince Anouvong of Vientiane who tried to reinstate control over the Khorat plateau. King Rama III conferred the title of &quot;Thao Suranari&quot; on Khunying Mo, as well as additional ones honouring her bravery.

The provincial tree and flower is the &quot;sathon&quot; (&quot;Millettia leucantha&quot;). The provincial aquatic animal is Hoven&#x27;s carp (&quot;Leptobarbus hoevenii&quot;).

The provincial motto is &quot;Land of brave women, fine silk material, Khorat rice noodles, Phimai Historical Park, and Dan Kwian ceramics&quot;.

The provincial color is orange

== Attractions ==

*Phimai Historical Park is one of the most important Khmer temples of Thailand. It is in the town of Phimai. The temple marks one end of the ancient Khmer Highway from Angkor. As the enclosed area of 1020 x 580 metres is comparable to that of Angkor Wat, Phimai must have been an important city in the Khmer Empire. Most buildings date from the late-11th to the late-12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon, and Angkor Wat styles. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back the 7th century. Inscriptions name the site &quot;Vimayapura&quot;, which developed into the Thai name &quot;Phimai&quot;.
*Khao Yai National Park is in the western part of the Sankamphaeng Mountain Range, at the southwestern boundary of the Khorat Plateau. The highest mountain in the area of the park is 1,351 m high Khao Rom. This park lies largely in Nakhon Ratchasima province (Khorat), but also includes parts of Saraburi, Prachinburi, and Nakhon Nayok provinces. The park is the third largest in Thailand. It covers an area of 300 square kilometers, including tropical seasonal forests and grasslands. Elevations mostly range from 400 to 1,000 m. It is home to 3,000 species of plants and 320 species of birds. Waterfalls include the 80 metre Heo Narok, and Heo Suwat .

*Nakhon Ratchasima railway station is a 1st class station and the main railway station in the province. There are 18 daily trains serving this station. There are four to six special trains during the celebration of the New Year and Songkran.
*Lam Takhong Dam is an embankment dam on the Lam Takhong River between Pak Chong District and Sikhio District. The dam was constructed in 1974 for the purposes of irrigation and water supply, but after 2002 its water storage also serves as the lower reservoir for the Lam Takhong pumped storage power plant, Thailand&#x27;s first power plant of this type.
*Korat&#x27;s zoo was established under the patronage of the king. The zoo is managed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand). The Korat Zoo has rare animals such as tigers, giraffes, lions, elephants, zebras, rhinoceroses, hedgehogs, birds such as guinea fowls, ostriches, and flamingos.
*Khao Yai Thiang is the mountain located in Khlong Phai, Pak Chong District. There are 12 wind turbines on top of the mountain. Tourist can go cycling and enjoying the view of reservoir.

==Korat cat==


The Korat cat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds. Originating in Nakhon Ratchasima province at Phimai, it is named after its province of origin. In Thailand the breed is known as &quot;si sawat&quot;, meaning &quot;colour of the sawat seed&quot; (bluish-gray). Korat cats are distinguished not only by the colour of their fur. Genuine Korat cats have a heart-shaped face when viewed from any angle and shorter grey hair with silver tips. The true breed&#x27;s eyes are yellow with an inner green circle. They must be slender and agile. The cat&#x27;s tail must be slender. Cats with crooked tails are considered inauspicious.

In 1965, Korat cats were first registered in the US by the Korat Cat Fanciers Association. The cats that formed the breed were first imported from Thailand by Jean L. Johnson in 1959. In 1966 the breed was accepted by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA). The Korat breed is now accepted by cat associations around the world.

The International Maew Boran Association (TIMBA) (&quot;maew boran&quot; means &quot;ancient cat&quot;) was formed in Thailand to provide a registry of and pedigrees for Thai cats, including Korats, and to provide a voice in English for Thai breeders as &quot;...Thai breeders...do not speak English, and farang breeders do not speak Thai.&quot;.

<text>A coupe or coupé (, ) is a passenger car with a sloping or truncated rear roofline and typically with two doors.

The term &quot;coupé&quot; was first applied to horse-drawn carriages for two passengers without rear-facing seats. It comes from the French past participle of , &quot;cut&quot;. 

Some coupé cars only have two seats, while some also feature rear seats. However, these rear seats are usually lower quality and much smaller than those in the front. Furthermore, &quot;A fixed-top two-door sports car would be best and most appropriately be termed a &#x27;sports coupe&#x27; or &#x27;sports coupé&#x27;&quot;.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
 () is based on the past participle of the French verb (&quot;to cut&quot;) and thus indicates a car which has been &quot;cut&quot; or made shorter than standard. It was first applied to horse-drawn carriages for two passengers without rear-facing seats. These or (&quot;clipped carriages&quot;) were eventually clipped to .

There are two common pronunciations in English:
* () – the anglicized version of the French pronunciation of &quot;coupé&quot;.
* () – as a spelling pronunciation when the word is written without an accent. This is the usual pronunciation and spelling in the United States and much of Canada, with the pronunciation entering American vernacular no later than 1936 and featuring in the Beach Boys&#x27; hit 1963 song &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;.

== Definition ==
A coupé is a fixed-roof car with a sloping rear roofline and one or two rows of seats. However, there is some debate surrounding whether a coupe must have two doors for passenger egress or whether cars with four doors can also be considered coupés. This debate has arisen since the early 2000s, when four-door cars such as the Mazda RX-8 and Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class have been marketed as &quot;four-door coupés&quot; or &quot;quad coupés&quot;, although the Rover P5 was a much earlier example, with a variant introduced in 1962 having a lower, sleeker roofline marketed as the Rover P5 Coupé.

In the 1940s and 1950s, coupés were distinguished from sedans by their shorter roof area and sportier profile. Similarly, in more recent times, when a model is sold in both coupé and sedan body styles, generally the coupe is sportier and more compact. There have been a number of two-door sedans built as well, a bodystyle the French call a &quot;coach&quot;.

The 1977 version of International Standard ISO3833—&quot;Road vehicles - Types - Terms and definitions&quot;—defines a coupe as having two doors (along with a fixed roof, usually with limited rear volume, at least two seats in at least one row and at least two side windows). On the other hand, the United States Society of Automotive Engineers publication J1100 does not specify the number of doors, instead defining a coupé as having a rear interior volume of less than .

The definition of coupé started to blur when manufacturers began to produce cars with a 2+2 body style (which have a sleek, sloping roofline, two doors, and two functional seats up front, plus two small seats in the back).

Some manufacturers also blur the definition of a coupé by applying this description to models featuring a hatchback or a rear cargo area access door that opens upwards. Most often also featuring a fold-down back seat, the hatchback or liftback layout of these cars improves their practicality and cargo room.

== Horse-drawn carriages ==

The coupe carriage body style originated from the berline horse-drawn carriage. The coupe version of the berline was introduced in the 18th century as a shortened (&quot;cut&quot;) version with no rear-facing seat. Normally, a coupé had a fixed glass window in the front of the passenger compartment. The coupé was considered an ideal vehicle for women to use to go shopping or to make social visits.

== History ==
The early coupé automobile&#x27;s passenger compartment followed in general conception the design of horse-drawn coupés, with the driver in the open at the front and an enclosure behind him for two passengers on one bench seat. The French variant for this word thus denoted a car with a small passenger compartment.

By the 1910s, the term had evolved to denote a two-door car with the driver and up to two passengers in an enclosure with a single bench seat. The coupé de ville, or coupé chauffeur, was an exception, retaining the open driver&#x27;s section at front.

In 1916, the Society of Automobile Engineers suggested nomenclature for car bodies that included the following:
During the 20th century, the term coupé was applied to various close-coupled cars (where the rear seat is located further forward than usual and the front seat further back than usual).

Since the 1960s the term &quot;coupé&quot; has generally referred to a two-door car with a fixed roof.

Since 2005, several models with four doors have been marketed as &quot;four-door coupés&quot;, however, reactions are mixed about whether these models are actually sedans instead of coupés. According to Edmunds, an American automotive guide, &quot;the four-door coupe category doesn&#x27;t really exist.&quot;

== Variations ==

===Berlinetta===

A &quot;berlinetta&quot; is a lightweight sporty two-door car, typically with two seats but also including 2+2 cars.

===Club coupe===
A club coupe is a two-door car with a larger rear-seat passenger area, compared with the smaller rear-seat area in a 2+2 body style. Thus, club coupes resemble coupes as both have two doors, but feature a full-width rear seat that is accessible by tilting forward the backs of the front seats.

===Hardtop coupé===
A hardtop coupe is a two-door car that lacks a structural pillar (&quot;B&quot; pillar) between the front and rear side windows. When these windows are lowered, the effect is like that of a convertible coupé with the windows down. The hardtop body style was popular in the United States from the early 1950s until the 2000s. It was also available in European and Japanese markets. Safety regulations for roof structures to protect passengers in a rollover were proposed, limiting the development of new models. The hardtop body style went out of style with consumers while the automakers focused on cost reduction and increasing efficiencies.

===Combi coupé===
Saab used the term &quot;combi coupé&quot; for a car body similar to the liftback.
===Business coupe===
A two-door car with no rear seat or with a removable rear seat intended for traveling salespeople and other vendors carrying their wares with them. American manufacturers developed this style of coupe in the late 1930s.

===Four-door coupe / quad coupe ===

The 1921 and 1922 LaFayette models were available in a variety of open and closed body styles that included a close-coupled version featuring two center-opening doors on each side that was marketed as a Four-Door Coupe. The 1927 Nash Advanced Six was available in four-door coupe body style.

More recently, the description has been applied by marketers to describe four-door cars with a coupe-like roofline at the rear. The low-roof design reduces back-seat passenger access and headroom. The designation was used for the low-roof model of the 1962–1973 Rover P5, followed by the 1992–1996 Nissan Leopard / Infiniti J30. Recent examples include the 2005 Mercedes-Benz CLS, 2010 Audi A7, Volkswagen CC, Volkswagen Arteon, and 2012 BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe.

Similarly, several cars with one or two small rear doors for rear seat passenger egress and no B-pillar have been marketed as &quot;quad coupes&quot;. For example, the 2003 Saturn Ion, the 2003 Mazda RX-8, and the 2011-2022 Hyundai Veloster.

===Three-door coupe===
Particularly popular in Europe, many cars are designed with coupe styling, but a three-door hatchback/liftback layout to improve practicality, including cars such as the Jaguar E-Type, Mitsubishi 3000GT, Datsun 240Z, Toyota Supra, Mazda RX-7, Alfa Romeo Brera, Ford/Mercury Cougar and Volkswagen Scirocco.

===Opera coupe===
A two-door car designed for driving to the opera with easy access to the rear seats. Features sometimes included a folding front seat next to the driver or a compartment to store top hats.

Often they would have solid rear-quarter panels, with small, circular windows, to enable the occupants to see out without being seen. These opera windows were revived on many U.S. automobiles during the 1970s and early 1980s.

=== Three-window coupe===
The three-window coupe (commonly just &quot;three-window&quot;) is a style of automobile characterized by two side windows and a backlight (rear window). The front windscreens are not counted. The three-window coupe has a distinct difference from the five-window coupe, which has an additional window on each side behind the front doors. These two-door cars typically have small-sized bodies with only a front seat and an occasional small rear seat.

The style was popular from the 1920s until the beginning of World War II. While many manufacturers produced three-window coupes, the 1932 Ford coupe is often considered the classic hot rod.

=== Coupe SUV ===
Some SUVs or crossovers with sloping rear rooflines are marketed as &quot;coupe crossover SUVs&quot; or &quot;coupe SUVs&quot;, even though they have four side doors for passenger egress to the seats and rear hatches for cargo area access however only a car with 2 doors and no B style are considered a true coupe.

== Positioning in model range ==

In the United States, some coupes are &quot;simply line-extenders two-door variants of family sedans&quot;, while others have significant differences from their four-door counterparts.

The AMC Matador coupe (1974–1978) has a shorter wheelbase with a distinct aerodynamic design and fastback styling, sharing almost nothing with the conventional three-box design and more &quot;conservative&quot; four-door versions.

Similarly, the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus coupes and sedans (late-1990 through 2000s), have little in common except their names. The coupes were engineered by Mitsubishi and built in Illinois, while the sedans were developed by Chrysler and built in Michigan. Some coupes may share platforms with contemporary sedans.

Coupes may also exist as model lines in their own right, either closely related to other models, but named differently – such as the Alfa Romeo GT or Infiniti Q60 – or have little engineering in common with other vehicles from the manufacturer – such as the Toyota GT86.

<doc id="204659" wikidata="Q310076" url="?curid=204659" title="Ulpian">
<text>Ulpian (; ; 223 or 228) was a Roman jurist born in Tyre in Roman Syria (modern Lebanon). He moved to Rome and rose to become considered one of the great legal authorities of his time. He was one of the five jurists upon whom decisions were to be based according to the Law of Citations of Valentinian III, and supplied the Justinian &quot;Digest&quot; about a third of its contents.

==Biography==

The exact time and place of his birth are unknown. The period of his literary activity in which we are interested was between AD 211 and 222. He made his first appearance in public life as assessor in the auditorium of Papinian and member of the council of Septimius Severus; under Caracalla he was master of the requests (&quot;magister libellorum&quot;). Elagabalus (also known as Heliogabalus) banished him from Rome, but on the accession of Severus Alexander (222) he was reinstated, and finally became the emperor&#x27;s chief adviser and &quot;Praefectus Praetorio&quot;.

During the Severan dynasty, the position of Praetorian prefect in Italy came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as Papinian, who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under Severus Alexander the Praetorian prefecture was held by Ulpian until his assassination by the Guard in the presence of the Emperor himself.

His curtailment of the privileges granted to the Praetorian Guard by Elagabalus provoked their enmity, and he narrowly escaped their vengeance; ultimately, he was murdered in the palace by the Guard, possibly in the course of a riot between the soldiers and the mob.

He had a luxurious villa at Santa Marinella on the coast north of Rome.

==Works==
His works include &quot;Ad Sabinum&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;ius civile&quot;, in over 50 books; &quot;Ad edictum&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Edict&quot;, in 83 books; collections of opinions, responses and disputations; books of rules and institutions; treatises on the functions of the different magistrates — one of them, the &quot;De officio proconsulis libri x.&quot;, being a comprehensive exposition of the criminal law; monographs on various statutes, on testamentary trusts, and a variety of other works. His writings altogether have supplied to Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Digest&quot; about a third of its contents, and his commentary on the &quot;Edict&quot; alone about a fifth. As an author, he is characterized by doctrinal exposition of a high order, judiciousness of criticism, and lucidity of arrangement, style, and language. He is also credited with the first life table ever.

&quot;Domitii Ulpiani fragmenta&quot;, consisting of 29 titles, were first edited by Tilius (Paris, 1549). Other editions are by Hugo (Berlin, 1834), Booking (Bonn, 1836), containing fragments of the first book of the &quot;Institutiones&quot; discovered by Endlicher at Vienna in 1835, and in Girard&#x27;s &quot;Textes de droit romain&quot; (Paris, 1890).

==Legacy==
In the study of law, Ulpian may be best remembered for the phrase &quot;&quot;Juris praecepta sunt haec: honeste vivere, alterum non laedere, suum cuique tribuere&quot; (The basic principles of law are: to live honorably, not to harm any other person, to render each his own)&quot;.

It had been assumed for a long time that Ulpian of Tyre was a model for Athenaeus&#x27; Ulpian in &quot;The Deipnosophists&quot; — or &quot;The Banquet of the Learned&quot;. Athenaeus makes &#x27;Ulpian&#x27; out to be a grammarian and philologist, characterised by his customary interjections: &quot;Where does this word occur in writing?&quot;. He is represented as a and he occupies a couch alone; his death is passed over in silence in Book XV 686c. Scholars today agree that Athenaeus&#x27;s Ulpian is not the historical Ulpian, but possibly his father.

A potential date of the real Ulpian&#x27;s death, 228 AD, has been wrongly used to estimate the date of completion of &quot;The Deipnosophists&quot;. However the year of his death cannot be determined with certainty. Robert Lee Cleve makes a compelling case that Ulpian died in 223, citing a papyrus discovered in 1966.

<doc id="204664" wikidata="Q433800" url="?curid=204664" title="Jim Thompson (writer)">
<text>James Myers Thompson (September 27, 1906 – April 7, 1977) was an American novelist and screenwriter, known for his hardboiled crime fiction.

Thompson wrote more than thirty novels, the majority of which were original paperback publications, published from the late-1940s through mid-1950s. Despite some positive critical notice—notably by Anthony Boucher in &quot;The New York Times&quot;—he was little-recognized in his lifetime. Only after death did Thompson&#x27;s literary stature grow. In the late 1980s, several of his novels were re-published in the &quot;Black Lizard&quot; series of re-discovered crime fiction.

His best-regarded works include &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;, &quot;Savage Night&quot;, &quot;A Hell of a Woman&quot; and &quot;Pop. 1280.&quot; In these works, Thompson turned the derided crime genre into literature and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and the quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson&#x27;s books were adapted as popular films, including &quot;The Getaway&quot; and &quot;The Grifters&quot;.

The writer R.V. Cassill has suggested that of all crime fiction, Thompson&#x27;s was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither Dashiell Hammett nor Raymond Chandler nor Horace McCoy ever &quot;wrote a book within miles of Thompson&quot;. Similarly, in the introduction to &quot;Now and on Earth&quot;, Stephen King says he most admires Thompson&#x27;s work because &quot;The guy was over the top. &quot;The guy was absolutely over the top.&quot; Big Jim didn&#x27;t know the meaning of the word stop. There are three brave &#x27;lets&#x27; inherent in the foregoing: He let himself see everything, he let himself write it down, then he let himself publish it.&quot;

Thompson was called a &quot;Dimestore Dostoevsky&quot; by writer Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien. Film director Stephen Frears, who directed an adaptation of Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Grifters&quot; in 1990, also identified elements of Greek tragedy in his themes.

==Life and career==
Thompson&#x27;s life was nearly as colorful as his fiction. His novels were considered semi-autobiographical, or, at least, inspired by his experiences. (The theme of a once-prominent family overtaken by ill-fortune was featured in some of Thompson&#x27;s works.)

Thompson&#x27;s father, known as &quot;Big Jim&quot; Thompson, was a teacher for a decade in Burwell, Nebraska before his son&#x27;s birth; his wife and Jim&#x27;s mother, Birdie Myers, was a former student. He moved the family to Anadarko, Oklahoma Territory, and was elected sheriff of Caddo County. He ran for the state legislature in 1906, but was defeated. Jim Thompson was born in 1906 in an apartment over the county jail. In 1907, Big Jim was accused of embezzlement and fled to Mexico on horseback. The rest of the family moved back to Birdie&#x27;s family farm in Burwell. In 1910, they reunited in Oklahoma City, and eventually moved again to Fort Worth, Texas, where Big Jim worked in the oil industry, making and losing a fortune.

Thompson&#x27;s father would inspire several characters in his later fiction, including Lou Ford of &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s complicated feelings toward his father were expressed in his writing; biographer Robert Polito noted that the books which expressly name and chronicle Thompson&#x27;s father, &quot;Bad Boy&quot; and &quot;King Blood&quot;, were &quot;respectful to the point of idolatry,&quot; whereas &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; and &quot;Pop. 1280&quot; &quot;roil with Oedipal anger&quot; and ridicule him as a psychopathic killer.

===Early work===
Thompson began writing early, and he published a few short pieces while still in his mid-teens. He was intelligent and well-read, but had little interest in or inclination towards formal education. For about two years during prohibition in Fort Worth, Texas, Thompson worked long and often wild nights as a bellboy while attending school in the day. He worked at the Hotel Texas. One biographical profile reports that &quot;Thompson quickly adapted to the needs of the hotel&#x27;s guests, busily catering to tastes ranging from questionable morality to directly and undeniably illegal.&quot; Bootleg liquor was ubiquitous, and Thompson&#x27;s brief trips to procure heroin and marijuana for hotel patrons were not uncommon. He was soon earning up to $300 per week more than his official $15 monthly wage.

He smoked and drank heavily, and at 19, he suffered a nervous breakdown. In 1926, Thompson began working as an oilfield laborer. In the oil fields, he met Harry McClintock, a musician, as well as a member and organizer for Industrial Workers of the World, who recruited him into the union. With his father he began an independent oil drilling operation that was ultimately unsuccessful. Thompson returned to Fort Worth, intending to attend school and to write professionally.

Thompson&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Oil Field Vignettes&quot; was published in 1929 (found in March 2010 by history recovery specialist Lee Roy Chapman). He began attending the University of Nebraska the same year as part of a program for gifted students with &quot;untraditional educational backgrounds.&quot; By 1931, however, he dropped out of school.

For several years, Thompson occasionally wrote short stories for various true crime magazines. Generally, he wrote about murder cases about which he had read in newspapers, but using a first person voice. In this era, he wrote other pieces for various newspapers and magazines, usually as a freelancer, but occasionally as a full-time staff writer. His 1936 &quot;Ditch of Doom,&quot; published in &quot;Master Detective&quot; magazine, was selected by the Library of America in the early 21st century for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American writing for true crime.

In the early 1930s, Thompson worked as the head of the Oklahoma Federal Writers Project, one of several New Deal programs intended to provide work for Americans during the Great Depression. Louis L&#x27;Amour, among others, worked under Thompson&#x27;s direction in this project. Thompson joined the Communist Party in 1935 but left the group by 1938.

===First novels===
In the early stages of World War II, Thompson worked at an aircraft factory. He was investigated by the FBI because of his early Communist Party affiliation. These events were fodder for his semi-autobiographical debut novel &quot;Now and on Earth&quot; (1942). It established his bleak, pessimistic tone, and it was positively reviewed but sold poorly. It featured little of the violence and crime that later permeated his writing. In his second novel &quot;Heed the Thunder&quot; (1946), Thompson centered it on crime. It explores a warped and violent Nebraska family, partly modeled on his own extended clan.

Gaining little attention, Thompson gravitated to the less-prestigious but more lucrative crime fiction genre with &quot;Nothing More Than Murder.&quot; He afterwards moved to Lion Books, a small paperback publisher. Lion&#x27;s Arnold Hano was his ideal editor, offering the writer essentially free rein about content, yet expecting him to be productive and reliable. Lion published most of Thompson&#x27;s best-regarded works.

To support his family while writing novels, Thompson took a job as a reporter with the &quot;Los Angeles Mirror&quot;, a tabloid newspaper owned by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, shortly after the &quot;Mirror&quot; was founded in 1948. He wrote for the &quot;Mirror&quot; until 1949.

===Fifties maturity and &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;===

In 1952, Thompson published &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;. The narrator, Lou Ford, is a small-town deputy sheriff who appears amiable, pleasant and slightly dull-minded. Ford is actually very intelligent and fighting a nearly-constant urge to act violently; Ford describes his urge as &quot;the sickness&quot; (always italicised). Lion Books tried to have &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; nominated for a National Book Award. It was eponymously adapted for the cinema in 1976 (by director Burt Kennedy, with Stacy Keach as Lou Ford) and again in 2010 (by director Michael Winterbottom, with Casey Affleck as Ford and co-starring Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba). After &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; was published, Thompson began producing novels at a furious pace. He published another novel in 1952, then five novels a year in 1953 and 1954.

&quot;Savage Night,&quot; published in 1953, is generally ranked as one of his best novels. It is also one of his oddest literary offerings. Its narrator, Charlie &quot;Little&quot; Bigger (also known as Carl Bigelow), is a small, tubercular hitman whose mind is deteriorating with his body. In reviewing &quot;Savage Night&quot;, Boucher said it was &quot;written with vigor and bite, but sheering off from realism into a peculiar surrealist ending of sheer Guignol horror. Odd that a mass-consumption paperback should contain the most experimental writing I&#x27;ve seen in a suspense novel of late&quot;. &quot;Savage Night&quot; contains an interlude—whether or not it is fantasy or dream, hallucination or flashback is unclear—when Bigger meets a poor, verbose writer who, much like Thompson, has a penchant for booze and makes a living writing pulp fiction to be sold alongside pornography. The writer also claims to operate a &quot;farm&quot; where he grows vaginas as a metaphor for the material he writes.

===Film work with Stanley Kubrick===
In 1955, Thompson moved to Hollywood, California, where Stanley Kubrick commissioned him to write the screenplay adaptation of Lionel White&#x27;s novel &quot;Clean Break&quot;. This was filmed as &quot;The Killing&quot;, Kubrick&#x27;s first studio-financed movie. Thompson wrote most of the script, but Kubrick credited himself as screenplay writer, giving Thompson only a &quot;dialogue&quot; writer credit. They collaborated again on &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (with Calder Willingham) and in the criminal story titled &quot;Lunatic at Large&quot; that never materialized despite Thompson&#x27;s having completed and submitted the screen treatment. Although pleased with the work, Kubrick was side-tracked by &quot;Spartacus&quot;; when Kubrick returned to &quot;Lunatic at Large&quot;, the sole copy of Thompson&#x27;s manuscript had been lost. Kubrick was quoted by family and friends as regretting the lost opportunity.

Although films would later be made based on Thompson&#x27;s novels, &quot;The Killing&quot; and &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; would be the only produced films on which Thompson received on-screen writing credit for either dialogue or screenplay.

===Later novels, television work and novelizations===
After his film work, Thompson remained a resident of California for the rest of his life. From the mid-1950s through the late 1960s, Thompson continued to write fiction, although not at the same torrid pace of 1952 to 1954. During this era, Thompson usually completed one novel a year, but he gradually drifted away from writing his increasingly unpopular novels, abandoning the medium completely by the end of the 1960s. In 1967, he published &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, about a young migrant laborer working on an oil pipeline in Texas.

With his novels providing scant income, Thompson turned to other forms of writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Raiders&quot; (1959), &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot; (1961) and &quot;Convoy&quot; (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson&#x27;s tie-ins include an original novel based on the television series &quot;Ironside&quot; (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films &quot;The Undefeated&quot; (1969) and &quot;Nothing But a Man&quot; (1970).

In the late 1960s, Thompson wrote his two final original books, &quot;King Blood&quot; and &quot;Child of Rage&quot; (its provisional title was &quot;White Mother, Black Son&quot;), neither of which were published until the early 1970s, the latter in the UK.

===Later life and death===
In 1970, Thompson was flown to Robert Redford&#x27;s Utah residence. Redford hired him to write a motion picture script about the life of a hobo during the Great Depression. Thompson was paid $10,000 for his script &quot;Bo&quot;, though it never was produced.

Motion picture writer/director Sam Fuller expressed an interest in adapting &quot;The Getaway&quot; for the screen, and Thompson&#x27;s biographer Robert Polito, in the biography &quot;Savage Art&quot;, notes that Fuller so admired the novel that he quipped, half-seriously, that he could use the novel as a shooting script. Eventually, Sam Peckinpah was slated to direct &quot;The Getaway.&quot;

In many regards, &quot;The Getaway&quot; was a frustrating repeat of his earlier experience collaborating with director Stanley Kubrick on the screenplay of the 1956 film &quot;The Killing&quot;. Thompson wrote a script, but Steve McQueen (who was cast in the movie&#x27;s lead role of Doc McCoy) rejected it as too reliant on dialogue, with not enough action. Though Walter Hill was given the sole script credit, Thompson insisted that much of his script ended up in the film. Thompson sought Writers Guild arbitration but the Guild ultimately ruled against him. In the end, the film was heavily bowdlerized from Thompson&#x27;s original vision and as Stephen King writes, &quot;if you have seen only the film version of &quot;The Getaway&quot;, you have no idea of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where Sam Peckinpah ended the story.&quot;

Thompson actually appeared in the 1975 movie &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum. He played the character Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle. When Thompson&#x27;s fortunes were fading, he made the acquaintance of writer Harlan Ellison who had long admired Thompson&#x27;s books. Though Thompson still drank heavily (preferring to meet at the famed writer&#x27;s haunt, the Musso &amp; Frank Grill) and Ellison was a teetotaler (preferring fast food restaurants), they often met for meals and conversation.

Though Thompson&#x27;s books were falling out of print in the United States, the French had discovered his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep a trickle of royalties flowing towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson&#x27;s pay, he notes, was roughly in line with what writers of similar works received during that era.

Thompson died in Los Angeles, aged 70, after a series of strokes aggravated by his long-term alcoholism. He refused to eat for some time before his death, and this self-inflicted starvation contributed greatly to his demise. At the time of his death, none of his novels were in print in his home country.

Thompson&#x27;s papers from 1955-1958, including typescripts and original drafts of about a dozen novels, are archived at UCLA&#x27;s Charles E. Young Research Library.

==Style==
Thompson&#x27;s stories are about grifters, losers, sociopaths and psychopaths—some at the fringe of society, some at its heart—their nihilistic world-view being best-served by first-person narratives revealing a frighteningly deep understanding of the warped mind. There are few good guys in Thompson&#x27;s literature: most of his characters are abusive or simply biding time until an opportunity presents itself, though many also have decent impulses.

Despite some positive critical notice, only after his best years as a writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame. Yet that neglect might stem from his style: the crime novels are fast-moving and compelling but sometimes sloppy and uneven. Thompson wrote quickly (many novels were written in a month); using his newspaper experience to write concise, evocative prose with little editing.

Yet at his best his novels were among the most effectively and memorably written genre pieces. He also managed unusual and highly successful literary tricks: halfway through &quot;A Hell of a Woman&quot;, the first-person narrator Frank &quot;Dolly&quot; Dillon has a mental breakdown; the sides of his personality then take turns narrating the chapters, alternately violently psychotic (telling the sordid tale that happened) or sweet-natured and patient (telling the idealized fantasy that did not happen). In the final page of the original manuscript the two sides of Dillon&#x27;s broken personality appear together as two columns of text. The publisher disliked that and instead alternated the two narrations in a long paragraph, alternating standard Roman type and italicized type. Thompson disliked the change, thinking it confusing and difficult for the reader.

For most of his life Thompson drank heavily; the effects of alcoholism often featured in his works, most prominently in &quot;The Alcoholics&quot; (1953) which is set in a detoxification clinic. Donald E. Westlake, who adapted &quot;The Grifters&quot; for the screen, observed that alcoholism had a great role in Thompson&#x27;s literature, but it tended to be tacit and subtle. Westlake described typical personal relationships in Thompson novels as pleasant in the morning, argumentative in the afternoon and abusive at night—behavior common to the alcoholic Thompson&#x27;s style of life but which he elided from the stories.

==Film adaptations==
Two of Thompson&#x27;s books (&quot;The Getaway&quot; and &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;) were adapted as Hollywood motion pictures during his lifetime receiving relatively poor reviews. However, Polito argues that neither adaptation was ultimately true to Thompson&#x27;s spirit. A second, more faithful adaptation of &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; was released in 2010, starring Casey Affleck and directed by Michael Winterbottom.

French director Bertrand Tavernier adapted &quot;Pop. 1280&quot; for his 1981 film &quot;Coup de Torchon&quot;, changing the setting from the American South to a French colony in West Africa of the 1930s. Aside from shift in setting, Polito argues that &quot;Coup de Torchon&quot; was remarkably faithful to the plot and the spirit of the novel, and—along with the 1990 film &quot;The Grifters&quot;—remains arguably the most authentic adaptation of any of Thompson&#x27;s work.

&quot;A Hell of a Woman&quot; was adapted in French as &quot;Série noire&quot; (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogue by French Oulipo writer Georges Pérec. This noir masterpiece set in the grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant&#x27;s debut performance as well as what is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere&#x27;s finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.

In the early 1990s, Hollywood resumed its interest in Thompson&#x27;s writing and several of his novels were re-published. Three novels were adapted for new film treatments during that period: &quot;The Kill-Off&quot;; &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot;; and &quot;The Grifters&quot;, which garnered four Academy Award nominations.

&quot;The Getaway&quot; was remade in 1994 with Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger in the lead roles; the film retained the happy ending of the earlier film and received comparably poor reviews.

In 1996, &quot;A Swell-Looking Babe&quot; was released as &quot;Hit Me,&quot; and 1997 saw the release of &quot;This World, Then the Fireworks&quot; from Thompson&#x27;s short story of that name. The latter film starred Billy Zane and Gina Gershon as a pair of twisted siblings.

<text>Gustav Hugo (23 November 1764 – 15 September 1844) was a German jurist.

==Biography==
Hugo was born at Lörrach in Baden. From the gymnasium at Karlsruhe he passed in 1782 to the University of Göttingen, where he studied law for three years. Having received the appointment of tutor to the prince of Anhalt-Dessau, he took his doctor&#x27;s degree at the University of Halle in 1788. Recalled in the same year to Göttingen as extraordinary professor of law, he became a full professor in 1792. In the preface to his &quot;Beiträge zur civilistischen Bucherkenntniss der letzten vierzig Jahre&quot; (1828–1829) he gives a sketch of the condition of the civil law teaching at Göttingen at that time.

The Roman and German elements of the existing law were, without criticism or differentiation, welded into an ostensible whole for practical needs, with the result that it was difficult to say whether historical truth or practical ends were most prejudiced. As it was passed from person to person, new errors crept in, and even the best of teachers could not escape from the false method which had become traditional. These were the evils which Hugo set himself to combat, and he became the founder of the German Historical School of jurisprudence which was continued and further developed by Savigny. His magna opera are the &quot;Lehrbuch eines civilistischen Cursus&quot; (7 vols., 1792–1821), in which his method is thoroughly worked out, and &quot;Civilistisches Magazin&quot; (6 vols., 1790–1837).

Hugo was criticized, and ridiculed, by Karl Marx in the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; as a founder of the historical school and for justifying the &quot;law of arbitrary power&quot;, among other things.

<doc id="204668" wikidata="Q833475" url="?curid=204668" title="Middle Way">
<text>The Middle Way (; ) as well as &quot;teaching the Dharma by the middle&quot; (&quot;majjhena dhammaṃ deseti&quot;) are common Buddhist terms used to refer to two major aspects of the Dharma, that is, the teaching of the Buddha. The first phrasing, the Middle Way, refers to a spiritual practice that steers clear of both extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence. This spiritual path is defined as the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to awakening. The second formulation, &quot;teaching the Dharma by the middle,&quot; refers to how the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma (Teaching) approaches ontological issues of existence and personal identity by avoiding eternalism (or absolutism) and annihilationism (or nihilism).

== Early Buddhist texts ==
In the early Buddhist texts, there are two aspects of the Middle Way taught by the Buddha. Scholar David Kalupahana describes these as the &quot;philosophical&quot; Middle Way and the &quot;practical&quot; Middle Way. He associates these with the teachings found in the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot; and the &quot;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&quot; respectively.

=== The Middle Way (&quot;majjhimāpaṭipadā&quot;) ===
In the Early Buddhist Texts, the term &quot;Middle Path&quot; () was used in the &quot;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&quot; (SN 56.11, and its numerous parallel texts), which the Buddhist tradition regards to be the first teaching that the Buddha delivered after his awakening. In this sutta, the Buddha describes the Noble Eightfold Path as the Middle Way which steers clear of the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification:

A similar passage occurs in other suttas such as &quot;Araṇavibhaṅgasutta&quot; (MN 139) with a Chinese parallel at MA 169 as well as in MN 3 (Chinese parallels at MA 88 and EA 18.3).

Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst concludes that the first extreme mentioned here &quot;indulgence in desirable sense objects&quot; does not refer to a specific religious movement or practice, but to the actions of common people. However, the other extreme does presuppose ascetics who used &quot;devotion to self-mortification&quot; to reach a religious goal.

The Buddhist texts depict (and criticize) Jain ascetics as those who practice extreme self-mortification (Bronkhorst cites MN 14). Early Buddhist sources (such as MN 36) also depict the Buddha practicing those ascetic practices before his awakening and how the Buddha abandoned them because they are not efficacious. Some of these extreme practices include a &quot;meditation without breathing&quot;, and extreme fasting which leads to emaciation as well as the total suppression of bodily movement while standing and refusing to lie down. According to the scriptural account, when the Buddha delivered the &quot;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&quot;, he was addressing five ascetics with whom he had previously practiced severe ascetic practices.

As noted by Y. Karunadasa, this middle path &quot;does not mean moderation or a compromise between the two extremes&quot; rather, it means as the sutta states &quot;without entering either of the two extremes&quot; (&quot;ubho ante anupagamma&quot;).

A sutta from the Anguttara Nikaya (AN 3.156–162) also discusses the middle path as well as two other &quot;paths&quot;, the addicted practice and the scorching path, referring to the two extremes. The addicted path is described as when someone thinks that there is nothing wrong with sensual pleasures &quot;so they throw themselves into sensual pleasures.&quot; Meanwhile, the scorching path includes numerous &quot;ways of mortifying and tormenting the body&quot; including going naked, restricting their food intake in various ways, wearing various kinds of rough clothing, &quot;they tear out their hair and beard,&quot; &quot;they constantly stand, refusing seats,&quot; they maintain the squatting posture, and &quot;they lie on a mat of thorns&quot;. The middle path meanwhile is described by listing the thirty seven aids to awakening.

=== Teaching by the Middle (&quot;majjhena desanā&quot;) ===

Other early sources like the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot; also state that &quot;the Tathagatha teaches &quot;by the middle way&quot;&quot; (&quot;majjhena tathāgato dhammaṃ deseti&quot;) which often refers to the doctrine of dependent origination as a view between the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism as well as the extremes of existence and non-existence. Gethin 78

According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, there are two extreme metaphysical views that are avoided through the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;teaching by the middle&quot; (&quot;majjhena dhammaṃ&quot;):

* Eternalism (&quot;sassatavāda&quot;), this refers to the view that there is &quot;an indestructible and eternal self, whether individual or universal&quot;. It can also refer to the idea that the world is maintained by a permanent being or entity, like God or some other eternal metaphysical Absolute. The main problem with this view is that it leads to grasping at the five aggregates, which are impermanent and empty of a self.
* Annihilationism (&quot;ucchedavāda&quot;), is the idea that a person is utterly annihilated at death and there is nothing which survives. The main problem with this view is that it leads to nihilism, particularly ethical nihilism.

According to Bodhi, by steering clear of both of these extremes, dependent origination teaches that &quot;existence is constituted by a current of conditioned phenomena devoid of a metaphysical self yet continuing on from birth to birth as long as the causes that sustain it remain effective.&quot;

One of the most famous and clear expositions of dependent origination is found in the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot; (SN 12.15 with Chinese Agama parallels at SA 262 and SA 301 and also a Sanskrit parallel &quot;Kātyāyanaḥsūtra&quot;) explains the middle way view as follows:Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence. But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won&#x27;t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won&#x27;t have the notion of existence regarding the world. The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting. But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don&#x27;t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion &#x27;my self&#x27;, you&#x27;ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others. This is how right view is defined. &#x27;All exists&#x27;: this is one extreme. &#x27;All doesn&#x27;t exist&#x27;: this is the second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: &#x27;Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. … [the rest of the 12 elements of dependent origination follow]

A similar passage is also found in SN 12.47. According to David Kalupahana, the terms &quot;existence&quot; (atthitā) and &quot;non-existence&quot; (natthitā) are referring to two absolutist theories (which were common in Indian philosophy at the time): the doctrine of permanent existence found in the Upanishads and the doctrine of non-existence (at death) of the materialist Carvaka school.

==== Dependent origination and personal identity ====
&quot;Dependent origination&quot; (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;) describes the existence of phenomena as coming about due to various causes and conditions. When one of these causes changes or disappears, the resulting object or phenomena will also change or disappear, as will the objects or phenomena depending on the changing object or phenomena. Thus, there is nothing with an eternal self, essence or atman, there are only mutually dependent origination and existence (hence, the middle doctrine avoids an eternal substance or being). However, the absence of an atman does not mean there is nothing at all (hence, the middle doctrine avoids nihilism). Therefore, according to Rupert Gethin, the &quot;middle&quot; doctrine of early Buddhism, when applied to the question of personal identity is closely connected with the Buddhist understanding of causality and with the doctrine of not-self (&quot;anatta&quot;). 143

The connection between dependent origination and personal identity is explored in SN 12.35. In this sutta, a monk asks the Buddha the following question regarding the 12 links of dependent origination: &quot;what now is aging-and-death, and for whom is there this aging-and-death?&quot; The Buddha responds:&quot;Not a valid question,&quot; the Blessed One replied. &quot;Bhikkhu, whether one says, &#x27;What now is aging-and-death, and for whom is there this aging-and-death?&#x27; or whether one says, &#x27;Aging-and-death is one thing, the one for whom there is this aging-and-death is another&#x27;—both these assertions are identical in meaning; they differ only in the phrasing. If there is the view, &#x27;The soul and the body are the same,&#x27; there is no living of the holy life; and if there is the view, &#x27;The soul is one thing, the body is another,&#x27; there is no living of the holy life. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: &#x27;With birth as condition, aging-and-death.&#x27;&quot;Another passage which discusses personal identity with regard to the middle teaching is found in the &quot;Aññatarabrāhmaṇasutta&quot; (SN 12.46, with a Chinese parallel at SA 300). This sutta outlines two further extreme views with regards to personal identity and karma:

* &quot;&#x27;The person who does the deed experiences the result&#x27;: this is one extreme.&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;One person does the deed and another experiences the result&#x27;: this is the second extreme.

The &quot;Timbarukasutta&quot; outlines a similar set of two extremes regarding personality:&quot;Suppose that the feeling and the one who feels it are the same thing. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, pleasure and pain is made by oneself. I don&#x27;t say this. Suppose that the feeling is one thing and the one who feels it is another. Then for one stricken by feeling, pleasure and pain is made by another. I don&#x27;t say this. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: &#x27;Ignorance is a condition for choices. The discourse then states that the Buddha teaches by the middle and outlines the twelve elements of dependent origination.

Gethin states that for early Buddhism, personal continuity is explained through the particular way that the various phenomena which make up a sentient being are causally connected.143 According to Gethin, this middle teaching &quot;sees a &#x27;person&#x27; as subsisting in the causal connectedness of dependent arising&quot;. Therefore, thinking that there is something unchanging and constant in a person is eternalistic, while thinking that there is no real connection between the same person at different points in time is annihilationist. As Gethin writes: 
In other words, if we deny that there is a real connectedness between events this is annihilationism, but if we understand that connectedness in terms of an unchanging self this is eternalism; the middle way is that there is only the connectedness, there is only dependent arising.

&quot;Dependent origination&quot; also gives a rationale for rebirth:
== Theravāda Buddhism ==
In the Theravāda Buddhist tradition, the usage of the term &quot;Middle Way&quot; is discussed in 5th-century CE Pali commentaries. The Pali commentary to the Samyutta Nikaya (SN) states:
Regarding the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta,&quot; the SN commentary glosses the key statements as follows: 

&quot;The origin of the world&quot;: the production of the world of formations. &quot;There is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world&quot;: there does not occur in him the annihilationist view that might arise in regard to phenomena produced and made manifest in the world of formations, holding &quot;They do not exist.&quot; &quot;The cessation of the world&quot;: the dissolution (&quot;bhanga&quot;) of formations. &quot;There is no notion of existence in regard to the world&quot;: There does not occur in him the eternalist view which might arise in regard to phenomena produced and made manifest in the world of formations, holding &quot;They exist.&quot; Further, &quot;the origin of the world&quot; is direct-order conditionality (&quot;anuloma-paccayākāra&quot;); &quot;the cessation of the world,&quot; reverse-order conditionality (&quot;patiloma-paccayākāra&quot;).

The Pali sub-commentary to the SN states:The notion of existence is eternalism because it maintains that the entire world (of personal existence) exists forever. The notion of nonexistence is annihilationism because it maintains that the entire world does not exist (forever) but is cut off.The influential Theravāda doctrinal compendium called the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; states:

The metaphysical import of the &quot;middle teaching&quot; is interpreted in different ways by modern Theravada Buddhists.

Bhikkhu Bodhi comments on the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot; as follows: In view of these explanations it would be misleading to translate the two terms, atthita and natthita, simply as &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;nonexistence&quot; and then to maintain (as is sometimes done) that the Buddha rejects all ontological notions as inherently invalid. The Buddha&#x27;s utterances at [SN] 22:94, for example, show that he did not hesitate to make pronouncements with a clear ontological import when they were called for. In the present passage atthita and natthita are abstract nouns formed from the verbs atthi and natthi. It is thus the metaphysical assumptions implicit in such abstractions that are at fault, not the ascriptions of existence and nonexistence themselves...While atthita is the notion of existence in the abstract, bhava is concrete individual existence in one or another of the three realms. Bodhi also argues that what the noble disciple does see when reflecting on his personality with wisdom is &quot;a mere assemblage of conditioned phenomena arising and passing away through the conditioning process governed by dependent origination.&quot;

Regarding the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta,&quot; Thanissaro Bhikkhu writes:this sutta is describing the state of mind of a person focusing on the origination or cessation of the data of the senses. A person in that state of mind would see nothing in that mode of perception that would give rise to thoughts of existence or non-existence with regard to those sense data. However, when people are engaging in discussions about things that do or do not appear in the world—as the Buddha is describing in SN 22:94—then the terms &quot;exist&quot; and &quot;do not exist&quot; would naturally occur to them. In other words, this sutta and SN 22:94 are not making different claims about the ontological status of the world. They are simply describing the types of concepts that do or don&#x27;t occur to the mind when regarding the world in different ways.Similarly, according to Ajahns Amaro and Pasanno, the &quot;Kaccānagotta-sutta&quot; &quot;more describes a method of meditation practice than merely another philosophical position&quot;. The Ajahns further state that:The advice given in the last passage closely matches the practice of vipassana (insight) meditation: this consists of, firstly, the calm and attentive observation of the arising of all patterns of experience. Secondly, it involves the seeing of all such patterns through the reflective lens of anicca-dukkha-anatta (impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self). Lastly, in the culmination of the process, there is the remainderless relinquishment of all experience. There is a complete acceptance of all that arises and no confusion about the fact that all patterns of experience are of the same dependent, insubstantial nature. 

== Mahāyāna ==
In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the &quot;Middle Way&quot; refers to the insight into śūnyatā (&quot;emptiness&quot;) that transcends the extremes of existence and non-existence. This has been interpreted in different ways by the various schools of Mahāyāna philosophy.

=== Madhyamaka ===
The Madhyamaka (&quot;Middle Way&quot;) school defends a &quot;Middle Way&quot; position between the metaphysical view that things exist in some ultimate sense and the view that things do not exist at all.

Madhyamika philosophy, based on the Buddha&#x27;s Perfection of Wisdom Sutras, was set forth by the great Indian master Nagarjuna. He was later followed by great masters such as Aryadeva, Buddhapalita, Bhavaviveka and Chandrakirti.

==== Nagarjuna====
Nagarjuna&#x27;s influential &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; -‘The Fundamental
Wisdom of the Middle Way’ (MMK) famously contains a reference to the &quot;Kaccyanagotta Sutta&quot; in its 15th chapter. This chapter focuses on deconstructing the ideas of existence, non-existence and intrinsic nature, essence, or inherent existence (&quot;svabhāva&quot;) and show how such ideas are incoherent and incompatible with causality and dependent origination.

The MMK states:
4. Further, without intrinsic nature and extrinsic nature how can there be an existent (&quot;bhāva&quot;)? For an existent is established given the existence of either intrinsic nature or extrinsic nature.

5. If the existent is unestablished, then the nonexistent (&quot;abhāva&quot;) too is not established. For people proclaim the nonexistent to be the alteration of the existent.

6. Intrinsic nature and extrinsic nature, existent and nonexistent—who see these do not see the truth of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings.

7. In &quot;The Instructing of Katyāyana&quot; both &quot;it exists&quot; and &quot;it does not exist&quot; are denied by the Blessed One, who clearly perceives the existent and the nonexistent.
MMK further discusses the two extremes as follows:
10. &quot;It exists&quot; is an eternalist view; &quot;It does not exist&quot; is an annihilationist idea. Therefore the wise one should not have recourse to either existence or nonexistence.

11. For whatever exists by its intrinsic nature does not become nonexistent; eternalism then follows. &quot;It does not exist now [but] it existed previously&quot;—from this, annihilation follows.According to Mark Siderits and Shoryu Katsura, for Nagarjuna, the two extremes refer to:the view that things exist having intrinsic nature and the view that the lack of intrinsic nature means that things are utterly unreal. The argument is that the first leads to the conclusion that ultimately real things are eternal, while the second leads to the conclusion that ultimately nothing whatsoever exists. 

====Aryadeva====
Ayradeva was a student of Nagarjuna. His work the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Middle Way’ principally explains the meaning of Nagarjuna&#x27;s work, but also includes refutations of non-Buddhist systems.

====Buddhapalita====
Buddhapālita-Mūlamadhyamakavṛtti, is a commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s Mūlamadhyamakakarikā. He explains Nāgārjuna&#x27;s work by pointing out the necessary but undesired consequences of an opponent&#x27;s thesis, without maintaining any thesis of his own. This approach became later known as Prasangika Madhyamaka.

====Bhāviveka====
Bhāviveka was critical of Buddhapalita&#x27;s approach to Madhyamaka. Inspired by the buddhist logician Dignāga he felt it was necessary to present syllogistic arguments which prove the Madhyamaka view. This later became known as Svatantrika Madhyamaka.

====Chandrakirti====
Chandrakirti defended Buddhaplita&#x27;s position and critiqued Bhāviveka&#x27;s approach. The sixth chapter of Chandrakirti&#x27;s Madhyamakavatara, ‘Entering the Middle Way’ explains the meaning of Nagarjuna&#x27;s work specifically from a Prasangika Madhyamika standpoint.

=== Yogācāra ===
The Yogācāra school examines emptiness through its central teaching of the three basic modes of existence or &quot;three natures&quot; (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). In Yogācāra, the ultimate basis for the erroneous conceptualizations we make about existence (like ideas of a self, etc.) is the &quot;Paratantra-svabhāva&quot;, which is the dependently originated nature of dharmas, or the causal process of the fabrication of things. According to the &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; (2:25) this basis is considered to be an ultimately existing (&quot;paramārtha&quot;) basis. However, this basis is empty since the events in this causal flow do not exist on their own and are dependent phenomena.

In Yogācāra, emptiness is understood mainly as an absence of duality which holds that ultimate reality is beyond all dualities like self and other (or any other concepts like &#x27;physical&#x27; and &#x27;non-physical&#x27;, internal and external). All dualities are an unreal superimposition since ultimately there is only an interconnected causal stream of mental events.

Unlike Madhyamaka, Yogācāra philosophy argues that there is a sense in which consciousness can be said to exist, that is, it exists in a dependent and empty way. Indeed, Madhyamaka philosophers were criticized by Yogācārins like Asanga for being nihilistic (and thus, of having fallen from the middle way). According to Asanga &quot;If nothing is real, there cannot be any ideas (&quot;prajñapti&quot;). Someone who holds this view is a nihilist.&quot; The Yogācāra position is that there is something that exists, the empty and purely mental (&quot;prajñapti-matra&quot;) stream of dependent arising. The &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; argues that it is only logical to speak of emptiness if there is &quot;something&quot; that is empty.

===Svatantrika-Yogachara Madhyamika===
* Śāntarakṣita outlined his Svatantrika-Yogachara Madhyamika view in the Madhyamakālaṃkāra (The Ornament of the Middle Way).
* Kamalaśīla, a student of Sàntaraksita profounds this view in his presentation entitled &#x27;The Stages of Meditation of Madhyamika (uma’i sgom rim)

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===
In Tibetan Buddhism, there are numerous interpretations of Madhyamaka philosophy, all of which represent the intent of the Buddha&#x27;s middle way and the right view outlined by Nagarjuna. Among some of the most influential views are the following:

====Rangtong - Empty of Self====
This philosophy is upheld by the Gelug school.
* The Madhyamaka of Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) argues that emptiness is &quot;an absolute negation&quot; (&quot;med dgag&quot;), which means that everything, including Buddhahood and emptiness itself, is said to be empty. The target of this negation is said to be inherent existence or intrinsic nature. Therefore, in this system, the conventional existence of the world is not negated, only the essentialist superimposition of an intrinsic nature.

====Shentong - &#x27;Empty of other&#x27;====

This philosophy is mainly propounded by non-Gelug Tibetan schools. Key figures who propound this view are: The third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (Karma Kagyu), Longchen Rabjam (Nyingma), Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Jonang), Sakya Chokden (Sakya) and Taranatha (Jonang).

* Dölpopa&#x27;s (1292–1361) held that ultimate reality is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned, but it is not empty of its own true nature. Buddhahood is therefore not held to be totally empty in this system, instead, it is an ultimately real self that is filled with infinite Buddha qualities. This philosophy is very influential among non-Gelug Tibetan schools.
* The Madhyamaka interpretation of Gorampa (1429–1489) has also been very influential among non-Gelug Tibetan orders. Gorampa&#x27;s interpretation is an anti-realist philosophy which sees emptiness as meaning that all phenomena lack the four extremes: existence, nonexistence, both and neither. Therefore, in this interpretation of Madhyamaka, conventional everyday reality is also negated and is seen as unreal, illusory, and ultimately non-existent since they are just conceptual fabrications.

Other important presentations include:
* Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje&#x27;s commentary on Chandrakırti&#x27;s Entering the Middle Way, entitled ‘Chariot of the Dagpo Kagu Siddhas’.
* Ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje&#x27;s commentary entitled ‘Feast for the Fortunate’.
* Pawo Rinpoche Tsuglag Trengwa&#x27;s ‘Exposition of The Entrance to the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Way of Life, the Essence of the Immeasurable, Profound, and Vast Ocean of the Dharma of the Great Vehicle’. The ninth chapter of this text propounds many of Mikyö Dorje&#x27;s explanations on Madhyamaka.

=== East Asian conceptions ===

==== Tendai ====
In the Tendai school, the &quot;Middle Way&quot; refers to the synthesis of the thesis that all things are śūnyatā and the antithesis that all things have phenomenal existence.

==== Chan Buddhism ====
In Chan Buddhism, the Middle Way describes the realization of being free of the one-sidedness of perspective that takes the extremes of any polarity as objective reality. In chapter ten of the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;, Huineng gives instructions for the teaching of the Dharma. Huineng enumerates 36 basic oppositions of consciousness and explains how the Way is free from both extremes:

<text>Moulton is an English bicycle manufacturer based in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. The company was founded in 1962 by Alex Moulton (1920–2012) who had designed the &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; and rubber cone suspension systems for the BMC Mini motorcar. Moulton bicycles are noted for unconventional frame design, small wheels, and front and rear suspension.

A misconception about Moultons is that they fold in the manner of more recent designs by manufacturers such as Brompton, Bickerton or Dahon. This is not true, though the Moulton design paved the way for such designs and various Moultons over the years have been made in separable versions allowing relatively easy dismantling for transportation or storage. Thus although Moultons are often included in the folding bicycle category along with small-wheel folders, small-wheel bicycles would be a more technically correct term covering all such bicycles.

Mass-appeal versions such as the Standard and Deluxe were complemented by Speed versions used in competition.

In August 2008, Alex Moulton announced the creation of a new company called Moulton Bicycle, in collaboration with British bicycle manufacturer Pashley Cycles which had manufactured certain Moulton designs under licence since 1992.

==History==

In the late 1950s, disillusioned with the design of the classic bicycle, Alex Moulton set about creating a new design. He thought the classic diamond frame was inconvenient to mount, difficult to adjust for size and not suitable for both sexes, and that &#x27;Ladies&#x27; open frame bicycles without the top tube of the diamond frame were structurally compromised for ease of use. He believed that classic bicycles (especially with small frames and smaller wheels known as &#x27;shopper&#x27; bicycles) were uncomfortable to ride without the use of wide, low-pressure tyres which increased rolling resistance. He also thought large wheels made a bicycle slow and cumbersome to store, and did not easily fit emerging societal commuting patterns in the developed world, which often combined more than one form of transport.

Moulton considered that small wheels with high-pressure tyres would result in less rolling resistance, less inertia and hence greater acceleration. He then went on to develop a range of high-pressure tyres in co-operation with Dunlop. Suspension for the front and rear was developed to give a comfortable ride with the smaller wheels. In this respect, the Moulton bicycle was ahead of its time, as bicycle suspension would not become common for another 30 years.

The Moulton bicycle also featured a different frame from the traditional diamond design. It is often known as an &quot;F-frame&quot; or &quot;Lazy F&quot; due to its unusual structure. The F-frame had no top tube, as such, and could therefore be easily mounted by those with mobility limitations, whether imposed by physical infirmity or by type of clothing.

===Impact===
When the design was released in 1962, it was one of the first major innovations in bicycle design since the &quot;safety bicycle&quot; in the 1880s and made an immediate impact. The 1962 version (aka &quot;bicycle of the future&quot;) was the first production Moulton bicycle with suspension and the racing version was televised the same year, ridden by road race champion and Moulton employee John Ronald Tovey. As Moulton bicycles became an icon of the Swinging Sixties and were sold around the world by the thousands, briefly, Moulton was one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in Britain. The architecture and design critic Peter Reyner Banham, known for often controversial views on technology and industrialisation, was a keen advocate and user of the original Moulton. Eleanor Bron&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Life and Other Punctures&quot; celebrates travels around France on an original Moulton. In bicycle culture, the rider of a Moulton bicycle is often referred to as being a &quot;Moultoneer&quot; (a play on the word &quot;Mountaineer&quot;).

===Models produced===

The following home-market models were produced between 1962 and 1967 in the Moulton factory at Bradford-on-Avon and in the BMC car factory at Kirkby, Liverpool: Continental and Automatic M0, Standard M1, Deluxe M2, Safari M3, Speed M4, Stowaway M5 and the Speedsix M6. A further low volume, high specification &#x27;S&#x27; range of Moulton bicycles was produced separately at another small workshop in Bradford-on-Avon and consisted of the Deluxe MS2, Safari MS3, Stowaway MS5 and the top-of-the-range &#x27;S&#x27; Speed. After the Raleigh take-over in 1967, the models were just the Major and Major Deluxe, which in turn were dropped with the introduction of the Mark III in 1970.

===Sellout===

The success of the Moulton spurred competitors to produce their own small wheelers, such as the Raleigh RSW 16. The drop in sales from the increased competition brought the company into financial difficulties and in August 1967, it was taken over by Raleigh. Raleigh then produced both the RSW and the Moulton side by side.

Raleigh produced the Major, Major Deluxe and the Mark III (previous Moultons were known as Series 1 and Series 2). The main differences were a re-designed rear suspension using a rubber ball instead of a block, and a rear triangle replacing the swingarm of the earlier designs. In 1974, production of the innovative cycles stopped. Some of the early Moulton bicycles are today considered to be collectors&#x27; items.

===Re-birth===
In the early 1980s, Alex Moulton bought back the rights to the Moulton design from Raleigh, and brought out a design along broadly similar lines to the original. Aimed at the high end of the market, this AM series (which remains in production) has a space frame allowing high rigidity and low weight when compared to traditional steel frames. In 1998, the New Series Moulton was introduced. This, similar to the AM, incorporates a Flexitor front suspension, and a rear suspension based on the unified rear triangle principle. The New Series includes the Pylon and Double Pylon high-performance models: in the latter all large diameter tubes have been eliminated, resulting in a pure space frame design and low weight.
===Pashley-Moulton===
To bring the new design to a larger market, a cheaper variant of the AM bicycle design, the APB (All-Purpose Bicycle), was produced under licence by Pashley Cycles from 1992 to 2005. To reduce costs, Pashley use off-the-shelf components as far as possible instead of the custom components of the original Moultons: for example, specially manufactured 17 by 1 inch (ISO 369) wheels, tyres, and inner tubes were replaced by the more common 20-inch ETRTO 406 size.

In 2005, the Pashley-Moulton design was updated to create the TSR series: high-performance, lighter versions of the Pashley-Moulton replacing the APB. In 2008 the TSR became the Moulton TSR when Alex Moulton Bicycles and Pashley Cycles combined to form a new company, The Moulton Bicycle Company. Production of the Moulton TSR by Pashley in Stratford-on-Avon continues today. In 2022, Moulton acquired the original Moulton Bicycle Works in Bradford-on-Avon, with the intention to make all Moulton products there. From the start of 2023 the Moulton TSR is now made in Bradford-on-Avon.

===Bridgestone Moulton===
A newer model, stylistically and structurally similar to the original Moulton design, was manufactured by Bridgestone. Known as the Bridgestone Moulton, it was built in Japan and those sold in the UK were assembled in England at the Moulton factory. Like the original Moulton, the AM, and the APB before it, it was available in separable and rigid performance versions. Though similar in appearance to the original design, it was a contemporary performance bicycle with advanced design and components.

===Moulton Bicycle Company===
, the Moulton Bicycle Company listed several models at prices ranging from £950 to £15,500.

<text>Shusaku (本因坊秀策, Yasuda Eisai, Kuwahara Shusaku, &quot;Invincible Shusaku&quot;, born Kuwabara Torajiro (桑原虎次郎); June 6, 1829 – September 3, 1862) was a Japanese professional Go player during the 19th century. He is known for his undefeated streak of 19 games during the annual castle games; his thirty-game match with Ota Yuzo; the eponymous Shusaku opening; and his posthumous veneration as a &quot;Go sage&quot;. Next to his teacher, Hon&#x27;inbō Shūwa, he is considered to have been the strongest player from 1847/8 to his death in 1862. He was nicknamed &quot;Invincible Shusaku&quot; because of his castle games performance.

==Biography==
He was nicknamed &quot;Invincible&quot; after he earned a perfect score for 19 straight wins in the annual castle games. Some say that he was not stronger than his teacher, Honinbō Shuwa. Out of respect for his teacher, Shusaku refused to play with white against his teacher thus there is no clear gauge of the difference in strength between them. Shusaku, for example, had a plus score against Ōta Yūzo but still found him a tough opponent, while Shuwa beat him easily.

Only two other people have been given the title &quot;Go Sage&quot; (Kisei) in addition to Shusaku, the others being Honinbō Dosaku (1645–1702) and Honinbo Jowa (1787–1847). However, Jowa&#x27;s title was posthumously revoked due to a biased account of his machinations (in the Zain Danso) towards obtaining the post of Meijin Godokoro. Today, Shusaku&#x27;s reputation is more balanced in Japan, where a wide number of texts on Shusaku and Jowa have since been published, but remains somewhat inflated in the West where the sources are more sparse.

===Early years===
He was born on the island of Innoshima near the town of Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan to a merchant, Kuwabara Wazo. Asano Tadahiro, lord of Mihara Castle, became his patron after playing a game with him, and allowed him to study under Lord Asano&#x27;s personal trainer, the priest Hoshin, a player of professional level.

In 1837, at age 8, Shusaku was already almost a player of professional caliber. He left home to join the Honinbō school (the most important institute in the game of Go in Japan at the time having produced the Go Saint Dosaku and many Meijins) officially as a student of Honinbo Jowa but his study would mainly be with senior students. On January 3, 1840, he received his shodan (first dan) professional diploma.

===Meteoric rise===
In 1840 Shusaku left Edo and returned to his home for a period of over a year. In the following years, he made steady progress up the ranks, reaching 4 dan in 1844, after which he again returned home for a prolonged period. In April–May 1846, returning to Edo, he played against Gennan Inseki, arguably the strongest player of that time. Shusaku played with a handicap of two stones, but Gennan found that Shusaku was too strong, so he called off the game. A new game was started with Shusaku just playing black, the ear-reddening game. Gennan played a new joseki (opening variation in a corner), and Shusaku erred in responding. He fought back hard, but still by the time of the middlegame, all the people watching the game thought Gennan was winning, except for one, a doctor. He admitted that he was not skilled in Go, but noticed that Gennan&#x27;s ears became red after a certain move by Shusaku, a sign that Gennan was surprised. In the end, Shusaku won the game by two points.

Returning to Edo, Shusaku was not only promoted to 5-dan, but he was also made the official heir of Honinbo Shuwa, who was to become the head of the Honinbo house. Shusaku declined at first, citing his obligations to Lord Asano as the reason. After that issue was settled, Shusaku accepted. As the official heir to the head of the Honinbo house, Shusaku had an eminent position. His grade also increased, he finally reached 7-dan, although it is not known exactly when—some think in 1849 while others say in 1853. After forcing his main rival and friend Ōta Yūzo to take a handicap, he was generally accepted to be the strongest player with the exception of Shuwa.

===Sanjubango===
In 1853, a group of players gathered in a mansion in Edo. The players were Yasui Sanchi, Ito Showa, Sakaguchi Sentoku, Hattori Seitetsu, and Ōta Yūzo. They were discussing Shusaku, to the point where they had come to the idea that Shusaku was the strongest player of the time, but Ota did not agree. He said he was in the middle of a series of games with Shusaku, tied at 3 apiece. Akai Gorosaku, who was a famous sponsor of Go during the time, had heard this and decided to sponsor an unheard of 30-game go competition (a &quot;Sanjubango&quot;) between Ota and Shusaku. The series had begun in 1853, when Ota was 46 and a 7 dan, while Shusaku was 24 years old and a 6 dan. The games were played once a week, faster than a typical 10-game match. Ota was doing well until the 11th game, when Shusaku started to fight back. Ota was behind by 4 games after the 17th game. The 21st game was played in July, but the 22nd game was not played until October of that year, a reason of which is not known. The 22nd game was played in Ota&#x27;s house, which was different from the others, considering they were played in more neutral venues. Ota had lost once more, and the venue was changed to a more neutral one. It is believed, however, the 23rd game, was fixed. It had lasted almost 24 straight hours, and had resulted in a tie. It saved Ota from embarrassment. It was thought as a great achievement, having a tie after taking white, so much that it was used, along with Shusaku&#x27;s calling up for the castle games, as an excuse to adjourn the match.

===Death and legacy===
In 1862, a cholera epidemic swept through Japan. Shusaku tended the patients within the Honinbō house, and fell ill himself, dying of it on September 3 at the age of 33.

Shusaku&#x27;s name is connected to the Shusaku fuseki, a certain method of opening the game on black, which was developed to perfection (but not invented) by him, and was the basis of the popular opening style up to the 1930s.

Shusaku is also remembered by the Shusaku number, an equivalent of the Erdős number for Go players.

On 6 June 2014, a Google doodle commemorated Shusaku&#x27;s 185th birthday. This caused controversy in the United Kingdom, as it was felt that preempting the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings to honour a Japanese person was impolitic. Google.uk was hurriedly amended.

==Fiction==

In the manga and anime series &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;, Shusaku discovered the spirit of fictional Go player Fujiwara-no-Sai. Shusaku became the medium through which Sai played the great games ascribed to Shusaku.

<doc id="204675" wikidata="Q319114" url="?curid=204675" title="Dunhuang">
<text>Dunhuang () is a county-level city in northwestern Gansu Province, Western China. According to the 2010 Chinese census, the city has a population of 186,027, though 2019 estimates put the city&#x27;s population at about 191,800. Sachu (Dunhuang) was a major stop on the ancient Silk Road and is best known for the nearby Mogao Caves.

Dunhuang is situated in an oasis containing Crescent Lake and Mingsha Shan (, meaning &quot;Singing-Sand Mountain&quot;), named after the sound of the wind whipping off the dunes, the singing sand phenomenon. Dunhuang commands a strategic position at the crossroads of the ancient Southern Silk Route and the main road leading from India via Lhasa to Mongolia and southern Siberia, and also controls the entrance to the narrow Hexi Corridor, which leads straight to the heart of the north Chinese plains and the ancient capitals of Chang&#x27;an (today known as Xi&#x27;an) and Luoyang.

Administratively, the county-level city of Dunhuang is part of the prefecture-level city of Jiuquan. Historically, the city and/or its surrounding region has also been known by the names Shazhou (prefecture of sand) or Guazhou (prefecture of melons). In the modern era, the two alternative names have been assigned respectively to &quot;Shazhou zhen&quot; (Shazhou town) which serves as Dunhuang&#x27;s seat of government, and to the neighboring Guazhou County. 
==Etymology==
A number of derivations of the name &quot;Dunhuang&quot; have been suggested by scholars:
# Giles 1892: ‘artificial mound, tumulus, beacon mound, square block of stone or wood’ + ‘blazing, bright, luminous’.
# Mathews (1931) 1944: , now usually ‘regard as important, to esteem; honest, sincere, generous’ + ‘a great blaze; luminous, glittering’.
# McGraw-Hill 1963: (‘honest + shining’).
# Jáo and Demieville 1971 (French, &quot;Airs de Touen-houang&quot;): () ‘noise of burning’ + ‘great blaze’ [per Mathews].
# Lín Yǚtáng 1972: () ‘small mound (+ shining)’ or () ‘to shimmer (+ shining)’.
# Kāngxī 1716: , also [&quot;t&quot;=&quot;t’&quot;].
# Mair 1977, Ptolemy&#x27;s c. 150 &quot;Geography&quot; refers to Dunhuang as Greek (Throana), possibly from Iranian &quot;Druvana&quot; meaning something like &quot;fortress for tax collecting.&quot;

==History==

===Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties===

There is evidence of habitation in the area as early as 2,000 BC, possibly by people recorded as the Qiang in Chinese history. According to Zuo Zhuan and Book of the Later Han, the Dunhuang region was a part of the ancient Guazhou, which was known for its production of melons. Its name was also mentioned in relation to the homeland of the Yuezhi in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. Some have argued that this may refer to the unrelated toponym Dunhong – the archaeologist Lin Meicun has also suggested that &quot;Dunhuan&quot; may be a Chinese name for the Tukhara, a people widely believed to be a Central Asian offshoot of the Yuezhi.

===Warring States period===
During the Warring States period, the inhabitants of Dunhuang included the Dayuezhi people, Wusun people, and Saizhong people (Chinese name for Scythians). As Dayuezhi became stronger, it absorbed the Qiang tribes.

===Han dynasty===
By the third century BC, the area became dominated by the Xiongnu, but came under Chinese rule during the Han dynasty after Emperor Wu defeated the Xiongnu in 121 BC.

Dunhuang was one of the four frontier garrison towns (along with Jiuquan, Zhangye and Wuwei) established by the Emperor Wu after the defeat of the Xiongnu, and the Chinese built fortifications at Dunhuang and sent settlers there. The name Dunhuang, meaning &quot;Blazing Beacon&quot;, refers to the beacons lit to warn of attacks by marauding nomadic tribes. Dunhuang Commandery was probably established shortly after 104 BC. Located in the western end of the Hexi Corridor near the historic junction of the Northern and Southern Silk Roads, Dunhuang was a town of military importance.&quot;The Great Wall was extended to Dunhuang, and a line of fortified beacon towers stretched westwards into the desert. By the second century AD Dunhuang had a population of more than 76,000 and was a key supply base for caravans that passed through the city: those setting out for the arduous trek across the desert loaded up with water and food supplies, and others arriving from the west gratefully looked upon the mirage-like sight of Dunhuang&#x27;s walls, which signified safety and comfort. Dunhuang prospered on the heavy flow of traffic. The first Buddhist caves in the Dunhuang area were hewn in 353.&quot;

===Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty===

During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties, it was the main stop of communication between ancient China and the rest of the world and a major hub of commerce of the Silk Road. Dunhuang was the intersection city of all three main silk routes (north, central, south) during this time.

From the West also came early Buddhist monks, who had arrived in China by the first century AD, and a sizable Buddhist community eventually developed in Dunhuang. The caves carved out by the monks, originally used for meditation, developed into a place of worship and pilgrimage called the Mogao Caves or &quot;Caves of a Thousand Buddhas.&quot; A number of Christian, Jewish, and Manichaean artifacts have also been found in the caves (see for example Jingjiao Documents), testimony to the wide variety of people who made their way along the Silk Road.

During the time of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Li Gao established the Western Liang here in 400 AD. In 405 the capital of the Western Liang was moved from Dunhuang to Jiuquan. In 421 the Western Liang was conquered by the Northern Liang.
As a frontier town, Dunhuang was fought over and occupied at various times by non-Han people. After the fall of the Han dynasty it came under the rule of various nomadic tribes, such as the Xiongnu during Northern Liang and the Turkic Tuoba during Northern Wei. The Tibetans occupied Dunhuang when the Tang Empire became weakened considerably after the An Lushan Rebellion; and even though it was later returned to Tang rule, it was under quasi-autonomous rule by the local general Zhang Yichao, who expelled the Tibetans in 848. After the fall of Tang, Zhang&#x27;s family formed the Kingdom of Golden Mountain in 910, but in 911 it came under the influence of the Uighurs. The Zhangs were succeeded by the Cao family, who formed alliances with the Uighurs and the Kingdom of Khotan.

===Song dynasty===
During the Song dynasty, Dunhuang fell outside the Chinese borders. In 1036 the Tanguts who founded the Western Xia dynasty captured Dunhuang. From the reconquest of 848 to about 1036 (i.e. era of the Guiyi Circuit), Dunhuang was a multicultural entrepot that contained one of the largest ethnic Sogdian communities in China following the An Lushan Rebellion. The Sogdians were Sinified to some extent and were bilingual in Chinese and Sogdian, and wrote their documents in Chinese characters, but horizontally from left to right instead of right to left in vertical lines, as Chinese was normally written at the time.

===Yuan dynasty===
Dunhuang was conquered in 1227 by the Mongols, and became part of the Mongol Empire in the wake of Kublai Khan&#x27;s conquest of China under the Yuan dynasty.

===Ming dynasty===
During the Ming dynasty, China became a major sea power, conducting several voyages of exploration with sea routes for trade and cultural exchanges. Dunhuang went into a steep decline after the Chinese trade with the outside world became dominated by southern sea-routes, and the Silk Road was officially abandoned during the Ming dynasty. It was occupied again by the Tibetans c. 1516, and also came under the influence of the Chagatai Khanate in the early sixteenth century.

===Qing dynasty===
Dunhuang was retaken by China two centuries later c. 1715 during the Qing dynasty, and the present-day city of Dunhuang was established east of the ruined old city in 1725.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
In 1988, Dunhuang was elevated from county to county-level city status. On March 31, 1995, Turpan and Dunhuang became sister cities.
Today, the site is an important tourist attraction and the subject of an ongoing archaeological project. A large number of manuscripts and artifacts retrieved at Dunhuang have been digitized and made publicly available via the International Dunhuang Project. The spreading Kumtag Desert, the result of long-standing overgrazing of the surrounding land, has reached the edges of the city.

In 2011 satellite images showing huge structures in the desert near Dunhuang surfaced online and caused a brief media stir.

==Culture==

===Buddhist caves===

A number of Buddhist cave sites are located in the Dunhuang area, the most important of these is the Mogao Caves which is located southeast of Dunhuang. There are 735 caves in Mogao, and the caves in Mogao are particularly noted for their Buddhist art, as well as the hoard of manuscripts, the Dunhuang manuscripts, found hidden in a sealed-up cave. Many of these caves were covered with murals and contain many Buddhist statues. Discoveries continue to be found in the caves, including excerpts from a Christian Bible dating to the Yuan dynasty.

Numerous smaller Buddhist cave sites are located in the region, including the Western Thousand Buddha Caves, the Eastern Thousands Buddha Caves, and the Five Temple site. The Yulin Caves are located further east in Guazhou County.

Many souvenir items are sold, including such typical items as jade, jewelry, scrolls, hangings, small sculptures, leather shows puppets, coins, Tibetan horns and Buddha statues. A sizable number of members of China&#x27;s ethnic minorities engage in business at these markets. A Central Asian dessert or sweet is also sold, consisting of a large, sweet confection made with nuts and dried fruit, sliced into the portion desired by the customer.

<text>USS &quot;Iowa&quot; (BB-61) is a retired battleship, the lead ship of her class, and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named after the state of Iowa. Owing to the cancellation of the s, &quot;Iowa&quot; is the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships and was the only ship of her class to serve in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.

During World War II, she carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic to Mers El Kébir, Algeria, en route to a conference of vital importance in 1943 in Tehran with Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom and Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union. When transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1944, &quot;Iowa&quot; shelled beachheads at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in advance of Allied amphibious landings and screened aircraft carriers operating in the Marshall Islands. She also served as the Third Fleet flagship, flying Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s flag at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.

During the Korean War, &quot;Iowa&quot; was involved in raids on the North Korean coast, after which she was decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets, better known as the &quot;mothball fleet.&quot; She was reactivated in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to counter the recently expanded Soviet Navy. In April 1989, an explosion of undetermined origin wrecked her No. 2 gun turret, killing 47 sailors.

&quot;Iowa&quot; was decommissioned for the last time in October 1990 after 19 total years of active service, and was initially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) in 1995, before being reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships. In 2011 &quot;Iowa&quot; was donated to the Los Angeles–based non-profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved to Berth 87 at the Port of Los Angeles in 2012, where she was opened to the public as the USS &quot;Iowa&quot; Museum.

==Construction==
Ordered in July 1939, USS &quot;Iowa&quot; was laid down at New York Naval Shipyard in June 1940. She was launched on 27 August 1942, sponsored by Ilo Wallace (wife of Vice President Henry Wallace), and commissioned on 22 February 1943 with Captain John L. McCrea in command.

USS &quot;Iowa&quot;″s main battery consisted of nine /50 caliber Mark 7 guns, which could fire armor-piercing shells . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty /38 cal guns in twin mounts, which could fire at targets up to away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers; to this end, &quot;Iowa&quot; was fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns to defend Allied carriers from enemy airstrikes.

==World War II (1943–1945)==

===Shakedown and service with the Atlantic Fleet===
On 24 February 1943, &quot;Iowa&quot; put to sea for a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast. She got underway on 27 August for Argentia, Newfoundland, to counter the threat of the German battleship which was reportedly operating in Norwegian waters, before returning to the United States on 25 October for two weeks of maintenance at the Norfolk Navy Yard.

In November 1943, &quot;Iowa&quot; carried President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Roosevelt&#x27;s Chief of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff of the Army General George C. Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King, Commanding General of the US Army Air Forces Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, Harry Hopkins, and other military leaders to Mers El Kébir, Algeria, on the first leg of the journey to the Cairo and Tehran conferences. On 14 November, in waters east of Bermuda, , a destroyer that was part of &quot;Iowa″&quot;s anti-submarine screen, accidentally discharged a torpedo toward &quot;Iowa&quot; during a drill. Following warnings from the destroyer and her own lookouts, &quot;Iowa&quot; turned hard to avoid the torpedo, which detonated approximately 1200 yards astern in the ship&#x27;s wake. &quot;Iowa&quot; trained her guns on &quot;William D. Porter&quot;, concerned that the smaller ship might have been involved in an assassination plot.

&quot;Iowa&quot; completed her presidential escort mission on 16 December by returning the President to the United States. Roosevelt addressed the crew of &quot;Iowa&quot; prior to leaving by stating, &quot;... from all I have seen and all I have heard, the &quot;Iowa&quot; is a &#x27;happy ship,&#x27; and having served with the Navy for many years, I know—and you know—what that means.&quot; He also touched on the progress made at the conference before concluding his address with &quot;... good luck, and remember that I am with you in spirit, each and every one of you.&quot;

===Service with Battleship Division 7, Admiral Lee===
As flagship of Battleship Division 7 (BatDiv 7), &quot;Iowa&quot; departed the United States on 2 January 1944 for the Pacific Ocean, transiting the Panama Canal on 7 January in advance of her combat debut in the campaign for the Marshall Islands. From 29 January to 3 February, she supported carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman&#x27;s Task Group 58.3 (TG 58.3) against Kwajalein and Eniwetok atolls. Her next assignment was to support air strikes against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at Truk, Caroline Islands. &quot;Iowa&quot;, in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. During this action, &quot;Iowa&quot;, along with her sister &quot;New Jersey&quot;, sank the Japanese light cruiser , the cruiser having escaped Truk the day before following Operation Hailstone, the US air attack on Truk.

On 21 February, she was underway with the Fast Carrier Task Force (alternatively designated TF 38 while with 3rd Fleet and TF 58 while with 5th Fleet) while it conducted the first strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam in the Mariana Islands.
On 18 March 1944, &quot;Iowa&quot;, flying the flag of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee (Commander, Battleships, Pacific), joined in the bombardment of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Although struck by two Japanese projectiles, &quot;Iowa&quot; suffered negligible damage. She then rejoined TF 58 on 30 March, and supported air strikes against the Palau Islands and Woleai of the Carolines for several days.

From 22 to 28 April, &quot;Iowa&quot; supported air raids on Hollandia (now known as Jayapura), Aitape, and Wake Islands to support Army forces on Aitape and at Tanahmerah and Humboldt Bays in New Guinea. She then joined the Task Force&#x27;s second strike on Truk, on 29 and 30 April, and bombarded Japanese facilities on Ponape in the Carolines on 1 May.

In the opening phases of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, &quot;Iowa&quot; protected the American carriers during air strikes on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota, and Pagan Island on 12 June. &quot;Iowa&quot; was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13–14 June, which resulted in the destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump. On 19 June, in an engagement known as the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Iowa&quot;, as part of the battle line of TF 58, helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier-based air-forces, with &quot;Iowa&quot; claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft. &quot;Iowa&quot; then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy fleet, shooting down one torpedo plane and assisting in splashing another.

Throughout July, &quot;Iowa&quot; remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month&#x27;s rest, &quot;Iowa&quot; sailed from Eniwetok as part of the Third Fleet, and helped support the landings on Peleliu on 17 September. She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, &quot;Iowa&quot; arrived off Okinawa for a series of air strikes on the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa. She then supported air strikes against Luzon on 18 October and continued this duty during General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s landing on Leyte on 20 October.

In a last-ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines, the Imperial Japanese Navy struck back with &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1, a three-pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in Leyte Gulf. The plan called for Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa to use the surviving Japanese carriers as bait to draw US carriers of TF 38 away from the Philippine beachheads, allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals Takeo Kurita, Kiyohide Shima, and Shōji Nishimura to take surface task forces through the San Bernardino Strait and Surigao Strait, where they would rendezvous and attack the US beachheads. &quot;Iowa&quot; accompanied TF 38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the Sibuyan Sea toward San Bernardino Strait. The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group; as a result, &quot;Iowa&quot;, with TF 38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off Cape Engaño, Luzon. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of &quot;Iowa&quot;″s guns, word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American escort carriers off Samar. This threat to the American beachheads forced TF 38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort carrier fleet, but fierce resistance by the 7th Fleet in the Battle off Samar had already caused the Japanese to retire and &quot;Iowa&quot; was denied a surface action. Following the Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Iowa&quot; remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944.

On 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force—7 fleet carriers, 6 light carriers, 8 battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers—during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time, the ships were operating about east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea. The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American amphibious operations against Mindoro in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with Captain Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group on 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.

Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the task force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the vessels were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers—, , and —capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage. Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars, and some 146 planes on various ships were swept overboard or damaged beyond economical repair by fires or impacts. &quot;Iowa&quot; reported zero injured sailors as a result of the typhoon, but suffered a loss of one of her float planes, and damage to one of her shafts. The damaged shaft required &quot;Iowa&quot; to return to the US, and she arrived at San Francisco on 15 January 1945, for repairs. During the course of the overhaul &quot;Iowa&quot; had her bridge area enclosed, and was outfitted with new search radars and fire-control systems.

===Bombardment of Japan===

&quot;Iowa&quot; sailed on 19 March 1945 for Okinawa, arriving on 15 April to relieve her sister ship . From 24 April, &quot;Iowa&quot; supported carrier operations which aimed to establish and maintain air superiority for ground forces during their struggle for the island. She then supported air strikes off southern Kyūshū from 25 May to 13 June. Afterward, she sailed toward northern Honshū and Hokkaidō, and participated in strikes on the Japanese home islands on 14–15 July by bombarding Muroran, Hokkaidō, destroying steel mills and other targets. The city of Hitachi on Honshū was shelled beginning the night of 17 July and lasting to 18 July. On 29 and 30 July, &quot;Iowa&quot; trained her guns on Kahoolawe for a bombardment and continued to support fast carrier strikes until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August.

On 27 August, &quot;Iowa&quot; and her sister ship entered Sagami Bay to oversee the surrender of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Two days later, she entered Tokyo Bay with the occupation forces. Here, a number of sailors from &quot;Missouri&quot; were temporarily stationed on &quot;Iowa&quot; for the duration of the surrender ceremony which took place aboard &quot;Missouri&quot;. After serving as Admiral Halsey&#x27;s flagship for the surrender ceremony on 2 September, &quot;Iowa&quot; remained in the bay as part of the occupying force. As part of the ongoing Operation Magic Carpet, she received homeward bound GIs and liberated US prisoners of war before departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September, bound for the United States.

==Post–World War II (1945–1949)==

&quot;Iowa&quot; arrived in Seattle, Washington, on 15 October 1945, then sailed for Long Beach, California, where she engaged in training operations until returning to Japan in 1946 to serve as flagship for the 5th Fleet. She returned to the United States on 25 March 1946 and resumed her role as a training ship. During her usual routine of drills and maneuvers she also embarked Naval Reserve elements and midshipmen for training. In October, &quot;Iowa&quot; underwent a period of overhaul and modernization, which resulted in the addition of the SK-2 Radar and the loss of a number of 20 mm and 40 mm gun mounts. In July, following the Bikini atomic experiments, the old battleship was selected as a target for a live fire exercise to be carried out by &quot;Iowa&quot; and other sea and air assets of the navy. The exercise began with separate shellings from a destroyer, heavy cruiser, and &quot;Iowa&quot;, but this did not sink the ship, and so &quot;Nevada&quot; was finished off with one aerial torpedo hit amidships, sinking her from Pearl Harbor on 31 July 1948. In September 1948, as part of the post World War II drawdown of the armed forces, &quot;Iowa&quot; was deactivated at San Francisco, and then formally decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets on 24 March 1949.

==Korean War (1951–52)==
In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, prompting the United Nations to authorize military intervention. President Harry S. Truman ordered US forces stationed in Japan to transfer to South Korea. Truman also sent US based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to the area to support South Korea. As part of the naval mobilization, &quot;Iowa&quot; was reactivated on 14 July 1951, and formally recommissioned on 25 August, with Captain William R. Smedberg III, in command. &quot;Iowa&quot; sailed for Korean waters in March 1952. On 1 April she relieved her sister ship and became the flagship of Vice Admiral Robert P. Briscoe, Commander of the Seventh Fleet. In her first combat operation of the Korean War, &quot;Iowa&quot; fired her main guns near Wonsan–Sŏngjin on 8 April 1952, with the goal of striking North Korean supply lines. In the company of other naval vessels &quot;Iowa&quot; again engaged North Korean forces the following day, this time against enemy troop concentrations, supply areas, and suspected gun positions in and around Suwon Dan and Kojo. In support of South Korea&#x27;s I Corps, &quot;Iowa&quot; shelled enemy positions on 13 April, killing 100 enemy soldiers, destroying six gun emplacements, and wrecking a division headquarters. The next day she entered Wonsan Harbor and shelled warehouses, observation posts and railroad marshaling yards before moving out to rejoin the UN flotilla aiding ground forces around Kosong. On 20 April, in her first combat action above the 38th parallel, &quot;Iowa&quot; shelled railroad lines at Tanchon, where four railroad tunnels were destroyed, before sailing to Chindong and Kosong for a two-day bombardment of North Korean positions.

On 25 May &quot;Iowa&quot;, following her sister ship &quot;Missouri&quot;″s example, arrived in the waters off Chongjin, a North Korean industrial center approximately from the Russian border. Upon arrival, &quot;Iowa&quot; proceeded to shell the industrial and rail transportation centers in Chongjin, after which she moved south to aid the US X Corps. &quot;En route&quot; to US positions, &quot;Iowa&quot; again bombarded Sŏngjin, destroying several railroad tunnels and bridges in the area. On 28 May, &quot;Iowa&quot; rejoined the main body of the US fleet supporting the X Corps, heavily shelling several islands in Wonsan Harbor.

Throughout June, &quot;Iowa&quot; trained her guns on targets at Mayang-do, Tanchon, Chongjin, Chodo–Sokcho and the ports of Hŭngnam and Wonsan in support of the UN and South Korean forces. On 9 June, a helicopter from &quot;Iowa&quot; rescued a downed pilot from the carrier . At the time, &quot;Princeton&quot; was operating with TF 77, and with other carriers in the task force who were involved in a bombing campaign against North Korean supply lines, troop concentrations, and infrastructure; additionally, the carriers were flying close air support missions for ground forces fighting against the North Korean forces. In July, &quot;Iowa&quot; received a new skipper, Captain Joshua W. Cooper, who assumed command of the battleship for the remainder of her Korean War tour.

On 20 August, &quot;Iowa&quot; took aboard nine wounded men from the destroyer after &quot;Thompson&quot; was hit by a Chinese artillery battery while shelling enemy positions at Sŏngjin. At the time, &quot;Iowa&quot; was operating south of Sŏngjin, and after receiving the wounded destroyer crewmen, &quot;Iowa&quot; covered &quot;Thompson&quot; as she retreated into safer waters.

On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard &quot;Iowa&quot;. Clark observed &quot;Iowa&quot; in action as her guns shelled the Wonsan area for a third time, accounting for the destruction of a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, &quot;Iowa&quot; fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, &quot;Iowa&quot; was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships&#x27; big guns. During the operation, &quot;Iowa&quot; provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.

In October 1952 &quot;Iowa&quot; was serving as flagship for the Commander, Seventh Fleet, and she engaged in 43 gun strikes on targets in the areas of Wonsan, Songjin, Kojo, Chaho, Toejo, Simpo, Hungnam and northern Inchon North Korea, and in 27 bombline operations. During these operations, 16,689 rounds were fired from her main and secondary batteries on enemy installations. This action established eligibility for the United Nations Service Medal and the Korean Service Medal with one bronze star.

===Post–Korean War (1953–1958)===
&quot;Iowa&quot; embarked midshipmen for at-sea training to Northern Europe in July 1953, and shortly afterwards took part in Operation Mariner, a major NATO exercise, serving as flagship of Vice Admiral Edmund T. Wooldridge, commander of the 2nd Fleet. Upon completion of this exercise, &quot;Iowa&quot; operated in the Virginia Capes area. Later, in September 1954, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Libby, Commander, Battleship Cruiser Force, United States Atlantic Fleet.

From January–April 1955, &quot;Iowa&quot; made an extended cruise to the Mediterranean Sea as the flagship of the Commander, 6th Fleet. She departed on a midshipman training cruise on 1 June, and upon her return entered Norfolk for a four-month overhaul. Afterward, &quot;Iowa&quot; continued intermittent training cruises and operational exercises, until 4 January 1957 when she departed Norfolk for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon completion, &quot;Iowa&quot; embarked midshipmen for a South American training cruise and joined in the International Naval Review off Hampton Roads, Virginia on 13 June.

On 3 September, &quot;Iowa&quot; sailed for Scotland for NATO&#x27;s Exercise Strikeback. She returned to Norfolk on 28 September, and departed Hampton Roads for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 22 October. She was decommissioned on 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia.

==Reactivation (1982–1990)==
As part of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s and Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman&#x27;s effort to create an expanded 600-ship Navy, &quot;Iowa&quot; was reactivated in 1982 and towed by USNS &quot;Apache&quot; to Avondale Shipyard near New Orleans, Louisiana, for refitting and equipment modernization in advance of her planned recommissioning. During the refit, &quot;Iowa&quot; had all of her remaining Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern fighter jets and anti-ship missiles. Additionally, the two gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the aft on the port and starboard sides of the battleship were removed.

&quot;Iowa&quot; was then towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, where over the next several months the battleship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close-in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Sometime after June 1986, &quot;Iowa&quot; was the first battleship to receive the RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters (although helicopters were not carried by battleships) previously used to spot for her nine 16 inch (406 mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, &quot;Iowa&quot; was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500 million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to &quot;Iowa&quot; engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) inspection was skipped.

===Shakedown and NATO exercises (1984–1989)===
From April to August 1984, &quot;Iowa&quot; underwent refresher training and naval gunfire support qualifications at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and the Puerto Rican Operating area. After a short period in her new home port of Norfolk, Virginia, she spent the two periods of time during the rest of 1984 and early 1985 conduction &quot;presence&quot; operations shakedown in the area around Central America. During this time she transited the Panama Canal to operate off the west coast of Central America while also conducting people-to-people humanitarian operations, including in El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras, before returning to the United States in April 1985 for a period of routine maintenance.

In August 1985, &quot;Iowa&quot; joined 160 other ships for Exercise Ocean Safari, a NATO naval exercise aimed at testing NATO&#x27;s ability to control sea lanes and maintain free passage of shipping. Owing to bad weather, &quot;Iowa&quot; and the other ships were forced to ride out rough seas, but &quot;Iowa&quot; made use of the time to practice hiding herself from enemy forces. While serving with the exercise force, &quot;Iowa&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle. In October, she took part in Baltic operations, and fired her phalanx guns, guns, and guns in the Baltic Sea on 17 October while operating with US and other allied ships. After these operations during which she visited Le Havre in France, Kiel in Germany, Copenhagen (where the current King of Denmark visited the ship as a schoolboy) and Aarhus in Denmark, and Oslo in Norway where the King of Norway was entertained at lunch, she returned to the United States.

Beginning on 17 March 1986, &quot;Iowa&quot; underwent her overdue InSurv inspection. The inspection, which &quot;Iowa&quot; ultimately failed, was conducted under the supervision of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley. Bulkeley found that the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of during a full-power engine run. Other problems included hydraulic fluid leaks in all three main gun turrets, electrical wiring shorts, pump failures, deteriorated bilge piping, unrepaired soft patches on high-pressure steam lines, and frozen valves in the ship&#x27;s firefighting system. He recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations and Lehman that &quot;Iowa&quot; be taken out of service immediately. Rejecting this advice, Lehman instead instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that &quot;Iowa&quot;″s deficiencies were corrected.

Afterward, &quot;Iowa&quot; returned to the waters around Central America and conducted drills and exercises while providing a military presence to friendly nations. On 4 July, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan boarded &quot;Iowa&quot; for the International Naval Review, which was held in the Hudson River. On 25 April, Captain Larry Ray Seaquist assumed command of the battleship and her crew during Naval Gunfire Support requalification off Vieques Island near Puerto Rico.

On 17 August, &quot;Iowa&quot; set sail for the North Atlantic, and in September she participated in Exercise Northern Wedding by ferrying Marines ashore and assisting helicopter gunships. During the exercise &quot;Iowa&quot; fired her main guns at Cape Wrath range in Scotland in support of a simulated amphibious assault on 5–6 September, firing a total of 19 shells and 32 shells during a 10-hour period and operating in rough seas. During the live fire exercise, a small number of &quot;Iowa&quot; marines were put ashore to monitor the fall of shot and advise the battleship of gunnery corrections. Afterward, &quot;Iowa&quot; visited ports, including Portsmouth, in England and Germany before returning to the United States in October.

In December, the ship became the test bed for the Navy&#x27;s RQ-2 Pioneer (UAV). The drone was designed to serve as an aerial spotter for the battleship&#x27;s guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard &quot;Iowa&quot;.

From January–September 1987 &quot;Iowa&quot; operated in the waters in and around Central America and participated in several exercises until sailing for the Mediterranean Sea on 10 September to join the 6th Fleet based there. She remained in the Mediterranean until 22 October, when she was detached from the 6th Fleet and departed for operations in the North Sea. On 25 November, as part of Operation Earnest Will, &quot;Iowa&quot; transited the Suez Canal and set sail for the Persian Gulf, which at the time was one of the battlefields of the first Gulf War (also referred to as the Iran–Iraq War). The presence of US naval vessels in the gulf was in response to a formal petition from Kuwait, whose ships were being raided by Iranian forces who were attempting to cut off weapons shipments from the United States and Europe to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq, via Kuwaiti territory. This phase of the war would later be called the &quot;Tanker War&quot; phase of the Iran–Iraq War. &quot;Iowa&quot; and other vessels operating in the gulf were assigned to escort Kuwaiti tankers from Kuwaiti ports to the open sea, but because US law forbade military escorts for civilian ships flying a foreign flag, the tankers escorted by the United States were reflagged as US merchant vessels and assigned American names. For the remainder of the year &quot;Iowa&quot; escorted Kuwaiti gas and oil tankers reflagged as US merchant ships from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.

On 20 February 1988, &quot;Iowa&quot; departed from the Persian Gulf, transited the Suez Canal, and set sail for the United States, arriving at Norfolk on 10 March for routine maintenance. In April, she participated in the annual Fleet Week celebrations before returning to Norfolk for an overhaul. On 26 May, Fred Moosally replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of &quot;Iowa&quot;. After the overhaul, Moosally took &quot;Iowa&quot; on a shakedown cruise around Chesapeake Bay on 25 August. Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water, Moosally narrowly missed colliding with the frigate , destroyer , and the cruiser before running aground in soft mud outside the bay&#x27;s main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals. After one hour, &quot;Iowa&quot; was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port. &quot;Iowa&quot; continued with sea trials throughout August and September, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October, during which the ship passed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation.

On 20 January 1989, during an improperly authorized gunnery experiment off Vieques Island, &quot;Iowa&quot; fired a shell , setting a record for the longest-ranged shell ever fired. In February, the battleship sailed for New Orleans for a port visit before departing for Norfolk. On 10 April, the battleship was visited by the commander of the 2nd Fleet, and on 13 April she sailed to participate in a fleet exercise.

===1989 turret explosion===


During a gunnery exercise, at 0955 on 19 April 1989, an explosion ripped through the Number Two gun turret, killing 47 crewmen. A gunner&#x27;s mate in the powder magazine room quickly flooded the No. 2 powder magazine, likely preventing catastrophic damage to the ship. At first, Naval Investigative Service (NIS, later renamed Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) investigators theorized that one of the dead crewmen, Clayton Hartwig, had detonated an explosive device in a suicide attempt after the end of an alleged affair with another sailor. To support this claim, naval officials pointed to several different factors, including Hartwig&#x27;s life insurance policy, which named Kendall Truitt as the sole beneficiary in the event of his death, the presence of unexplained materials inside turret 2, and his mental state, which was alleged to be unstable.

Although the Navy was satisfied with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered as most of the original debris from &quot;Iowa&quot; had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion due to over-ramming rather than an intentional act of sabotage.

While &quot;Iowa&quot; was undergoing modernization in the early 1980s, her sister ship &quot;New Jersey&quot; had been dispatched to Lebanon to provide offshore fire support. At the time, &quot;New Jersey&quot; was the only commissioned battleship anywhere in the world, and it was found that, in an effort to get another battleship commissioned to relieve &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the modernization of &quot;Iowa&quot; was stepped up, leaving her in poor condition when she recommissioned in 1984. It was also determined that Captain Fred Moosally was more concerned with the maintenance of the missiles than the training and manning of guns.

Powder from the same lot as the one under investigation was tested at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. Spontaneous combustion was achieved with the powder, which had been originally milled in the 1930s and improperly stored in a barge at the Navy&#x27;s Yorktown, Virginia, Naval Weapons Station during a 1988 dry-docking of &quot;Iowa&quot;. As it degrades, gunpowder gives off ether gas, which is highly flammable and could be ignited by a spark which could be caused by static electricity. This revelation resulted in a shift in the Navy&#x27;s position on the incident, and Admiral Frank Kelso, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, publicly apologized to the Hartwig family, concluding that there was no real evidence to support the claim that he had intentionally killed the other sailors. &quot;Iowa&quot; captain Fred Moosally was severely criticized for his handling of the matter, and as a result of the incident the Navy changed the powder-handling procedures for its battleships. The incident remains one of the surface Navy&#x27;s worst losses of life during peacetime operations.

==Reserve Fleet and museum ship (1990–present)==


With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical. As a result, &quot;Iowa&quot; was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She was the first of the reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. &quot;Iowa&quot; was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the tug &quot;Sea Victory&quot; began her tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the Reserve Fleet, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. (She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995.) She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.

Section 1011 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 required the US Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets (or &quot;mothball fleet&quot;). The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps&#x27; amphibious operations. Due to &quot;Iowa&quot;″s damaged turret, the Navy selected &quot;New Jersey&quot; for placement into the mothball fleet, even though the training mechanisms on &quot;New Jersey&quot;″s guns had been welded down. The cost to fix &quot;New Jersey&quot; was considered less than the cost to fix &quot;Iowa&quot;; as a result, &quot;New Jersey&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet.

&quot;New Jersey&quot; remained there until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 required the Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on the Naval Vessel Register. The Act also required the Secretary of the Navy to strike &quot;New Jersey&quot; from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of Title 10 of the United States Code. It also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the state of New Jersey. The Navy made the switch in January 1999, allowing &quot;New Jersey&quot; to open as a museum ship in her namesake state.

On 17 March 2006, the Secretary of the Navy struck &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; from the NVR, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museum ships; but the United States Congress remained &quot;deeply concerned&quot; over the loss of the naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and noted that &quot;navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic.&quot; As a partial consequence, Congress passed , the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again. Congress ordered that measures be implemented to ensure that, if need be, &quot;Iowa&quot; could be returned to active duty. These measures closely mirrored the original three conditions that the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 which laid out for the maintenance of &quot;Iowa&quot; while she was in the &quot;mothball fleet&quot;.


In March 2007, the Historic Ships Memorial at Pacific Square (HSMPS) of Vallejo, site of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and a Stockton group submitted proposals to use the ship as a museum. The HSMPS, which had attempted to place the ship in San Francisco, supported the Mare Island–Vallejo site. In October 2007 the Navy informed HSMPS that they were the only viable candidate to acquire &quot;Iowa&quot;, and their application would be further reviewed after evidence was presented that financing was in place, and when the Stockton and San Francisco groups withdrew or failed to submit a final application respectively. On 25 April 2009, Iowa Senate Resolution No. 19 was approved, endorsing HSMPS as USS &quot;Iowa&quot;″s custodian and supporting the battleship&#x27;s placement at Mare Island.

In February 2010, the Pacific Battleship Center (PBC) supported the efforts to have the ship berthed in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. In late February the Port of Los Angeles (which includes the San Pedro area) rejected a proposal by the PBC to berth USS &quot;Iowa&quot; at its facilities because the battleship was not yet available. On 12 April 2010, the Governor of Iowa signed into law Bill SJR2007, which officially formed a 10-member committee to raise about $5 million for the group awarded USS &quot;Iowa&quot;. The statement supporting the Vallejo group in the original Iowa State Senate&#x27;s version SR19 was struck in favor of supporting any group actually awarded the battleship.

On 13 May 2010, the Navy announced it would reopen the bidding process, citing HSMPS&#x27;s lack of progress as the reason. On 24 May 2010 the Federal Register officially reopened the bidding process for USS &quot;Iowa&quot; to a California-based city or non-profit organization.

On 18 November 2010, the Port of Los Angeles Harbor Commissioners voted unanimously on a resolution to support Berth 87 as the future home of USS &quot;Iowa&quot;, clearing the way for The Pacific Battleship Center to send its completed application to the Navy. On 6 September 2011, USS &quot;Iowa&quot; was awarded to Pacific Battleship Center for placement at the Port of Los Angeles. After rehabilitation at the Port of Richmond, California (beginning in October 2011), she was towed to and eventually berthed in the Port of Los Angeles.

Starting in December 2011, USS &quot;Iowa&quot; was open for weekend tours. The Battleship Expo at the Port of Richmond included shipboard access and other exhibits such as 16-inch shells, a short film about the battleship, and other exhibits. On 30 April 2012, USS &quot;Iowa&quot; was officially donated to the Pacific Battleship Center in Los Angeles by the United States Navy.

&quot;Iowa&quot; began her journey to the Port of Los Angeles on 26 May 2012 under tow by four Crowley Maritime tugboats. After being anchored off the Southern California coast to have her hull scrubbed to remove any invasive species or contaminants, on 9 June 2012 she was permanently docked in San Pedro at Berth 87, along the Main Channel, directly south of the World Cruise Center. The museum opened to the public on 7 July, under the direction and control of Pacific Battleship Center.

<doc id="204680" wikidata="Q1068463" url="?curid=204680" title="Four-momentum">
<text>In special relativity, four-momentum (also called momentum–energy or momenergy) is the generalization of the classical three-dimensional momentum to four-dimensional spacetime. Momentum is a vector in three dimensions; similarly four-momentum is a four-vector in spacetime. The contravariant four-momentum of a particle with relativistic energy and three-momentum , where is the particle&#x27;s three-velocity and the Lorentz factor, is
formula_1

The quantity of above is the ordinary non-relativistic momentum of the particle and its rest mass. The four-momentum is useful in relativistic calculations because it is a Lorentz covariant vector. This means that it is easy to keep track of how it transforms under Lorentz transformations.

== Minkowski norm ==

Calculating the Minkowski norm squared of the four-momentum gives a Lorentz invariant quantity equal (up to factors of the speed of light ) to the square of the particle&#x27;s proper mass:
formula_2
where
formula_3
is the metric tensor of special relativity with metric signature for definiteness chosen to be . The negativity of the norm reflects that the momentum is a timelike four-vector for massive particles. The other choice of signature would flip signs in certain formulas (like for the norm here). This choice is not important, but once made it must for consistency be kept throughout.

The Minkowski norm is Lorentz invariant, meaning its value is not changed by Lorentz transformations/boosting into different frames of reference. More generally, for any two four-momenta and , the quantity is invariant.

== Relation to four-velocity ==

For a massive particle, the four-momentum is given by the particle&#x27;s invariant mass multiplied by the particle&#x27;s four-velocity,
formula_4
where the four-velocity is
formula_5
and
formula_6
is the Lorentz factor (associated with the speed formula_7), is the speed of light.

== Derivation ==
There are several ways to arrive at the correct expression for four-momentum. One way is to first define the four-velocity and simply define , being content that it is a four-vector with the correct units and correct behavior. Another, more satisfactory, approach is to begin with the principle of least action and use the Lagrangian framework to derive the four-momentum, including the expression for the energy. One may at once, using the observations detailed below, define four-momentum from the action . Given that in general for a closed system with generalized coordinates and canonical momenta ,
formula_8
it is immediate (recalling , , , and , , , in the present metric convention) that
formula_9
is a covariant four-vector with the three-vector part being the canonical momentum.

Consider initially a system of one degree of freedom . In the derivation of the equations of motion from the action using Hamilton&#x27;s principle, one finds (generally) in an intermediate stage for the variation of the action,
formula_10

The assumption is then that the varied paths satisfy , from which Lagrange&#x27;s equations follow at once. When the equations of motion are known (or simply assumed to be satisfied), one may let go of the requirement . In this case the path is &quot;assumed&quot; to satisfy the equations of motion, and the action is a function of the upper integration limit , but is still fixed. The above equation becomes with , and defining , and letting in more degrees of freedom,
formula_11

Observing that
formula_12
one concludes
formula_13

In a similar fashion, keep endpoints fixed, but let vary. This time, the system is allowed to move through configuration space at &quot;arbitrary speed&quot; or with &quot;more or less energy&quot;, the field equations still assumed to hold and variation can be carried out on the integral, but instead observe
formula_14
by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Compute using the above expression for canonical momenta,
formula_15

Now using
formula_16
where is the Hamiltonian, leads to, since in the present case,
formula_17

Incidentally, using with in the above equation yields the Hamilton–Jacobi equations. In this context, is called Hamilton&#x27;s principal function.


The action is given by
formula_18
where is the relativistic Lagrangian for a free particle. From this,

The variation of the action is
formula_19

To calculate , observe first that and that
formula_20

So
formula_21
or
formula_22
and thus
formula_23
which is just
formula_24

formula_25

where the second step employs the field equations , , and as in the observations above. Now compare the last three expressions to find
formula_26
with norm , and the famed result for the relativistic energy,

} = m_{r}c^2,&lt;/math&gt;
 |cellpadding = 6
 |border
 |border colour = #0073CF
 |bgcolor = #F9FFF7

where is the now unfashionable relativistic mass, follows. By comparing the expressions for momentum and energy directly, one has

that holds for massless particles as well. Squaring the expressions for energy and three-momentum and relating them gives the energy–momentum relation,

Substituting
formula_27
in the equation for the norm gives the relativistic Hamilton–Jacobi equation,

It is also possible to derive the results from the Lagrangian directly. By definition,
formula_28
which constitute the standard formulae for canonical momentum and energy of a closed (time-independent Lagrangian) system. With this approach it is less clear that the energy and momentum are parts of a four-vector.

The energy and the three-momentum are &quot;separately conserved&quot; quantities for isolated systems in the Lagrangian framework. Hence four-momentum is conserved as well. More on this below.

More pedestrian approaches include expected behavior in electrodynamics. In this approach, the starting point is application of Lorentz force law and Newton&#x27;s second law in the rest frame of the particle. The transformation properties of the electromagnetic field tensor, including invariance of electric charge, are then used to transform to the lab frame, and the resulting expression (again Lorentz force law) is interpreted in the spirit of Newton&#x27;s second law, leading to the correct expression for the relativistic three- momentum. The disadvantage, of course, is that it isn&#x27;t immediately clear that the result applies to all particles, whether charged or not, and that it doesn&#x27;t yield the complete four-vector.

It is also possible to avoid electromagnetism and use well tuned experiments of thought involving well-trained physicists throwing billiard balls, utilizing knowledge of the velocity addition formula and assuming conservation of momentum. This too gives only the three-vector part.

== Conservation of four-momentum ==
As shown above, there are three conservation laws (not independent, the last two imply the first and vice versa):
* The four-momentum (either covariant or contravariant) is conserved.
* The total energy is conserved.
* The 3-space momentum formula_29 is conserved (not to be confused with the classic non-relativistic momentum formula_30).

Note that the invariant mass of a system of particles may be more than the sum of the particles&#x27; rest masses, since kinetic energy in the system center-of-mass frame and potential energy from forces between the particles contribute to the invariant mass. As an example, two particles with four-momenta and each have (rest) mass 3GeV/&quot;c&quot;2 separately, but their total mass (the system mass) is 10GeV/&quot;c&quot;2. If these particles were to collide and stick, the mass of the composite object would be 10GeV/&quot;c&quot;2.

One practical application from particle physics of the conservation of the invariant mass involves combining the four-momenta and of two daughter particles produced in the decay of a heavier particle with four-momentum to find the mass of the heavier particle. Conservation of four-momentum gives , while the mass of the heavier particle is given by . By measuring the energies and three-momenta of the daughter particles, one can reconstruct the invariant mass of the two-particle system, which must be equal to . This technique is used, e.g., in experimental searches for Z′ bosons at high-energy particle colliders, where the Z′ boson would show up as a bump in the invariant mass spectrum of electron–positron or muon–antimuon pairs.

If the mass of an object does not change, the Minkowski inner product of its four-momentum and corresponding four-acceleration is simply zero. The four-acceleration is proportional to the proper time derivative of the four-momentum divided by the particle&#x27;s mass, so
formula_31

== Canonical momentum in the presence of an electromagnetic potential ==
For a charged particle of charge , moving in an electromagnetic field given by the electromagnetic four-potential:
formula_32
where is the scalar potential and the vector potential, the components of the (not gauge-invariant) canonical momentum four-vector is
formula_33

This, in turn, allows the potential energy from the charged particle in an electrostatic potential and the Lorentz force on the charged particle moving in a magnetic field to be incorporated in a compact way, in relativistic quantum mechanics.

== Four-momentum in curved spacetime ==
In the case when there is a moving physical system with a continuous distribution of matter in curved spacetime, the primary expression for four-momentum is a four-vector with covariant index: 

:formula_34

Four-momentum formula_35 is expressed through the energy formula_36 of physical system and relativistic momentum formula_37. At the same time, the four-momentum formula_38 can be represented as the sum of two non-local four-vectors of integral type:

:formula_39

Four-vector formula_40 is the generalized four-momentum associated with the action of fields on particles; four-vector formula_41 is the four-momentum of the fields arising from the action of particles on the fields.

Energy formula_36 and momentum formula_37, as well as components of four-vectors formula_40 and formula_41 can be calculated if the Lagrangian density formula_46 of the system is given. The following formulas are obtained for the energy and momentum of the system:

:formula_47

:formula_48

Here formula_49 is that part of the Lagrangian density that contains terms with four-currents; formula_50 is the velocity of matter particles; formula_51 is the time component of four-velocity of particles; formula_52 is determinant of metric tensor; formula_53 is the part of the Lagrangian associated with the Lagrangian density formula_54; formula_55 is velocity of a particle of matter with number formula_56.

<text>Ambarvalia was a Roman agricultural fertility rite, involving animal sacrifices and held on 29 May in honor of Ceres, Bacchus and Dea Dia. However, the exact timing could vary since Ambarvalia was a &quot;fariae conceptivae&quot; - a festival not bound to a fixed date.

== Summary ==
Ambarvalia is believed to have taken its name from the words &quot;ambiō&quot; - &quot;I go round&quot; and &quot;arvum&quot; - &quot;field&quot;. During the festival, they sacrificed a bull, a sow, and a sheep, which were led in procession thrice around the fields. This sacrifice was called a &quot;suovetaurilia&quot; in Latin. Ambarvalia can be of two kinds: public and private. The private were solemnized by the masters of families, accompanied by their children and servants, in the villages and farms out of Rome. The public was celebrated within the city&#x27;s boundaries, in which twelve &quot;fratres arvales&quot; walked at the head of a procession of citizens who had lands and vineyards in Rome. During the procession, prayers would be made to the goddess. The &quot;ambervale carmen&quot; was the preferred prayer.

The name &quot;Ambarvalia&quot; appears to be predominantly an urban designation. Roman farmers&#x27; almanacs &quot;(Menologia rustica)&quot; describe this only as &quot;segetes lustrantur&quot; (&quot;crops are purified&quot;). Scaliger, in his notes on Festus, maintains the ambarvalia to be the same as amburbium. Numerous other communities of the Italian peninsula enacted similar rites with different names.

== In literature ==

* &quot;Ambarvalia&quot; (1849) is a collection of poems by Thomas Burbidge and Arthur H. Clough.
* &quot;Ambarvalia&quot; (1933) a poetry collection by Nishiwaki Junzaburo, is considered a seminal contribution to Japanese modernism. Its influence is likened to that of T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.
* In chapter I of Walter Pater&#x27;s 1885 novel &quot;Marius the Epicurean&quot;, set in ancient Rome, the protagonist, Marius, engages in the ritual observance of Ambarvalia

== In music ==

* &quot;Ambarvalia&quot; is an orchestral composition by Ruth Gipps from 1988. It was first recorded in 2019 by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.

<doc id="204682" wikidata="Q211459" url="?curid=204682" title="Translation (geometry)">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, a translation is a geometric transformation that moves every point of a figure, shape or space by the same distance in a given direction. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system. In a Euclidean space, any translation is an isometry.

==As a function==

If formula_1 is a fixed vector, known as the &quot;translation vector&quot;, and formula_2 is the initial position of some object, then the translation function formula_3 will work as formula_4.

If formula_5 is a translation, then the image of a subset formula_6 under the function formula_5 is the translate of formula_6 by formula_9. The translate of formula_10 by formula_3 is often written as formula_12.

===Application in classical physics===
In classical physics, translational motion is movement that changes the position of an object, as opposed to rotation. For example, according to Whittaker:

A translation is the operation changing the positions of all points formula_13 of an object according to the formula

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the same vector for each point of the object. The translation vector formula_15 common to all points of the object describes a particular type of displacement of the object, usually called a &quot;linear&quot; displacement to distinguish it from displacements involving rotation, called &quot;angular&quot; displacements.

When considering spacetime, a change of time coordinate is considered to be a translation.

==As an operator==
The translation operator turns a function of the original position, formula_17, into a function of the final position, formula_18. In other words, formula_19 is defined such that formula_20 This operator is more abstract than a function, since formula_19 defines a relationship between two functions, rather than the underlying vectors themselves. The translation operator can act on many kinds of functions, such as when the translation operator acts on a wavefunction, which is studied in the field of quantum mechanics.

==As a group==

The set of all translations forms the translation group formula_22, which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a normal subgroup of Euclidean group formula_23. The quotient group of formula_24 by formula_22 is isomorphic to the group of rigid motions which fix a particular origin point, the orthogonal group formula_26:
:formula_27

Because translation is commutative, the translation group is abelian. There are an infinite number of possible translations, so the translation group is an infinite group.

In the theory of relativity, due to the treatment of space and time as a single spacetime, translations can also refer to changes in the time coordinate. For example, the Galilean group and the Poincaré group include translations with respect to time.

===Lattice groups===
One kind of subgroup of the three-dimensional translation group are the lattice groups, which are infinite groups, but unlike the translation groups, are finitely generated. That is, a finite generating set generates the entire group.

==Matrix representation==
A translation is an affine transformation with &quot;no&quot; fixed points. Matrix multiplications &quot;always&quot; have the origin as a fixed point. Nevertheless, there is a common workaround using homogeneous coordinates to represent a translation of a vector space with matrix multiplication: Write the 3-dimensional vector formula_28 using 4 homogeneous coordinates as formula_29.

To translate an object by a vector formula_1, each homogeneous vector formula_31 (written in homogeneous coordinates) can be multiplied by this translation matrix:

: formula_32
As shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:
: formula_33

The inverse of a translation matrix can be obtained by reversing the direction of the vector:
: formula_34

Similarly, the product of translation matrices is given by adding the vectors:
: formula_35
Because addition of vectors is commutative, multiplication of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).

==Translation of axes==
While geometric translation is often viewed as an active transformation that changes the position of a geometric object, a similar result can be achieved by a passive transformation that moves the coordinate system itself but leaves the object fixed. The passive version of an active geometric translation is known as a &quot;translation of axes&quot;.

==Translational symmetry==
An object that looks the same before and after translation is said to have translational symmetry. A common example is a periodic function, which is an eigenfunction of a translation operator.

== Translations of a graph ==


The graph of a real function , the set of points , is often pictured in the real coordinate plane with as the horizontal coordinate and as the vertical coordinate.

Starting from the graph of , a horizontal translation means composing with a function , for some constant number , resulting in a graph consisting of points . Each point of the original graph corresponds to the point in the new graph, which pictorially results in a horizontal shift.

A vertical translation means composing the function with , for some constant , resulting in a graph consisting of the points . Each point of the original graph corresponds to the point in the new graph, which pictorially results in a vertical shift.

For example, taking the quadratic function , whose graph is a parabola with vertex at , a horizontal translation 5 units to the right would be the new function whose vertex has coordinates . A vertical translation 3 units upward would be the new function whose vertex has coordinates .

The antiderivatives of a function all differ from each other by a constant of integration and are therefore vertical translates of each other.

== Applications ==

For describing vehicle dynamics (or movement of any rigid body), including ship dynamics and aircraft dynamics, it is common to use a mechanical model consisting of six degrees of freedom, which includes translations along three reference axes (as well as rotations about those three axes). These translations are often called &quot;surge&quot;, &quot;sway&quot;, and &quot;heave&quot;.

<doc id="204687" wikidata="Q214321" url="?curid=204687" title="Jan Smuts">
<text>Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts, (baptismal name Jan Christiaan Smuts, 24 May 1870 11 September 1950) was a South African statesman, military leader and philosopher. In addition to holding various military and cabinet posts, he served as prime minister of the Union of South Africa from 1919 to 1924 and 1939 to 1948.

Smuts was born to Afrikaner parents in the British Cape Colony. He was educated at Victoria College, Stellenbosch before reading law at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge on a scholarship. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1894 but returned home the following year. In the leadup to the Second Boer War, Smuts practised law in Pretoria, the capital of the South African Republic. He led the republic&#x27;s delegation to the Bloemfontein Conference and served as an officer in a commando unit following the outbreak of war in 1899. In 1902, he played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the war and resulted in the annexation of the South African Republic and Orange Free State into the British Empire. He subsequently helped negotiate self-government for the Transvaal Colony, becoming a cabinet minister under Louis Botha.

Smuts played a leading role in the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, helping shape its constitution. He and Botha established the South African Party, with Botha becoming the union&#x27;s first prime minister and Smuts holding multiple cabinet portfolios. As defence minister he was responsible for the Union Defence Force during the First World War. Smuts personally led troops in the East African campaign in 1916 and the following year joined the Imperial War Cabinet in London. He played a leading role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, advocating for the creation of the League of Nations and securing South African control over the former German South-West Africa.

In 1919, Smuts replaced Botha as prime minister, holding the office until the South African Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1924 general election by J. B. M. Hertzog&#x27;s National Party. He spent several years in academia, during which he coined the term &quot;holism&quot;, before eventually re-entering politics as deputy prime minister in a coalition with Hertzog; in 1934 their parties subsequently merged to form the United Party. Smuts returned as prime minister in 1939, leading South Africa into the Second World War at the head of a pro-interventionist faction. He was appointed field marshal in 1941 and in 1945 signed the UN Charter, the only signer of the Treaty of Versailles to do so. His second term in office ended with the victory of his political opponents, the reconstituted National Party at the 1948 general election, with the new government implementing early apartheid policies.

Smuts was an internationalist who played a key role in establishing and defining the League of Nations, United Nations and Commonwealth of Nations. He supported racial segregation and opposed democratic non-racial rule. At the end of his career, Smuts supported the Fagan Commission&#x27;s recommendations to relax restrictions on black South Africans living and working in urban areas.

==Early life and education==
Smuts was born on 24 May 1870, at the family farm, Bovenplaats, near Malmesbury, in the Cape Colony. His parents, Jacobus Smuts and his wife Catharina, were prosperous, traditional Afrikaner farmers, long established and highly respected.

As the second son of the family, rural custom dictated that Jan would remain working on the farm. In this system, typically only the first son was supported for a full, formal education. In 1882, when Jan was twelve, his elder brother died, and Jan was sent to school in his place. Jan attended the school in nearby Riebeek West. He made excellent progress despite his late start, and caught up with his contemporaries within four years. He was admitted to Victoria College, Stellenbosch, in 1886, at the age of sixteen.

At Stellenbosch, he learned High Dutch, German, and Ancient Greek, and immersed himself in literature, the classics, and Bible studies. His deeply traditional upbringing and serious outlook led to social isolation from his peers. He made outstanding academic progress, graduating in 1891 with double first-class honours in Literature and Science. During his last years at Stellenbosch, Smuts began to cast off some of his shyness and reserve. At this time he met Isie Krige, whom he later married.

On graduation from Victoria College, Smuts won the Ebden scholarship for overseas study. He decided to attend the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom to read law at Christ&#x27;s College. Smuts found it difficult to settle at Cambridge. He felt homesick and isolated by his age and different upbringing from the English undergraduates. Worries over money also contributed to his unhappiness, as his scholarship was insufficient to cover his university expenses. He confided these worries to Professor J. I. Marais, a friend from Victoria College. In reply, Professor Marais enclosed a cheque for a substantial sum, by way of loan, encouraging Smuts to let him know if he ever found himself in need again. Thanks to Marais, Smuts&#x27;s financial standing was secure. He gradually began to enter more into the social aspects of the university, although he retained a single-minded dedication to his studies.

During this time in Cambridge, Smuts studied a diverse number of subjects in addition to law. He wrote a book, &quot;Walt Whitman: A Study in the Evolution of Personality&quot;. It was not published until 1973, after his death, but it can be seen that Smuts in this book had already conceptualized his thinking for his later wide-ranging philosophy of holism.

Smuts graduated in 1894 with a double first. Over the previous two years, he had received numerous academic prizes and accolades, including the coveted George Long prize in Roman Law and Jurisprudence. One of his tutors, Professor Maitland, a leading figure among English legal historians, described Smuts as the most brilliant student he had ever met. Lord Todd, the Master of Christ&#x27;s College, said in 1970 that &quot;in 500 years of the College&#x27;s history, of all its members, past and present, three had been truly outstanding: John Milton, Charles Darwin and Jan Smuts.&quot;

In December 1894, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. His old Cambridge college, Christ&#x27;s College, offered him a fellowship in Law. Smuts turned his back on a potentially distinguished legal future. By June 1895, he had returned to the Cape Colony, determined to make his future there.

==Career==
===Law and politics===
Smuts began to practise law in Cape Town, but his abrasive nature made him few friends. Finding little financial success in the law, he began to devote more and more of his time to politics and journalism, writing for the &quot;Cape Times&quot;. Smuts was intrigued by the prospect of a united South Africa, and joined the Afrikaner Bond. By good fortune, Smuts&#x27;s father knew the leader of the group, Jan Hofmeyr. Hofmeyr in turn recommended Jan to Cecil Rhodes, who owned the De Beers mining company. In 1895, Smuts became an advocate and supporter of Rhodes.

When Rhodes launched the Jameson Raid, in the summer of 1895–96, Smuts was outraged. Feeling betrayed by his employer, friend and political ally, he resigned from De Beers, and left political life. Instead he became state attorney in the capital of the South African Republic, Pretoria.

After the Jameson Raid, relations between the British and the Afrikaners had deteriorated steadily. By 1898, war seemed imminent. Orange Free State President Martinus Steyn called for a peace conference at Bloemfontein to settle each side&#x27;s grievances. With an intimate knowledge of the British, Smuts took control of the Transvaal delegation. Sir Alfred Milner, head of the British delegation, took exception to his dominance, and conflict between the two led to the collapse of the conference, consigning South Africa to war.

===Psychology===
Smuts was the first South African to be internationally regarded as an important psychologist. During Smuts&#x27;s undergraduate years at Cambridge University, he produced a manuscript in 1895 in which he analysed the personality of the famous American poet Walt Whitman. Due to his manuscript being considered unviable, it was only published 23 years after his death in 1973. Smuts went on to produce his next manuscript, which he completed in 1910, entitled &quot;An Inquiry into the Whole&quot;. His manuscript was then revised in 1924 and published in 1926 with the title &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot;.

Smuts had no interest in pursuing a career in psychology. He considered psychology as &quot;too impersonal to study great personalities&quot;, and believed that the holistic tendency of the personality would be studied best through personology. Smuts, however, never inquired further into the idea of personology due to him wanting to continue laying the foundation of the concept of holism. He never returned to either of the topics.

Holism

Although the concept of holism has been discussed by many, the term holism in academic terminology was first introduced and publicly shared in print by Smuts in the early twentieth century. Smuts was acknowledged for his contribution by getting the honour to write the first entry about the concept for the Encyclopaedia Britannica 1929 edition. The Austrian medical doctor, founder of the school of Individual Psychology, and psychotherapist, Alfred Adler (1870–1937), also showed a great interest in Smuts&#x27;s book. Adler requested permission from Smuts to have the book translated to German and published in Germany.

Although Smuts&#x27;s concept of holism is grounded in the natural sciences, he claimed that it has a relevance in philosophy, ethics, sociology, and psychology. In &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot;, he argued that the concept of holism is &quot;grounded in evolution and is also an ideal that guides human development and one&#x27;s level of personality actualization.&quot; Smuts stated in the book that &quot;personality is the highest form of holism&quot; (p. 292).

Recognition from Adler

Adler later wrote a letter, dated 31 January 1931, where he stated that he recommended Smuts&#x27;s book to his students and followers. He referred to it as &quot;the best preparation for the science of Individual Psychology&quot;. After Smuts gave permission for the translation and publication of his book in Germany, it was translated by H. Minkowski and eventually published in 1938. During the Second World War, the books were destroyed after the Nazi government had removed it from circulation. Adler and Smuts, however, continued their correspondence. In one of Adler’s letters dated 14 June 1931, he invited Smuts to be one of three judges of the best book on the history of wholeness with a reference to Individual Psychology.

===The Boer War===

On 11 October 1899 the Boer republics declared war and launched an offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas, beginning the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. In the early stages of the conflict, Smuts served as Paul Kruger&#x27;s eyes and ears in Pretoria, handling propaganda, logistics, communication with generals and diplomats, and anything else that was required. In the second phase of the war, from mid-1900, Smuts served under Koos de la Rey, who commanded 500 commandos in the Western Transvaal. Smuts excelled at hit-and-run warfare, and the unit evaded and harassed a British army forty times its size. President Paul Kruger and the deputation in Europe thought that there was good hope for their cause in the Cape Colony. They decided to send General de la Rey there to assume supreme command, but then decided to act more cautiously when they realised that General de la Rey could hardly be spared in the Western Transvaal. Consequently, Smuts was left with a small force of 300 men, while another 100 men followed him. By January 1902 the British scorched-earth policy left little grazing land. One hundred of the cavalry that had joined Smuts were therefore too weak to continue and so Smuts had to leave these men with General Kritzinger. Intelligence indicated that at this time Smuts had about 3,000 men.

To end the conflict, Smuts sought to take a major target, the copper-mining town of Okiep in the present-day Northern Cape Province (April–May 1902). With a full assault impossible, Smuts packed a train full of explosives, and tried to push it downhill, into the town, in order to bring the enemy garrison to its knees. Although this failed, Smuts had proved his point: that he would stop at nothing to defeat his enemies. Norman Kemp Smith wrote that General Smuts read from Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; on the evening before the raid. Smith contended that this showed how Kant&#x27;s critique can be a solace and a refuge, as well as a means to sharpen the wit. Combined with the British failure to pacify the Transvaal, Smuts&#x27;s success left the United Kingdom with no choice but to offer a ceasefire and a peace conference, to be held at Vereeniging.

Before the conference, Smuts met Lord Kitchener at Kroonstad station, where they discussed the proposed terms of surrender. Smuts then took a leading role in the negotiations between the representatives from all of the commandos from the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (15–31 May 1902). Although he admitted that, from a purely military perspective, the war could continue, he stressed the importance of not sacrificing the Afrikaner people for that independence. He was very conscious that &quot;more than 20,000 women and children have already died in the concentration camps of the enemy&quot;. He felt it would have been a crime to continue the war without the assurance of help from elsewhere and declared, &quot;Comrades, we decided to stand to the bitter end. Let us now, like men, admit that that end has come for us, come in a more bitter shape than we ever thought.&quot; His opinions were representative of the conference, which then voted by 54 to 6 in favour of peace. Representatives of the Governments met Lord Kitchener and at five minutes past eleven on 31 May 1902, the Acting State President of the South African Republic, Schalk Willem Burger signed the Treaty of Vereeniging, followed by the members of his government, Acting State President of the Orange Free State, Christiaan De Wet, and the members of his government.

===A British Transvaal===

Despite Smuts&#x27;s exploits as a general and a negotiator, nothing could mask the fact that the Boers had been defeated. Lord Milner had full control of all South African affairs, and established an Anglophone elite, known as Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. As an Afrikaner, Smuts was excluded. Defeated but not deterred, in January 1905, he decided to join with the other former Transvaal generals to form a political party, &quot;Het Volk&quot; (&#x27;The People&#x27;), to fight for the Afrikaner cause. Louis Botha was elected leader, and Smuts his deputy.

When his term of office expired, Milner was replaced as High Commissioner by the more conciliatory Lord Selborne. Smuts saw an opportunity and pounced, urging Botha to persuade the Liberals to support &quot;Het Volk&#x27;s&quot; cause. When the Conservative government under Arthur Balfour collapsed, in December 1905, the decision paid off. Smuts joined Botha in London, and sought to negotiate full self-government for the Transvaal within British South Africa. Using the thorny political issue of South Asian labourers (&#x27;coolies&#x27;), the South Africans convinced Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and, with him, the cabinet and Parliament.

Through 1906, Smuts worked on the new constitution for the Transvaal, and, in December 1906, elections were held for the Transvaal parliament. Despite being shy and reserved, unlike the showman Botha, Smuts won a comfortable victory in the Wonderboom constituency, near Pretoria. His victory was one of many, with &quot;Het Volk&quot; winning in a landslide and Botha forming the government. To reward his loyalty and efforts, Smuts was given two key cabinet positions: Colonial Secretary and Education Secretary.

Smuts proved to be an effective leader, if unpopular. As Education Secretary, he had fights with the Dutch Reformed Church, of which he had once been a dedicated member, which demanded Calvinist teachings in schools. As Colonial Secretary, he opposed a movement for equal rights for South Asian workers, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

During the years of Transvaal self-government, nobody could avoid the predominant political debate of the day: South African unification. Ever since the British victory in the war, it was an inevitability, but it remained up to the South Africans to decide what sort of country would be formed, and how it would be formed. Smuts favoured a unitary state, with power centralised in Pretoria, with English as the only official language, and with a more inclusive electorate. To impress upon his compatriots his vision, he called a constitutional convention in Durban, in October 1908.

There, Smuts was up against a hard-talking Orange River Colony delegation, who refused every one of Smuts&#x27;s demands. Smuts had successfully predicted this opposition, and their objections, and tailored his own ambitions appropriately. He allowed compromise on the location of the capital, on the official language, and on suffrage, but he refused to budge on the fundamental structure of government. As the convention drew into autumn, the Orange leaders began to see a final compromise as necessary to secure the concessions that Smuts had already made. They agreed to Smuts&#x27;s draft South African constitution, which was duly ratified by the South African colonies. Smuts and Botha took the constitution to London, where it was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent by King Edward VII in December 1909.

===The Old Boers===

The Union of South Africa was born, and the Afrikaners held the key to political power, as the majority of the increasingly whites-only electorate. Although Botha was appointed prime minister of the new country, Smuts was given three key ministries: Interior, Mines, and Defence. Undeniably, Smuts was the second most powerful man in South Africa. To solidify their dominance of South African politics, the Afrikaners united to form the South African Party, a new pan-South African Afrikaner party.

The harmony and co-operation soon ended. Smuts was criticised for his overarching powers, and the cabinet was reshuffled. Smuts lost Interior and Mines, but gained control of Finance. That was still too much for Smuts&#x27;s opponents, who decried his possession of both Defence and Finance, two departments that were usually at loggerheads. At the 1913 South African Party conference, the Old Boers (Hertzog, Steyn, De Wet), called for Botha and Smuts to step down. The two narrowly survived a confidence vote, and the troublesome triumvirate stormed out, leaving the party for good.

With the schism in internal party politics came a new threat to the mines that brought South Africa its wealth. A small-scale miners&#x27; dispute flared into a full-blown strike, and rioting broke out in Johannesburg after Smuts intervened heavy-handedly. After police shot dead twenty-one strikers, Smuts and Botha headed unaccompanied to Johannesburg to resolve the situation personally. Facing down threats to their own lives, they negotiated a cease-fire. But the cease-fire did not hold, and in 1914, a railway strike turned into a general strike. Threats of a revolution caused Smuts to declare martial law. He acted ruthlessly, deporting union leaders without trial and using Parliament to absolve him and the government of any blame retroactively. That was too much for the Old Boers, who set up their own National Party to fight the all-powerful Botha-Smuts partnership.

===First World War===
During the First World War, Smuts formed the Union Defence Force (UDF). His first task was to suppress the Maritz Rebellion, which was accomplished by November 1914. Next he and Louis Botha led the South African army into German South-West Africa and conquered it (see the South-West Africa Campaign for details). In 1916 General Smuts was put in charge of the conquest of German East Africa. Col (later BGen) J. H. V. Crowe commanded the artillery in East Africa under General Smuts and published an account of the campaign, &quot;General Smuts&#x27; Campaign in East Africa&quot; in 1918. Smuts was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 18 February 1916, and to honorary lieutenant general for distinguished service in the field on 1 January 1917.

Smuts&#x27;s chief intelligence officer, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, wrote very critically of his conduct of the campaign. He believed Horace Smith-Dorrien (who had saved the British Army during the retreat from Mons and was the original choice as commander in 1916) would have quickly defeated the Germans. In particular, Meinertzhagen thought that frontal attacks would have been decisive, and less costly than the flanking movements preferred by Smuts, which took longer, so that thousands of Imperial troops died of disease in the field. He wrote: &quot;Smuts has cost Britain many hundreds of lives and many millions of pounds by his caution... Smuts was not an astute soldier; a brilliant statesman and politician but no soldier.&quot; Meinertzhagen wrote these comments in October/November 1916, in the weeks after being relieved by Smuts due to symptoms of depression, and he was invalided back to England shortly thereafter.

Early in 1917, Smuts left Africa and went to London, as he had been invited to join the Imperial War Cabinet and the War Policy Committee by David Lloyd George. Smuts initially recommended renewed Western Front attacks and a policy of attrition, lest with Russian commitment to the war wavering, France or Italy would be tempted to make a separate peace. Lloyd George wanted a commander &quot;of the dashing type&quot; for the Middle East in succession to Murray, but Smuts refused the command (late May) unless promised resources for a decisive victory, and he agreed with Robertson that Western Front commitments did not justify a serious attempt to capture Jerusalem. Allenby was appointed instead. Like other members of the War Cabinet, Smuts&#x27;s commitment to Western Front efforts was shaken by Third Ypres.

In 1917, following the German Gotha Raids, and lobbying by Viscount French, Smuts wrote a review of the British Air Services, which came to be called the Smuts Report. He was helped in large part in this by General Sir David Henderson who was seconded to him. This report led to the treatment of air as a separate force, which eventually became the Royal Air Force.

By mid-January 1918, Lloyd George was toying with the idea of appointing Smuts Commander-in-Chief of all land and sea forces facing the Ottoman Empire, reporting directly to the War Cabinet rather than to Robertson. Early in 1918, Smuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and Marshall, and prepare for major efforts in that theatre. Before his departure, alienated by Robertson&#x27;s exaggerated estimates of the required reinforcements, he urged Robertson&#x27;s removal. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson&#x27;s private instructions (sent by hand of Walter Kirke, appointed by Robertson as Smuts&#x27;s adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance. He worked with Smuts to draw up plans, using three reinforcement divisions from Mesopotamia, to reach Haifa by June and Damascus by the autumn, the speed of the advance limited by the need to lay fresh rail track. This was the foundation of Allenby&#x27;s successful offensive later in the year.

Like most British Empire political and military leaders in the First World War, Smuts thought the American Expeditionary Forces lacked the proper leadership and experience to be effective quickly. He supported the Anglo-French amalgamation policy towards the Americans. In particular, he had a low opinion of General John J. Pershing&#x27;s leadership skills, so much so that he proposed to Lloyd George that Pershing be relieved of command and US forces be placed &quot;under someone more confident, like [himself]&quot;. This did not endear him to the Americans once it was leaked.

===Statesman===
Smuts and Botha were key negotiators at the Paris Peace Conference. Both were in favour of reconciliation with Germany and limited reparations. Smuts was a key architect of the League of Nations through his correspondences with Woodrow Wilson, his work with the Imperial War Cabinet during the First World War and his book &quot;League of Nations: A Practical Suggestion&quot;. According to Jacob Kripp, Smuts saw the League as necessary in unifying white internationalists and pacifying a race war through indirect rule by Europeans over non-whites and segregation. Kripp states that the League of Nations mandates system reflected a compromise between Smuts&#x27;s desire to annex non-white territories and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s principles of trusteeship.

He was sent to Budapest to negotiate with Béla Kun&#x27;s Hungarian Soviet Republic. This was in the wake of issues around the neutral zone the Entente dictated in the Vix Note. Smuts arrived on 4 April 1919, and negotiations started the next day. He offered a neutral zone more favorable to Hungary (shifted 25 km east), though making sure its western border passes west of the final border proposal worked in the Commission on Romanian and Yugoslav Affairs, that the Hungarian leaders were unaware of. Smuts reassured the Hungarians that the agreement would not influence Hungary&#x27;s final borders. He also teased the lifting of the economic blockade of the country and inviting the Hungarian soviet leaders to the Paris Peace Conference. Kun rejected the terms, and demanded the return to the Belgrade armistice line later that day, upon which Smuts ended negotiations and left. On 8 April he negotiated with Masaryk in Prague over the Hungarian border. Hungary&#x27;s rejection led to the conference&#x27;s approval of a Czechoslovak-Romanian invasion and harsher terms in the Treaty of Trianon. 

The Treaty of Versailles gave South Africa a Class C mandate over German South-West Africa (which later became Namibia), which was occupied from 1919 until withdrawal in 1990. At the same time, Australia was given a similar mandate over German New Guinea, which it held until 1975. Both Smuts and the Australian Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, feared the rising power of the Japanese Empire in the post First World War world. When the former German East Africa was divided into two mandated territories (Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika), &quot;Smutsland&quot; was one of the proposed names for what became Tanganyika. Smuts, who had called for South African territorial expansion all the way to the River Zambesi since the late 19th century, was ultimately disappointed with the League awarding South-West Africa only a mandate status, as he had looked forward to formally incorporating the territory to South Africa. 

Smuts returned to South African politics after the conference. When Botha died in 1919, Smuts was elected prime minister, serving until a shocking defeat in 1924 at the hands of the National Party. After the death of the former American President Woodrow Wilson, Smuts was quoted as saying that: &quot;Not Wilson, but humanity failed at Paris.&quot;

While in Britain for an Imperial Conference in June 1921, Smuts went to Ireland and met Éamon de Valera to help broker an armistice and peace deal between the warring British and Irish nationalists. Smuts attempted to sell the concept of Ireland receiving Dominion status similar to that of Australia and South Africa.

During his first premiership Smuts was involved in a number of controversies. The first was the Rand Revolt of March 1921, where aeroplanes were used to bomb white miners who were striking in opposition to proposals to allow non-whites to do more skilled and semi-skilled work previously reserved to whites only. Smuts was accused of siding with the Rand Lords who wanted the removal of the colour bar in the hope that it would lower wage costs. The white miners perpetrated acts of violence across the Rand, including murderous attacks on non-Europeans, conspicuously on African miners in their compounds, and this culminated in a general assault on the police. Smuts declared martial law and suppressed the insurrection in three days – at a cost of 291 police and army deaths, and 396 civilians killed. A Martial Law Commission was established which found that Smuts used larger forces than were strictly required, but had saved lives by doing so.

The second was the Bulhoek Massacre of 24 May 1921, when at Bulhoek in the eastern Cape eight hundred South African policemen and soldiers armed with maxim machine guns and two field artillery guns killed 163 and wounded 129 members of an indigenous religious sect known as &quot;Israelites&quot; who had been armed with knobkerries, assegais and swords and who had refused to vacate land they regarded as holy to them. Casualties on the government side at Bulhoek amounted to one trooper wounded and one horse killed. Once again, there were charges of the unnecessary use of overwhelming force. However, no commission of enquiry was appointed.

The third was the Bondelswarts Rebellion, in which Smuts supported the actions of the South African Administration in attacking the Bondelswarts in South West Africa. The mandatory administration moved to crush what they called a rebellion of 500 to 600 people, of which 200 were said to be armed (although only about 40 weapons were captured after the Bondelswarts were crushed). Gysbert Hofmeyr, the Mandatory Administrator, organised 400 armed men, and sent in aircraft to bomb the Bondelswarts. Casualties included 100 Bondelswart deaths, including a few women and children. A further 468 men were either wounded or taken prisoner. South Africa&#x27;s international reputation was tarnished. Ruth First, a South African anti-apartheid activist and scholar, describes the Bondelswarts shooting as &quot;the Sharpeville of the 1920s&quot;.

As a botanist, Smuts collected plants extensively over southern Africa. He went on several botanical expeditions in the 1920s and 1930s with John Hutchinson, former botanist-in-charge of the African section of the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens and taxonomist of note. Smuts was a keen mountaineer and supporter of mountaineering. One of his favourite rambles was up Table Mountain along a route now known as Smuts&#x27; Track. In February 1923 he unveiled a memorial to members of the Mountain Club who had been killed in the First World War.

In 1925, assessing Smuts&#x27;s role in international affairs, African-American historian and Pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in an article which would be incorporated into the pivotal Harlem Renaissance text &quot;The New Negro&quot;,

Jan Smuts is today, in his world aspects, the greatest protagonist of the white race. He is fighting to take control of Laurenço Marques from a nation that recognizes, even though it does not realize, the equality of black folk; he is fighting to keep India from political and social equality in the empire; he is fighting to insure the continued and eternal subordination of black to white in Africa; and he is fighting for peace and good will in a white Europe which can by union present a united front to the yellow, brown and black worlds. In all this he expresses bluntly, and yet not without finesse, what a powerful host of white folk believe but do not plainly say in Melbourne, New Orleans, San Francisco, Hongkong, Berlin, and London.

In December 1934, Smuts told an audience at the Royal Institute of International Affairs that:

How can the inferiority complex which is obsessing and, I fear, poisoning the mind, and indeed the very soul of Germany, be removed? There is only one way and that is to recognise her complete equality of status with her fellows and to do so frankly, freely and unreservedly ... While one understands and sympathises with French fears, one cannot, but feel for Germany in the prison of inferiority in which she still remains sixteen years after the conclusion of the war. The continuance of the Versailles status is becoming an offence to the conscience of Europe and a danger to future peace ... Fair play, sportsmanship—indeed every standard of private and public life—calls for frank revision of the situation. Indeed ordinary prudence makes it imperative. Let us break these bonds and set the complexed-obsessed soul free in a decent human way and Europe will reap a rich reward in tranquility, security and returning prosperity.

Though in his Rectorial Address delivered on 17 October 1934 at St Andrews University he stated that:

The new Tyranny, disguised in attractive patriotic colours, is enticing youth everywhere into its service. Freedom must make a great counterstroke to save itself and our fair western civilisation. Once more the heroic call is coming to our youth. The fight for human freedom is indeed the supreme issue of the future, as it has always been.

===Second World War===
After nine years in opposition and academia, Smuts returned as deputy prime minister in a &#x27;grand coalition&#x27; government under J. B. M. Hertzog. When Hertzog advocated neutrality towards Nazi Germany in 1939, the coalition split and Hertzog&#x27;s motion to remain out of the war was defeated in Parliament by a vote of 80 to 67. Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan refused Hertzog&#x27;s request to dissolve parliament for a general election on the issue. Hertzog resigned and Duncan invited Smuts, Hertzog&#x27;s coalition partner, to form a government and become prime minister for the second time in order to lead the country into the Second World War on the side of the Allies.

On 24 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a field marshal of the British Army.

Smuts&#x27;s importance to the Imperial war effort was emphasised by a quite audacious plan, proposed as early as 1940, to appoint Smuts as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, should Churchill die or otherwise become incapacitated during the war. This idea was put forward by Sir John Colville, Churchill&#x27;s private secretary, to Queen Mary and then to George VI, both of whom warmed to the idea.

In May 1945, he represented South Africa in San Francisco at the drafting of the United Nations Charter. According to historian Mark Mazower, Smuts &quot;did more than anyone to argue for, and help draft, the UN&#x27;s stirring preamble.&quot; Smuts saw the UN as key to protecting white imperial rule over Africa. Also in 1945, he was mentioned by Halvdan Koht among seven candidates that were qualified for the Nobel Prize in Peace. However, he did not explicitly nominate any of them. The person actually nominated was Cordell Hull.

==Later life==
In domestic policy, a number of social security reforms were carried out during Smuts&#x27;s second period in office as Prime Minister. Old-age pensions and disability grants were extended to &#x27;Indians&#x27; and &#x27;Africans&#x27; in 1944 and 1947 respectively, although there were differences in the level of grants paid out based on race. The Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act of 1941 &quot;insured all employees irrespective of payment of the levy by employers and increased the number of diseases covered by the law,&quot; and the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1946 introduced unemployment insurance on a national scale, albeit with exclusions.

Smuts continued to represent his country abroad. He was a leading guest at the 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
 At home, his preoccupation with the war had severe political repercussions in South Africa. Smuts&#x27;s support of the war and his support for the Fagan Commission made him unpopular amongst the Afrikaner community and Daniel François Malan&#x27;s pro-apartheid stance won the Reunited National Party the 1948 general election.

In 1948, he was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, becoming the first person from outside the United Kingdom to hold that position. He held the position until his death two years later.

He accepted the appointment as Colonel-in-Chief of Regiment Westelike Provinsie as from 17 September 1948.

In 1949, Smuts was bitterly opposed to the London Declaration which transformed British Commonwealth into the Commonwealth of Nations and made it possible for Republics (such as the newly independent India) to remain its members. In the South African context, republicanism was mainly identified with Afrikaner Conservatism and with tighter racial segregation.

==Death==

On 29 May 1950, a week after the public celebration of his eightieth birthday in Johannesburg and Pretoria, Field Marshal Jan Smuts suffered a coronary thrombosis. He died of a subsequent heart attack on his family farm of Doornkloof, Irene, near Pretoria, on 11 September 1950.

==Relations with Churchill==
In 1899, Smuts interrogated the young Winston Churchill, who had been captured by Afrikaners during the Boer War, which was the first time they met. The next time was in 1906, while Smuts was leading a mission about South Africa&#x27;s future to London before Churchill, then Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Cabinet shared Churchill&#x27;s sympathetic view, which led to self-government within the year, followed by dominion status for the Union of South Africa in 1910. Their association continued in the First World War, when Lloyd George appointed Smuts, in 1917, to the war cabinet in which Churchill served as Munitions Minister. By then, both had formed a fast friendship that continued through Churchill&#x27;s &quot;wilderness years&quot; and the Second World War, to Smuts&#x27;s death. Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran, Churchill&#x27;s personal physician, wrote in his diary:

Smuts is the only man who has any influence with the PM; indeed, he is the only ally I have in pressing counsels of common sense on the PM. Smuts sees so clearly that Winston is irreplaceable, that he may make an effort to persuade him to be sensible.

Churchill:

Smuts and I are like two old love-birds moulting together on a perch, but still able to peck.

When Eden said at a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff (29 October 1942) that Montgomery&#x27;s Middle East offensive was &quot;petering out&quot;, after having some late night drinks with Churchill the previous night, Alan Brooke had told Churchill &quot;fairly plainly&quot; what he thought of Eden&#x27;s ability to judge the tactical situation from a distance (Churchill was always impatient for his generals to attack at once). He was supported at the Chiefs of Staff meeting by Smuts. Brooke said he was fortunate to be supported by:

a flow of words from the mouth of that wonderful statesman. It was as if oil had been poured on the troubled waters. The temperamental film-stars returned to their tasks – peace reigned in the dove cot!

==Views==
===Race and segregation===
Smuts and his parties supported existing policies of racial discrimination in South Africa, taking a more moderate and ambiguous stance than the rival National Party, and he later endorsed the relatively liberal proposals of the Fagan Commission.

At the Imperial Conference of 1925 Smuts stated:

Smuts was, for most of his political life, a vocal supporter of segregation of the races, and in 1929 he justified the erection of separate institutions for black and white people in tones prescient of the later practice of apartheid:

In general, Smuts&#x27;s view of black Africans was patronising: he saw them as immature human beings who needed the guidance of whites, an attitude that reflected the common perceptions of most westerners in his lifetime. Of black Africans he stated that:

Although Gandhi and Smuts were adversaries in many ways, they had a mutual respect and even admiration for each other. Before Gandhi returned to India in 1914, he presented General Smuts with a pair of sandals (now held by Ditsong National Museum of Cultural History) made by Gandhi himself. In 1939, Smuts, then prime minister, wrote an essay for a commemorative work compiled for Gandhi&#x27;s 70th birthday and returned the sandals with the following message: &quot;I have worn these sandals for many a summer, even though I may feel that I am not worthy to stand in the shoes of so great a man.&quot;

Smuts is often accused of being a politician who extolled the virtues of humanitarianism and liberalism abroad while failing to practise what he preached at home in South Africa. This was most clearly illustrated when India, in 1946, made a formal complaint in the UN concerning the legalised racial discrimination against Indians in South Africa. Appearing personally before the United Nations General Assembly, Smuts defended the policies of his government by fervently pleading that India&#x27;s complaint was a matter of domestic jurisdiction. However, the General Assembly censured South Africa for its racial policies and called upon the Smuts government to bring its treatment of the South African Indians in conformity with the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

At the same conference, the African National Congress President General Alfred Bitini Xuma along with delegates of the South African Indian Congress brought up the issue of the brutality of Smuts&#x27;s police regime against the African Mine Workers&#x27; Strike earlier that year as well as the wider struggle for equality in South Africa.

In 1948, he went further away from his previous views on segregation when supporting the recommendations of the Fagan Commission that Africans should be recognised as permanent residents of White South Africa, and not merely as temporary workers who belonged in the reserves. This was in direct opposition to the policies of the National Party that wished to extend segregation and formalise it into apartheid. There is, however, no evidence that Smuts ever supported the idea of equal political rights for black and white people. Despite this, he did say:

The Fagan Commission did not advocate the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa, but rather wanted to liberalise influx controls of black people into urban areas in order to facilitate the supply of black African labour to the South African industry. It also envisaged a relaxation of the pass laws that had restricted the movement of black South Africans in general.

In the assessment of South African Cambridge professor Saul Dubow, &quot;Smuts&#x27;s views of freedom were always geared to securing the values of western Christian civilization. He was consistent, albeit more flexible than his political contemporaries, in his espousal of white supremacy.&quot;

===Holism and related academic work===
While in academia, Smuts pioneered the concept of holism, which he defined as &quot;[the] fundamental factor operative towards the creation of wholes in the universe&quot; in his 1926 book, &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot;. Smuts&#x27;s formulation of holism has been linked with his political-military activity, especially his aspiration to create a league of nations. As one biographer said:

It had very much in common with his philosophy of life as subsequently developed and embodied in his Holism and Evolution. Small units must develop into bigger wholes, and they in their turn again must grow into larger and ever-larger structures without cessation. Advancement lay along that path. Thus the unification of the four provinces in the Union of South Africa, the idea of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and, finally, the great whole resulting from the combination of the peoples of the earth in a great league of nations were but a logical progression consistent with his philosophical tenets.

===Zionism===
In 1943 Chaim Weizmann wrote to Smuts, detailing a plan to develop Britain&#x27;s African colonies to compete with the United States. During his service as Premier, Smuts personally fundraised for multiple Zionist organisations. His government granted &quot;de facto&quot; recognition to Israel on 24 May 1948. However, Smuts was deputy prime minister when the Hertzog government in 1937 passed the Aliens Act that was aimed at preventing Jewish immigration to South Africa. The act was seen as a response to growing anti-Semitic sentiments among Afrikaners.

Smuts lobbied against the White Paper of 1939, and several streets and a kibbutz, Ramat Yohanan, in Israel are named after him. He also wrote an epitaph for Weizmann, describing him as &quot;the greatest Jew since Moses.&quot; Smuts once said:

==Legacy==
One of his greatest international accomplishments was aiding in the establishment of the League of Nations, the exact design and implementation of which relied upon Smuts. He later urged the formation of a new international organisation for peace – the United Nations. Smuts wrote the first draft of the preamble to the United Nations Charter, and was the only person to sign the charters of both the League of Nations and the UN. He played a key role in the development of trusteeship and the League of Nations mandate system. He sought to redefine the relationship between the United Kingdom and her colonies, helping to establish the British Commonwealth, as it was known at the time. This proved to be a two-way street; in 1946 the General Assembly requested the Smuts government to take measures to bring the treatment of Indians in South Africa into line with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.
In 1932, the kibbutz Ramat Yohanan in Israel was named after him. Smuts was a vocal proponent of the creation of a Jewish state, and spoke out against the rising antisemitism of the 1930s. A street in the German Colony neighbourhood of Jerusalem and a boulevard in Tel Aviv are named in his honour.

In 1917, part of the M27 route in Johannesburg was renamed from &quot;Pretoria Road&quot; to Jan Smuts Avenue.

The international airport serving Johannesburg was known as Jan Smuts Airport from its construction in 1952 until 1994. In 1994, it was renamed to Johannesburg International Airport to remove any political connotations. In 2006, it was renamed again to its current name, OR Tambo International Airport, for the ANC politician Oliver Tambo.

In 2004, Smuts was named by voters in a poll held by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) as one of the top ten Greatest South Africans of all time. The final positions of the top ten were to be decided by a second round of voting but the programme was taken off the air owing to political controversy and Nelson Mandela was given the number one spot based on the first round of voting. In the first round, Field Marshal Smuts came ninth.

Mount Smuts, a peak in the Canadian Rockies, is named after him.

In August 2019, the South African Army Regiment Westelike Provinsie was renamed after Smuts as the General Jan Smuts Regiment.

The Smuts House Museum at Smuts&#x27;s home in Irene is dedicated to promoting his legacy.

<text>The Fairey Swordfish is a retired biplane torpedo bomber, designed by the Fairey Aviation Company. Originating in the early 1930s, the Swordfish, nicknamed &quot;Stringbag&quot;, was principally operated by the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. It was also used by the Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as several overseas operators, including the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the Royal Netherlands Navy. It was initially operated primarily as a fleet attack aircraft. During its later years, the Swordfish was increasingly used for anti-submarine and training duties. The type was in frontline service throughout the Second World War.

Despite being obsolescent, the Swordfish achieved some spectacular successes during the war, including sinking one battleship and damaging two others belonging to the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (the Italian navy) during the Battle of Taranto, and the famous attack on the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, which contributed to her eventually being sunk. Swordfishes sank a greater tonnage of Axis shipping than any other Allied aircraft during the war. The Swordfish remained in front-line service until V-E Day, having outlived some of the aircraft intended to replace it.

==Development==

===Origins===
In 1933 Fairey, who were experienced in the design and construction of naval aircraft, began development of an entirely new three-seat naval aircraft, intended for the twin roles of aerial reconnaissance and torpedo bomber. Receiving the internal designation of &quot;T.S.R. I&quot;, standing for &quot;Torpedo-Spotter-Reconnaissance I&quot;, the proposed design was a biplane powered by a single 645 hp Bristol Pegasus IIM radial engine. The company initially chose to pursue the project as a self-financed private venture while both customers and applicable requirements for the type were sought. Development of the T.S.R. I was in parallel to Fairey&#x27;s activities upon Air Ministry Specification S.9/30, for which the company was at one point developing a separate but broadly similar aircraft, but powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine and having a different fin and rudder configuration.
Significant contributions to the T.S.R.I&#x27;s development came from Fairey&#x27;s independent design work on a proposed aircraft for the Greek Naval Air Service, which had asked for a replacement for the Fairey IIIF Mk.IIIB, and from British Air Ministry specifications M.1/30 and S.9/30. Fairey promptly informed the Air Ministry of its work for the Greeks, whose interest had waned, and proposed its solution to the requirements for a spotter-reconnaissance plane (&quot;spotter&quot; referring to the activity of observing and directing a warship&#x27;s Fall of shot). In 1934 the Air Ministry issued the more advanced Specification S.15/33, which added the torpedo bomber role.

The prototype, &quot;F1875&quot;, made its maiden flight from Great West Aerodrome, Heathrow on 21 March 1933, flown by Chris Staniland. F1875 made various flights, including several while re-engined with an Armstrong Siddeley Tiger radial engine before it was refitted with the Pegasus engine. On 11 September 1933, F1875 was lost during a series of spinning tests in which it became unable to recover; the pilot survived the incident. Prior to this, the prototype had exhibited favourable performance, which contributed to the subsequent decision to proceed with the more advanced &quot;T.S.R II&quot; prototype, which had been specifically developed to conform with the newly issued Specification S.15/33.

On 17 April 1934, the prototype T.S.R II, &quot;K4190&quot;, made its first flight, flown by Staniland. Compared to the previous prototype, K4190 had a more powerful version of the Pegasus, an additional bay in the rear fuselage to counteract spin tendencies, and the upper wing was slightly swept back to account for the increased length of the fuselage. During the ensuing flight test programme, K4190 was transferred to Fairey&#x27;s factory in Hamble-le-Rice, Hampshire, where it was fitted with a twin-float undercarriage in place of its original land-only counterpart; on 10 November 1934, the first flight of K4190 in this new configuration was performed. Following successful water-handling trials, K4190 conducted a series of aircraft catapult and recovery tests aboard the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;. K4190 was later restored to its wheeled undercarriage prior to an extensive evaluation process by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath.

In 1935, following the successful completion of testing at Martlesham, an initial pre-production order for three aircraft was placed by the Air Ministry; it was at this point that the T.S.R II received the name &quot;Swordfish&quot;. All three pre-production aircraft were powered by the Pegasus IIIM3 engine, but had a three-bladed Fairey-Reed propeller in place of the two-bladed propeller used on the prototype. On 31 December 1935 the first pre-production Swordfish, &quot;K5660&quot;, made its maiden flight. On 19 February 1936, the second pre-production aircraft, &quot;K5661&quot;, became the first to be delivered; the final pre-production aircraft, &quot;K5662&quot;, was completed as a floatplane configuration and underwent water-based service trials at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe, Suffolk.

===Production and further development===
In early 1936 a production contract for 68 aircraft was received, as the &quot;Swordfish I&quot;. Manufactured at Fairey&#x27;s factory in Hayes, West London, the first production aircraft was completed in early 1936 and the type entered service with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in July 1936. By early 1940, Fairey was busy with the Swordfish and other types such as the new Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber. The Admiralty approached Blackburn Aircraft with a proposal that manufacture of the Swordfish be transferred to the them; Blackburn then set up a new fabrication and assembly facility in Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire. Less than a year later, the first Blackburn-built Swordfish made its first flight. During 1941 the Sherburn factory assumed primary responsibility for the fuselage, along with final assembly and testing of finished aircraft.

Efforts were made to disperse production and to use shadow factories to minimise the damage caused by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing raids. Major sub-assemblies were produced by four subcontractors based in neighbouring Leeds. Initial deliveries from Sherburn were completed to the Swordfish I standard; from 1943 onwards, the improved &quot;Swordfish II&quot; and &quot;Swordfish III&quot; came into production and superseded the original model. The Swordfish II carried ASV Mk. II radar and the lower wings had metal undersurfaces to allow the use of 3-inch rockets. Later-built models also had the more powerful Pegasus XXX engine. The Swordfish III was fitted with centimetric ASV Mk.XI radar mounted between the undercarriage legs, precluding carrying torpedoes, and retained the Pegasus XXX powerplant.

Production of the Swordfish ended on 18 August 1944. Almost 2,400 aircraft had been built, 692 having been constructed by Fairey and a further 1,699 by Blackburn at their Sherburn facility. The most numerous version of the Swordfish was the Mark II, of which 1,080 were completed.

==Design==
The Fairey Swordfish was a medium-sized biplane torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft with a fabric-covered metal airframe. It had folding wings. In service, it received the nickname &quot;Stringbag&quot;; this was not due to its profusion of struts, spars, and braces, but a reference to the seemingly endless variety of stores and equipment that the type was cleared to carry. Crews likened the aircraft to a housewife&#x27;s string shopping bag, common at the time and which could accommodate contents of any shape.

The primary weapon of the Swordfish was the aerial torpedo, but the low speed of the aircraft and the need for a long straight approach made it difficult to attack well-defended targets. Swordfish torpedo doctrine called for an approach at followed by a dive to torpedo release altitude of . Maximum range of the early Mark XII torpedo was at and at . The torpedo travelled forward from release to water impact, and needed another to stabilise at preset depth and arm itself. Ideal release distance was from the target.

The Swordfish could also be used as a dive-bomber. During 1939, Swordfish on board HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; participated in a series of dive-bombing trials, during which 439 practice bombs were dropped at dive angles of 60, 67 and 70 degrees, against the target ship HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;. Tests against a stationary target showed an average error of from a release height of and a dive angle of 70 degrees; tests against a manoeuvring target showed an average error of from a drop height of and a dive angle of 60 degrees.

After more modern torpedo attack aircraft were developed, the Swordfish was redeployed successfully in an anti-submarine role, armed with depth charges or eight 60 lb (27 kg) RP-3 rockets and flying from the smaller escort carriers, or even merchant aircraft carriers (MACs) when equipped for rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO). Its low stall speed and inherently tough design made it ideal for operation from the MACs in the often severe mid-Atlantic weather. Indeed, its takeoff and landing speeds were so low that, unlike most carrier-based aircraft, it did not require the carrier to be steaming into the wind. On occasion, when the wind was right, Swordfish were flown from a carrier at anchor.

==Operational history==

===Introduction===

In July 1936, the Swordfish entered service with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), which was then part of the RAF; 825 Naval Air Squadron was the first squadron to receive the type. The Swordfish began replacing both the Fairey Seal in the spotter-reconnaissance role and the Blackburn Baffin in the torpedo bomber role, competing with the Blackburn Shark in the combined role. Initially, the Shark replaced the Seal in the spotter-reconnaissance squadrons and the Swordfish replaced the Baffin in torpedo squadron, after which the Shark was quickly replaced by the Swordfish. For nearly two years during the late 1930s, the Swordfish was the sole torpedo bomber aircraft used by the FAA.

By the eve of war in September 1939, the FAA, which had been transferred to Royal Navy control, had 13 operational squadrons equipped with the Swordfish I. There were also three flights of Swordfish equipped with floats, for use with catapult-equipped warships. After the outbreak of the Second World War, 26 FAA Squadrons were equipped with the Swordfish. More than 20 second-line squadrons also operated the Swordfish for training. During the early months of the war, the Swordfish operated in mostly uneventful fleet protection and convoy escort missions.

===Norwegian Campaign===

The Swordfish first saw combat on 11 April 1940, during the Norwegian Campaign. Several Swordfish aircraft were launched from the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Furious&quot; to torpedo several German vessels reported to be anchoring at Trondheim. The Swordfish found only two enemy destroyers at Trondheim, scoring one hit in the first attack of the war by torpedo-carrying aircraft.

On 13 April 1940, just before the Second Battle of Narvik, a Swordfish floatplane was launched from the battleship to search for Germans ships. The crew reported seeing several German destroyers, and also spotted the anchored close to the shore in Herjangsfjord. They dived to and dropped two anti-submarine bombs; one hit and sank the submarine. This was the first U-boat to be destroyed by an FAA aircraft in the war. Later that day a force of ten Swordfish were dispatched from HMS &quot;Furious&quot; to attack the German destroyers with 250lb bombs. They scored no hits and two aircraft were shot down; the crew of one were lost and the crew of the other were picked up after making a forced landing. During the battle, eight German destroyers were sunk or scuttled with no British ships lost.

After the Second Battle of Narvik, Swordfish continually bombed ships, land facilities, and parked enemy aircraft around Narvik. Anti-submarine patrols and aerial reconnaissance missions were also flown despite difficult terrain and inhospitable weather, which proved especially challenging for aircrew in the Swordfish&#x27;s open cockpit. For many Swordfish crews, this campaign marked their first combat missions and nighttime landings upon aircraft carriers.

===Mediterranean operations===

On 14 June 1940, soon after the Italian declaration of war, nine Swordfish of 767 Naval Air Squadron stationed in Hyeres, Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, France took off for the first Allied bombing raid upon Italian soil. Four days later, 767 Squadron relocated to Bone, Algeria before being split, the training elements returning to Britain while the operational portion proceeded to RAF Hal Far on Malta, where it was re-numbered as 830 Naval Air Squadron. On 30 June, operations re-commenced with an opening night raid upon oil tanks at Augusta, Sicily.

On 3 July 1940, the Swordfish was one of the main weapons used during the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir, an attack by the Royal Navy upon the French Navy fleet stationed at Oran, French Algeria to prevent the vessels falling into German hands. Twelve Swordfish from 810 and 820 Naval Air Squadrons launched from the aircraft carrier and made three sorties against the anchored fleet. The torpedo attack, which crippled the French battleship &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and damaged other vessels, demonstrated that capital ships could be effectively attacked while in harbour; it was also the first time in history that the Royal Navy had won a battle without the use of gunfire.

Shortly after Mers-el-Kébir a detachment of three Swordfish were sent to support British Army operations in the Western Desert in response to a request for torpedo aircraft to destroy hostile naval units operating off the coast of Libya. On 22 August the three aircraft destroyed two U-boats, one destroyer and a replenishment ship in the Gulf of Bomba, Libya, using only three torpedoes.

On 11 November 1940 Swordfish flying from achieved great success in the Battle of Taranto. The main fleet of the Italian Navy was based at Taranto in southern Italy; in light of the success of the earlier attack upon the French Navy at Mers-el-Kébir, members of the Admiralty sought another victory under similar conditions. The Royal Navy had conducted extensive preparations, with some planning having taken place as early as 1938, when war between the European powers had already seemed inevitable. Regular aerial reconnaissance missions were flown to gather intelligence on the positions of specific capital ships and Swordfish crews were intensively trained for night flying operations, as an undetected aerial attack during the night raid had been judged to be the only effective method of reasonably overcoming the defences of the well-protected harbour and to strike at the fleet anchored there.

Originally scheduled for 21 October 1940, the Taranto raid was delayed until 11 November to allow for reinforcements to arrive and other commitments to be met. The aerial attack started with flares being dropped to illuminate the harbour, after which the Swordfish began bomb and torpedo runs. Due to the presence of barrage balloons and torpedo nets restricting the number of suitable torpedo-dropping positions, many of the Swordfish had been armed with bombs and made a synchronised attack upon the cruisers and destroyers instead. The six torpedo-armed Swordfish inflicted serious damage on three of the battleships. Two cruisers, two destroyers and other vessels were damaged or sunk. The high manoeuvrability of the Swordfish enabled the aircraft to evade intense anti-aircraft fire and hit the Italian ships. The Battle of Taranto firmly established that naval aircraft were independently capable of immobilising an entire fleet and were therefore an effective means of altering the balance of power. The Japanese assistant naval attaché to Berlin, Takeshi Naito, visited Taranto to view the consequences of the attack; he later briefed the staff who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor.

On 28 March 1941, a pair of Swordfish based at Crete contributed to the disabling of the Italian cruiser &quot;Pola&quot; during the Battle of Cape Matapan.

In May 1941 six Swordfish based at Shaibah, near Basra, Iraq, participated in the suppression of a revolt in the region, widely known now as the Anglo-Iraqi War. The aircraft made dive bombing attacks on Iraqi barracks, fuel storage tanks and bridges.

The Swordfish also made many anti-shipping sorties in the Mediterranean, many being based at Malta. Guided by aerial reconnaissance, the attacks were timed to arrive at enemy convoys in the dark to elude German fighters, which were restricted to daytime operations. While there were never more than a total of 27 Swordfish aircraft stationed on the island at any one time, the type succeeded in sinking an average of 50,000 tons of enemy shipping per month over a nine-month period. During one record month, 98,000 tons of shipping were reportedly lost to the island&#x27;s Swordfish. The recorded Swordfish losses were low, especially considering the high sortie rate of the aircraft and the lack of any blind-flying equipment, making night flying even more hazardous.

===Atlantic operations===

In May 1941, Swordfish helped pursue and sink the German battleship . On 24 May, nine Swordfish from flew a late night sortie against the &quot;Bismarck&quot; under deteriorating weather conditions. Using ASV radar, the flight were able to spot and attack the ship, resulting in a single torpedo hit that only caused minor damage.

On 26 May, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched two Swordfish strikes against &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The first failed to locate the ship. The second attack scored two torpedo hits, one of which jammed the ship&#x27;s rudders at a 12° port helm. This made &quot;Bismarck&quot; unmanoeuvrable and unable to escape to port in France. She sank after intense Royal Navy attack within 13 hours. Some of the Swordfish flew so low that most of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s flak weapons could not depress enough to hit them.

Throughout 1942, the Swordfish was progressively transferred away from the Royal Navy&#x27;s fleet carriers as newer strike aircraft, such as the Fairey Albacore and Fairey Barracuda, were introduced. In the submarine-hunter role, the Swordfish contributed to the Battle of the Atlantic, detecting and attacking the roaming U-boat packs that preyed upon merchant shipping between Britain and North America and in support of the Arctic convoys which delivered supplies from Britain to Russia. Swordfish attacked submarines directly and guided destroyers to their locations. During one convoy battle, Swordfish from the escort carrier and flew over 1,000 hours on anti-submarine patrols in 10 days.

One of the more innovative uses of the Swordfish was its role with merchant aircraft carriers (&quot;MAC ships&quot;). These were 20 civilian cargo or tanker ships modified to carry three or four aircraft each on anti-submarine duties with convoys. Three of these vessels were Dutch-manned, and several Swordfish of 860 (Dutch) Naval Air Squadron were typically deployed on board. The others were manned by aircrew from 836 Naval Air Squadron. At one time this was the largest squadron operating the type, with 91 aircraft.

===Indian Ocean===
In March and April 1941, during the East African campaign, Swordfish from HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s 813 and 824 Naval Air Squadrons, operating from shore bases, were used against Italian land and naval targets in Massawa, East Africa. On 2 April 1941 four Italian destroyers, attempting to escape from Massawa, were attacked at sea by the Swordfish; the &quot;Nazario Sauro&quot; and &quot;Daniele Manin&quot; were sunk in dive-bombing attacks. The other two Italian destroyers, &quot;Pantera&quot; and &quot;Tigre&quot; were heavily damaged and driven ashore at Jedda and later destroyed by HMS &quot;Kingston&quot;.

In 1942, Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons on HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; took part in the Battle of Madagascar. They dropped dummy paratroopers in support of the initial landings. They later conducted anti-ship and anti-submarine operations in Diego Suarez Bay and bombed land targets in support of land operations during Operation Ironclad. In the later Operation Jane, Swordfish were ready to support the attack on Tamatave, but in the event the town surrendered before they were needed.

===Home front===
During early 1940, Swordfish aircraft of 812 Squadron under RAF Coastal Command started a campaign against enemy ports along the English Channel. The aircraft routinely sortied to drop naval mines near such harbours. To increase range, additional fuel tanks were installed in the crew area and the third crew member was left behind. RAF fighters often provided aerial cover where possible and occasionally counterattacked enemy air bases.

The intensity of Coastal Command&#x27;s Swordfish operations was drastically increased after the German invasion of the Low Countries, expanding to involve four Swordfish-equipped squadrons. Typically flying from Detling, Thorney Island, North Coates and St Eval, Swordfish crews were dispatched to strike strategic targets off the coasts of Netherlands and Belgium in daylight raids, during which they braved anti-aircraft fire and interception by Luftwaffe fighter aircraft. Night time bombing raids were conducted against oil installations, power stations, and aerodromes. After the Allied defeat in the Battle of France and the signing of the French Armistice of 22 June 1940, Swordfish focused their activities against ports that might be used for a German invasion of the United Kingdom This included security patrols and spotting for naval bombardments.

In February 1942, the shortcomings of the Swordfish were starkly demonstrated during a German naval movement known as the Channel Dash. Six Swordfish led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde flew from Manston to intercept the battleships and as they traversed the English Channel towards Germany. When the Swordfish formation began their attack run, approaching astern of the ships, the Swordfish were intercepted by about 15 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter aircraft; the fight was extremely one-sided, quickly resulting in the loss of all Swordfish while no damage was inflicted upon the ships themselves. The lack of fighter cover was a contributing factor for the heavy losses; only 10 of 84 promised fighters were available. Thirteen of the 18 Swordfish crew involved were killed. Esmonde, who had previously led an attack on &quot;Bismarck&quot;, was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously.
The courage of the Swordfish crews was noted by commanders on both sides. British Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay wrote &quot;In my opinion the gallant sortie of these six Swordfish aircraft constitutes one of the finest exhibitions of self-sacrifice and devotion to duty the war had ever witnessed&quot;. German Vice-Admiral Otto Ciliax remarked on &quot;the mothball attack of a handful of ancient planes, piloted by men whose bravery surpasses any other action by either side that day.&quot;

However, as a result of this incident, Swordfish were quickly withdrawn from the torpedo-bomber role in favour of more anti-submarine duties. Armed with depth charges and rockets, the aircraft were good submarine killers.

In the anti-submarine role, the Swordfish pioneered the naval use of air to surface vessel (ASV) radar, allowing the aircraft to effectively locate surface ships at night and through clouds. Swordfish were flying missions with the radar by October 1941. In December 1941, a Swordfish based in Gibraltar located and sank a U-boat, the first such kill to be achieved by an aircraft during nighttime. On 23 May 1943, a rocket-equipped Swordfish destroyed German submarine U-752 off the coast of Ireland, the first kill achieved with this weapon.

===Later use===

Towards the end of the war, No. 119 Squadron RAF operated Swordfish Mark IIIs with centimetric radar from airfields in Belgium. Their main task was to hunt at night for German midget submarines in the North Sea and off the Dutch coast. The radar was able to detect ships at a range of around . One of the aircraft operated by 119 Squadron in this role survives and is part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum (&quot;see Surviving aircraft&quot;).
By 1945, nine front-line squadrons were still equipped with Swordfish. Overall, Swordfish sank 14 U-boats. The Swordfish was intended to be replaced by the Fairey Albacore, also a biplane, but it outlived its intended successor until succeeded by the Fairey Barracuda monoplane torpedo bomber. Operational sorties of the Swordfish continued into January 1945. The last active missions are believed to have been anti-shipping operations off the coast of Norway by FAA Squadrons 835 and 813, where the Swordfish&#x27;s manoeuvrability was essential. The last operational squadron, 836 Naval Air Squadron, which had last been engaged in providing resources for the MAC ships, was disbanded on 21 May 1945, soon after the end of World War II in Europe. In mid-1946, the last training squadron equipped with the type was disbanded, after which only a few remained in service to perform sundry duties at a few naval air stations.

<text>Harris Glenn Milstead (October 19, 1945 – March 7, 1988), better known by the stage name Divine, was an American actor, singer and drag queen. Closely associated with independent filmmaker John Waters, Divine was a character actor, usually performing female roles in cinematic and theatrical productions, and adopted a female drag persona for his music career.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland to a conservative middle-class family, Milstead developed an early interest in drag while working as a women&#x27;s hairdresser. By the mid-1960s he had embraced the city&#x27;s countercultural scene and befriended Waters, who gave him the name &quot;Divine&quot; and the tagline of &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world, almost&quot;. Along with his friend David Lochary, Milstead joined Waters&#x27; acting troupe, the Dreamlanders, and adopted female roles for their experimental short films &quot;Roman Candles&quot; (1966), &quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot; (1969). Again in drag, he took a lead role in both of Waters&#x27; early full-length movies, &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; (1969) and &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; (1970), the latter of which attracted press attention for the group. Milstead next starred in Waters&#x27; &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972), which was a hit on the U.S. midnight movie circuit, became a cult classic and established Milstead&#x27;s fame in the American counterculture.

After starring as the lead role in Waters&#x27; next film, &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1974), Divine moved on to theater, appearing in several avant-garde performances alongside San Francisco drag collective, The Cockettes. He followed this with a performance in Tom Eyen&#x27;s play &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Neon Woman&quot;. Continuing his cinematic work, he starred in two more of Waters&#x27; films, &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981) and &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988), the latter of which represented his breakthrough into mainstream cinema and for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. Independent of Waters, he also appeared in several other films, such as &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; (1985) and &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; (1985), seeking to diversify his repertoire by playing male roles. In 1981, Divine embarked on a career in the disco industry by producing a number of Hi-NRG tracks, most of which were written by Bobby Orlando. He achieved international chart success with hits like &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, all performed in drag.

Described by &quot;People&quot; magazine as the &quot;Drag Queen of the Century&quot;, Divine has remained a cult figure, particularly within the LGBTQ community, and has provided the inspiration for fictional characters, artworks and songs. Various books and documentary films devoted to his life have also been produced, including &quot;Divine Trash&quot; (1998) and &quot;I Am Divine&quot; (2013).

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1945–1965===
Divine was born as Harris Glenn Milstead on October 19, 1945, at Women&#x27;s Hospital in Baltimore. His father, Harris Bernard Milstead (May 1, 1917 – March 4, 1993), after whom he was named, was one of seven children born in Towson, Maryland, to a plumber who worked for the Baltimore City Water Department. Divine&#x27;s mother, Frances Milstead (; April 12, 1920 – March 24, 2009), was one of 15 children born to an impoverished Serb immigrant couple who had grown up near Zagreb (in today&#x27;s Croatia) before moving to the United States in 1891. When she was 16, she moved to Baltimore where she worked at a diner in Towson where she met Harris, a regular customer. After marrying in 1938, they were both hired at the Black &amp; Decker factory in Towson. Due to muscular dystrophy, Harris was not required to join the U.S. armed forces in the Second World War; instead, he and Frances worked through the war years in what they considered &quot;good jobs&quot;. Frances suffered two miscarriages in 1940 and 1943.

By the time of Divine&#x27;s birth in 1945, the Milsteads were affluent and socially conservative Baptists. Describing his upbringing, Divine recollected: &quot;I was an only child in, I guess, your upper middle-class American family. I was probably your American spoiled brat.&quot; His parents lavished almost anything that he wanted on him, including food, and he became overweight, a condition he lived with for the rest of his life. On his request, his parents and friends called him by his middle name, Glenn, to distinguish him from his father.

At age 12, Milstead and his parents moved to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville, where he attended Towson High School, graduating in 1963. Bullied by other students because of his weight and effeminacy, he later reminisced that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t rough and tough&quot; but instead &quot;loved painting and [he] always loved flowers and things&quot;. At age 15, Milstead took a part-time job at a local florist&#x27;s shop. Several years later, he went on a diet and slimmed down from , giving him new confidence. When he was age 17, his parents sent him to a psychiatrist, where he first realized his sexual attraction to men as well as women, something then taboo in conventional American society. He helped out at his parents&#x27; day care business, including dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment at a couple of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other upswept styles. He eventually gave up the job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars. They reluctantly paid the many bills he ran up throwing lavish parties where he dressed in drag as his favorite celebrity, actress Elizabeth Taylor.

===John Waters and first film roles: 1966–1968===
Milstead developed a large coterie of friends, among them David Lochary, who became an actor and costar in several of Divine&#x27;s later films. In the mid-1960s, Milstead befriended John Waters through their mutual friend Carol Wernig; Waters and Milstead were the same age and from the same neighborhood, and both embraced Baltimore&#x27;s countercultural and underground elements. Along with friends like Waters and Lochary, Milstead began hanging out at a beatnik bar in downtown Baltimore named Martick&#x27;s, where they associated with hippies and smoked marijuana, bonding into what Waters described as &quot;a family of sorts&quot;. Waters gave his friends new nicknames, and it was he who first called Milstead &quot;Divine&quot;. Waters later remarked that he had borrowed the name from a character in Jean Genet&#x27;s novel &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; (1943), a controversial book about homosexuals living on the margins of Parisian society, which Waters – himself a homosexual – was reading at the time. Waters also introduced Divine as &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world, almost&quot;, a description widely repeated in ensuing years.

Waters was an aspiring filmmaker, intent on making &quot;the trashiest motion pictures in cinema history&quot;. Many of his friends, a group which came to be known as &quot;the Dreamlanders&quot; (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, &quot;Hag in a Black Leather Jacket&quot; (1964), Waters began production of a second work, &quot;Roman Candles&quot; (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. &quot;Roman Candles&quot; was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, &quot;Roman Candles&quot; never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premiere at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with &quot;elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course a whole bunch of hippies&quot;. Waters went on to screen it at several local venues alongside Kenneth Anger&#x27;s short film &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; (1953).

Waters followed &quot;Roman Candles&quot; with a third short film, &quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot; (1968), in which Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a flamboyant character who fantasizes about being Jackie Kennedy, during the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In the film, he is a friend of a deranged governess who turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing that they would not understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine&#x27;s parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.

===&quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot;, &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot;, and &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;: 1969–1970===

Divine appeared in Waters&#x27;s next short film, &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot; (1969), which was initially designed to be a test for a new sound camera. A black comedy that carried on in Waters&#x27;s tradition of making &quot;bad taste&quot; films to shock conventional American society, &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot; was based upon the true story of Diane Linkletter, the daughter of media personality Art Linkletter, who had committed suicide earlier that year. Her death had led to a flurry of media interest and speculation, with various sources erroneously claiming that she had done so under the influence of the psychedelic LSD. Waters&#x27;s dramatized version starred Divine in the leading role as the teenager who rebels against her conservative parents after they try to break up her relationship with hippie boyfriend Jim, before consuming a large quantity of LSD and committing suicide. Although screened at the first Baltimore Film Festival, the film was not publicly released at the time, largely for legal reasons.

Soon after the production of &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot;, Waters began filming a full-length motion picture, &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot;, starring Divine as one of the main characters, an unnamed blonde woman who drives around town and runs over a hitchhiker. In one scene, an actor was required to walk along a street naked, which was a crime in the state of Maryland at the time, leading to the arrest of Waters and most of the actors associated with the film; Divine escaped, having speedily driven away from the police when they arrived to carry out the arrests. In their review of the film, the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; exclaimed that &quot;The 300-pound (140 kg) sex-symbol Divine is undoubtedly some sort of discovery.&quot;

In 1970, Divine abandoned work as a hairdresser, opening up a vintage clothing store in Provincetown, Massachusetts using his parents&#x27; money. Opening in 1970 as &quot;Divine Trash&quot;, the store sold items that Divine had purchased in thrift stores, flea markets and garage sales, although it had to move from its original location after he had failed to obtain a license from the local authorities. Realizing that this venture was not financially viable, Divine sold off his stock at very low prices. In the hope of raising some extra money, he sold the furniture of his rented, furnished apartment, leading the landlady to put out a warrant for his arrest. He evaded the local police by traveling to San Francisco, California, a city which had a large gay subculture that attracted Divine, who was then embracing his homosexuality.

In 1970, Divine played the role of Lady Divine, the operator of an exhibit known as The Cavalcade of Perversion who turns to murdering visitors in Waters&#x27;s film &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;. The film contained several controversial scenes, notably one which involved Lady Divine masturbating using a rosary while sitting inside a church. In another, Lady Divine kills her boyfriend and proceeds to eat his heart; in actuality, Divine bit into a cow&#x27;s heart which had gone rotten from being left out on the set all day. At the end of the film, Lady Divine is raped by a giant lobster named Lobstora, an act that drives her into madness; she subsequently goes on a killing spree in Fell&#x27;s Point before being shot down by the National Guard. Due to its controversial nature, Waters feared that the film would be banned and confiscated by the Maryland State Board of Censors, so avoided their jurisdiction by only screening it at non-commercial venues, namely rented church premises. &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; was the first of Waters&#x27;s films to receive widespread attention, as did Divine; KSFX remarked that &quot;Divine is incredible! Could start a whole new trend in films.&quot;

==Rise to fame==

===&quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;: 1971–1972===
Following his San Francisco stay, Divine returned to Baltimore and participated in Waters&#x27;s next film &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;. Designed by Waters to be &quot;an exercise in poor taste&quot;, the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be &quot;the filthiest person alive&quot; and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, and to enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines. All of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, &quot;I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole&quot;, waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene became one of the most notable moments of Divine&#x27;s acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that &quot;I run around doing it all the time. I&#x27;ve received boxes of dog shit – plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it&#x27;s what I want to talk about.&quot; In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because it was in the script.
The film premiered in March 1972 at the third Annual Baltimore Film Festival, held on the campus of the University of Baltimore, where it sold out tickets for three successive screenings; the film aroused particular interest among underground cinema fans following the success of &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, which had begun to be screened in New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Being picked up by the small independent company New Line Cinema, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; was distributed to Ben Barenholtz, the owner of the Elgin Theater in New York City. At the Elgin Theater, Barenholtz had been promoting the midnight movie scene, primarily by screening Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s acid western film &quot;El Topo&quot; (1970). Barenholtz felt that being of an avant-garde nature, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; would fit in well with this crowd, screening it at midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. The film soon gained a cult following at the Elgin Theatre. Barenholtz characterized its early fans as primarily being &quot;downtown gay people, more of the hipper set&quot;, but after a while he noted that this group broadened, with the film becoming popular with &quot;working-class kids from New Jersey who would become a little rowdy&quot;. Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the film&#x27;s lines, reciting them at the screenings, a phenomenon which became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975).

While keeping his involvement with Waters&#x27;s underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After he charged them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from him and told him that they would not continue to support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris&#x27;s doctor, who prescribed the southern state&#x27;s warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris&#x27;s muscular dystrophy.

===Theatre work and &quot;Female Trouble&quot;: 1973–1978===
When the filming of &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; finished, Divine returned to San Francisco, where he and Mink Stole starred in a number of small-budget plays at the Palace Theater as part of drag troupe The Cockettes, including &quot;Divine and Her Stimulating Studs&quot;, &quot;Divine Saves the World&quot;, &quot;Vice Palace&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of Uranus&quot; and &quot;The Heartbreak of Psoriasis&quot;., the latter a musical that closed after three performances. It was here that he first met androgynous performer Sylvester. Divine purchased a house in Santa Monica, which he furnished to his expensive tastes. On visits to Washington D.C. during the early 1970s, Divine and Waters attended the city&#x27;s balls that were frequented by LGBT African-Americans. Here, Waters encouraged Divine&#x27;s drag persona to become more outrageous, exposing her overweight stomach and carrying weapons. He later commented that he wanted Divine to become &quot;the Godzilla of drag queens&quot;, a direct confrontation with the majority of Euro-American drag queens who wanted to be Miss America. In his private life, Divine became the godfather of Brook Yeaton, the son of his friends Chuck Yeaton and Pat Moran; Brook and Divine remained very close until Divine&#x27;s death.

In 1974, Divine returned to Baltimore to film Waters&#x27;s next motion picture, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, in which he played the lead role. Divine&#x27;s character, teenage delinquent Dawn Davenport, embraces the idea that crime is art and is eventually executed in the electric chair for her violent behavior. Waters claimed that the character of Dawn had been partly based on the mutual friend who had introduced him to Divine, Carol Wernig, while the costumes and make-up were once more designed by Van Smith to create the desired &quot;trashy, slutty look&quot;. In the film, Divine did his own stunts, including the trampoline scene, for which he had to undertake a number of trampolining lessons. Divine also played his first on-screen male role in the film, Earl Peterson, and Waters included a scene during which these two characters had sexual intercourse as a joke on the fact that both characters were played by the same actor. &quot;Female Trouble&quot; proved to be Divine&#x27;s favorite of his films, because it both allowed him to develop his character and to finally play a male role, something he had always felt important because he feared being typecast as a female impersonator. Divine was also responsible for singing the theme tune for &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, although it was never released as a single. Divine remained proud of the film, although it received a mixed critical reception.

In 1977, Divine co-starred in the revue &quot;Restless Underwear&quot;, alongside Canadian rock band Rough Trade, which played at Massey Hall in Toronto. In 1980, the revue appeared at the Beacon Theatre on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Bernard Jay, Divine&#x27;s manager, said that it was a &quot;gigantic disaster&quot;, as Divine did not have as large a part in the revue as audience members expected.

Divine was unable to appear in Waters&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Desperate Living&quot; (1977), despite the fact that the role of Mole McHenry had been written for him. This was because he had returned to working in the theater, this time taking the role of the scheming prison matron Pauline in Tom Eyen&#x27;s comedy &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;. Performed in New York City&#x27;s Truck and Warehouse Theater, the play proved popular and was later taken to London&#x27;s Whitehall Theater next to Trafalgar Square. Containing a new cast, it proved less successful than it had in New York. It was in this city that Divine met a group of people whom he would come to know as his &quot;London family&quot;: fashion designer Zandra Rhodes, photographer Robyn Beeche, sculptor Andrew Logan and the latter&#x27;s partner, Michael Davis. While in London in 1978, Divine attended as the guest of honour at the fourth Alternative Miss World pageant, a &quot;mock&quot; event founded by Logan in 1972 in which &quot;drag queens&quot; – including men, women and children – competed for the prize. The event was filmed by director Richard Gayer, whose subsequent film, entitled &quot;Alternative Miss World&quot;, premiered at the Odeon in London&#x27;s Leicester Square as well as featuring at the Cannes Film Festival, both events which were attended by Divine.

Impressed with Divine&#x27;s performance in &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;, playwright Tom Eyen decided to write a new play that would feature him in a starring role. The result was &quot;The Neon Woman&quot;, a story set in 1962 featuring Divine as Flash Storm, the female owner of a Baltimore strip club. It played at the Hurrah! club in New York City before moving on to the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco. Divine remained very proud of the work, seeing it as evidence that his acting skills were coming to wider recognition, and his performances were attended by such celebrities as Eartha Kitt, Elton John, and Liza Minnelli. It was during the New York leg of the play&#x27;s tour that Divine befriended Jay Bennett; they subsequently began renting an apartment together on 58th Street. In the city, Divine assembled a group of friends that came to be known as his &quot;New York family&quot;: designer Larry LeGaspi, makeup artist Conrad Santiago, Vincent Nasso, and dresser Frankie Piazza. While there, he frequented the famous club Studio 54, having a love of partying and club culture.

===Early disco work and &quot;Polyester&quot;: 1979–1983===
Divine eventually decided to abandon his agent, Robert Hussong, and replace him with his English friend Bernard Jay. Jay suggested that with his love of clubs, Divine could obtain work performing in them; as a result, Divine first appeared in 1979 at a gay club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his unscripted act included shouting &quot;fuck you&quot; repeatedly at the audience and then getting into a fight with another drag queen, a gimmick that proved popular with the club&#x27;s clientele. Subsequently, he saw the commercial potential of including disco songs in with his act and, with Tom Eyen and composer Henry Krieger, created &quot;Born to be Cheap&quot; in 1981. In 1981 Divine appeared in John Waters&#x27;s next film, &quot;Polyester&quot;, starring as Francine Fishpaw. Unlike earlier roles, Fishpaw was not a strong female but a meek and victimized woman who falls in love with her dream lover, Todd Tomorrow, played by Tab Hunter. In real life, tabloid publications claimed a romantic connection between them, an assertion both denied. The film was released in &quot;Odorama&quot;, accompanied by &quot;scratch &#x27;n&#x27; sniff&quot; cards for the audience to smell at key points in the film. Soon after &quot;Polyester&quot;, Divine auditioned for a male role in Ridley Scott&#x27;s upcoming science-fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Even though Scott thought Divine unsuitable for the part, he claimed to be enthusiastic about Divine&#x27;s work and was very interested in including him in another of his films, but ultimately this never came about.

That same year, Divine decided to get back in contact with his estranged parents. His mother had learned of his cinematic and disco career after reading an article about the films of John Waters in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and had gone to see &quot;Female Trouble&quot; at the cinema, but had not felt emotionally able to get back in contact with her son until 1981. She got a friend to hand Divine a note at one of his concerts, leading Divine to telephone her, and the family was subsequently reunited. The relationship was mended, and Divine bought them lavish gifts and informed them of how wealthy he was. In fact, according to his manager Bernard Jay, he was already heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending. In 1982, he then joined forces with young American composer Bobby Orlando, who wrote a number of Hi-NRG singles for Divine, including &quot;Native Love (Step By Step)&quot;, &quot;Shoot Your Shot&quot;, and &quot;Love Reaction&quot;. To help publicize these singles, which proved to be successful in many discos across the world, Divine went on television shows like &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, as well as on a series of tours in which he combined his musical performances with comedic stunts and routines that often played up to his characters&#x27; stereotype of being &quot;trashy&quot; and outrageous. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, Divine took his musical performances on tour across the world, attaining a particularly large following in Europe. He also appeared in films by Rosa von Praunheim, for example in 1979 in &quot;Tally Brown, New York&quot;. Divine was friend with both (the director and Tally Brown).

==Later life==

===Later disco work, &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;, and &quot;Hairspray&quot;: 1984–1988===
Divine&#x27;s career as a disco singer continued and his records had sold well, but he and his management felt that they were not receiving their share of the profits. They went to court against Orlando and his company, O-Records, and successfully nullified their contract. After signing with Barry Evangeli&#x27;s company, InTune Music Limited, Divine released several new disco records, including &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Beautiful&quot;, which were both co-produced by Pete Waterman of the then-up-and-coming UK production team of Stock Aitken Waterman. In the United Kingdom, Divine sang his hit &quot;You Think You&#x27;re A Man&quot; – a song which he had dedicated to his parents – on BBC television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He gained a devout follower, Briton Mitch Whitehead, a man who declared himself Divine&#x27;s &quot;number 1 fan&quot;, tattooing himself with images of his idol and eventually aiding Bernard Jay in setting up for Divine&#x27;s show onstage. In London, Divine also befriended drag comedy act Paul O&#x27;Grady, with Jay helping O&#x27;Grady obtain his first bookings in the U.S.

The next Divine film, &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; (1985), reunited him with Tab Hunter and was Divine&#x27;s first film not directed by John Waters. Set in the Wild West during the nineteenth century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman who works as a singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, the film was a critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine&#x27;s performance.

After finishing his work on &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot;, Divine again became involved with a John Waters project, the film &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988). Set in Baltimore during the 1960s, &quot;Hairspray&quot; revolved around self-proclaimed &quot;pleasantly plump&quot; teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation. As he had in Waters&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, Divine took on two roles in the film, one of which was female and the other male. The first of these, Edna Turnblad, was Tracy&#x27;s loving mother; Divine later noted that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen, proclaiming &quot;What drag queen would allow herself to look like this? I look like half the women from Baltimore.&quot; His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile. In one interview, Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in &quot;Hairspray&quot;, but that the producers had been &quot;a bit leery&quot; and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead. Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake, jokingly telling the interviewer that &quot;She is nineteen and delightful. I hate her.&quot; In reality they had become good friends while working together on set. Reviews of the film were predominantly positive, with Divine in particular being singled out for praise; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine&#x27;s breakthrough into mainstream cinema. He subsequently took his mother to the film&#x27;s premiere in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premiere, this time also with several of his other relatives. After the screening, a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross, a friend and fan of Divine&#x27;s.

Divine&#x27;s final film role was in the low-budget comedy horror &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;, filmed and produced in Los Angeles with the same crew as &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;. Appearing in only one scene within the film, he played the character of Detective Langella, a foul-mouthed policeman investigating the murders of a killer clown. &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; was released the year after Divine&#x27;s death. Divine had become a well-known celebrity throughout the 1980s, appearing on American television chat shows such as &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;, and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; to promote both his music and his film appearances. Divine-themed merchandise was produced, including greeting cards and &quot;The Simply Divine Cut-Out Doll Book&quot;. Portraits of Divine were painted by several famous artists, including David Hockney and Andy Warhol, both of whom were known for their works which dealt with popular culture.

==Death==
On March 7, 1988, three weeks after &quot;Hairspray&quot; was released nationwide, Divine was staying at the Regency Plaza Suites Hotel in Los Angeles. He was scheduled to tape a guest appearance the following day as Uncle Otto on the Fox network&#x27;s television series &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in the second season wrap-up episode. After spending all day at Sunset Gower Studios for rehearsals, Divine returned to his hotel that evening, where he dined with friends at the hotel restaurant before returning to his room. Shortly before midnight, he died in his sleep, at age 42, of a heart attack. His body was discovered by Bernard Jay the following morning, who then sat with the body for the next six hours, alongside three of Divine&#x27;s other friends. They contacted Thomas Noguchi, the former chief coroner of Los Angeles County, who arranged for removal of the body; Divine&#x27;s friends were able to prevent the press from taking any photographs of the body as it was being carried out of the hotel.

Divine&#x27;s body was flown back to Maryland and taken to Ruck&#x27;s Funeral Home in Towson, where a casket was obtained for him. The funeral took place at Prospect Hill Cemetery, where a crowd of hundreds had assembled to pay their respects. The ceremony was conducted by Leland Higginbotham, who had baptized Divine into the Christian faith many years before. John Waters gave a speech and was one of the pallbearers who then carried the casket to its final resting place, next to the grave of Divine&#x27;s grandmother. Many flowers were left at the grave, including a wreath sent by actress Whoopi Goldberg, which bore the remark &quot;See what happens when you get good reviews.&quot; Following the funeral, a tribute was held at the Baltimore Governor&#x27;s Mansion. In the ensuing weeks, the Internal Revenue Service confiscated many of Divine&#x27;s possessions and auctioned them off, as restitution for unpaid taxes.

==Drag persona and performance==

After developing a name for himself as a female impersonator known for &quot;trashy&quot; behavior in his early John Waters films, Divine capitalized on this image by appearing at his musical performances in his drag persona. In this role, he was described by his manager Bernard Jay, as displaying &quot;Trash. Filth. Obscenity. In bucket-loads&quot;. Divine described his stage performances as &quot;just good, dirty fun, and if you find it offensive, honey, don&#x27;t join in.&quot; As a part of his performance, he constantly swore at the audience, often using his signature line of &quot;fuck you very much.&quot; Excited audience members would frequently come onstage, where he would fondle their buttocks, groins, and breasts, to the approval of the audience. Divine and his stage act proved particularly popular among gay audiences, and he appeared at some of the world&#x27;s biggest gay clubs, such as Central London&#x27;s Heaven. According to Divine&#x27;s manager Bernard Jay, this was not because Divine himself was gay, but because the gay community &quot;openly and proudly identified with the determination of the &quot;female&quot; character Divine&quot;.

Divine became increasingly known for outlandish stunts onstage, each time trying to outdo what he had done before. At one performance in London&#x27;s Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose up from the floor on a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: &quot;I&#x27;m here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life.&quot; When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome in the last year of his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that &quot;my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to&quot;, a view he echoed to his friends.

==Personal life==
During his childhood and adolescence, Divine was called &quot;Glenn&quot; by his friends and family; as an adult, he used the stage name &quot;Divine&quot; as his personal name, telling one interviewer that both &quot;Divine&quot; and &quot;Glenn Milstead&quot; were &quot;both just names. Glenn is the name I was brought up with, Divine is the name I&#x27;ve been using for the past 23 years. I guess it&#x27;s &quot;always&quot; Glenn and it&#x27;s &quot;always&quot; Divine. Do you mean the character Divine or the person Divine? You see, it gets very complicated. There&#x27;s the Divine you&#x27;re talking to now and there&#x27;s the character Divine, which is just something I do to make a living. She doesn&#x27;t really exist at all.&quot; At one point he had the name &quot;Divine&quot; officially recognized, as it appeared on his passport, and in keeping with his personal use of the name, his close friends nicknamed him &quot;Divy&quot;.

Divine identified as a gay man. During the 1980s, he had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee L&#x27;Ecuyer, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men whom he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met a young man in Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but in the latter part of the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.

Divine&#x27;s mother, Frances Milstead, remarked that while Divine &quot;was blessed with many talents and abilities, he could be very moody and demanding&quot;. She noted that while he was &quot;incredibly kind and generous&quot;, he always wanted to get things done the way that he wanted, and would &quot;tune you out if you displeased him&quot;. She noted that in most interviews, he came across as &quot;a very shy and private person&quot;. Divine&#x27;s Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On numerous occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine&#x27;s final years, when his disco career was coming to an end and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.

As to his gender identity, Waters said, &quot;People [think] Divine – they always think wrong – was trans. Divine never dressed as a woman except when he was working. He had no desire to be a woman... He didn&#x27;t want to pass as a woman; he wanted to pass as a monster. He was thought up to scare hippies. And that&#x27;s what he wanted to do. He wanted to be Godzilla. Well, he wanted to be Elizabeth Taylor and Godzilla put together.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Milstead&#x27;s 1980s films: &quot;Those who could get past the unremitting weirdness of Divine&#x27;s performance discovered that the actor/actress had genuine talent, including a natural sense of comic timing and an uncanny gift for slapstick.&quot; In a letter to the newspaper, Paul Thornquist described him as &quot;one of the few truly radical and essential artists of the century... [who] was an audacious symbol of man&#x27;s quest for liberty and freedom&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine described him as &quot;the Goddess of Gross, the Punk Elephant, the Big Bad Mama of the Midnight Movies... [and] a Miss Piggy for the blissfully depraved&quot;. Following his death, fans of Divine visited Prospect Hill Cemetery to pay their respects. In what has become a tradition, fans have been known to leave makeup, food, and graffiti on his grave &quot;in memoriam&quot;; Waters claims that some fans have sexual intercourse on his grave, which he believes Divine would love.

Divine has left an influence on a number of musicians. During the mid-1980s, the androgynous performer Sylvester decorated the powder room of his San Francisco home with Divine memorabilia. Anohni of the band Antony and the Johnsons wrote a song about Divine which was included in the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released in 1998. The song, titled &quot;Divine&quot;, was an ode to the actor, who was one of Anohni&#x27;s lifelong heroes. Her admiration is expressed in the lines: &quot;He was my self-determined guru&quot; and &quot;I turn to think of you/Who walked the way with so much pain/Who holds the mirror up to fools.&quot; In 2008, Irish electronic singer Róisín Murphy paid homage to Divine in the music video for her song &quot;Movie Star&quot; by reenacting the attack by Lobstora from &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;.

Divine was an inspiration for Ursula the Sea Witch, the villain in the 1989 Disney animated film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Due to Divine&#x27;s portrayal of Edna Turnblad in the original comedy-film version of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, later musical adaptations of &quot;Hairspray&quot; have commonly placed male actors in the role of Edna, including Harvey Fierstein and others in the 2002 Broadway musical, and John Travolta in the 2007 musical film. A statue in the likeness of Divine by Andrew Logan can be seen on permanent display at The American Visionary Art Museum in Divine&#x27;s hometown of Baltimore.
&quot;I Am Divine&quot;, a feature documentary on the life of Divine, was premiered at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and had its Baltimore premiere within Maryland Film Festival. It is produced and directed by Jeffrey Schwarz of the Los Angeles-based production company Automat Pictures. In August 2015, a play based on the final day of Divine&#x27;s life, &quot;Divine/Intervention&quot;, was performed at the New York Fringe Festival.

Additionally, the song Cha Cha Heels was originally written for Divine but he died before recording it. As a result, the synthpop band Bronski Beat recorded the song with then-lead singer Jonathan Hellyer and Eartha Kitt. It charted in many countries and was written as a tribute to Divine.

===Publications===
Divine&#x27;s manager and friend Bernard Jay wrote a book titled &quot;Not Simply Divine!&quot;, published in 1992 by Virgin Books. Admitting that he was &quot;immensely proud&quot; of Divine and the cause which he &quot;strived for&quot;, Jay noted in the book&#x27;s introduction that he wrote the work because he felt that Divine deserved a &quot;memorial&quot; that would act as a &quot;record for posterity&quot;. He insisted that &quot;Not Simply Divine!&quot; was &quot;not the bitter revenge of an unappreciated manager, eager now to get his share of his praise&quot;, but that equally it was not &quot;a gushing homage&quot; designed to paint Divine as &quot;both saintly and legendary&quot;. He expressed his hope that the book shines light on the &quot;shades of grey&quot; between the man and his female persona, portraying a &quot;warts and all&quot; picture. The book was criticized by Divine&#x27;s mother, Frances Milstead, who accused Jay of writing a &quot;mean-spirited&quot; work that provided an incorrect image of her son. &quot;Not Simply Divine!&quot; was also criticized by Divine&#x27;s friend Greg Gorman, who remarked that, &quot;there was so much hostility and so much meanspiritedness in the way Divine was portrayed in the book, that it was just 180 degrees from who he was&quot;.

Frances Milstead subsequently cowrote her own book about Divine, entitled &quot;My Son Divine&quot;, with Kevin Heffernan and Steve Yeager, which was published by Alyson Books in 2001. &quot;Postcards From Divine&quot;, a book composed of over 50 postcards Divine sent to his parents while traveling the world between 1977 and 1987, was released by the Divine estate on November 5, 2011. &quot;Postcards From Divine&quot; also includes quotes and stories from his friends and colleagues, including Waters, Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce, Channing Wilroy, Susan Lowe, Jean Hill, Tab Hunter, Lainie Kazan, Alan J. Wendl, Ruth Brown, Deborah Harry, Jerry Stiller, Ricki Lake, Silvio Gigante and others.

<doc id="204703" wikidata="Q313605" url="?curid=204703" title="Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)">
<text>Wang Wei (Traditional Chinese: 王維; Simplified Chinese: 王维, pinyin: &quot;Wáng Wéi&quot;, 699–761) was a Chinese musician, painter, poet, and politician of the middle Tang dynasty. He is regarded as one of the most distinguished men of arts and letters of his era. About 400 of his poems survived and 29 of them are included in the 18th-century anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;. A large portion of his finest poems drew inspirations from the local landscape.

Wang Wei is renowned for his dual talents as a nature poet and landscape painter. His poems were originally compiled and edited into a collection by his next-youngest brother, Wang Jin, at imperial command. Of his paintings, no authenticated specimens survive, although there were evidence of his work through influences on later paintings and descriptive accounts. His musical talents were highly regarded; however, no compositions or music notes have been preserved. He had a successful career as an imperial court official. Later in life, he became a devout Chan Buddhist and a vegetarian. He spent ten years studying with Chan master Daoguang.

==Names==
Wang adopted the courtesy name Mojie and signed many of his works &quot;Wang Weimojie&quot;. Wei-mo-Jie () was a reference to Vimalakirti, the central figure of the Buddhist sutra by the same name. In this Buddhist text presented partly in the form of a debate with Mañjuśrī (the Bodhisattva of Wisdom), the lay devotee Vimalakīrti expounds the doctrine of Śūnyatā, or emptiness, to an assembly that includes arhats and bodhisattvas, and then culminates with the wordless teaching conveyed through silence.

==Life==

===Early years===
Born into an aristocratic family of Han ethnicity, originally from Qixian (present-day Qi County in Shanxi province), Wang Wei&#x27;s father moved east of the Yellow River to Puzhou, part of the historic Hedong Commandery (now Yongji, Shanxi). Known for his youthful precocity, Wang Wei, the eldest of five brothers, set off for Chang’an, the imperial capital, at the age of nineteen to prepare for the civil service examination. While residing in Chang&#x27;an before taking the test, Wang gained favor at the court due to his poetic and musical talents, particularly in playing the instrument pipa. He passed the palace examination in 721 with top position known as the Zhuangyuan, setting the stage for a potentially lucrative civil service career.

Wang Wei&#x27;s official career experienced ups and downs. His initial appointment was a court musician, or &quot;Deputy Master of Music&quot;. However, he was subsequently demoted to overseeing a granary in the former province of Jizhou (now the name of a different town Jizhou, in Hebei). The reason for this demotion was Wang&#x27;s breach of conventional etiquette by performing a lion dance. In any case, this proved to be only a minor setback to his career, and it had a compensatory aspect as it afforded him the opportunity to travel. Subsequently, a sequence of promotions following this demotion was apparently attributable to his association with the prominent governmental minister, poet, and literary scholar Zhang Jiuling. This connection persisted, at least until Zhang&#x27;s 727 demotion to a post in Jingzhou. By 728, Wang Wei had returned to Chang&#x27;an, where he hosted the poet Meng Haoran, forging a close friendship and poetic collaboration. At this point, Wang seems to have attained the rank of Assistant Censor, followed by a subsequent promotion within the government. However, he experienced a later demotion back to Assistant Censor, coinciding with the decline in imperial favor of Zhang Jiuling and the rising political influence of Li Linfu. After his wife&#x27;s death in 731, he never remarried. In his capacity as a government official, he was dispatched to Liangzhou, then the northwestern frontier of the Chinese empire and a region marked by continual military conflicts. Invited by the local commander, Wang served in this location until his return to Chang&#x27;an in 738 or early 739.

===Middle years===
After returning to Chang&#x27;an from Liangzhou, and lacking an official posting, Wang Wei took the opportunity to explore the countryside south of the capital, in the Lantian area within the Zhongnan Mountains. During his time there, Wang Wei formed a friendship with fellow poet Pei Di. In 740–741 Wang resumed his governmental career, which included an inspection tour of Xiangyang, Hubei (the home of Meng Haoran). Following this, Wang held various positions in Chang&#x27;an. In addition to his governmental salary, he earned income as an artist, enabling him to acquire the extensive Lantian estate once owned by the poet Song Zhiwen, known as Wang Chuan. After the death of his mother in 747–748, Wang Wei erected a shrine in her honor at the estate, observing a traditional three-year mourning period. Overwhelmed by grief, Wang Wei was reduced almost to a skeleton. By 751–752 Wang Wei resumed his official duties. However, historical records from this point become cloudy due to the devastating effects of the An Shi disorders.

===War===

The An-Shi disorders (755 - 763) profoundly impacted Chinese society in general and Wang Wei in particular, although Nicolas Tackett has recently argued that it was not as destructive to the Tang aristocracy as had previously been thought. In 756, Wang Wei was residing in the capital of Chang&#x27;an, where he was captured by the rebels when they took over the city. While Emperor Xuanzong, his court, and most of the governmental officials had already evacuated to Sichuan; Wang Wei, plagued by dysentery, was incapacitated and unable to travel, especially through the challenging mountainous terrain of the region. The rebels subsequently transported him to their capital at Luoyang, where the rebel government sought his collaboration. Some sources suggest that in an attempt to avoid actively assisting the insurgents, Wang Wei feigned deafness; others state that he consumed medicine to damage his voice. Regardless, in Luoyang, Wang Wei became officially affiliated with the rebels and was given an official title. In 757, with the ascendency of Emperor Suzong and the Tang&#x27;s recapture of Luoyang from the rebel forces, Wang Wei was arrested and imprisoned by the Tang government on charges of treason.

The charges were eventually dropped, in part due to the intervention of Wang Wei&#x27;s brother, Wang Jin. Wang Jin held a high government rank as the Undersecretary of the Board of Punishments, and his loyal efforts in the defense of Taiyuan were well recognized. Furthermore, the poems Wang Wei had written during his captivity were produced and accepted as evidence of his loyalty. Following his pardon, Wang Wei dedicated much of his time to Buddhist practice and activities. Subsequently, with the further suppression of the rebellion, he re-entered government service in 758, initially in a lower position compared to before the rebellion, as a &quot;tàizǐ zhōngchōng&quot; (), serving in the court of the crown prince rather than the emperor himself. In 759, Wang Wei not only regained his former position in the emperor&#x27;s court but was eventually promoted. Over time, he was moved up to the secretarial position of &quot;jǐshìzhōng&quot; () and his last position, which he held until his death in 761, was &quot;shàngshū yòuchéng&quot; (), or deputy prime minister. These positions, located in the city of Chang&#x27;an, were conveniently close to his private estate, allowing him to visit and maintain it. Throughout this period, Wang Wei continued to pursue his artistic endeavors.

===Later years===

Wang Wei never lived to see the empire&#x27;s return to peace, as the An-Shi disorder and its aftermath continued beyond his lifetime. Nonetheless, he found some solace and stability which were non-existent during the early years of the rebellion. Particularly, he had the opportunity to spend time in the relative seclusion of his Lantian estate that offered him a poetic and Buddhist retreat. He was able to spend time with friends and connect with nature, continue to engage in painting and writing. Eventually, his days came to an end. In the seventh month of 759 or 761, Wang Wei requested writing implements and wrote several letters to his brother and to his friends before passing away. He was then buried at his Lantian estate.

==Works==
Wang Wei was accomplished in both his poetry and his paintings, on which the Song dynasty literati Su Shi commented: &quot;The quality of Wang Wei’s poems can be summed up as, &#x27;a painting within a poem.&#x27; Observing his paintings you see, &#x27;within the painting there is poetry.&#x27;&quot; He is especially known for his compositions in the Mountains and Streams (Shanshui) poetry genre, also known as &quot;the landscape&quot; school of poetry, along with fellow poet Meng Haoran. The two poets were often collectively referred to as &quot;Wang Meng&quot; (a combination of their surnames), to their shared excellence in poetic composition as contemporaries.

In his later years, Wang Wei lost interest in being a statesman and became more involved in Buddhism practice, particularly Chan Buddhism. This practice significantly influenced his poems, leading to his posthumous recognition as the &quot;Poet Buddha.&quot; His works are collected in &quot;Secretary General Wang&#x27;s Anthology&quot;, which includes 400 poems. He excelled in painting images of people, bamboo forests and scenery of mountains and rivers. It is recorded that his landscape paintings have two different genres, one of the Father and Son of the Li Family () and the other being of strong brush strokes. His work of &quot;Picture of Wang River&quot; is of the latter, but unfortunately the original no longer exists. His works of &quot;Scenery of Snow and Creek&quot; and &quot;Jinan’s Fusheng Portrait&quot; are both realistic in their representation of the subjects.

At present 420 poems are attributed to Wang Wei, of which 370 are thought to be genuine. Wang Wei was a &quot;very great master&quot; of the Jueju, or the Chinese quatrain. Many of his Jueju depict quiet scenes of water and mist, with few details and little human presence. The &quot;Indiana Companion&quot; comments that he affirms the world&#x27;s beauty, while questioning its ultimate reality. It also draws a comparison between the deceptive simplicity of his works and the Chan path to enlightenment, which is built on careful preparation but is achieved without conscious effort.

One of Wang Wei&#x27;s famous poems is &quot;Longing&quot; (&quot;Xiang Si&quot; ), a quatrain known for its heartfelt emotions expressed in the simplest language.
===&quot;Wang River&quot; Collection===

Some of Wang Wei&#x27;s most famous poetry was done as a series of 20 quatrains, matched by his friend Pei Di&#x27;s verses on the same topic and title. Together, these poems form a group titled the &quot;Wang River Collection&quot; (; &quot;Wǎngchuān jí&quot;). These poems are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lantian poems&quot;, after the real name of Wang&#x27;s estate&#x27;s location, in what is now Lantian County.

Inspired in part by Wang&#x27;s Lantian home and features of its neighborhood and by their correspondences with other places and features, the &quot;Wang River Collection&quot; includes such pieces as the poem often translated &quot;Deer Park&quot; (literally, &quot;Deer Fence&quot;). However, the poems tend to have a deceptive simplicity to them, while they actually have great depth and complexity upon closer examination. Below is a selection of several of Wang&#x27;s &quot;Wang River Collection&quot; quatrains, with English translations by the American sinologist Stephen Owen.


=== Other poetry ===
&quot;Villa on Zhongnan Mountain (終南別業)&quot; 
===Painting===

Wang Wei has historically been regarded as the founder of the Southern School of Chinese landscape art, a school which was characterised by strong brushstrokes contrasted with light ink washes.
==Cultural references==
===Influence in the East===
Wang Wei was of extensive influence in China and its area of cultural influence, particularly in terms of monochrome ink painting and in terms of his deceptively simple and insightful Buddhist-influenced poetry. Wang Shimin and Wang Yuanqi of the Six Masters of the early Qing period painted works in the style of Wang Wei, as well as copying his paintings as &quot;copying former masters was seen as the cornerstone of artistic training.&quot; In the Ming dynasty, Dong Qichang included Wang Wei&#x27;s style in his paintings after the old masters.

One of Wang Wei&#x27;s poems, called &quot;Weicheng Qu&quot; or &quot;Song of the City of Wei&quot; has been adapted to the famous music melody, &quot;Yangguan Sandie&quot; or &quot;Three Refrains on the Yang Pass&quot;. The most famous version of this melody is based on a tune for guqin first published in 1864 but may be traced back to a version from 1530.

Wang Wei&#x27;s lasting influence is seen in the death poem of the Japanese haiku master Yosa Buson:
===Influence in the West===
Wang Wei&#x27;s poetry in translation formed the inspiration for the final &quot;Der Abschied&quot; movement of the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler&#x27;s penultimate completed work, &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. &quot;Der Abschied&quot; is set to a loose German translation of Wang Wei&#x27;s &quot;Farewell&quot; (), a work addressed to fellow poet Meng Haoran on the occasion of his retirement (after a brief civil service career) to become a scholar-recluse (&quot;yinshi&quot;, ).

Wang Wei&#x27;s poetry as found in the works of Ernest Fenollosa also provided inspiration for the American poet Ezra Pound in the creation of Pound&#x27;s Ideogrammic Method.

His art inspired Innisfree Garden in Millbrook, New York.

<doc id="204706" wikidata="Q358561" url="?curid=204706" title="Reinhold Niebuhr">
<text>Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (June 21, 1892 – June 1, 1971) was an American Reformed theologian, ethicist, commentator on politics and public affairs, and professor at Union Theological Seminary for more than 30 years. Niebuhr was one of America&#x27;s leading public intellectuals for several decades of the 20th century and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. A public theologian, he wrote and spoke frequently about the intersection of religion, politics, and public policy, with his most influential books including &quot;Moral Man and Immoral Society&quot; and &quot;The Nature and Destiny of Man&quot;. 

Starting as a minister with working-class sympathies in the 1920s and sharing with many other ministers a commitment to pacifism and socialism, his thinking evolved during the 1930s to neo-orthodox realist theology as he developed the philosophical perspective known as Christian realism. He attacked utopianism as ineffectual for dealing with reality. Niebuhr&#x27;s realism deepened after 1945 and led him to support American efforts to confront Soviet communism around the world. A powerful speaker, he was one of the most influential thinkers of the 1940s and 1950s in public affairs. Niebuhr battled with religious liberals over what he called their naïve views of the contradictions of human nature and the optimism of the Social Gospel, and battled with religious conservatives over what he viewed as their naïve view of scripture and their narrow definition of &quot;true religion&quot;. During this time he was viewed by many as the intellectual rival of John Dewey.

Niebuhr&#x27;s contributions to political philosophy include using the resources of theology to argue for political realism. His work has also significantly influenced international relations theory, leading many scholars to move away from idealism and embrace realism. A large number of scholars, including political scientists, political historians, and theologians, have noted his influence on their thinking. Aside from academics, activists such as Myles Horton and Martin Luther King Jr., and numerous politicians have also cited his influence on their thought, including Hillary Clinton, Hubert Humphrey, and Dean Acheson, as well as presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter. Niebuhr has also influenced the Christian right in the United States. The Institute on Religion and Democracy, a conservative think tank founded in 1981, has adopted Niebuhr&#x27;s concept of Christian realism on their social and political approaches.

Aside from his political commentary, Niebuhr is also known for having composed the Serenity Prayer, a widely recited prayer which was popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous. Niebuhr was also one of the founders of both Americans for Democratic Action and the International Rescue Committee and also spent time at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, while serving as a visiting professor at both Harvard and Princeton. He was also the brother of another prominent theologian, H. Richard Niebuhr.

==Early life and education==
Niebuhr was born on June 21, 1892, in Wright City, Missouri, the son of German immigrants Gustav Niebuhr and his wife, Lydia (née Hosto). His father was a German Evangelical pastor; his denomination was the American branch of the established Prussian Church Union in Germany. It is now part of the United Church of Christ. The family spoke German at home. His brother H. Richard Niebuhr also became a noted theological ethicist and his sister Hulda Niebuhr became a divinity professor in Chicago. The Niebuhr family moved to Lincoln, Illinois, in 1902 when Gustav Niebuhr became pastor of Lincoln&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s German Evangelical Synod church. Reinhold Niebuhr first served as pastor of a church when he served from April to September 1913 as interim minister of St. John&#x27;s following his father&#x27;s death.

Niebuhr attended Elmhurst College in Illinois and graduated in 1910. He studied at Eden Theological Seminary in Webster Groves, Missouri, where, as he said, he was deeply influenced by Samuel D. Press in &quot;biblical and systematic subjects&quot;, and Yale Divinity School, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1914 and a Master of Arts degree the following year, with the thesis &quot;The Contribution of Christianity to the Doctrine of Immortality&quot;. He always regretted not earning a doctorate degree. He said that Yale gave him intellectual liberation from the localism of his German-American upbringing.

==Marriage and family==
In 1931 Niebuhr married Ursula Keppel-Compton. She was a member of the Church of England and was educated at the University of Oxford in theology and history. She met Niebuhr while studying for her master&#x27;s degree at Union Theological Seminary. For many years, she was on faculty at Barnard College – the women&#x27;s college of Columbia University – where she helped establish and then chaired the religious studies department. The Niebuhrs had two children, Elisabeth Niebuhr Sifton, a high-level executive at several major publishing houses who wrote a memoir on her father, and Christopher Niebuhr. Ursula Niebuhr left evidence in her professional papers at the Library of Congress showing that she co-authored some of her husband&#x27;s later writings.

==Detroit==
In 1915, Niebuhr was ordained a pastor. The German Evangelical mission board sent him to serve at Bethel Evangelical Church in Detroit, Michigan. The congregation numbered 66 on his arrival and grew to nearly 700 by the time he left in 1928. The increase reflected his ability to reach people outside the German-American community and among the growing population attracted to jobs in the booming automobile industry. In the early 1900s Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the country, attracting many black and white migrants from the rural South, as well as Jewish and Catholic people from eastern and southern Europe. White supremacists determined to dominate, suppress, and victimize Black, Jewish, and Catholic Americans, as well as other Americans who did not have western European ancestry, joined the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Legion in growing numbers. By 1923, membership in the KKK in Detroit topped 20,000. In 1925, as part of the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s strategy to accumulate government power, the membership organization selected and publicly supported several candidates for public office, including for the office of the mayor. Niebuhr spoke out publicly against the Klan to his congregation, describing them as &quot;one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride of a people has ever developed&quot;. Though only one of the several candidates publicly backed by the Klan gained a seat on the city council that year, the Klan continued to influence daily life in Detroit. The KKK&#x27;s failed 1925 mayoral candidate, Charles Bowles, still became a judge on the recorder&#x27;s court; later, in 1930, he was elected the city&#x27;s mayor.

===First World War===
When America entered the First World War in 1917, Niebuhr was the unknown pastor of a small German-speaking congregation in Detroit (it stopped using German in 1919). All adherents of German-American culture in the United States and nearby Canada came under attack for suspicion of having dual loyalties. Niebuhr repeatedly stressed the need to be loyal to America, and won an audience in national magazines for his appeals to the German Americans to be patriotic. Theologically, he went beyond the issue of national loyalty as he endeavored to fashion a realistic ethical perspective of patriotism and pacifism. He endeavored to work out a realistic approach to the moral danger posed by aggressive powers, which many idealists and pacifists failed to recognize. During the war, he also served his denomination as Executive Secretary of the War Welfare Commission, while maintaining his pastorate in Detroit. A pacifist at heart, he saw compromise as a necessity and was willing to support war in order to find peace—compromising for the sake of righteousness.

===Origins of Niebuhr&#x27;s working-class sympathy===
Several attempts have been made to explicate the origins of Niebuhr&#x27;s sympathies from the 1920s to working-class and labor issues as documented by his biographer Richard W. Fox. One supportive example has concerned his interest in the plight of auto workers in Detroit. This one interest among others can be briefly summarized below.
After seminary, Niebuhr preached the Social Gospel, and then initiated the engagement of what he considered the insecurity of Ford workers. Niebuhr had moved to the left and was troubled by the demoralizing effects of industrialism on workers. He became an outspoken critic of Henry Ford and allowed union organizers to use his pulpit to expound their message of workers&#x27; rights. Niebuhr attacked poor conditions created by the assembly lines and erratic employment practices.

Because of his opinion about factory work, Niebuhr rejected liberal optimism. He wrote in his diary:
We went through one of the big automobile factories to-day. ... The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labour is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them. ... We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces and none of us is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.

The historian Ronald H. Stone thinks that Niebuhr never talked to the assembly line workers (many of his parishioners were skilled craftsmen) but projected feelings onto them after discussions with Samuel Marquis. Niebuhr&#x27;s criticism of Ford and capitalism resonated with progressives and helped make him nationally prominent. His serious commitment to Marxism developed after he moved to New York in 1928.

In 1923, Niebuhr visited Europe to meet with intellectuals and theologians. The conditions he saw in Germany under the French occupation of the Rhineland dismayed him. They reinforced the pacifist views that he had adopted throughout the 1920s after the First World War.

===Conversion of Jews===
Niebuhr preached about the need to persuade Jews to convert to Christianity. He believed there were two reasons Jews did not convert: the &quot;un-Christlike attitude of Christians&quot; and &quot;Jewish bigotry.&quot; However, he later rejected the idea of a mission to Jews. According to his biographer, the historian Richard Wightman Fox, Niebuhr understood that &quot;Christians needed the leaven of pure Hebraism to counteract the Hellenism to which they were prone&quot;.

==1930s: Growing influence in New York==
Niebuhr captured his personal experiences in Detroit in his book &quot;Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic&quot;. He continued to write and publish throughout his career, and also served as editor of the magazine &quot;Christianity and Crisis&quot; from 1941 through 1966.

In 1928, Niebuhr left Detroit to become Professor of Practical Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York. He spent the rest of his career there, until retirement in 1960. While teaching theology at Union Theological Seminary, Niebuhr influenced many generations of students and thinkers, including the German minister Dietrich Bonhoeffer of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church.

The Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by Niebuhr and others with similar views. Later it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action. The main supporters of the fellowship in the early days included Eduard Heimann, Sherwood Eddy, Paul Tillich, and Rose Terlin. In its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics. Although not Communist, the group acknowledged Karl Marx&#x27;s social philosophy. Niebuhr was among the group of 51 prominent Americans who formed the International Relief Association (IRA) that is today known as the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The committee mission was to assist Germans suffering from the policies of the Hitler regime.

===Niebuhr and Dewey===
In the 1930s Niebuhr was often seen as an intellectual opponent of John Dewey. Both men were professional polemicists and their ideas often clashed, although they contributed to the same realms of liberal intellectual schools of thought. Niebuhr was a strong proponent of the &quot;Jerusalem&quot; religious tradition as a corrective to the secular &quot;Athens&quot; tradition insisted upon by Dewey. In the book &quot;Moral Man and Immoral Society&quot; (1932), Niebuhr strongly criticized Dewey&#x27;s philosophy, although his own ideas were still intellectually rudimentary. Two years later, in a review of Dewey&#x27;s book &quot;A Common Faith&quot; (1934), Niebuhr was calm and respectful towards Dewey&#x27;s &quot;religious footnote&quot; on his then large body of educational and pragmatic philosophy.

==Neo-orthodox theology==
In 1939 Niebuhr explained his theological odyssey:
In the 1930s Niebuhr worked out many of his ideas about sin and grace, love and justice, faith and reason, realism and idealism, and the irony and tragedy of history, which established his leadership of the neo-orthodox movement in theology. Influenced strongly by Karl Barth and other dialectical theologians of Europe, he began to emphasize the Bible as a human record of divine self-revelation; it offered for Niebuhr a critical but redemptive reorientation of the understanding of humanity&#x27;s nature and destiny.

Niebuhr couched his ideas in Christ-centered principles such as the Great Commandment and the doctrine of original sin. His major contribution was his view of sin as a social event—as pride—with selfish self-centeredness as the root of evil. The sin of pride was apparent not just in criminals, but more dangerously in people who felt good about their deeds—rather like Henry Ford (whom he did not mention by name). The human tendency to corrupt the good was the great insight he saw manifested in governments, business, democracies, utopian societies, and churches. This position is laid out profoundly in one of his most influential books, &quot;Moral Man and Immoral Society&quot; (1932). He was a debunker of hypocrisy and pretense and made the avoidance of self-righteous illusions the center of his thoughts.

Niebuhr argued that to approach religion as the individualistic attempt to fulfill biblical commandments in a moralistic sense is not only an impossibility but also a demonstration of man&#x27;s original sin, which Niebuhr interpreted as self-love. Through self-love man becomes focused on his own goodness and leaps to the false conclusion—one he called the &quot;Promethean illusion&quot;—that he can achieve goodness on his own. Thus man mistakes his partial ability to transcend himself for the ability to prove his absolute authority over his own life and world. Constantly frustrated by natural limitations, man develops a lust for power which destroys him and his whole world. History is the record of these crises and judgments which man brings on himself; it is also proof that God does not allow man to overstep his possibilities. In radical contrast to the Promethean illusion, God reveals himself in history, especially personified in Jesus Christ, as sacrificial love which overcomes the human temptation to self-deification and makes possible constructive human history.

==Politics==

===Domestic===
During the 1930s, Niebuhr was a prominent leader of the militant faction of the Socialist Party of America, although he disliked die-hard Marxists. He described their beliefs as a religion and a thin one at that. In 1941, he co-founded the Union for Democratic Action, a group with a strongly militarily interventionist, internationalist foreign policy and a pro-union, liberal domestic policy. He was the group&#x27;s president until it transformed into the Americans for Democratic Action in 1947.

===International===
Within the framework of Christian realism, Niebuhr became a supporter of American action in the Second World War, anti-communism, and the development of nuclear weapons. However, he opposed the Vietnam War.

At the outbreak of World War II, the pacifist component of his liberalism was challenged. Niebuhr began to distance himself from the pacifism of his more liberal colleagues and became a staunch advocate for the war. Niebuhr soon left the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a peace-oriented group of theologians and ministers, and became one of their harshest critics.

This departure from his peers evolved into a movement known as Christian realism. Niebuhr is widely considered to have been its primary advocate. Niebuhr supported the Allies during the Second World War and argued for the engagement of the United States in the war. As a writer popular in both the secular and the religious arena and a professor at the Union Theological Seminary, he was very influential both in the United States and abroad. While many clergy proclaimed themselves pacifists because of their World War I experiences, Niebuhr declared that a victory by Germany and Japan would threaten Christianity. He renounced his socialist connections and beliefs and resigned from the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. He based his arguments on the Protestant beliefs that sin is part of the world, that justice must take precedence over love, and that pacifism is a symbolic portrayal of absolute love but cannot prevent sin. Although his opponents did not portray him favorably, Niebuhr&#x27;s exchanges with them on the issue helped him mature intellectually.

Niebuhr debated Charles Clayton Morrison, editor of &quot;The Christian Century&quot; magazine, about America&#x27;s entry into World War II. Morrison and his pacifistic followers maintained that America&#x27;s role should be strictly neutral and part of a negotiated peace only, while Niebuhr claimed himself to be a realist, who opposed the use of political power to attain moral ends. Morrison and his followers strongly supported the movement to outlaw war that began after World War I and the Kellogg–Briand Pact of 1928. The pact was severely challenged by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. With his publication of &quot;Moral Man and Immoral Society&quot; (1932), Niebuhr broke ranks with &quot;The Christian Century&quot; and supported interventionism and power politics. He supported the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 and published his own magazine, &quot;Christianity and Crisis&quot;. In 1945, however, Niebuhr charged that use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was &quot;morally indefensible&quot;.

Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. explained Niebuhr&#x27;s influence:
Traditionally, the idea of the frailty of man led to the demand for obedience to ordained authority. But Niebuhr rejected that ancient conservative argument. Ordained authority, he showed, is all the more subject to the temptations of self-interest, self-deception and self-righteousness. Power must be balanced by power. He persuaded me and many of my contemporaries that original sin provides a far stronger foundation for freedom and self-government than illusions about human perfectibility. Niebuhr&#x27;s analysis was grounded in the Christianity of Augustine and Calvin, but he had, nonetheless, a special affinity with secular circles. His warnings against utopianism, messianism and perfectionism strike a chord today. ... We cannot play the role of God to history, and we must strive as best we can to attain decency, clarity and proximate justice in an ambiguous world.

Niebuhr&#x27;s defense of Roosevelt made him popular among liberals, as the historian Morton White noted:
The contemporary liberal&#x27;s fascination with Niebuhr, I suggest, comes less from Niebuhr&#x27;s dark theory of human nature and more from his actual political pronouncements, from the fact that he is a shrewd, courageous, and right-minded man on many political questions. Those who applaud his politics are too liable to turn then to his theory of human nature and praise it as the philosophical instrument of Niebuhr&#x27;s political agreement with themselves. But very few of those whom I have called &quot;atheists for Niebuhr&quot; follow this inverted logic to its conclusion: they don&#x27;t move from praise of Niebuhr&#x27;s theory of human nature to praise of its theological ground. We may admire them for drawing the line somewhere, but certainly not for their consistency.

After Joseph Stalin signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Adolf Hitler in August 1939, Niebuhr severed his past ties with any fellow-traveler organization having any known Communist leanings. In 1947, Niebuhr helped found the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. His ideas influenced George Kennan, Hans Morgenthau, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and other realists during the Cold War on the need to contain Communist expansion.

In his last cover story for &quot;Time&quot; magazine (March 1948), Whittaker Chambers said of Niebuhr:

Most U.S. liberals think of Niebuhr as a solid socialist who has some obscure connection with Union Theological Seminary that does not interfere with his political work. Unlike most clergymen in politics, Dr. Niebuhr is a pragmatist. Says James Loeb, secretary of Americans for Democratic Action: &quot;Most so-called liberals are idealists. They let their hearts run away with their heads. Niebuhr never does. For example, he has always been the leading liberal opponent of pacifism. In that period before we got into the war when pacifism was popular, he held out against it steadfastly. He is also an opponent of Marxism.

In the 1950s, Niebuhr described Senator Joseph McCarthy as a force of evil, not so much for attacking civil liberties, as for being ineffective in rooting out Communists and their sympathizers. Neibuhr, notwithstanding his general opposition to capital punishment, supported the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, saying, &quot;Traitors are never ordinary criminals and the Rosenbergs are quite obviously fiercely loyal Communists ... Stealing atomic secrets is an unprecedented crime.&quot;

==Views on race, ethnicity, and other religious affiliations==
His views developed during his pastoral tenure in Detroit, which had become a place of immigration, migration, competition and development as a major industrial city. During the 1920s, Niebuhr spoke out against the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Detroit, which had recruited many members threatened by the rapid social changes. The Klan proposed positions that were anti-black, anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic. Niebuhr&#x27;s preaching against the Klan, especially in relation to the 1925 mayoral election, gained him national attention.

Niebuhr&#x27;s thoughts on racial justice developed slowly after he abandoned socialism. Niebuhr attributed the injustices of society to human pride and self-love and believed that this innate propensity for evil could not be controlled by humanity. But, he believed that a representative democracy could improve society&#x27;s ills. Like Edmund Burke, Niebuhr endorsed natural evolution over imposed change and emphasized experience over theory. Niebuhr&#x27;s Burkean ideology, however, often conflicted with his liberal principles, particularly regarding his perspective on racial justice. Though vehemently opposed to racial inequality, Niebuhr adopted a conservative position on segregation.

While after World War II most liberals endorsed integration, Niebuhr focused on achieving equal opportunity. He warned against imposing changes that could result in violence. The violence that followed peaceful demonstrations in the 1960s forced Niebuhr to reverse his position against imposed equality; witnessing the problems of the Northern ghettos later caused him to doubt that equality was attainable.

===Catholicism===
Anti-Catholicism surged in Detroit in the 1920s in reaction to the rise in the number of Catholic immigrants from southern Europe since the early 20th century. It was exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, which recruited many members in Detroit. Niebuhr defended pluralism by attacking the Klan. During the Detroit mayoral election of 1925, Niebuhr&#x27;s sermon, &quot;We fair-minded Protestants cannot deny&quot;, was published on the front pages of both the &quot;Detroit Times&quot; and the &quot;Free Press&quot;.

This sermon urged people to vote against mayoral candidate Charles Bowles, who was being openly endorsed by the Klan. The Catholic incumbent, John W. Smith, won by a narrow margin of 30,000 votes. Niebuhr preached against the Klan and helped to influence its decline in political power in Detroit. Niebuhr preached that:

===Martin Luther King Jr.===
In the &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, &quot;Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.&quot; King drew heavily upon Niebuhr&#x27;s social and ethical ideals; according to Andrew Young, &quot;King always claimed to have been much more influenced by Niebuhr than by Gandhi; he considered his nonviolent technique to be a Niebuhrian strategy of power&quot; and &quot;Whenever there was a conversation about power, Niebuhr came up. Niebuhr kept us from being naive about the evil structures of society.&quot; King invited Niebuhr to participate in the third Selma to Montgomery March in 1965, and Niebuhr responded by telegram: &quot;Only a severe stroke prevents me from accepting ... I hope there will be a massive demonstration of all the citizens with conscience in favor of the elemental human rights of voting and freedom of assembly&quot; (Niebuhr, March 19, 1965). Two years later, Niebuhr defended King&#x27;s decision to speak out against the Vietnam War, calling him &quot;one of the greatest religious leaders of our time&quot;. Niebuhr asserted: &quot;Dr. King has the right and a duty, as both a religious and a civil rights leader, to express his concern in these days about such a major human problem as the Vietnam War.&quot; Of his country&#x27;s intervention in Vietnam, Niebuhr admitted: &quot;For the first time I fear I am ashamed of our beloved nation.&quot;

===Judaism===
Throughout his life, Niebuhr cultivated a good reputation and rapport with the Jewish community. He was an early critic of Christian antisemitism, including proselytism, and a persistent critic of Nazism and rising antisemitism in Germany throughout the 1930s.

When he began as a young pastor in 1923 Detroit, he favored conversion of Jews to Christianity, scolding evangelical Christians who were either antisemitic or ignored them. He spoke out against &quot;the un-Christlike attitude of Christians&quot;, and what he called &quot;Jewish bigotry&quot;. Within three years, his theological views had evolved, and he spoke out against the practicality and necessity of missionizing Jews. He was the first prominent Christian theologian to argue it was inappropriate for Christians to seek to convert Jews to their faith, saying this negated “every gesture of our common biblical inheritance.” His experience in Detroit led him to the conclusion that the Jewish community was already sincerely committed to Social Justice.

In a 1926-01-10 lecture, Niebuhr said: &quot;If I were a self-respecting Jew, I certainly would not renounce the faith of the fathers to embrace a faith which is as involved as Christianity is with racialism, Nordicism and gentile arrogance. (...) What we need is an entente cordiale between prophetic Judaism and prophetic Christianity in which both religions would offer the best they have to each other.&quot;

Niebuhr&#x27;s 1933 article in &quot;The Christian Century&quot; was an attempt to sound the alarm within the Christian community over Hitler&#x27;s &quot;cultural annihilation of the Jews&quot;.

As a preacher, writer, leader, and adviser to political figures, Niebuhr supported Zionism and the development of Israel. His solution to antisemitism was a combination of a Jewish homeland, greater tolerance, and assimilation in other countries. Unlike other Christian Zionists, Niebuhr&#x27;s support of Zionism was practical, not theological, and not rooted in fulfillment of Biblical prophesy nor anticipation of the End-of-Days. Despite being a religious leader, he cautioned against the involvement of religious claims in the conflict.

Niebuhr noted that “Zionism is the expression of a national will to live that transcends the traditional orthodox religion of the Jews.” Jewish statehood was necessary because “the bigotry of majority groups toward minority groups that affront the majority by diverging from the dominant type is a perennial aspect of man’s collective life. The force of it may be mitigated, but it cannot be wholly eliminated.”

&quot;How is the ancient and hereditary title of the Jews to Palestine to be measured against the right of the Arab’s present possession? … The participants cannot find a common ground of rational morality from which to arbitrate the issues because the moral judgments which each brings to them are formed by the historical forces which are in conflict. … The effort to bring such a conflict under the dominion of a spiritual unity may be partly successful, but it always produces a tragic by-product of the spiritual accentuation of natural conflict. The introduction of religious motives into these conflicts is usually no more than the final and most demonic pretension.&quot;

===Secular humanism===
In response to a question from journalist Mike Wallace over whether or not Neibuhr considered himself superior to atheists such as the British mathematician Bertrand Russell, Niebuhr said that it would be &quot;pretentious&quot; to deem himself superior in the eyes of God to anyone else because of their religion or lack thereof, stating &quot;How do I know about God&#x27;s judgment? One of the fundamental points about religious humility is that you don&#x27;t know about the ultimate judgment. It&#x27;s beyond your judgment. And if you equate God&#x27;s judgment with your judgment, you have a wrong religion.&quot; Niebuhr also voiced his view that he would judge others, be they believers or atheists, &quot;by the fruits [of their] lives, rather than [their] presuppositions...a sense of charity...a sense of justice.&quot;

==History==
In 1952, Niebuhr published &quot;The Irony of American History&quot;, in which he interpreted the meaning of the United States&#x27; past. Niebuhr questioned whether a humane, &quot;ironical&quot; interpretation of American history was credible on its own merits, or only in the context of a Christian view of history. Niebuhr&#x27;s concept of irony referred to situations in which &quot;the consequences of an act are diametrically opposed to the original intention&quot;, and &quot;the fundamental cause of the disparity lies in the actor himself, and his original purpose.&quot; His reading of American history based on this notion, though from the Christian perspective, is so rooted in historical events that readers who do not share his religious views can be led to the same conclusion.

==Serenity Prayer==

Niebuhr created the first version of the Serenity Prayer. It inspired Winnifred Wygal to write versions of the prayer that would become well known. Fred R. Shapiro, who had cast doubts on Niebuhr&#x27;s claim of authorship, conceded in 2009 that, &quot;The new evidence does not prove that Reinhold Niebuhr wrote [the prayer], but it does significantly improve the likelihood that he was the originator.&quot; A popular version of it reads: 
&lt;poem&gt;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Influence==
Many political scientists, such as George F. Kennan, Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and Samuel P. Huntington, and political historians, such as Richard Hofstadter, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and Christopher Lasch, have noted his influence on their thinking.

Niebuhr exerted a significant influence upon mainline Protestant clergy in the years immediately following World War II, much of it in concord with the neo-orthodox and the related movements. That influence began to wane and then drop toward the end of his life.

The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in the late twentieth century described the legacy of Niebuhr as being contested between American liberals and conservatives, both of whom wanted to claim him. Martin Luther King Jr. gave credit to Niebuhr&#x27;s influence. Foreign-policy conservatives point to Niebuhr&#x27;s support of the containment doctrine during the Cold War as an instance of moral realism; progressives cite his later opposition to the Vietnam War.

In more recent years, Niebuhr has enjoyed something of a renaissance in contemporary thought, although usually not in liberal Protestant theological circles. Both major-party candidates in the 2008 presidential election cited Niebuhr as an influence: Senator John McCain, in his book &quot;Hard Call&quot;, &quot;celebrated Niebuhr as a paragon of clarity about the costs of a good war&quot;. President Barack Obama said that Niebuhr was his &quot; philosopher&quot; and &quot;favorite theologian&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; magazine columnist Fred Kaplan characterized Obama&#x27;s 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech as a &quot;faithful reflection&quot; of Niebuhr.

Kenneth Waltz&#x27;s seminal work on international relations theory, &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot;, includes many references to Niebuhr&#x27;s thought. Waltz emphasizes Niebuhr&#x27;s contributions to political realism, especially &quot;the impossibility of human perfection&quot;. Andrew Bacevich&#x27;s book &quot;The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism&quot; refers to Niebuhr 13 times. Bacevich emphasizes Niebuhr&#x27;s humility and his belief that Americans were in danger of becoming enamored of US power.

Other leaders of American foreign policy in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century have acknowledged Niebuhr&#x27;s importance to them, including Jimmy Carter, Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton.

==Legacy and honors==

Niebuhr died on June 1, 1971, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

* During his lifetime, Niebuhr was awarded several honorary doctorates.
* Niebuhr was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1947.
* In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Niebuhr the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
* In Niebuhr&#x27;s honor, New York City named West 120th Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive Reinhold Niebuhr Place. This is the site of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, where Niebuhr taught for more than 30 years.
*Elmhurst University, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, established the Niebuhr Medal to honor him and his brother. The first recipient was author Elie Wiesel. 
*A statue of Niebuhr can also be found on the Elmhurst campus; erected in 1997, the sculpture includes the Serenity Prayer printed in two places.

Niebuhr&#x27;s influence was at its peak during the first two decades of the Cold War. By the 1970s, his influence was declining because of the rise of liberation theology, antiwar sentiment, the growth of conservative evangelicalism, and postmodernism. According to historian Gene Zubovich, &quot;It took the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to revive Niebuhr.&quot;

In spring of 2017, it was speculated (and later confirmed) that former FBI director James Comey used Niebuhr&#x27;s name as a screen name for his personal Twitter account. Comey, as a religion major at the College of William &amp; Mary, wrote his undergraduate thesis on Niebuhr and televangelist Jerry Falwell.

==Personal style==
Niebuhr was often described as a charismatic speaker. The journalist Alden Whitman wrote of his speaking style:
He possessed a deep voice and large blue eyes. He used his arms as though he were an orchestra conductor. Occasionally one hand would strike out, with a pointed finger at the end, to accent a trenchant sentence. He talked rapidly and (because he disliked to wear spectacles for his far-sightedness) without notes; yet he was adroit at building logical climaxes and in communicating a sense of passionate involvement in what he was saying.

<text>The Gospel of Peter (), or the Gospel according to Peter, is a pseudographic text concerning Jesus Christ, only partially known today. Originally written in Koine Greek, it is a non-canonical gospel and was rejected as apocryphal by the Church&#x27;s synods of Carthage and Rome, which contributed to the establishment of the New Testament canon. It was the first of the apocryphal gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt.

A major focus of the surviving fragment of the Gospel of Peter is the Passion narrative, which ascribes responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus to Herod Antipas rather than to Pontius Pilate.
== Composition ==
=== Authorship ===
The Gospel of Peter explicitly claims to be the work of Saint Peter:

According to bible scholar Craig Blomberg, the Gospel of Peter is pseudepigraphical (bearing the name of an author who did not actually compose the text).

The true author of the gospel remains a mystery. Although there are parallels with the three synoptic gospels, Peter does not use any of the material unique to Matthew or unique to Luke. Raymond E. Brown and others find that the author may have been acquainted with the synoptic gospels and even with the Gospel of John; Brown even suggests that the author&#x27;s source in the canonical gospels was transmitted orally, through readings in the churches, i.e. that the text is based on what the author remembers about the other gospels, together with their own embellishments.

Ron Cameron and others have further speculated the Gospel of Peter was written independently of the synoptic gospels using an early proto-gospel. A consequence of this is the potential existence of a source text that formed the basis of the passion narratives in Matthew, Luke, and Mark, as well as in Peter. Origen makes mention of the Gospel of Peter as agreeing with the tradition of the Hebrews. The relationship to the Gospel according to the Hebrews becomes more clear when Theodoret states that the Nazarenes made use of the Gospel of Peter, for it is known by the testimony of the Fathers generally that the Nazarene Gospel was commonly called the Gospel according to the Hebrews. The same Gospel was in use among the Ebionites, and, in fact, as almost all critics are agreed, the Gospel according to the Hebrews – under various names such as the Gospel according to Peter, according to the Apostles, the Nazarenes, Ebionites, Egyptians, etc. – was substantially the same work, circulated very widely throughout the early Church, though with modifications.

=== Date ===
The gospel is widely thought to date from after the composition of the four canonical gospels. Scholars are divided as to the exact date of the text, with some placing it in the first half of the 2nd century and considering it to have been compiled based on oral traditions about Jesus, independent of the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=&quot;e/p 370–372&quot;&gt;Ehrman and Pleše 2011, pp. 370–372.&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of the text depends to a certain extent on whether it is the same &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot; condemned by Serapion, Bishop of Antioch upon inspection at Rhossus.&lt;ref name=&quot;e/p 371&quot;&gt;Ehrman and Pleše 2011, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhossus community had already been using it in their liturgy.

John Dominic Crossan argues that the Gospel of Peter, as it is found in the modern day, was composed in the 2nd century but incorporates a passion narrative source that predates all other known passion accounts. He calls this primitive passion source the &quot;Cross Gospel.&quot; Crossan asserts that this Cross Gospel was written before the synoptic gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke and that it influenced both them and the Gospel of Peter. Crossan&#x27;s view is not accepted by mainstream Biblical scholars.

Craig A. Evans argues that the Gospel of Peter was written in the 2nd century CE to counter anti-Christian polemics of that time (such as the ones found in Celsus&#x27;s &quot;The True Word&quot;).

Later Western references, which condemn the work, such as Jerome and the , traditionally connected to Pope Gelasius I, are apparently based upon the judgment of Eusebius, not upon a direct knowledge of the text.

== Historical references ==
The Second Epistle of Clement refers to a passage thought to be from the Gospel of Peter:
Origen mentions &quot;the Gospel according to Peter, as it is called&quot;, together with &quot;the Book of James&quot; (believed by scholars to be the apocryphal Gospel of James), in support of the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary. However, it is not clear that he was referring to what is known modernly as the Gospel of Peter because the extant fragments say nothing about this or about the birth of Jesus.

In his &quot;Church History&quot;, Eusebius writes that Bishop Serapion of Antioch had been informed that a Christian community in Rhosus was using the Gospel of Peter in their liturgy and had sent a letter authorizing them to do so, while also denying that such Gospel was actually written by Saint Peter. Later, however, Serapion was informed that the Gospel of Peter &quot;hid a heresy&quot;, which he attributed to Marcian of Rhossos and that he identified with docetism. Serapion reports that he read the Gospel carefully and had the opportunity &quot;to find, along with much of the Savior&#x27;s true doctrine, some additions&quot;. Eusebius also states that several works had been attributed to Peter: the First Epistle of Peter, the Second Epistle of Peter, the Acts of Peter, the Gospel of Peter, the Preaching of Peter and the Apocalypse of Peter. He accepts the First Epistle of Peter as genuine, the Second Epistle as useful but not canonical, while he describes the others as &quot;not universally accepted&quot;. Jerome mistakenly says in his that Serapion wrote the Gospel of Peter.

In his &quot;Compendium of Heretical Accounts&quot;, Theodoret states that the 4th century Nazarene sect used the Gospel of Peter in their liturgy, though there is little evidence to support this claim. In his &quot;Church History&quot;, Philip of Side states that &quot;the ancients absolutely refused the Gospel of the Hebrews, the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas, which they considered the work of heretics.&quot;

== Discovery ==

The Gospel of Peter was recovered in 1886 by the French archaeologist Urbain Bouriant in the modern Egyptian city of Akhmim ( north of Nag Hammadi). The 8th- or 9th-century manuscript had been respectfully buried with an Egyptian monk. The fragmentary Gospel of Peter was the first non-canonical gospel to have been rediscovered, preserved in the dry sand of Egypt. Publication, delayed by Bouriant until 1892, occasioned intense interest. From the passion sequence that is preserved, it is clear that the gospel was a narrative gospel, but whether a complete narrative similar to the canonical gospels or simply a Passion cannot be said.

Two other papyrus fragments from Oxyrhynchus (P.Oxy 4009 and P.Oxy. 2949) were uncovered later and published in 1972. They are possibly, but not conclusively, from the Gospel of Peter and would suggest, if they belonged, that the text was more than just a passion narrative. These small fragments both seem to give first person accounts of discussions between Jesus and Peter in situations prior to the Passion week. It has also been speculated that the Fayyum Fragment may be an excerpt from the Gospel of Peter.

To date it is one of four early non-canonical narrative gospels, which exist only in fragmentary form: this Gospel of Peter, the Egerton Gospel, and the two very fragmentary Oxyrhynchus Gospels (P.Oxy. 840 and P.Oxy. 1224). The main point of interest from the first has resided in establishing its relationship to the four canonical gospels.

== Contents ==
J. Rendel Harris (1852–1941) decided to introduce the Gospel of Peter to the public in &quot;A Popular Account of the Newly-Recovered Gospel of Peter.&quot; He opens with a description of its discovery, offering his opinions regarding its date and original language. Classifying the work as a Docetic gospel, Harris defines the community in which it arose as well as its use during the Patristic age. He translates the fragment and then proceeds to discuss the sources behind it. Harris is convinced that the author borrowed from the canonical accounts, and he lists other literature that may have incorporated the Gospel of Peter, with special emphasis on the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;.

Edgar J. Goodspeed stated that the main importance of this work is that it is the first of the Christian apologies, although on the next page he admits that only &quot;bits&quot; actually fall into that category.

One of the chief characteristics of the work is that Pontius Pilate is exonerated of all responsibility for the Crucifixion, the onus being laid upon Herod Antipas, the scribes, and other Jews, who pointedly did not &quot;wash their hands&quot; like Pilate. However, the Gospel of Peter was condemned as heretical by for its alleged docetic elements.

The opening leaves of the text are lost, so the Passion begins abruptly with the trial of Jesus before Pilate, after Pilate has washed his hands, and closes with its unusual and detailed version of the watch set over the tomb and the resurrection. The Gospel of Peter is more detailed in its account of the events after the Crucifixion than any of the canonical gospels, and it varies from the canonical accounts in numerous details: Herod gives the order for the execution, not Pilate, who is exonerated; Joseph (of Arimathea, which place is not mentioned) has been acquainted with Pilate; in the darkness that accompanied the crucifixion, &quot;many went about with lamps, supposing that it was night, and fell down&quot;.

Jesus&#x27; cry from the cross, which the Gospels of Mark and Matthew give as &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&quot; which Mark and Matthew explain as meaning, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; is reported in the Gospel of Peter as &quot;My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me&quot;. Immediately after, Peter states that, &quot;when he had said it, he was taken up&quot;, suggesting that Jesus did not actually die. This, together with the claim that on the cross Jesus &quot;remained silent, as though he felt no pain&quot;, has led many early Christians to accuse the text of docetism. F. F. Bruce writes:
F. F. Bruce continues:

The account in Peter tells that the supposed writer and other disciples hid because they were being sought on suspicion of plotting to set fire to the temple, and totally rejects any possibility of their disloyalty. The centurion who kept watch at the tomb is given the name Petronius. Details of the sealing of the tomb, requested of Pilate by the elders of the Jewish community, elaborate upon Matthew 27:66: &quot;So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch&quot;, saying instead:
Most importantly, the Resurrection and Ascension, which are described in detail, are not treated as separate events, but occur on the same day:
The text is unusual at this point in describing the Cross itself as speaking, and even moving out of the tomb. Deane Galbraith shows that the Gospel of Peter has derived its unusual description of the talking and moving cross by interpreting the first six verses of LXX Psalm 18 (Psalm 19 in the Masoretic Text) as a prophecy of Jesus&#x27; resurrection. The text then proceeds to follow the Gospel of Mark, ending at the short ending (where the women flee the empty tomb in fear), adding on an extra scene set during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, where the disciples leave Jerusalem, and ends, like the short ending, without Jesus being physically seen.

<doc id="204711" wikidata="Q282195" url="?curid=204711" title="Coat of arms of New Brunswick">
<text>The original coat of arms of New Brunswick was granted to New Brunswick by a Royal Warrant of Queen Victoria on 26 May 1868. The provincial flag is a banner of the arms.

==History==
The original coat of arms, consisting solely of the shield, was based on the design of the Great Seal of New Brunswick, which featured a sailing ship.

The achievement of arms was augmented with crest and motto by an Order in Council of then-Lieutenant Governor John Babbitt McNair in 1966. The supporters and compartment were added by Royal Warrant of Queen Elizabeth II on 24 September 1984, and presented to the province in a public ceremony in Fredericton the following day to mark the province&#x27;s bicentennial.

==Symbolism==
Crest
:The crest, an Atlantic salmon that is leaping, sits on a golden helmet and a coronet of maple leaves, and is marked with St. Edward&#x27;s crown, all three symbols of royal authority.
Shield
:The shield features a lion passant in chief, commemorating both England (whose arms feature three such lions) and Brunswick (whose arms have two). The principal charge is an ancient galley, symbolizing the maritime province&#x27;s links to the sea.
Compartment
:The compartment is covered by the provincial flower, the purple violet, and the fiddlehead, an edible fern that grows in New Brunswick.

Supporters
:The supporters are white-tailed deer collared with Maliseet wampum, and bear badges of the Union colours and of the fleurs-de-lis of royal France, to commemorate the colonization of the area by those powers.

Motto
:The motto, &quot;Spem reduxit&quot; means &quot;Hope Restored&quot;, refers to the province&#x27;s having acted as a haven for Loyalist refugees who fled there after the American Revolution.

<text>In heraldry, supporters, sometimes referred to as &quot;attendants&quot;, are figures or objects usually placed on either side of the shield and depicted holding it up.

Historically, supporters were left to an individual&#x27;s free choice and were assumed and changed at will, not always having any meaning whatsoever. In more modern times, restrictions have been put in place in certain countries and nowhere more prevalent than in the United Kingdom.

Early forms of supporters are found in medieval seals. However, unlike the coronet or helmet and crest, supporters were not part of early medieval heraldry. As part of the heraldic achievement, they first become fashionable towards the end of the 15th century, but even in the 17th century were not necessarily part of the full heraldic achievement (being absent, for example, in &quot;Siebmachers Wappenbuch&quot; of 1605).

The figures used as supporters may be based on real or imaginary animals, human figures, and in rare cases plants or other inanimate objects, such as the pillars of Hercules of the coat of arms of Spain. Often, as in other elements of heraldry, these can have local significance, such as the fisherman and the tin miner granted to Cornwall County Council, or a historical link; such as the lion of England and unicorn of Scotland in the two variations of the coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The arms of nutritionist John Boyd-Orr use two &#x27;garbs&#x27; (wheat sheaves) as supporters; the arms of , missiles; the arms of the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil, trees. Letters of the alphabet are used as supporters in the arms of Valencia, Spain. Human supporters can also be allegorical figures, or, more rarely, specifically named individuals.

There is usually one supporter on each side of the shield, though there are some examples of single supporters placed behind the shield, such as the imperial eagle of the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire. The coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo provide an extremely unusual example of two supporters issuing from behind the shield. While such single supporters are generally eagles with one or two heads, there are other examples, including the cathedra in the case of some Canadian cathedrals. At the other extreme and even rarer, the Scottish chief Dundas of that Ilk had three supporters: two conventional red lions and the whole supported by a salamander. The coat of arms of Iceland even has four supporters.

The context of the application of supporters may vary, although entitlement may be considered conditioned by grant of a type of augmentation of honour by admission in orders of chivalry or by heraldic authorities, such as in the case of traditional British heraldry.

==Attitude==

Animal supporters are, by default, as close to rampant as possible, if the nature of the supporter allows it (this does not need to be mentioned in the blazon), though there are some blazoned exceptions. An example of whales &#x27;non-rampant&#x27; is the arms of the Dutch municipality of Zaanstad.

==Regional development and entitlement==

Older writers trace origins of supporters to their usages in tournaments, where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection, and guarded by their servants or pages disguised in fanciful attire. However, medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. Also, the seal of John, Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the King of France, before 1316 bears his arms as; France ancient, a bordure &quot;gules&quot;, between two lions rampant away from the shield, and an eagle with expanded wings standing above it.

===Australia===
In Australia, Knights or Dames of the Order of Australia may be granted supporters. It is unclear whether supporters may only be used on arms granted by Garter Principal King of Arms, or whether other heraldic authority suffices. Further, as arms may be legitimately adopted upon an armiger&#x27;s whim, there may be nothing limiting the adoption of supporters by any person, should they so choose.

===Canada===
In Canada, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Order of Military Merit, Commanders of the Royal Victorian Order, people granted the style the Right Honourable, and corporations are granted the use of supporters on their coats of arms. Further, on his retirement from office as Chief Herald, Robert Watt was granted supporters as an honour.

===France===
In France, writers made a distinctive difference on the subject of supporters, giving the name of &quot;Supports&quot; to animals, real or imaginary, thus employed; while human figures or angels similarly used are called &quot;Tenants&quot; (i.e. &#x27;holders&#x27;). Trees and other inanimate objects which are sometimes used are called &quot;Soutiens&quot;.

===New Zealand===
Knights Grand Companion and Principal Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit are granted the use of heraldic supporters.

===Spain===
In Spain, there is a difference between &quot;tenantes&quot;, used for human figures, &quot;soportes&quot;, used for beasts, and &quot;sosténes&quot;, used for anything other than humans or beasts. There aren&#x27;t any rules governing the use, position, or whether they face the viewer or not. As a matter of fact, Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent says &quot;There are no rules that determine the use of [supporters] and it can be considered that their use are complete capriciousness or fantasy, without any precedent, in almost the totality of cases, with documented justification for the inclusion of these ornaments with the arms of a House or individual.&quot; The only generally accepted rule is that female and ecclesiastical arms should not have supporters, with the only exception for ecclesiastical the use of angels or when it comes to the arms of saints or monasteries.

===United Kingdom===
Originally, in England, supporters were regarded as little more than mere decorative and artistic appendages.

In the United Kingdom, supporters are typically an example of special royal favour, granted at the behest of the sovereign. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, and to some chiefs of Scottish clans. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers; Knights and Ladies Companion of the Order of the Garter; Knights and Ladies of the Order of the Thistle; Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire; and Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of St John. Knights banneret were also granted non-hereditary supporters, but no such knight has been created since the time of Charles I.

Supporters may also be granted to corporations which have a royal charter.

<text>In heraldry, mantling or &quot;lambrequin&quot; (its name in French) is drapery tied to the helmet above the shield. In paper heraldry it is a depiction of the protective cloth covering (often of linen) worn by knights from their helmets to stave off the elements, and, secondarily, to decrease the effects of sword-blows against the helmet in battle, from which it is usually shown tattered or cut to shreds; less often it is shown as an intact drape, principally in those cases where clergy use a helmet and mantling (to symbolise that, despite the perhaps contradictory presence of the helmet, they have not been involved in combat), although this is usually the artist&#x27;s discretion and done for decorative rather than symbolic reasons.

Generally, mantling is blazoned &quot;mantled x, doubled&quot; [lined] &quot;y&quot;; the cloth has two sides, one of a colour and the other of a metal. The mantling is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the livery colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which the outside of the mantling is per pale of two colours or both the inside and outside are per pale, and even rarer examples of other divisions, and there is a perhaps unique example in which the lining of the mantling is per pale of the two metals or of the entire mantling being of a single tincture. The mantling of the Black Loyalist Heritage Society is a unique example in which the mantling is of two furs (ermines, lined ermine). There is also the unique example of the mantling of Bruce Douglas Bolton, which is tartan on the outside. The coat of arms of Canada is mantled white and red, or &quot;argent doubled gules&quot;; furthermore, the current standard rendering of the Canadian arms has mantling in the shape of maple leaves. The arms of sovereigns are a common exception. The arms of the United Kingdom are &quot;or, lined ermine&quot;, such a mantling often being held to be limited to sovereigns.In the early days of the development of the crest, before the torse (wreath), crest coronets and chapeaux were developed, the crest often &quot;continued into the mantling&quot; if this was feasible (the clothes worn by a demi-human figure, or the fur of the animal, for instance, allowing or encouraging this). It still holds true frequently in Germany.

There are rare examples where the mantling is blazoned to complement the armiger&#x27;s coat of arms, mimicking the ordinaries and charges on the escutcheon. When charges occur, they are usually displayed as a semy.

<doc id="204719" wikidata="Q251238" url="?curid=204719" title="Compartment (heraldry)">
<text>In heraldry, a compartment is a design placed under the shield, usually rocks, a grassy mount (&quot;mount vert&quot;), or some sort of other landscape upon which the supporters are depicted as standing. Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the coat of arms of Belize and Gabon, in which what may be taken to be a crest, trees in both coats of arms rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment. It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer. As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the blazon separately from the supporters.

==Background==
If the compartment is mentioned in the blazon it forms part of the grant and is an integral part of the arms e.g. the current royal arms of the United Kingdom are required to have a compartment with plant badges. If no compartment is specified in the blazon then whether to draw one is at the discretion of the artist. The current arms of the Commonwealth of Australia are usually depicted on a compartment of a wreath of wattle, the national flower. It would be acceptable to omit the wattle or substitute something else as it does not form part of the grant.

The decorative flourish which was often placed by heraldic artists under the feet, hooves or paws of supporters, chiefly in the 19th century, was disparagingly known by some as the &quot;gas bracket&quot;, although this term never had any official currency; the only case in which something similar was ever actually mentioned in the blazon was the &quot;arabesque&quot; vert on which the whale supporters of Zaanstad, North Holland, the Netherlands, balance. The compartment of the coat of arms of Michigan is similar.

A rare instance in which the supporters stand on the motto scroll is in the arms of New Jersey. The coat of arms of the Netherlands, likewise, features the two lion supporters standing on the motto scroll.

Usually when arms are augmented by supporters, a compartment will be added too. In rare cases, a compartment might be granted as an augmentation. A compartment without supporters is possible but practically unknown, with the exception of the coat of arms of South Australia.

A compartment is usually some kind of landscape (in the case of Scottish chiefs it is generally a &quot;mount vert&quot; - &quot;grassy mount&quot; covered with the clan&#x27;s flower) or seascape, and these can be quite elaborate. These elaborate designs particularly feature in more recent Canadian grants, such as the compartment of the University of Northern British Columbia, in which the female Kermode bear and woodland caribou buck stand on a forest, mountain peaks and ears of wheat, all rising out of the conventionalised heraldic representation of water, which is itself charged with an orca.

Compartments can have a specific piece of geography; Kenya&#x27;s compartment is Mount Kenya and the compartment of Arbeláez, Cundinamarca, Colombia is a globe.

There are some unusual compartments. The compartment of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada is a quadrangle. The arms of the former Cumberland County Council have a wall as a compartment, while the Canadian Academy of Engineering has a bridge spanning water. The chief of Clan Donnachaidh has a man in chains as a compartment, while that of Dundas of that Ilk is &quot;a salamander in flames of fire&quot;. 

Recent compartments can also feature indigenous non-European features. The arms of Gisborne, New Zealand contain another unique compartment, a Māori waka (canoe).

Hip Hop the genre itself was created by African Americans during the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York. African Hip-hop and Rap has also women or girls like rapper. They began Rap in 1980 in south Africa and west Africa.

While the consensus is that hip hop originated in the Bronx, many scholars and enthusiasts argue that the genre&#x27;s artistic roots can be traced back to Africa. Dating back to the 13th century, griots were prominent figures in West African kingdoms and empires. These highly skilled orators, poets, musicians, praise singers and satirists traveled extensively, recounting the history of their empires through rhythmic and repetitive delivery. This well-established oral tradition is often cited as a precursor to rap, suggesting it may have laid the foundational groundwork for the emergence of hip hop. Call-and-response, popularized by artists like James Brown,and featured in 1980s songs like Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;The Breaks&quot;. Call-and-response has deep historical roots in African traditions, evident in the Igbo musical style of ogene music, the foundational elements of fuji music and oríkì panegyrics performed by Yoruba priests. African-American poetry groups, collectively called The Last Poets offered the earliest glimpse of Africa’s influence on Western hip hop culture, during the Civil Rights movement. The group&#x27;s vocal style incorporated elements of call-and-response and rhythmic chanting rooted in African cultural traditions. Moreover, the name &quot;The Last Poets&quot; was inspired by a poem titled &quot;Towards a Walk in the Sun&quot; by South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile.

==Algeria==

Algerian hip-hop music, as a genre, includes the hip-hop music of both native Algerians and Algerians abroad. Algerians living abroad have contributed much to this genre, especially in France, where they are also considered part of the French hip hop scene. Some of these Algerians have become prominent. Algeria also has a hip-hop scene, which, while less well known internationally, is among the most developed in Africa and the Arab world.

Raï is a genre of music that developed in Algeria during the 1920s as rural migrants incorporated their native musical styles into the culture of the growing urban centers of western Algeria.

==Angola==
Angola has a lively hip hop music scene, including popular and influential crews like Conciencia da Africa, Atitude violenta, Pobres Sem Culpa, Filhos Da Ala Este, Mutu Moxy (Intelektu) Based in Cape Town, South Africa, and have begun to work with some South African hip hop musicians. Angolan hip hop is characterized by the influence of American hip hop beats with a special flavor of Portuguese flow, mixed with African rhythm and some Caribbean influence. SSP, Mutu Moxy (Intelektu) Political Rap, Kool Kleva, Nelboy Dastha Burda are credited for being the pioneers of the hip hop in Angola from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.

Hip-hop in Angola can be very censored. In order for artists to perform in large arenas where they can get a lot of exposure and recognition, their music has to be reviewed by a board. Because of this, oftentimes artists who tend to speak out on politics in their music have trouble blowing up. Instead of getting to perform at certain events such as festivals and actual concerts, they are forced to perform to small groups in underground areas. This has made the underground hip hop music scene in Angola very lively.

MCK is one of the most popular underground rappers in Angola. He is known for constantly getting in trouble with the law about his lyrics, in which he constantly criticizes and calls out the government. Other rappers in Angola known for this include Brigadeiro 10 Pacotes and Dioniso Casimiro.

Luanda is the music capital of Angola. Many new sounds have came from this city, including a popular one called Kuduro. Legends like DJ Amado and Buraka Som Systema helped to spread this sound quick internationally by performing across the globe.

== Benin ==
Beninese hip hop traces its roots to a 1992 concert by Senegalese-French rapper MC Solaar in Cotonou. Several music groups presented in this concert, such as Ardiess, Sakpata Boys and H2O, later produced hip hop style music on their own. Beninese hip hop features lyrics in French, English and local languages such as Fon and Yoruba.

==Botswana==
Botswana has never had a large popular music industry, with most of its recorded music coming from South Africa or further abroad. However, since about 1999, Botswana hip hop performers have begun to gain mainstream acceptance; the record labels such as Dagee Records,

Phat Boy etc. has done a lot to promote Botswana hip hop. The hip hop movement in Botswana has grown over the years as evidenced by the release over the years of albums and songs from artists such as Mr Doe, Zeus, Touch Motswak Tswak, Ignition, S.C.A.R, Awesomore.aka Gaddamit, Cashless Society, Nitro, Konkrete, HT, Flex, Dice, Dj Dagizus, 3rd Mind, Kast, Nomadic, Slaine John and Draztik to name a few. The release of hip hop albums is slow because of the small market and competition from other genres of mostly dance-oriented music. Since 2000 hip hop has achieved more prominence in Botswana, with rappers like Scar Kast and Third Mind releasing relatively successful albums. In 2006, Scar released his sophomore offering, &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. The same year Kast released &quot;Dazzit&quot;. S.C.A.R has since won a Channel O Spirit of Africa Award 2007 for best hip hop. New Hip Hop Musicians such as William Last KRM, Ban T, DoubleUp(Ambitiouz Entertainment) and AbtheActivist have found mainstream success in the neighboring South Africa .

==Cameroon==
After hip hop reached Cameroon, it took two years to actually become popular. This was because when the genre of music first reached the country, it was associated with angry youth and rebellious behavior.

The hip hop scene of Cameroon includes pioneers like Manhitoo and Negrissim&#x27; who broke new ground in the early 1990s. Other hip hop artists from Cameroon are Les Nubians. Stanley Enow and Jovi continue to build the industry.

Krotal, also known as Paul Edouard Etoundi Onambele, is one of the most legendary pioneer rappers to come out of Cameroon. He also founded the popular record label Ndabott Prod in 2007.

Evindi and Sundjah formed one of the most influential rap groups out of Cameroon, Evindi and Sundjah in 1995.

Rap in Cameroon has continued to evolve since then. For example, Cameroon was not used to sampling beats. Jovi, who also goes by Ndukong Godlove, was one of the first artist to do this in the country and make it popular. Now many artists in Cameroon follow in his footsteps. Today the most viewed song and video out of Cameroon is Stanley Enow&#x27;s &#x27;Hein Pere&#x27;, which was released in 2013. Rap in Cameroon is also no longer associated with angry youth.

==Côte d&#x27;Ivoire==

Ivorian hip hop became a mainstream part of the popular music of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire beginning in 2009 after the victory of Ivorian hip hop group Kiff No Beat at the hip-hop contest Faya Flow, and has been fused with many of the country&#x27;s native styles, such as zouglou.

As citizens&#x27; freedom of speech dwindles away. Rap and its lyrics have been used by the youth as a way to protest this and rebel. Fally Ipupa is one of Congos most popular rappers.

The capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kinshasa, has long been a major home for pan-African styles of popular music like rumba, soukous and kwassa kwassa. Long-time performers on the Kinshasa scene include Profetzion (formerly of Holokaust), and the Congo Brazzaville rapper Passi.

==Gambia==

Gambia&#x27;s much larger neighbor, Senegal, is home to a thriving hip hop scene, which has exerted a strong influence on Gambian hip hop but Gambian hip hop is now evolving its own unique style. In 1999, the Gambia Radio &amp; Television Services gave out the first Gambian Rap Award. The first crew to win the award for best new act was Da Fugitvz, who rapped in Wolof, the national language of Senegal, and thus became popular in both countries. They also later played at Popkomm in Germany.

==Ghana==

Hip hop in Ghana is commonly referred to as Gh hiphop. The phrase GH Rap was created by Jayso and Ball J when they released their first Skillions mixtape. According to the two rappers, GH Rap means Hiphop made in Ghana. Hiplife is also a Ghanaian genre similar to hip hop music; it is a combination of hip hop music and highlife. This started in the late 1980s and early 90s with the hiplife father Reggie Rockstone, VIP, Talking Drums and Nananom.

Ghanaian rapping is mostly in the English language, but is also sometimes in Twi, Ewe, Ga or Hausa.

==Guinea==
Although Guinea is not much known internationally for any variety of popular music, there is a local hip hop music scene, which has produced one crew with an international reputation, Kill Point, which has toured across West Africa. Many groups use Guinean folk rhythms and styles in their music. The Guinean Africa Rap Festival is held in Conakry.

Hip Hop in Guinea first appeared in the 1990s. Since then, it has been used in the country to fight political and social battles, and in the fight for civil rights and justice. It is constantly being used to criticize the government. Rap in Guinea often features references to Congos history and historical figures. It has entirely changed the sociocultural identity of Guinea&#x27;s youth, which are now more concerned with making political changes in the country.

Emerging in the 1980s, Hipco has consistently maintained a social and political edge. Despite the challenges posed by the civil wars of the 1990s, it continued to evolve, becoming an integral aspect of Liberian cultural identity in present-day. 

==Madagascar==
Hip hop has rapidly grown in popularity in Madagascar in the past decade. The local name of hip hop is &quot;Haintso Haintso&quot;, meaning &quot;H. H.&quot; (for hip hop). Malagasy hip hop, although largely reflective of Western genre standards, has been moving toward incorporation of more Malagasy musical tradition in its style and instrumentation.

Hip hop spread to Madagascar in about 1985 together with breakdancing. The local rap scene (Rap Gasy) remained underground until the late nineties, although artists as early as 1994 were attracting attention with their politically provocative lyrics.

On 21 June 2007, UNICEF chose a 15-year-old Malagasy rap star, Name Six as its first-ever Junior Goodwill Ambassador for Eastern and Southern Africa. The young rapper&#x27;s work continues the genre&#x27;s tradition of social critique and political commentary, focusing largely on the challenges faced by children in underprivileged communities in Madagascar and voicing the views and concerns of the young, who are routinely omitted from political decision-making processes.

==Malawi==

Hip hop culture in Malawi is relatively young. Notable rappers who were early on the scene include Criminal A, Bantu Clan, Real Elements, Dynamike, Dominant 1, Black Mind, L-Planet, trudoccsy, Ben Flavor,Knight of the Round Table, and Wisdom Chitedze. The scene started to gain traction in the late 90s and expanded further in the early 2000s when cheap computers and recording gear became widely available to artists. The launch of Television Malawi in 1999 provided a platform for rappers to have their music videos beamed to a national audience. The music video to Wisdom Chitedze&#x27;s song Tipewe was on regular rotation on the station in its early days. In the early to mid-2000s artists such as Nospa G, M Krazy, David Kalilani, and Gosple helped push the music further. A lot of Malawi&#x27;s early hip hop music contained social commentary, religious, and introspective themes.

By the late 2000s the scene had picked up further with artists such as Barry One, Godskho, Sage Poet, Sergius, Prototype, Prevail, G.E.N.E.T.I.X, MO Effects, Nyasa Vibes Crew, Basement, Mandela Mwanza, Hyphen, Fredokiss, and Tay Grin gaining notoriety. Tay Grin&#x27;s music video for the song Stand Up was featured considerably on Channel O. He was not the first Malawian rapper to get his song on that station; that accolade goes to the Real Elements. However, Tay Grin&#x27;s got much more airplay. In 2009, Phyzix released his debut studio album The Lone Ranger LP which contained the hit singles Cholapitsa and Gamba. Around the same time, Christian rap started to gain popularity and that movement was spearheaded by Manyanda Nyasulu, DJ Kali, KBG, Double Zee, Liwu, C-Scripture, Asodzi, Erasto, and Sintha.

Some of the producers who helped pioneer the sound of Malawian hip hop include Dominant 1, Maj Beats, The Dare Devils, Kond1, Dynamike, Keith Justus Wako, Qabaniso Malewezi, Tapps, Dizzo, Sonye, Kas Mdoka and Rebel Musiq.

DJs such as Dr Gwynz and Kenny Klips also helped push the music on radio. They hosted a show called The Hip Hop Drill which involved playing rap music and a phone-in rap competition whereby rappers called in and competed to spit the best bars.

==Morocco==
==Namibia==
Hip hop music and culture have a big influence on the Namibian youth, with American [rappers], [Tupac Shakur], and [The Notorious B.I.G.] being popular. Most of the urban Namibian youth have adopted a hip-hop lifestyle, including their dress code. Early [Namibian hip hop] acts include a group called Dungeon Family.

==Niger==

&quot;Rap Nigerien&quot;, a style of Nigerien hip hop, began to develop in the late 1990s, mostly in Niamey, and has become one of the dominant popular music forms in Niger. It is a mélange of different languages spoken in Niger. Sampled music is often mellow, and is mixed with the traditional music, although more aggressive dance styles have been mixed in, reflecting influences of French, American, and other West African hip hop styles (especially Ivorian hip hop). Young, dissatisfied Nigeriens have used the form to talk about common social problems. Local recordings are mostly sold on cassette tapes and compact discs, as with most forms of contemporary West African popular music.

Hip hop groups began to appear and perform in Niamey in 1998. In August 2004, UNICEF opened its &quot;Scene Ouverte Rap&quot;, where 45 new groups entered selections among an informal count of 300 existing groups. Shows took place at Niamey&#x27;s Jean Rouch Centre Culturel Franco – Nigerien (CCFN) in August 2004.

==Nigeria==

Nigerian hip hop, began gaining traction in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with Lagos emerging as its initial hub. During this period, Nigeria was under military rule, which contributed to widespread economic difficulties, including currency devaluation, job losses, and high unemployment, particularly among recent university graduates. For many youths, hip hop served as an escape from these challenging circumstances. The genre was initially popularized through the use of Nigerian languages in the lyrics, combined with traditional hip hop beats from pioneers like DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash. Due to the scarcity of record labels and limited financial resources, aspiring musicians often produced their own music on modest budgets. Music videos from this era were typically simple and low-cost. The advent of computers and affordable music editing software in the late 1990s and early 2000s enabled Nigerian artists to produce higher-quality recordings, which quickly resonated with the local audience. This era saw a shift towards independent music production and distribution, with artists selling their music on CDs. Hip hop provided a platform for entertainment and a means to critique the government, advocating for social change. Notable early hip hop groups and artists from this period include Junior &amp; Pretty, Daniel &#x27;Danny&#x27; Wilson, Plantashun Boiz, and The Remedies, featuring members such as Eedris Abdulkareem, Eddy Remedy, and Tony Tetuila. The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the emergence of artists returning from the Western diaspora, such as eLDee da Don, U.G.O, Madarocka, and Naeto C, along with European-Nigerians like JJC Skillz and the 419 Squad. These artists helped to localize hip hop, incorporating Nigerian languages and English, thus enriching the genre&#x27;s linguistic diversity. Despite a decline in popularity from 2010 to 2021, when hip hop&#x27;s market share dropped from nearly 15% to 7%, a resurgence began in early 2022 with a new wave of artists like Reminisce, Olamide, Falz, Naira Marley, CDQ, PsycoYP, Cheque, and Blue Ivan, who introduced a refreshed approach to the genre. Publications such as Hip-Hop World Magazine, African Beatz, Blast, and Bubbles have played a significant role in shaping and promoting hip hop culture in Nigeria and across Africa.

=== Street pop ===

Street pop, also known as street hop, originating in Lagos is an experimental rap-vocal genre that evolved from a fusion of Nigerian hip hop, popular music, Afrobeats, and Nigerian street music. It draws influence from artists such as Danfo Drivers, Baba Fryo, and Daddy Showkey, as well as the shaku shaku dance style, which was initially inspired by gqom but eventually developed into its distinct genre. Characterized by vibrant tempos, street pop incorporates elements of gqom, highlife, pop, hip hop, and EDM. While it is predominantly fast-paced, slower variations are also common within the genre. Street pop is known for its melodic arrangements, use of urban colloquial language and Pidgin, and a blend of indigenous and Western rap styles. Variants of street pop include neo-fuji, shaku shaku and zanku. Prominent figures in the street pop scene are Olamide, Phyno, Slimcase, Mr Real, Idowest, Naira Marley, Zinoleesky, Mohbad, Balloranking, Reminisce, Rexxie, Zlatan Ibile, Sarz, 9ice, Lil Kesh, T.I Blaze, Asake, Portable, Bella Shmurda, Seyi Vibez, and DJ Kaywise.

==Rwanda==

Hip hop spread to Rwanda in the early to mid-1980s. The most prominent figure in the early Rwandan scene was DJ Berry (Nsabimana Abdul Aziz), who was a DJ for Kigali Night and Cosmos and a presenter for Radio Rwanda, in addition to being an early rapper and breakdancer. The Rwandan government of the period did not approve of hip hop, however, and DJ Berry was forced into exile in Goma, Zaire, where he continued performing. He later moved on to Germany and recorded &quot;Hey You&quot;, which became a hit on both Rwandan and Ugandan radio. After returning to Africa in 1990, Berry continued to promote hip hop in Rwanda until his death from AIDS in 1996. By the mid-1990s, hip hop was growing increasingly popular in Rwanda, due to the introduction of 101 FM Kigali and TVR in 1995, and American and French rappers like Tupac Shakur and MC Solaar became popular.

The first locally recorded Rwandan hip hop hit was &quot;Peaced Up&quot; by KP Robinson ft Mc Monday Assoumani. This was promoted by DJ Alex of Radio Rwanda from 1997.

In 2020, particularly in its capital Kigali, drill music experienced a sudden increase in popularity in 2020 because of the rise of local rappers and producers in the region, along with a localized scene known as &quot;Kinyatrap&quot;. The scene gave rise to numerous rappers such as Ish Kevin, Logan Joe, and Pro Zed.

==Senegal==


Senegal has one of the most active hip hop scenes on the continent and has produced international stars like MC Solaar. US hip hop became popular in Senegal in the early 1980s, and a few MCs began rapping. During this period, many Senegalese rappers were copying American performers quite closely. One often-cited reason for the prominence of Senegalese hip hop is the ancient musical and oral traditions of that country, which include some practices, like griots and tassou, which are similar to rapping. Some of the earliest hip hop groups from Senegal include Positive Black Soul, Pee Froiss, and Daara J. 

It was not until later in the decade that a more distinctive Senegalese sound began evolving, along with the use of Wolof lyrics. The 1990s saw a division in the Senegalese scene, with some artists remaining underground, associated with the American alternative hip hop scene, while others, like Black Mboolo (&quot;Alal&quot;), fused hip hop with Senegalese mbalax style, (this is called &quot;mbalax rap&quot; or &quot;rap ragga soul&quot;), which uses the sabar drums.

==Sierra Leone==
Sierra Leone rap music was originated by a Sierra Leone–based rapper; YOK Seven in the late 1990s. Prior to this time pop rapper Jimmy B had already blown up in South Africa. His pop rap was a rave in Sierra Leone during the mid 1990s. Hip hop music in Sierra Leone includes Grammy-nominated artist and author Freddy Will.

==Somalia==

One of the most internationally renowned Somali rappers is Canada-based K&#x27;naan (real name Kanaan Warsame). The award-winning artist is a rapper and a poet with three albums, &quot;The Dusty Foot Philosopher&quot; (on BMG Music), &quot;The Dusty Foot on the Road&quot; (on Wrasse Records) and &quot;Troubadour&quot; (on A&amp;M/OctoScope Music) He has been one of the most popular artists in this country and across the continent this century and is very politically engaged. As a teenager, K’Naan began to write songs to help him process the turmoil he experienced in Mogadishu. He had a major influence on rap when he released The Dusty Foot Philosopher. In this song he combined African instruments with American hip-hop to form a new sound. Many artists have followed in his footsteps. Soobax is one of his most popular tracks.

==South Africa==
=== South African hip hop ===
The history of South African hip hop in Cape Town can be traced back to the early 1980s, amid widespread cultural exchange between the United States, the West Indies, and South Africa since the 19th century. Influences from minstrels, swing, and bebop, partly in response to British imperialism, shaped South African musical styles. The discovery of gold in Johannesburg in the late 19th century led to a migration of diverse tribal groups, resulting in a fusion of traditional South African and European music, which contributed to the development of a unique sound. Over the past two decades, hip hop in South Africa has grown significantly, notably through the rise of kwaito, a distinct genre in its own right. Despite its growth, South African hip hop remains relatively underrecognized, with artists struggling to achieve commercial success. The South African hip hop scene became divided, with Cape Town being recognized as a central hub, known for its politically charged and socially conscious artists. The youth in South Africa initially engaged with hip hop through breakdancing and graffiti, due to the high cost and limited availability of American music. Economic and political sanctions made American hip hop difficult to access, with albums often arriving through relatives from abroad. Although some skepticism existed regarding hip hop&#x27;s ties to the broader global context of Third World struggles, South African youth embraced the genre’s anger, passion, and style. They localized hip hop to reflect their own cultural narratives, frustrations, and hopes. The adaptation allowed them to express their experiences and connect with broader socio-political issues, particularly in the context of apartheid, using hip hop as a vehicle for cultural pride and resistance.

South African hip hop has risen as a significant presence in the country&#x27;s mainstream music landscape and it has undergone a transformative journey over the decades. Notable figures in South African hip hop include Tuks Senganga, Cassper Nyovest, Nasty C, Kwesta, Khuli Chana, iFani, Mo&#x27;Molemi, Da L.E.S, Sjava, K.O, Frank Casino, Okmalumkoolkat, Fifi Cooper, Anatii, Emtee, Shane Eagle, YoungstaCPT, A-Reece, and Big Zulu.

Die Antwoord, an alternative hip hop group, gained global mainstream recognition. Their style, reflecting their Zef counter-culture with its embrace of &quot;cheap-and-dirty values,&quot; garnered attention worldwide. Their self-published debut, propelled by two standout and humorous YouTube music videos released in 2010, quickly went viral. Eliciting a highly polarized international response, their music ultimately led to a record deal with Cherrytree Records, an imprint of Interscope. Additionally, they sparked controversy by rejecting an opening act offer from American pop singer Lady Gaga for her Born This Way Tour.

== Hip Hop and civil rights in Africa ==
Rap has been used as a form of political protest in Africa since it reached the continent. Fela Kuti is legendary in Africa for being one of the first artists to use rap to critique the government. Since then, a large majority of rappers in Africa have followed in his footsteps. Rappers in Africa are often responsible for political change. For example, Keur Gui, a popular rap group in Africa helped to lead the Y&#x27;en a Marre movement in Senegal. They played a large role in getting thousands of Senegalese citizens to vote and make sure President Wade did not serve a third term.

Because hip hop in Africa has such a large impact on politics, many countries have begun censorship of rap. However, banned artists often gain popularity as listening to them is seen as a form of protest and rebellion.

Rapper PilAto for example, was arrested for participating in protests when he accused future member of the ruling party in Zambia of stealing state resources in 2017, in one of his songs.

<doc id="204722" wikidata="Q898519" url="?curid=204722" title="MOX fuel">
<text>Mixed oxide fuel, commonly referred to as MOX fuel, is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material, usually consisting of plutonium blended with natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, or depleted uranium. MOX fuel is an alternative to the low-enriched uranium fuel used in the light-water reactors that predominate nuclear power generation.

For example, a mixture of 7% plutonium and 93% natural uranium reacts similarly, although not identically, to low-enriched uranium fuel (3 to 5% uranium-235). MOX usually consists of two phases, UO2 and PuO2, and/or a single phase solid solution (U,Pu)O2. The content of PuO2 may vary from 1.5 wt.% to 25–30 wt.% depending on the type of nuclear reactor.

One attraction of MOX fuel is that it is a way of utilizing surplus weapons-grade plutonium, an alternative to storage of surplus plutonium, which would need to be secured against the risk of theft for use in nuclear weapons. On the other hand, some studies warned that normalizing the global commercial use of MOX fuel and the associated expansion of nuclear reprocessing would increase, rather than reduce, the risk of nuclear proliferation, by encouraging increased separation of plutonium from spent fuel in the civil nuclear fuel cycle.

==Overview==
In every uranium-based nuclear reactor core there is both fission of uranium isotopes such as uranium-235, and the formation of new, heavier isotopes due to neutron capture, primarily by uranium-238. Most of the fuel mass in a reactor is uranium-238. By neutron capture and two successive beta decays, uranium-238 becomes plutonium-239, which, by successive neutron capture, becomes plutonium-240, plutonium-241, plutonium-242, and (after further beta decays) other transuranic or actinide nuclides. Plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, like uranium-235. Small quantities of uranium-236, neptunium-237 and plutonium-238 are formed similarly from uranium-235.
Normally, with low-enriched uranium fuel being changed every five years or so, most of the plutonium-239 is &quot;burned&quot; in the reactor. It behaves like uranium-235, with a slightly higher cross section for fission, and its fission releases a similar amount of energy. Typically, about one percent of the spent fuel discharged from a reactor is plutonium, and some two-thirds of the plutonium is plutonium-239. Worldwide, almost 100 tonnes of plutonium in spent fuel arises each year.

Reprocessing the plutonium into usable fuel increases the energy derived from the original uranium by some 12%, and if the uranium-235 is also recycled by re-enrichment, this becomes about 20%. Plutonium is only reprocessed and used once as MOX fuel; spent MOX fuel, with a high proportion of minor actinides and plutonium isotopes, is stored as waste.
Existing nuclear reactors must be re-licensed before MOX fuel can be introduced because using it changes the operating characteristics of a reactor, and the plant must be designed or adapted slightly to take it; for example, more control rods are needed. Often only a third to half of the fuel load is switched to MOX, but for more than 50% MOX loading, significant changes are necessary and a reactor needs to be designed accordingly. The System 80 reactor design deployed at the U.S. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Phoenix, Arizona was designed for 100% MOX core compatibility, but so far has always operated on fresh low enriched uranium. In theory, the three Palo Verde reactors could use the MOX arising from seven conventionally fueled reactors each year and would no longer require fresh uranium fuel.

Fast neutron BN-600 and BN-800 reactors are designed for 100% MOX loading. In 2022, the BN-800 was fully loaded with MOX fuel for the first time.

According to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), CANDU reactors could use 100% MOX cores without physical modification. AECL reported to the United States National Academy of Sciences committee on plutonium disposition that it has extensive experience in testing the use of MOX fuel containing from 0.5 to 3% plutonium.

==Spent MOX fuel==
The content of un-burnt plutonium in spent MOX fuel from thermal reactors is significant – greater than 50% of the initial plutonium loading. However, during the burning of MOX the ratio of fissile (odd numbered) isotopes to non-fissile (even) drops from around 65% to 20%, depending on burn up. This makes any attempt to recover the fissile isotopes difficult and any bulk Pu recovered would require such a high fraction of Pu in any second generation MOX that it would be impractical. This means that such a spent fuel would be difficult to reprocess for further reuse (burning) of plutonium. Regular reprocessing of biphasic spent MOX is difficult because of the low solubility of PuO2 in nitric acid.

As of 2015, the only demonstration of twice-recycled, high-burnup fuel occurred in the Phénix fast reactor.

==Applications==
Reprocessing of commercial nuclear fuel to make MOX is performed in France and to a lesser extent in Russia, India and Japan. In the UK THORP operated from 1994 to 2018. China plans to develop fast breeder reactors and reprocessing. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is not permitted in the United States due to nonproliferation considerations. Germany had plans for a reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf but as this failed to materialize, it instead relied on French nuclear reprocessing capabilities until legally outlawing the transport of German spent fuel for reprocessing in 2005.

The United States was building a MOX fuel plant at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Although the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Duke Energy expressed interest in using MOX reactor fuel from the conversion of weapons-grade plutonium, TVA (the most likely customer) said in April 2011 that it would delay a decision until it could see how MOX fuel performed in the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi. In May 2018, the Department of Energy reported that the plant would require another $48 billion to complete, on top of the $7.6 billion already spent. Construction was cancelled.

===Thermal reactors===
Most modern thermal reactors using high burn up uranium oxide fuel produce a significant proportion of their output towards the end of core life from fission of plutonium produced by neutron capture in uranium 238 earlier in the life of the core, so adding some plutonium oxide to the fuel at manufacture is not in principle a very radical step. About 30 thermal reactors in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and France) are using MOX and an additional 20 have been licensed to do so. Most reactors use it as about one third of their core, but some will accept up to 50% MOX assemblies. In France, EDF aims to have all its 900 MWe series of reactors running with at least one-third MOX. Japan aimed to have one third of its reactors using MOX by 2010, and has approved construction of a new reactor with a complete fuel loading of MOX. As 2011, of the total nuclear fuel used, MOX provides about 2%.

Licensing and safety issues of using MOX fuel include:
* Plutonium oxide is substantially more toxic than uranium oxide, making fuel manufacture more difficult and expensive.
* As plutonium isotopes absorb more neutrons than uranium fuels, reactor control systems may need modification.
* MOX fuel tends to run hotter because of lower thermal conductivity, which may be an issue in some reactor designs.
* Fission gas release in MOX fuel assemblies may limit the maximum burn-up time of MOX fuel.

About 30% of the plutonium originally loaded into MOX fuel is consumed by use in a thermal reactor. In theory, if one third of the core fuel load is MOX and two-thirds uranium fuel, there is zero net change in the mass of plutonium in the spent fuel and the cycle could be repeated, but there are multiple difficulties in reprocessing spent MOX fuel. As of 2010, plutonium is only recycled once in thermal reactors, and spent MOX fuel is separated from the rest of the spent fuel to be stored as waste.

All plutonium isotopes are either fissile or fertile, although plutonium-242 needs to absorb 3 neutrons before becoming fissile curium-245; in thermal reactors isotopic degradation limits the plutonium recycle potential. About 1% of spent nuclear fuel from current LWRs is plutonium, with approximate isotopic composition 52% , 24% , 15% , 6% and 2% when the fuel is first removed from the reactor.

===Fast reactors===

Because the fission-to-capture ratio of high energy or fast neutrons changes to favour fission for almost all of the actinides, including , fast reactors could use all of them for fuel. All actinides can undergo neutron induced fission with unmoderated or fast neutrons. A fast reactor is therefore more efficient than a thermal reactor for using plutonium and higher actinides as fuel.

These fast reactors are better suited for the transmutation of other actinides than thermal reactors. Because thermal reactors use slow or moderated neutrons, the actinides that are not fissionable with thermal neutrons tend to absorb the neutrons instead of fissioning. This leads to buildup of heavier actinides and lowers the number of thermal neutrons available to continue the chain reaction. A subcritical reactor with an external neutron source could either be run in the fast neutron spectrum (without the need for highly enriched fuels as otherwise common in fast reactors) or use thermal neutrons to breed fissile materials, compensating the loss of neutrons by increasing the flux from the neutron source.

==Fabrication==
===Plutonium separation===
The first step is separating the plutonium from the remaining uranium (about 96% of the spent fuel) and the fission products with other wastes (together about 3%) using the PUREX process.

===Dry mixing===
MOX fuel can be made by grinding together uranium oxide (UO2) and plutonium oxide (PuO2) before the mixed oxide is pressed into pellets, but this process has the disadvantage of forming much radioactive dust.

===Coprecipitation===
A mixture of uranyl nitrate and plutonium nitrate in nitric acid is converted by treatment with a base such as ammonia to form a mixture of ammonium diuranate and plutonium hydroxide. After heating in a mixture of 5% hydrogen and 95% argon will form a mixture of uranium dioxide and plutonium dioxide. Using a base, the resulting powder can be run through a press and converted into pellets. The pellets can then be sintered into mixed uranium and plutonium oxide.

==Americium content==
Plutonium from reprocessed fuel is usually fabricated into MOX within less than five years of its production to avoid problems resulting from impurities produced by the decay of short-lived isotopes of plutonium. In particular, plutonium-241 decays to americium-241 with a 14-year half-life. Because americium-241 is a gamma ray emitter, its presence is a potential occupational health hazard. It is possible, however, to remove the americium from the plutonium by a chemical separation process. Even under the worst conditions, the americium/plutonium mixture is less radioactive than a spent-fuel dissolution liquor, so it should be relatively straightforward to recover the plutonium by PUREX or another aqueous reprocessing method.

==Curium content==
It is possible that both americium and curium could be added to a U/Pu MOX fuel before it is loaded into a fast reactor or a subcritical reactor run in &quot;Actinide burner mode&quot;. This is one means of transmutation. Work with curium is much harder than americium because curium is a neutron emitter, the MOX production line would need to be shielded with both lead and water to protect the workers.

Also, the neutron irradiation of curium generates the higher actinides, such as californium, which increase the neutron dose associated with the used nuclear fuel; this has the potential to pollute the fuel cycle with strong neutron emitters. As a result, it is likely that curium will be excluded from most MOX fuels. A subcritical reactor such as the Accelerator Driven System could &quot;burn&quot; such fuels if the problems associated with their handling and transportation are solved. However, to avoid power excursions due to unintended criticality, the neutronics must be known precisely at any given point in time, including the effect of build-up or consumption of neutron emitting nuclides as well as neutron poisons.

==Thorium MOX==

MOX fuel containing thorium and plutonium oxides is also being tested. According to a Norwegian study, &quot;the coolant void reactivity of the thorium-plutonium fuel is negative for plutonium contents up to 21%, whereas the transition lies at 16% for MOX fuel.&quot; The authors concluded, &quot;Thorium-plutonium fuel seems to offer some advantages over MOX fuel with regards to control rod and boron worths, CVR and plutonium consumption.&quot;

<doc id="204728" wikidata="Q61855" url="?curid=204728" title="Matthew C. Perry">
<text>Matthew Calbraith Perry (April 10, 1794 – March 4, 1858) was a United States Navy officer who commanded ships in several wars, including the War of 1812 and the Mexican–American War. He led the Perry Expedition that ended Japan&#x27;s isolationism and signed the Convention of Kanagawa between Japan and the United States in 1854.

Perry was interested in the education of naval officers and assisted in the development of an apprentice system that helped establish the curriculum at the United States Naval Academy. With the advent of the steam engine, he became a leading advocate of modernizing the U.S. Navy and came to be considered &quot;The Father of the Steam Navy&quot; in the United States.

==Lineage==
Matthew Perry was a member of the Perry family, a son of Sarah Wallace (née Alexander) (1768–1830) and Navy Captain Christopher Raymond Perry (1761–1818). He was born April 10, 1794, in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. His siblings included Oliver Hazard Perry, Raymond Henry Jones Perry, Sarah Wallace Perry, Anna Marie Perry (mother of George Washington Rodgers), James Alexander Perry, Nathaniel Hazard Perry, and Jane Tweedy Perry (who married William Butler).

His mother was born in County Down, Ireland and was a descendant of an uncle of William Wallace, the Scottish knight and landowner. His paternal grandparents were James Freeman Perry, a surgeon, and Mercy Hazard, a descendant of Governor Thomas Prence, a co-founder of Eastham, Massachusetts, who was a political leader in both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, and governor of Plymouth; and a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers, both of whom were signers of the Mayflower Compact, Elder William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, and George Soule, through Susannah Barber Perry.

==Naval career==

In 1809, Perry received a midshipman&#x27;s warrant in the Navy and was initially assigned to , under the command of his elder brother. He was then assigned to , where he served as an aide to Commodore John Rodgers. &quot;President&quot; attacked a British Royal Navy warship, in the lead-up to the War of 1812. Perry continued aboard &quot;President&quot; during the War of 1812 and was present at the engagement with .

Rodgers fired the first shot of the war at &quot;Belvidera&quot;. A later shot resulted in a cannon bursting, killing several men and wounding Rodgers, Perry and others. Perry transferred to , commanded by Stephen Decatur, and saw little fighting in the war afterwards, since the ship was trapped in port at New London, Connecticut.

Following the signing of the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war, Perry served on various vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. Perry served under Commodore William Bainbridge during the Second Barbary War. He then served in African waters aboard USS &quot;Cyane&quot; during its patrol off Liberia from 1819 to 1820. After that cruise, Perry was sent to suppress piracy and the slave trade in the West Indies.

===Opening of Key West===
From 1821 to 1825, Perry placed in commission and commanded , a schooner with 12 guns. He deployed to the West Africa Station to support the American and British joint patrols to suppress the slave trade.

In 1815, the Spanish governor in Havana deeded the island of Key West to Juan Pablo Salas of St. Augustine in Spanish Florida. After Florida was transferred to the United States, Salas sold Key West to American businessman John W. Simonton for $2,000 in 1821. Simonton lobbied Washington to establish a naval base on Key West, both to take advantage of its strategic location and to bring law and order to the area. 

On March 25, 1822, Perry sailed &quot;Shark&quot; to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, physically claiming the Florida Keys as United States territory. Perry renamed Cayo Hueso &quot;Thompson&#x27;s Island&quot; for the Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson and the harbor &quot;Port Rodgers&quot; for the president of the Board of Navy Commissioners. Neither name stuck however.

From 1826 to 1827, Perry acted as fleet captain for Commodore Rodgers. In 1828, Perry returned to Charleston, South Carolina, for shore duty. In 1830, he took command of a sloop-of-war, . During this period, while in port in Russian Kronstadt, Perry was offered a commission in the Imperial Russian Navy, which he declined.

He spent 1833 to 1837 as second officer of the New York Navy Yard, later the Brooklyn Navy Yard, gaining a promotion to captain at the end of this tour.

===Father of the Steam Navy===

Perry had an ardent interest in and saw the need for naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the United States Naval Academy. He was a vocal proponent of modernizing the Navy. Once promoted to captain, he oversaw construction of the Navy&#x27;s second steam frigate , which he commanded after its completion. 

He was called &quot;The Father of the Steam Navy&quot;, and he organized America&#x27;s first corps of naval engineers. Perry conducted the first U.S. naval gunnery school while commanding &quot;Fulton&quot; from 1839 to 1841 off Sandy Hook on the New Jersey coast.

===Promotion to commodore===
In 1841, Perry received the title of commodore, when the Secretary of the Navy appointed him commandant of New York Navy Yard. The United States Navy did not have ranks higher than captain until 1857, so the title of commodore carried considerable importance. Officially, an officer would revert to his permanent rank after the squadron command assignment had ended, although in practice officers who received the title of commodore retained the title for life, as did Perry.

During his tenure in Brooklyn, he lived in Quarters A in Vinegar Hill, a building which still stands today. In 1843, Perry took command of the Africa Squadron, whose duty was to interdict the slave trade under the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, and continued in this endeavor to 1844.

===Mexican–American War===

In 1845, Commodore David Conner&#x27;s length of service in command of the Home Squadron had come to an end. However, the coming of the Mexican–American War persuaded the authorities not to change commanders in the face of the war. Perry, who eventually succeeded Conner, was made second-in-command and captained . Perry captured the Mexican city of Frontera, demonstrated against Tabasco, being defeated in San Juan Bautista by Colonel Juan Bautista Traconis in the First Battle of Tabasco, and took part in the capture of Tampico on November 14, 1846.

Perry had to return to Norfolk, Virginia, to make repairs and was there when the amphibious landings at Veracruz took place. His return to the U.S. gave his superiors the chance to give him orders to succeed Commodore Conner in command of the Home Squadron. Perry returned to the fleet, and his ship supported the siege of Veracruz from the sea. 

After the fall of Veracruz, Winfield Scott moved inland, and Perry moved against the remaining Mexican port cities. Perry assembled the Mosquito Fleet and captured Tuxpan in April 1847. In June 1847 he attacked Tabasco personally, leading a 1,173-man landing force ashore and attacking the city of San Juan Bautista from land, defeating the Mexican forces and taking the city.

In 1847, Perry was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati in recognition of his achievements during the Mexican War.

==Perry Expedition: opening of Japan, 1852–1854==

In 1852, Perry was assigned a mission by American President Millard Fillmore to force the opening of Japanese ports to American trade, through the use of gunboat diplomacy if necessary. The growing commerce between the United States and China, the presence of American whalers in waters offshore Japan, and the increasing monopolization of potential coaling stations by European powers in Asia were all contributing factors. Shipwrecked foreign sailors were either imprisoned or executed, and the safe return of such persons was one demand. 

The Americans were also driven by concepts of manifest destiny and the desire to impose the benefits of western civilization and the Christian religion on what they perceived as backward Asian nations. The Japanese were forewarned by the Dutch of Perry&#x27;s voyage but were unwilling to change their 250-year-old policy of national seclusion. There was considerable internal debate in Japan on how best to meet this potential threat to Japan&#x27;s economic and political sovereignty.

On November 24, 1852, Perry embarked from Norfolk, Virginia, for Japan, in command of the East India Squadron in pursuit of a Japanese trade treaty. He chose the paddle-wheeled steam frigate as his flagship and made port calls at Madeira (December 11–15), Saint Helena (January 10–11), Cape Town (January 24 – February 3), Mauritius (February 18–28), Ceylon (March 10–15), Singapore (March 25–29), Macao and Hong Kong (April 7–28). 

In Hong Kong he met with American-born Sinologist Samuel Wells Williams, who provided Chinese language translations of his official letters, and where he rendezvoused with . He continued to Shanghai (May 4–17), where he met with the Dutch-born American diplomat, Anton L. C. Portman, who translated his official letters into the Dutch language, and where he rendezvoused with .

Perry then switched his flag to &quot;Susquehanna&quot; and made call at Naha on Great Lewchew Island (Ryukyu, now Okinawa) from May 17–26. Ignoring the claims of Satsuma Domain to the islands, he demanded an audience with the Ryukyuan King Shō Tai at Shuri Castle and secured promises that the Ryukyu Kingdom would be open to trade with the United States. Continuing on to the Ogasawara islands in mid-June, Perry met with the local inhabitants and purchased a plot of land.

===First visit (1853)===
Perry reached Uraga at the entrance to Edo Bay in Japan on July 8, 1853. His actions at this crucial juncture were informed by a careful study of Japan&#x27;s previous contacts with Western ships and what he knew about the Japanese hierarchical culture. As he arrived, Perry ordered his ships to steam past Japanese lines towards the capital of Edo and turn their guns towards the town of Uraga. Perry refused Japanese demands to leave or to proceed to Nagasaki, the only Japanese port open to foreigners.

Perry attempted to intimidate the Japanese by presenting them a white flag and a letter which told them that in case they chose to fight, the Americans would destroy them. He also fired blank shots from his 73 cannon, which he claimed was in celebration of the American Independence Day. Perry&#x27;s ships were equipped with new Paixhans shell guns, cannons capable of wreaking great explosive destruction with every shell. He also ordered his ship boats to commence survey operations of the coastline and surrounding waters over the objections of local officials.

Meanwhile, &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyoshi was ill and incapacitated, which resulted in governmental indecision on how to handle the unprecedented threat to the nation&#x27;s capital. On July 11, &quot;Rōjū&quot; Abe Masahiro bided his time, deciding that simply accepting a letter from the Americans would not constitute a violation of Japanese sovereignty. The decision was conveyed to Uraga, and Perry was asked to move his fleet slightly southwest to the beach at Kurihama where he was allowed to land on July 14, 1853. After presenting the letter to attending delegates, Perry departed for Hong Kong, promising to return the following year for the Japanese reply.

===Second visit (1854)===
On his way back to Japan, Perry anchored off Keelung in Formosa, known today as Taiwan, for ten days. Perry and crewmembers landed on Formosa and investigated the potential of mining the coal deposits in that area. He emphasized in his reports that Formosa provided a convenient, mid-way trade location. Perry&#x27;s reports noted that the island was very defensible and could serve as a base for exploration in a similar way that Cuba had done for the Spanish in the Americas. Occupying Formosa could help the United States counter European monopolization of the major trade routes. The United States government failed to respond to Perry&#x27;s proposal to claim sovereignty over Formosa. 

To command his fleet, Perry chose officers with whom he had served in the Mexican–American War. Commander Franklin Buchanan was captain of &quot;Susquehanna&quot;. Joel Abbot, Perry&#x27;s second in command, was captain of &quot;Macedonian&quot;. Commander Henry A. Adams was chief of staff with the title &quot;Captain of the Fleet&quot;. Major Jacob Zeilin, future commandant of the United States Marine Corps, was the ranking Marine officer and was stationed on &quot;Mississippi&quot;.

Perry returned on February 13, 1854, after only half a year rather than the full year promised, and with ten ships and 1,600 men. American leadership designed the show of force to &quot;command fear&quot; and &quot;astound the Orientals.&quot; After initial resistance, Perry was permitted to land at Kanagawa, near the site of present-day Yokohama on March 8. The Convention of Kanagawa was signed on March 31. Perry signed as American plenipotentiary, and Hayashi Akira, also known by his title of &quot;Daigaku-no-kami&quot;, signed for the Japanese side. The celebratory events for the signing ceremony included a Kabuki play from the Japanese side and, from the American side, U.S. military band music and blackface minstrelsy.

Perry departed, mistakenly believing the agreement had been made with imperial representatives, not understanding the true position of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, the de facto ruler of Japan. Perry then visited Hakodate on the northern island of Hokkaido and Shimoda, the two ports which the treaty stipulated would be opened to visits by American ships. A handscroll with pictorial record from the Japanese side of US Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s second visit to Japan in 1854 is retained in the British Museum in London.

===Return to the United States (1855)===
When Perry returned to the United States, Congress voted to grant him a reward of $20,000, , in appreciation of his work in Japan. He used part of this money to prepare and publish a report on the expedition in three volumes, titled &quot;Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan&quot;. He was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list when his health began to fail, as a reward for his service in the Far East.

==Last years==
Living in his adopted home of New York City, Perry&#x27;s health began to fail as he suffered from cirrhosis of the liver from heavy drinking. Perry was known to have been an alcoholic, which compounded the health complications leading to his death. He also suffered severe arthritis that left him in frequent pain, and on occasion precluded him from his duties. 

Perry spent his last years preparing for the publication of his account of the Japan expedition, announcing its completion on December 28, 1857. Two days later he was detached from his last post, an assignment to the Naval Efficiency Board. He died awaiting further orders on March 4, 1858, in New York City, of rheumatic fever that had spread to the heart, compounded by complications of gout and alcoholism.

Initially interred in a vault on the grounds of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery, in New York City, Perry&#x27;s remains were moved to the Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island, on March 21, 1866, along with those of his daughter, Anna, who died in 1839. In 1873, an elaborate monument was placed by Perry&#x27;s widow over his grave in Newport.

==Personal life==
Perry was married to Jane Slidell Perry (1797–1864), sister of United States Senator John Slidell (1793–1871), in New York on December 24, 1814, and they had ten children:

* Jane Slidell Perry (c. 1817–1880)
* Sarah Perry (1818–1905), who married Col. Robert Smith Rodgers (1809–1891)
* Jane Hazard Perry (1819–1881), who married John Hone (1819–1891) and Frederic de Peyster (1796–1882)
* Matthew Calbraith Perry (1821–1873), a captain in the United States Navy and veteran of the Mexican War and the Civil War
* Susan Murgatroyde Perry (c. 1824–1825)
* Oliver Hazard Perry (c. 1825–1870), US Consul in Canton, China
* William Frederick Perry (1828–1884), a 2nd Lieutenant, United States Marine Corps, 1847–1848
* Caroline Slidell Perry Belmont (1829–1892), who married financier August Belmont
* Isabella Bolton Perry (1834–1912), who married George T. Tiffany
* Anna Rodgers Perry (c. 1838–1839)

In 1819, Perry joined the masonic Holland Lodge No. 8 in New York City, New York.

==Legacy==
Perry was a key agent in both the making and recording of Japanese history, as well as in the shaping of Japanese history. 90% of school children in Japan can identify him.

Woodblock paintings of Matthew Perry closely resemble his actual 
appearance, depicting a physically large, clean shaven, jowly man. The portraits portray him with blue eyeballs, rather than blue irises. Westerners in this period were commonly thought of as &quot;blue-eyed barbarians&quot;, however, in Japanese culture, blue eyeballs were also associated with ferocious or threatening figures, such as monsters or renegades. It is thought that the intimidation that the Japanese felt at the time could have influenced these portraits. Some portraits of Perry depict him as a tengu. However, the portraits of his crewmen are normal.

When Perry returned to the United States after signing the Convention of Kanagawa, he brought with him diplomatic gifts, including art, pottery, textiles, musical instruments, and other artifacts now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

&quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; is a musical set in Japan beginning in 1853 and follows the difficult westernization of Japan, told from the point of view of the Japanese.

A replica of Perry&#x27;s U.S. flag is on display on board the memorial in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, attached to the bulkhead just inboard of the Japanese surrender signing site on the starboard side of the ship. The original flag was brought from the U.S. Naval Academy Museum to Japan for the Japan surrender ceremony and was displayed on that occasion at the request of Douglas MacArthur, who was a blood-relative of Perry. 
Today, the flag is preserved and on display at the Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. 

In the museum, the flag is displayed the &#x27;wrong&#x27; way round. However, photographs show that at the signing ceremony, this flag was displayed properly, on its starboard side, with the stars in the upper right corner, as are all flags on vessels, known as ensigns. The cloth of this historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the museum directed that a protective backing be sewn on it, which accounts for its currently being displayed &#x27;port&#x27; side round.

==Memorials==
Japan erected a monument to Perry on July 14, 1901, at the spot where the commodore first landed. The monument survived World War II and is now the centerpiece of a small seaside park called Perry Park at Yokosuka, Japan. Within the park there is a small museum dedicated to the events of 1854. Matthew C. Perry Elementary and High School can be found on Marine Corps Air Station, Iwakuni.

At his birthplace in Newport, there is a memorial plaque in Trinity Church, Newport and a statue of Perry in Touro Park.

<text>Nicholas Scott Cannon (born October 8, 1980) is an American comedian, television presenter, actor, and rapper. In television, he began his career as a teenager on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; before going on to host &quot;The Nick Cannon Show&quot;, &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, &quot;Lip Sync Battle Shorties,&quot; and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He has also acted in the films &quot;Drumline&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing,&quot; &quot;Roll Bounce,&quot; and &quot;Goal II: Living the Dream&quot;.

As a recording artist, Cannon briefly saw commercial success with his 2003 single &quot;Gigolo&quot; (featuring R. Kelly), which peaked within the top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led his self-titled debut studio album (2003) — his only major label release under Jive Records. In 2006, Cannon recorded the singles &quot;Dime Piece&quot; and &quot;My Wife&quot; for the planned album &quot;Stages&quot;, which was never released.

== Early life ==
Cannon was born on October 8, 1980, in San Diego, California. He was largely raised by his paternal grandfather, whom both he and his biological father called &quot;dad&quot;. As a child, he grew up in Lincoln Park&#x27;s Bay Vista Housing Projects, a gang-ridden section of Southeast San Diego. While in his teenage years, Cannon was affiliated with the Lincoln Park Bloods street gang, but stated that he left behind his affiliations after losing a close friend. In 1998, he graduated from Monte Vista High School in Spring Valley, where he was president of the African Student Coalition and participated in track and field. Cannon received his first break doing stand-up comedy on his father&#x27;s local cable public access TV program.

== Music career ==
===1999–2006: Music beginnings, &quot;Nick Cannon&quot; and &quot;Stages&quot;===
As a teenager, Cannon was one-third of the rap group &quot;Da G4 Dope Bomb Squad&quot;, they opened for the likes of Will Smith, LFO, 98 Degrees, and Montell Jordan.

After signing with Jive Records in 2001, he was featured alongside Romeo Miller and 3LW on the &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; soundtrack with a cover of the 1988 hit song &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;. His debut self titled album was released in 2003 and included the single &quot;Your Pops Don&#x27;t Like Me (I Really Don&#x27;t Like This Dude)&quot;.

In 2005, Cannon formed his own record label, Can-I-Ball Records, with plans to release his second studio album, entitled &quot;Stages&quot;, later that year. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Can I Live?&quot;, an anti-abortion (pro-life) song, was released in July 2005 followed by the second single &quot;Dime Piece&quot; in March 2006. It was never released because of Cannon&#x27;s acting career.

===2009–2012: N&#x27;Credible Entertainment, Slick Nick and &quot;Child of the Corn&quot;===
In 2009, Cannon formed a new label after cancelling his old label Can-I-Ball Records entitled N&#x27;Credible Entertainment. In 2010, Cannon created a parody of hip hop pioneer Slick Rick entitled &quot;Slick Nick&quot;. He released two songs by the character such as &quot;I&#x27;m a Slick Rick&quot;, a freestyle of Cali Swag District&#x27;s &quot;Teach Me How to Dougie&quot; in which he attempted to diss hip hop mega-star Eminem, and &quot;Nick&#x27;s Story&quot;, a freestyle rap version of Slick Rick&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot;. On December 6, 2011, Cannon released his debut mixtape entitled &quot;Child of the Corn&quot;.

===2013–present: &quot;White People Party Music&quot; and second mixtape===
On July 26, 2013, Cannon premiered his new single &quot;Me Sexy&quot; and announced over seven years after the shelving of his album &quot;Stages&quot; that he was working on a new second studio album entitled &quot;White People Party Music&quot; featuring collaborations with Afrojack, Pitbull, Future and Polow da Don.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Looking for a Dream&quot; was released on February 11, 2014. The song features Afrojack. The music video was released on VEVO on February 13.

On November 16, 2016, Cannon released his second mixtape &quot;The Gospel of Ike Turn Up: My Side of the Story&quot;. Prior to the release of the mixtape, a music video for the single &quot;If I Was Your Man&quot; was released on November 7, 2016.

On December 2, 2016, Cannon released a single called &quot;Hold On&quot; on iTunes.

Cannon released &quot;The Invitation&quot;, an Eminem diss track, on December 9, 2019, as a response to Eminem&#x27;s feature on Fat Joe and Dre&#x27;s &quot;Lord Above&quot; dissing Cannon. The track featured former record producer and convicted felon Suge Knight, as well as rappers Hitman Holla, Charlie Clips and Prince Eazy, whom Cannon referred to as &quot;The Black Squad&quot;. After Eminem responded to Cannon with two tweets, Cannon released a second diss track the next day featuring the same rappers as well as Conceited titled &quot;Pray For Him&quot;, followed by another solo diss track entitled &quot;The Invitation Canceled&quot;

== Other ventures ==
===Hosting===
In 2005, Cannon created, produced, and hosted the MTV improv comedy series &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot;. That same year he hosted the so-called slime stunt on Nickelodeon&#x27;s 2005 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards in which a human cannonball was shot into slime. In addition, he was the DJ on Ellen DeGeneres&#x27;s &quot;Bigger, Longer, And Wider&quot; show. On December 11, 2009, Cannon hosted the Nickelodeon HALO Awards along with Justin Timberlake, Hayden Panettiere, LeBron James, Kelly Rowland and Alicia Keys.

In 2010, Cannon created and co-hosted the short-lived TeenNick original series &quot;The Nightlife.&quot;

On July 4, 2011, Cannon hosted the Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest, an annual American competitive eating competition.

On November 12, 2012, MTV2 announced the revival of &quot;Wild &#x27;N Out&quot;. The revived show was produced by Cannon&#x27;s Ncredible Entertainment, the series premiered in 2013 with a few returning faces joined by a roster of fresh talents. When asked about the show coming back, Cannon said, &quot;With our show&#x27;s original cast, everyone from Kevin Hart to Katt Williams, Affion Crockett and Taran Killam becoming household names, I am looking forward to working with MTV2 as we work to introduce the biggest comedic stars of tomorrow with the return of Wild &#x27;N Out.&quot; Rapper Big Boi of Outkast has confirmed in a tweet on Twitter he was shooting an episode on January 29, 2013, in NYC and for people to join in the audience.

Season 5 of the show premiered on July 9, 2013, to the highest ratings in MTV2 history. It was renewed for season 6 and 7, which aired in two blocks.

Meanwhile on December 1, 2012, Cannon would launch and host the &quot;TeenNick Top 10&quot; on TeenNick as part of his executive role with the network. The program counted down ten popular videos of the week, often with Cannon&#x27;s input also a part of the week&#x27;s playlist. The series would air until March 17, 2018, when TeenNick phased out all original programming.

On November 4, 2013, Cannon was the master of ceremonies as well as an honoree at the annual &quot;Ebony&quot; Magazine Power 100 Awards. In 2014, he began hosting &quot;Caught on Camera with Nick Cannon&quot; on NBC.

On August 4, 2016, &quot;Wild &#x27;N Out&quot; returned for its 8th season after three record-breaking seasons.

On February 3, 2021, Cannon tested positive for COVID-19, leading to Niecy Nash temporarily filling in for him during his quarantine during the fifth season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He returned to hosting duty after competing as the wild card contestant &quot;Bulldog&quot; in the fifth episode and was eliminated by Nash&#x27;s choice. Cannon unmasked without the panelists having to make their final guesses.

In 2019, it was announced that Cannon would be debuting his own syndicated daytime talk show in 2020 via Lionsgate&#x27;s Debmar-Mercury and Cannon&#x27;s own production company, NCredible Entertainment. After taking a brief hiatus due to his controversy, the show, &quot;Nick Cannon&quot;, premiered on September 27, 2021, with the Fox Television Stations as a key group. The show was canceled in March 2022, and his final episode aired on May 27, 2022, with guest Carrie Ann Inaba.

====&quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and departure====
From 2009 to 2016, Cannon served as the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. He announced he would not be back for 2017, citing creative differences between him and the executives of NBC. The resignation came in the wake of news that the network considered firing Cannon after he made disparaging remarks about NBC in his Showtime comedy special, &quot;Stand Up, Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot;. &quot;I love art and entertainment too much to watch it be ruined by controlling corporations and big business,&quot; Cannon said in a statement, referring to the cable giant Comcast&#x27;s ownership of NBC. Cannon, however, was technically under contract to host &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and could have been potentially sued by NBC for breach of contract, though this was considered unlikely. NBC executives did not accept his resignation and had been stated to be keeping their fingers crossed that he would instead choose to return. Cannon&#x27;s resignation was ultimately accepted as final without further incident. He was replaced in his position as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; by Tyra Banks, known for also having hosted &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

===Business===
Following his role as host of the TEENick block, Cannon was the chairman of the TeenNick channel for Nickelodeon in 2009, as well as its development and creative consultant. In 2012, he created a sketch-comedy series, &quot;Incredible Crew&quot;, starring six teenagers as Cannon wrote and produced the theme song. The show was produced by Cartoon Network Studios, in association with Ncredible Entertainment. The series aired 13 episodes before being canceled. As previously mentioned, he also hosted the network&#x27;s &quot;TeenNick Top 10&quot; video countdown program.

On November 30, 2012, a picture of Cannon was posted on the Ncredible Entertainment website, which reported that Cannon signed a deal with NBCUniversal to produce scripted and unscripted material for the network.

In December 2015, Cannon was named &quot;Chief Creative Officer&quot; of RadioShack in hopes of catering to a younger crowd. According to the company this role involved &quot;creating RadioShack-exclusive products and curating the in-store experience.&quot; They launched the NCredible line of consumer audio electronics the following February, starting with the Ncredible1 Wireless Headphones.

=== Radio hosting ===
On January 19, 2010, Cannon hosted the morning show (6–10AM) with co-hosts Nikki and Southern Sarah Lee at 92.3 NOW FM (WXRK-FM) in New York. On February 17, 2012, he stepped down from 92.3 NOW citing health issues.

Cannon has a weekly chart program called &quot;Cannon&#x27;s Countdown&quot; that is syndicated by CBS Radio.

Currently, Cannon hosts his own show &quot;Nick Cannon Mornings&quot; at Power 106 in Los Angeles. His show replaced J. Cruz&#x27;s &quot;The Cruz Show&quot; in the 5am – 10am time slot after J. Cruz went over to urban contemporary hip hop iHeart Radio rival KRRL &quot;Real 92.3&quot; for their afternoon drive show.

===Comedy===
On July 13, 2010, Cannon announced that he was going on a comedy tour in fall 2010, beginning at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal.

In early 2011, Cannon recorded his first stand-up comedy special titled &quot;Mr. Showbiz&quot; at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The special premiered on Showtime on May 14, 2011. A digital release of &quot;Mr. Showbiz&quot; became available on iTunes beginning May 16, 2011, with a physical release of the album on May 31, 2011.

==Personal life==
Cannon graduated from Howard University in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Criminology/Administration of Justice and a minor in Africana Studies.

Cannon endorsed the 2020 presidential campaign of rapper Kanye West after he guest-starred on his podcast &quot;Cannon&#x27;s Class&quot;.

=== Health and illnesses ===
Cannon was hospitalized on January 4, 2012, for treatment of &quot;mild kidney failure&quot;, and again on February 17, 2012, after a pulmonary embolism. On March 5, 2012, he announced that his kidney problems were due to lupus nephritis.

In November 2024, Cannon revealed he had been &quot;clinically diagnosed&quot; with narcissistic personality disorder, saying &quot;I need help&quot;.

===Relationships and children===
In February 2007, Cannon met model Selita Ebanks. The couple got engaged with a public proposal at Times Square in May of the same year, but broke off the engagement by October.

Cannon married singer-songwriter Mariah Carey on April 30, 2008, at her private estate on Windermere Island in the Bahamas. On April 30, 2011, Carey gave birth to fraternal twins.

Model and real estate agent Bre Tiesi gave birth to their son in June 2022.

In September 2022, model LaNisha Cole gave birth to their daughter.

===Activism===
In 2011, Cannon filmed a public service announcement for DoSomething encouraging teens to find a cause about which they are passionate and take action in their communities. Since 2011, Cannon has served as the celebrity spokesperson for the National Association of Letter Carriers&#x27; annual national food drive, which is held throughout the United States on the second Saturday in May.

===Racist comments===
On July 14, 2020, Cannon was fired by ViacomCBS after making racist and anti-Semitic remarks during an episode of his podcast &quot;Cannon&#x27;s Class&quot; with Professor Griff. Cannon endorsed conspiracy theories about Jewish control of finance, claimed that Jews had stolen the identity of &quot;black people as the &#x27;true Hebrews&#x27;, and cited Louis Farrakhan, who is labeled as an anti-Semite by the Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League. Cannon also made black supremacist statements, calling white people &quot;savages&quot; who were &quot;closer to animals&quot;, claiming the &quot;only way that they can act is evil&quot;, citing the pseudoscientific melanin theory. A statement from ViacomCBS noted that the company&#x27;s relationship with Cannon was terminated due to his promotion of &quot;hateful speech and... anti-Semitic conspiracy theories&quot;.

Two days later, Cannon released an apology only for his remarks regarding anti-Semitism, saying: &quot;I want to assure my Jewish friends, new and old, that this is only the beginning of my education.&quot; He also demanded complete ownership of &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot;, and an apology from ViacomCBS for his termination. When Fox became aware of his podcast, the network immediately consulted him and accepted his public apology, allowing him to remain host of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He donated his first paycheck to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in light of the incident. On February 5, 2021, ViacomCBS announced that &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot; would resume production with Cannon as host, saying that Cannon has &quot;taken responsibility for his comments&quot; and &quot;worked to educate himself&quot; through conversations with Jewish leaders.

<text>Lee Roy Raymond (born August 13, 1938) is an American businessman and was the chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of ExxonMobil from 1999 to 2005. He had previously been the CEO of Exxon since 1993. He joined the company in 1963 and served as president from 1987 and a director beginning in 1984.

While at Exxon, Raymond was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail global warming. While casting doubt on climate change in public, internal Exxon research pointed to the role of human activity in climate change and the dangers of climate change which was characterized in the PBS Frontline three-part documentary &quot;The Power of Big Oil&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Lee Raymond was born in Watertown, South Dakota, on August 13, 1938. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1956. Raymond received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. Raymond went on to earn his PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the same university in 2001. Raymond met his wife, Charlene née Hocevar, while studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; she was pursuing and later earned a degree in journalism.

==Career==
Raymond began working for Exxon in 1963. Raymond became a director of Exxon in 1984 and in 1987 he became the president of the company. In 1993, he became CEO succeeding Lawrence G. Rawl and held this post until 2005. He negotiated the merger with Mobil that became effective on January 1, 2000, and gave birth to the new ExxonMobil company. In 2003, when approaching the age of 65, the mandatory retirement age for executives at ExxonMobil, the board of directors requested him to stay in his position two more years, in order to prepare his succession, after the post-merger reorganisation period. On August 14, 2005, Raymond announced that he would retire at the end of 2005 as ExxonMobil&#x27;s chairman and CEO, two years later than the usual mandatory retirement age of 65 for the company executives. ExxonMobil president Rex W. Tillerson succeeded Raymond on 1 January 2006. On April 14, 2006, it was reported that Raymond&#x27;s retirement package was worth about $400 million, the largest in history for a U.S. public company. However, the majority of that sum consisted of retirement-independent salary, bonuses, stock options, and restricted stock awards from his final year and prior years that, while high, are not unprecedented among major American CEOs. Retirement-specific payments in accordance with the standard pension plan provided to all ExxonMobil employees totaled around $100 million, calculated based on his over forty years of service and his salary upon retirement. Raymond was also chair of the National Petroleum Council (NPC), when it was asked to produce a report on the future of oil supply and demand.

Raymond was one of the most outspoken executives in the United States against regulation to curtail global warming. In the 1990s, Raymond claimed that the scientific evidence for climate change was “inconclusive” and that “the case for global warming is far from air tight.”

After retiring from Exxon, Raymond was hired in 2005 as lead independent director for JPMorgan Chase. In 2020, amid pressure to remove Raymond from the board due to his history on climate change, JPMorgan Chase removed Raymond as lead independent director of JPMorgan Chase’s board.

==Legacy==
Steve Coll describes Raymond as &quot;notoriously skeptical about climate change and disliked government interference at any level&quot;. In a new BBC Documentary, Big Oil v the World, Professor Martin Hoffert, a former Exxon climate consultant, called Lee Raymond&#x27;s report, &quot;Climate Change: Don&#x27;t Ignore the facts,&quot; as &quot;a load of baloney,&quot; and &quot;I would have to say that on an ethical basis, it is actually evil.&quot;

Lee Raymond was at the helm of Exxon while it remained one of the last large companies to omit gay employees in its anti-discrimination policy. He was also at the helm during the takeover of Mobil, when the new Exxon-Mobil corporation rescinded Mobil&#x27;s pre-existing anti-discrimination policy. HR policy was eventually updated in 2015 to include a prohibition on discrimination against gay employees, but from 1999 to 2014 the board annually rejected a resolution brought by shareholders to compel the company to implement a non-discrimination policy.

His son, John T. Raymond, is active in the oil and gas industry. John partnered with the Jim Flores and Paul Allen-backed Vulcan Capital in the buyout of Plains Resources.

Lee Raymond received the Woodrow Wilson Award from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution for Corporate Citizenship during a dinner held in his honor in Dallas, Texas, in early 2003.
