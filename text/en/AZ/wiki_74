<text>Stirling Castle, located in Stirling, is one of the largest and most historically and architecturally important castles in Scotland. The castle sits atop an intrusive crag, which forms part of the Stirling Sill geological formation. It is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs, giving it a strong defensive position. Its strategic location, guarding what was, until the 1890s, the farthest downstream crossing of the River Forth, has made it an important fortification in the region from the earliest times.

Most of the principal buildings of the castle date from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A few structures remain from the fourteenth century, while the outer defences fronting the town date from the early eighteenth century.

Before the union with England, Stirling Castle was also one of the most used of the many Scottish royal residences, very much a palace as well as a fortress. Several Scottish Kings and Queens have been crowned at Stirling, including Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1542, and others were born or died there.

There have been at least eight sieges of Stirling Castle, including several during the Wars of Scottish Independence, with the last being in 1746, when Bonnie Prince Charlie unsuccessfully tried to take the castle. Stirling Castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is now a tourist attraction managed by Historic Environment Scotland.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Castle Hill, on which Stirling Castle is built, forms part of the Stirling Sill, a formation of quartz-dolerite around 350 million years old, which was subsequently modified by glaciation to form a &quot;crag and tail&quot;. It is likely that this natural feature was occupied at an early date, as a hill fort is located on Gowan Hill, immediately to the east.

The Romans bypassed Stirling, building a fort at Doune instead, but the rock may have been occupied by the Maeatae at this time. It may later have been a stronghold of the Manaw Gododdin, and has also been identified with a settlement recorded in the 7th and 8th centuries as Iudeu, where King Penda of Mercia besieged King Oswy of Bernicia in 655. The area came under Pictish control after the defeat of the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain thirty years later. However, there is no archaeological evidence for occupation of Castle Hill before the late medieval period.

Other legends have been associated with Stirling, or &quot;Snowdoun&quot; as it was more poetically known. The 16th-century historian Hector Boece claims in his &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot; that the Romans, under Agricola, fortified Stirling, and that Kenneth MacAlpin, traditionally the first King of Scotland, besieged a castle at Stirling during his takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the 9th century. Boece is, however, considered an unreliable historian.

Another chronicler, William Worcester, associated Stirling with the court of the legendary King Arthur. Tradition suggests that St Monenna founded a chapel here, as she is said to have done at Edinburgh Castle, although it is now thought that the legend of Monenna results from a later confusion of early Christian figures, including Modwenna and Moninne.

The first record of Stirling Castle dates from around 1110, when King Alexander I dedicated a chapel there. It appears to have been an established royal centre by this time, as Alexander died here in 1124. During the reign of his successor David I, Stirling became a royal burgh, and the castle an important administration centre. King William I formed a deer park to the south-west of the castle, but after his capture by the English in 1174, he was forced to surrender several castles, including Stirling and Edinburgh Castle, under the Treaty of Falaise. There is no evidence that the English actually occupied the castle, and it was formally handed back by Richard I of England in 1189. Stirling continued to be a favoured royal residence, with William himself dying there in 1214, and Alexander III laying out the New Park, for deer hunting, in the 1260s.

=== Wars of Independence ===

Stirling remained a centre of royal administration until the death of Alexander III in 1286. His passing triggered a succession crisis, with Edward I of England invited to arbitrate between competing claimants. Edward came north in 1291, demanding that Stirling, along with the other royal castles, be put under his control during the arbitration. Edward gave judgement in favour of John Balliol, hoping he would be a &quot;puppet&quot; ruler, but John refused to obey Edward&#x27;s demands.

In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, beginning the Wars of Scottish Independence, which would last for the next 60 years. The English found Stirling Castle abandoned and empty, and set about occupying this key site. They were dislodged the following year, after the victory of Andrew Moray and William Wallace at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Many of the garrison were killed during the battle, after which the English commanders William FitzWarin and Marmaduke Thweng retreated into the castle. However, they were quickly starved into surrender by the Scots.

Next summer, the castle changed hands again, being abandoned by the Scots after the English victory at Falkirk. Edward strengthened the castle, but it was besieged in 1299 by forces including Robert Bruce. King Edward failed to relieve the garrison, who were forced to surrender.

By 1303, the English again held the upper hand, and Stirling was the last remaining castle in Scottish hands. Edward&#x27;s army arrived in April 1304, with at least 17 siege engines. The Scots, under William Oliphant, surrendered on 20 July, but part of the garrison were ordered back into the castle by Edward, as he had not yet deployed his latest engine, &quot;Warwolf&quot;. Warwolf is believed to have been a large trebuchet, which destroyed the castle&#x27;s gatehouse. Although Edward&#x27;s victory seemed complete, he was dead by 1307, and Robert Bruce was now King of Scots. By 1313, only Stirling, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Berwick castles were held by the English. Edward Bruce, the king&#x27;s brother, laid siege to Stirling, which was held by Sir Philip Mowbray. After several months, on 24 June 1313, Mowbray proposed a bargain: that he would surrender the castle, if it were not relieved within one year by the English. Edward Bruce agreed, and withdrew. Scottish historian Patrick Fraser Tytler would describe Mowbray&#x27;s offer, five centuries later, as &quot;a truce involving conditions which ought on no account to have been accepted.&quot; As Tytler noted, the effect &quot;was to check the ardour of the Scots in that career of success, which was now rapidly leading to the complete deliverance of their country; it gave the King of England a whole year to assemble the strength of his dominions... We need not wonder, then, that Bruce was highly incensed, on hearing that, without consulting him, his brother had agreed to Mowbray&#x27;s proposals.&quot;
The following summer, the English duly headed north, led by Edward II, to save the castle. On 23 June 1314, King Robert&#x27;s forces met the English at the Battle of Bannockburn, within sight of the castle walls. The resulting English defeat was decisive. King Edward attempted to take refuge in the castle, but Mowbray was determined to keep to his word, and the English were forced to flee. Mowbray handed over the castle, changing sides himself in the process. King Robert ordered the castle to be slighted; its defences destroyed to prevent reoccupation by the English.
The war was not over, however. The second War of Scottish Independence saw the English in control of Stirling Castle by 1336, when Thomas Rokeby was the commander, and extensive works were carried out, still largely in timber rather than stone. Andrew Murray attempted a siege in 1337, when guns may have been used for one of the first times in Scotland. Robert Stewart, the future King Robert II, retook Stirling in a siege during 1341–1342. Maurice Murray was appointed as its keeper, who in the words of Andrew of Wyntoun &quot;inforsyt it grettumly, for riche he was and full mychty&quot; (enforced it greatly, for rich he was and full mighty). In 1360, Robert de Forsyth was appointed governor of Stirling Castle, an office he passed on to his son John and grandson William, who was governor in 1399.

=== Early Stewarts ===

Under the early Stewart kings Robert II (reigned 1371–1390) and Robert III (reigned 1390–1406), the earliest surviving parts of the castle were built. Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith, Regent of Scotland as brother of Robert III, undertook works on the north and south gates. The present north gate is built on these foundations of the 1380s, the earliest surviving masonry in the castle. In 1424, Stirling Castle was part of the jointure (marriage settlement) given to James I&#x27;s wife Joan Beaufort, establishing a tradition which later monarchs continued.

After James&#x27; murder in 1437, Joan took shelter here with her son, the young James II. He hosted a tournament at Stirling on Shrove Tuesday 1449, which included a combat between two teams of three, led by the Burgundian knight Jacques de Lalaing and James Douglas, a brother of the Earl of Douglas. The Burgundian knights were the victors. In 1452, it was at Stirling Castle that James stabbed and killed William, 8th Earl of Douglas, when the latter refused to end a potentially treasonous alliance with John of Islay, Earl of Ross and Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford. James III (reigned 1460–1488) was born here, and later undertook works to the gardens and the chapel royal. The manufacture of artillery in the castle is recorded in 1475. James&#x27; wife, Margaret of Denmark, died in Stirling Castle in 1486, and two years later James himself died at the Battle of Sauchieburn, fought over almost the same ground as the Battle of Bannockburn, just to the south of the castle.

=== Renaissance palace ===

Almost all the present buildings in the castle were constructed between 1490 and 1600, when Stirling was developed as a principal royal centre by the Stewart kings James IV, James V and James VI. The architecture of these new buildings shows an eclectic mix of English, French and German influences, reflecting the international ambitions of the Stewart dynasty.
James IV (reigned 1488–1513) kept a full Renaissance court, including alchemists, and sought to establish a palace of European standing at Stirling. He undertook building works at the royal residences of Edinburgh, Falkland and Linlithgow, but the grandest works were at Stirling, and include the King&#x27;s Old Building, the Great Hall, and the Forework. He also renovated the chapel royal, one of two churches within the castle at this time, and in 1501 received approval from Pope Alexander VI for the establishment of a college of priests. The Forework, of which little now remains, was derived from French military architecture, although military details were added more for style than for defence. A new portcullis was painted with red lead and linseed oil. The gardener, George Campbell, built archery butts next to the stables in 1504. James IV played tennis at Stirling with the Spanish ambassador, Pedro de Ayala.

If a satirical account in two poems by the poet William Dunbar is based on facts, the castle walls may have been the site of an attempt at human-powered flight, c.1509, by the Italian alchemist and abbot of Tongland, John Damian. The Captain of the Castle Andrew Aytoun kept an alchemist called Caldwell maintaining a furnace for &quot;quinta essencia&quot;, the mythical fifth element, at the castle.

The building works begun by James IV had not been completed at the time of his death at the Battle of Flodden. His successor, James V (reigned 1513–1542), was crowned in the chapel royal, and grew up in the castle under the guardianship of Lord Erskine. In 1515, the Regent Albany brought 7,000 men to Stirling to wrest control of the young king from his mother, Margaret Tudor. James V as monarch was said to have travelled in disguise under the name &quot;Gudeman of Ballengeich&quot;, after the road running under the eastern wall of the castle. Ballengeich means &quot;windy pass&quot; in Gaelic. In 1533 a priest James Nicholson was in charge of the building fabric, and he also fed cranes, herons, peacocks, and bitterns for the king&#x27;s table.

James V continued and expanded his father&#x27;s building programme, creating the centrepiece of the castle, the Royal Palace, built under the direction of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart and masons brought from France. James V also died young, leaving unfinished work to be completed by his widow, Mary of Guise. His infant daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots, was brought to Stirling Castle for safety, and crowned in the chapel royal on 9 September 1543. She too was brought up here, until she was sent to Inchmahome Priory, and then to France in 1548. In the 1550s, during the Regency of Mary of Guise, Anglo-French hostilities were fought out in Scotland. Artillery fortifications were added to the south approach of the castle including the &#x27;French Spur&#x27;, and these form the basis of the present Outer Defences. Guise employed an Italian military engineer called Lorenzo Pomarelli. From 1534 to 1584 Michael Gardiner was in charge of the artillery.

Queen Mary returned to Scotland in 1561, and visited Stirling Castle frequently. She nursed Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, through an illness here in 1565, and the two were soon married. Their son, James VI, was baptised here in December 1566. The celebrations included fireworks, an assault on a mock castle, and a masque designed by Bastian Pagez. Darnley was already estranged from the Queen and did not attend although he was resident at the castle. James&#x27; guardian, the Earl of Mar, was made hereditary governor of the castle in 1566. Mary was travelling from Stirling when she was abducted by the Earl of Bothwell, beginning the chain of events that led to her forced abdication and her flight to England. When Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle in May 1568, the Earl of Mar was ordered step up security at Stirling around the king and expel from the castle all but his closest friends and relatives.

The young King James was crowned in July 1567 in the nearby Church of the Holy Rude, and grew up within the castle walls in the care of Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar and under the tutelage of the humanist scholar George Buchanan. A tennis court was built of timber for the king in 1576. Frequently used as a pawn in the struggles between his regents and the supporters of Mary, the young king was closely guarded. Stirling became the base for James&#x27; supporters, while those nobles who wished to see Queen Mary restored gathered at Edinburgh, under William Kirkcaldy of Grange. Grange led a raid on Stirling in 1571, attempting to round up the Queen&#x27;s enemies, but failed to gain control of the castle or the King.

The keeper of the Castle, Alexander Erskine of Gogar was ejected by supporters of Regent Morton in April 1578, after his son was fatally wounded during a struggle at the gate. The rebellious Earls of Mar and Angus seized the castle in 1584, but surrendered and fled to England when the King arrived with an army. They returned the following year, forcing the King to surrender, although they proclaimed their loyalty to him.

In December 1593 Anne of Denmark decided to come to Stirling for the birth of her first child, and James ordered the palace which was in &quot;ruin and decay&quot; to be repaired. Prince Henry was born in the castle in 1594, and the present Chapel Royal was constructed for his baptism on 30 August. Probably built by William Schaw, the chapel completed the quadrangle of the Inner Close. Like his predecessors Henry spent his childhood here under the 2nd Earl of Mar, until the Union of the Crowns of 1603, when his father succeeded as King of England and the royal family left for London.

=== Military fortress ===

After their departure, Stirling&#x27;s role as a royal residence declined, and it became principally a military centre. It was used as a prison for persons of rank during the 17th century, and saw few visits by the monarch. The architect James Murray restored roofs and facilities of the castle for the return of James VI &amp; I to Scotland, who stayed in Stirling during July 1617. From 1625, extensive preparations were made for the anticipated visit of the new king, Charles I, including works to the gardens and painting of the Chapel Royal. Charles did not come to Scotland until 1633, and only stayed in the castle briefly.

Following the execution of Charles I, the Scots crowned his son Charles II, and he became the last reigning monarch to stay here, living at the castle in 1650. The Royalist forces were defeated at Dunbar by those of Oliver Cromwell, and the King marched south to defeat at Worcester. General Monck laid siege to the castle on 6 August 1651, erecting gun platforms in the adjacent churchyard. After the garrison mutinied, Colonel William Conyngham was obliged to surrender on 14 August. Damage done during the siege can still be seen on the church and the Great Hall.

After The Restoration of Charles II, the Earl of Mar was restored as governor, and the castle was frequently used as a prison, housing several Covenanters. James, Duke of Albany, later King James VII of Scotland and II of England, visited the castle in 1681. During this time, the castle&#x27;s military role became increasingly important, a powder magazine being built in the castle gardens, and a formal garrison installed from 1685. At the accession of King George I in 1714, John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar was deprived of the governorship, as well as the post of Scottish Secretary. In response, he raised the standard of James Stuart, the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, in the Jacobite rising of 1715. Government troops, under the Duke of Argyll, quickly moved to occupy the fortress, then advanced to Sheriffmuir to block Mar&#x27;s way. The Battle of Sheriffmuir was inconclusive, but the rising was effectively over. The Jacobite rising of 1745 saw Charles Edward Stuart lead his army of Highlanders past Stirling on the way to Edinburgh. Following the Jacobites&#x27; retreat from England, they returned to Stirling in January 1746. The town soon surrendered, but the castle governor refused to capitulate. Artillery works were set up on Gowan Hill, but were quickly destroyed by the castle&#x27;s guns. Despite victory at Falkirk, the Jacobites withdrew north on 1 February.

From 1800 the Castle was owned by the War Office and run as a barracks. Many alterations were made to the Great Hall, which became an accommodation block, to the Chapel Royal, which became a lecture theatre and dining hall, to the King&#x27;s Old Building, which became an infirmary and to the Royal Palace, which became the Officer&#x27;s Mess. A number of new buildings were also constructed, including the prison and powder magazine, at the Nether Bailey, in 1810. Queen Victoria visited in 1842, and the Prince of Wales in 1859.

In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 72nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot and the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot amalgamated to form the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders with its depot in the barracks in 1881.

=== Twentieth century ===
The Royal Lodgings have now been returned to something approaching their former glory. A major programme of research and re-presentation, lasting ten years and costing £12 million, was completed in summer 2011. Since January 2002, the Tapestry Studio at West Dean College near Chichester in West Sussex has been working on a recreation of &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; tapestries, four of which are now hanging in the restored Queen&#x27;s Presence Chamber in the Royal Palace. Historians studying the reign of James V believe that a similar series of Unicorn tapestries were part of the royal collection.

The team of weavers visited The Cloisters, part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, to inspect the 15th-century originals, and researched medieval weaving techniques, colour palettes and materials. The weavers worked both at the college in West Sussex, and at a studio at Stirling Castle. The project was completed in 2015.

Stirling Castle remains the headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, although Balaclava Company, the sole surviving unit of the regiment, has been garrisoned at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh since 2014. The regimental museum is also located within the castle.

== Interior ==

=== Outer defences ===

The Outer Defences comprise artillery fortifications, and were built in their present form in the 18th century, although some parts, including the French Spur at the east end, date back to the regency of Mary of Guise in the 1550s. The French Spur was originally an ear-shaped bastion known as an orillon, and contained gun emplacements which protected the main spur. This projecting spur was fronted by an earth ramp called a talus, and was entered via a drawbridge over a ditch. Excavations in the 1970s showed that much of the original stonework remains within the 18th-century defences.

Following the attempted Jacobite invasion of 1708, improvements to the castle&#x27;s defences were ordered as a matter of priority. A scheme of new defences was proposed by Theodore Dury, although this was criticised by one Captain Obryan, who put forward his own, much more expensive, scheme. In the end a compromise was built, and was complete by 1714. The main front wall was extended outwards, to form Guardhouse Square. This had the effect of creating two defensive walls, both of which were fronted by ditches defended by covered firing galleries known as caponiers. One of the caponiers survives and is accessible from Guardhouse Square by a narrow staircase.

To the rear of the walls, chambers called casemates were built to strengthen the wall, and to provide gun emplacements. The French Spur was modified slightly to allow more cannons to be mounted. The buildings within Guardhouse Square date from the 19th century. Outside the castle is the early 19th-century Esplanade, used as a parade ground, and now as a car park and performance space.

=== Forework ===
The gatehouse providing entry from the outer defences to the castle proper was erected by King James IV, and was probably completed around 1506. It originally formed part of a Forework, extending as a curtain wall across the whole width of Castle Hill. At the centre is the gatehouse itself, which now stands to less than half its original height. The round towers at the outer corners rose to conical roofs, with battlements carried around the tops of the towers. These were flanked by more round towers, of which only traces now remain, and mirrored by further rounds at the rear of the gatehouse. The overall design, as drawn by John Slezer in 1693, shows French influence, and has parallels with the forework erected at Linlithgow Palace.

Like the Linlithgow structure, the Forework was probably intended more for show, evoking the &quot;age of chivalry&quot;, than for defence, as it would have offered little protection against contemporary artillery. The entrance was via a central passage, flanked by two separate pedestrian passages. This triple arrangement was unusual in its time, and Classical triumphal arches have been suggested as an influence. The gatehouse was dismantled gradually, and was consolidated in its present form in 1810. At each end of the crenellated curtain wall was a rectangular tower. The west tower, known as the Prince&#x27;s Tower, probably after Henry, Prince of Scotland, survives to its full height, and is now attached to the later palace. At the east end, the Elphinstone Tower contained a kitchen and possibly an officer&#x27;s lodging. It was cut down to form a gun battery, probably in the early 18th century when the Outer Defences were rebuilt.

=== Outer Close ===
Within the Forework is a courtyard known as the Outer Close. To the south-east are Georgian military buildings; the late 18th-century Main Guard House, and the early 19th-century Fort Major&#x27;s House. The early North Gate, giving access to the Nether Bailey, contained the original castle kitchens, which were probably linked to the Great Hall. The Great Kitchen which is now visible was constructed later, against the east wall of the castle. However, in 1689 these rooms were infilled with rubble to reinforce gun emplacements, known as the Grand Battery, which were built on top of the kitchen&#x27;s vaults. Excavations in the 1920s ascertained the extent of the surviving rooms, and the vaults were reconstructed in 1929. The small building above the North Gate is traditionally said to have been a mint, known in Scots as the &quot;Cunzie Hoose&quot; or &quot;coining house&quot;. To the west of the Outer Close, the main parts of the castle are arranged around the quadrangular Inner Close: the Royal Palace to the south, the King&#x27;s Old Building on the west, the Chapel Royal to the north, and the Great Hall to the east.

=== King&#x27;s Old Building ===
The oldest part of the Inner Close is the King&#x27;s Old Building, located on the western side and completed around 1497. It was begun as a new residential range by James IV, and originally comprised an L-shaped building. The principal rooms were on the first floor, over cellars, and included two chambers with wide open views to the west, although the interiors have been much altered. The projecting stair tower has an octagonal upper section, which was copied for a second, later stair tower on the same building.

In 1855, the north end of the building burned down, and was rebuilt in a Baronial style by the architect and historian Robert William Billings. At the southwest end of the range is a linking building, once used as kitchens, which is on a different alignment to both the King&#x27;s Old Building and the adjacent Royal Palace. It has been suggested that this is an earlier 15th-century structure, dating from the reign of James I. Excavations within this building in 1998 revealed burials, suggesting that this may have been the site of a church or chapel.

=== Great Hall ===
On the east side of the Inner Close is the Great Hall, or Parliament Hall. This was built by James IV following on from the completion of the King&#x27;s Old Building in 1497, and was being plastered by 1503. Described as &quot;the grandest secular building erected in Scotland in the late Middle Ages&quot;, it represents the first example of Renaissance-influenced royal architecture in that country.

It was worked on by a number of English craftsmen, and incorporates some English design ideas, being comparable to Edward IV&#x27;s hall at Eltham Palace in Kent, built in the late 1470s. It includes Renaissance details, such as the intersecting tracery on the windows, within a conventional medieval plan. Inside are five fireplaces, and large side windows lighting the dais end, where the king would be seated. It is across.

The original hammerbeam roof was removed in 1800, along with the decorative crenellated parapet, when the hall was subdivided to form barracks. Two floors and five cross-walls were inserted, and the windows were altered accordingly. As early as 1893, calls were being made for the restoration of the Great Hall, but it was not until the army left in 1965 that the opportunity arose. It was agreed that a historically correct restoration could be achieved, and works began which were only completed in 1999. The hammerbeam roof and parapet were replaced, windows reinstated, and the outer walls were limewashed.

=== Royal Palace ===

To the left of the gatehouse, and forming the south side of the Inner Close, is the Royal Palace. The first Renaissance palace in the British Isles, this was the work of King James V. With its combination of Renaissance architecture, and exuberant late-gothic detail, it is one of the most architecturally impressive buildings in Scotland, covered with unique carved stonework. It was begun in the 1530s, and was largely complete by the late 1540s.

The Master of Works, until his execution in 1540, was Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, who also financed part of the work, in return for land and favours from the king. Further work was carried out during the regency of Mary of Guise, and the upper floor was converted to provide an apartment for the castle governor in the 18th century.

The architecture is French-inspired, but the decoration is German in inspiration, and sources for the statues have been found in the work of the German engraver Hans Burgkmair. The statues include a line of soldiers on the south parapet, and a series of full-size figures around the principal floor. These principal figures include a portrait of James V, the Devil, St Michael, and representations of Venus and several planetary deities. Their arrangement on the north, east and south faces of the Palace has been interpreted in relation to the quarters of the heavens.

The 19th-century architectural historian R. W. Billings described the statues as &quot;the fruits of an imagination luxuriant but revolting&quot;. The west façade is undecorated and incomplete, and the Privy Council of Scotland noted in 1625 that the building was &quot;schote over the craig&quot;.

Internally, the Palace comprises two apartments, one each for the king and queen. Each has a hall, presence chamber, and bedchamber, with various small rooms known as closets. The Renaissance decoration continued inside, although little has survived the building&#x27;s military use, excepting the carved stone fireplaces. The ceiling of the King&#x27;s Presence Chamber was originally decorated with a series of carved oak portrait roundels known as the Stirling Heads, described as &quot;among the finest examples of Scottish Renaissance wood-carving now extant&quot;. Some of the heads may have been made by a French-born carver Andrew Mansioun. The carvings were taken down following a ceiling collapse in 1777, and of an estimated 56 original heads, 38 survive. Most were given to the Smith Institute in Stirling but now these are preserved in the castle, and three more are in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. Another two are on display in the Thieves Pot, a preserved 16th-century jail within the Thistles Shopping Centre.

Some of the portraits are believed to be of kings, queens or courtiers, and others are thought to show classical or Biblical figures. As with the exterior carving, similarities to German sources have been noted, and in particular to a ceiling in Wawel, Poland. A £12 million project to recreate the grandeur of the Royal Palace reopened to the public during the weekend of 5 and 6 June 2011. The restoration of the palace and its interiors involved a decade of research and craftsmanship, and restored six royal apartments to how they would have looked in the 1540s, when this was the childhood home of Mary Queen of Scots, The project involved the recreation of seven hand-woven tapestries.

=== Chapel Royal ===
The collegiate chapel established by James IV in 1501 lay between the King&#x27;s Old Building and the Great Hall, but was further south than the present building. This was the chapel in which Queen Mary was crowned in 1543. However, when James VI&#x27;s first son, Prince Henry was born in 1594, it was decided to rebuild the chapel as a suitable venue for the royal baptism.

The new building was erected within a year, north of the old site to improve access to the hall. There was some doubt if the chapel, which John Colville called the &quot;great temple of Solomon&quot;, could be finished in time. The chapel, with its Italianate arched windows, was the work of the Royal Master of Works William Schaw. The interior was decorated by the painter Valentine Jenkin prior to the visit of Charles I in 1633. The chapel too was later modified for military use, housing a dining room. The wall paintings were rediscovered in the 1930s, and restoration began after the Second World War.

=== Nether Bailey ===
Beyond the North Gate, the Nether Bailey occupies the northern end of Castle Hill. Surrounded by defensive walls, the area contains a 19th-century guard house and gunpowder stores, and the modern tapestry studio. There was formerly access to the Nether Bailey from Ballengeich to the west, until the postern was blocked in response to the threat of Jacobite rebellion.

=== Gardens ===
There are two gardens within the castle, the southern one including a bowling green. Below the castle&#x27;s west wall is the King&#x27;s Knot, a 16th-century formal garden, now only visible as earthworks, but once including hedges and knot-patterned parterres. The surviving octagonal earthwork mount was the work of the gardener William Watts and architect James Murray in 1629. The gardens were built on the site of a medieval jousting arena known as the Round Table, in imitation of the legendary court of King Arthur.

== Modern use ==
The castle esplanade, or parade ground, has been used as an open-air concert venue for several noted acts, some of whom have used Stirling Castle and the surrounding scenery to film &quot;in concert&quot; DVDs. These acts include R.E.M., Ocean Colour Scene, Bob Dylan, Wet Wet Wet, Rod Stewart and Runrig. The esplanade also hosts the city&#x27;s Hogmanay celebrations. The Regimental Museum and Home Headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders are located in the King&#x27;s Old Building. The museum closed for refurbishment on 31 August 2018 and reopened in June 2021.
The castle is open to the public year-round. Stirling Castle is a popular place for tourists, and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, 609,698 people visited in 2019.

An illustration of Stirling Castle features on the reverse side of a current series of £20 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank, with Robert the Bruce on horseback in the foreground.

Due to its similar appearance to Colditz Castle in Saxony, Germany, the castle was used to film the exterior shots for the 1970s TV series &quot;Colditz&quot;, a drama about the many attempts of Allied POWs to escape from the castle during its use as a military prison in the Second World War.

== Ghostlore ==
Numerous accounts of ghostlore exist in relation to Stirling Castle, with the Green Lady being perhaps the most renowned. According to various reports, she has been sighted by a multitude of residents and visitors over the years. One widely circulated narrative posits that the Green Lady was a maidservant who rescued Queen Mary from a perilous situation. Many interpret the apparition of the Green Lady as a portent of impending danger, often in the form of a fire.

<text>Mantes-la-Jolie (, often informally called Mantes) is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region of north-central France. It is located to the west of Paris, from the centre of the capital. Mantes-la-Jolie is a subprefecture of Yvelines.

==History==
Mantes was halfway between the centres of power of the dukes of Normandy at Rouen and the Kings of France in Paris. Along with most of northern France, the city changed hands frequently in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Philip Augustus died in Mantes on 14 July 1223.

Louis XIV instituted the manufacture of musical instruments in Mantes, and it was chosen as the centre of brass and woodwind instrument manufacture. In the 19th century, painters were attracted to the town, particularly Corot, whose paintings of the bridge and the cathedral are celebrated. Prokofiev spent the summer of 1920 there orchestrating the ballet &quot;Chout&quot;.

Originally officially called Mantes-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Mantes on the Seine&quot;), Mantes merged with the commune of Gassicourt in 1930 and the commune born of the merger was called Mantes-Gassicourt.

Mantes was the location of the first allied bridgehead across the Seine on 19 August 1944, by General Patton&#x27;s 3rd Army. Major rebuilding was needed after the war.

On 7 May 1953, the commune of Mantes-Gassicourt was officially renamed Mantes-la-Jolie (meaning &quot;Mantes the pretty&quot;), allegedly in reference to a letter of King Henry IV addressed to his mistress Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées who resided in Mantes: &quot;I am on my way to Mantes, my pretty&quot; ().

==Art==
At the end of the 19th century, Impressionist painters like Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Édouard Manet and Claude Monet came to paint the Seine River which crosses the town.
Jean Batiste Corot painting of the Old Mantes bridge is shown at the Louvres.

==Population==
Inhabitants are called &quot;Mantais&quot; in French. The city had a total of 44,299 inhabitants in 2017. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Mantes-la-Jolie proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Mantes-la-Jolie absorbed the former communes of Gassicourt in 1930.

Mantes-la-Jolie has a significant Muslim population, consisting mainly of North Africans, Arabs, Turks, and Sub-Saharan Africans. Many Muslims in Mantes-la-Jolie experience disillusionment, high levels of poverty and unemployment. Val Fourré is a low-income housing estate occupied almost entirely by Arabs and African migrants. Over one-in-three residents in the town is an immigrant, and 27% of the town does not have French citizenship as of 2019.

The city is divided into four districts each with a characteristic urban form:
* Centre-ville: city center, a dense and commercial area
* Gassicourt: residential area
* Val Fourré: large housing district
* Hautes Garennes: a non-urbanized area

==Sights==

The main monument in Mantes is the church of Notre-Dame dating back to 12th century. A previous church was burnt down by William the Conqueror together with the rest of the town, at the capture of which he lost his life in 1087. Modern bridges link Mantes with the town of Limay on the other side of the river.

==Economy==
Mantes is home to small businesses working on concrete and chemical processing, but is inevitably drawn into the economic area of nearby Paris.

It is historically and at present a center of musical instrument manufacturing. The well known Buffet Crampon woodwind factory is located in the neighbourhood city of Mantes-la-Ville.

==Transportation==
Mantes-la-Jolie is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare and Transilien Paris-Montparnasse suburban rail lines: and . The Mantes-la-Jolie station is also served by TGV trains towards Le Havre, and Cherbourg.

<text>Neal Joseph Schon (born February 27, 1954) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as the co-founder and lead guitarist for the rock band Journey. He is the last original member to remain throughout the group&#x27;s history. He was a member of the rock band Santana before forming Journey. He was also a member of the group Bad English during Journey&#x27;s hiatus from 1987 to 1995, as well as an original member of Hardline.

Schon was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2013, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Journey in 2017.

==Early life and career==
Neal Joseph Schon was born at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, the son of Matthew and Barbara Schon. He is of German and Italian ancestry. His father was a big band musician, arranger, and composer, and played and taught all reed instruments with emphasis on jazz tenor saxophone; his mother was a big band singer. Schon started playing guitar at age 10. He attended Aragon High School in San Mateo, California, later dropping out to pursue his music career.

A quick learner, he joined Santana at age 17, in 1971. Schon has said he was asked by Eric Clapton to join Derek and the Dominos, but that he joined Santana instead, performing on the albums &quot;Santana III&quot; and &quot;Caravanserai&quot;. Schon also played in the band Azteca. 

In 1973, he, Gregg Rolie and manager Herbie Herbert co-founded the Golden Gate Rhythm Section, which had later been re-named to Journey after a suggestion by roadie John Villaneuva.

Schon&#x27;s guitar style is influenced by guitarists such as B.B. King, Albert King, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Jimmy Page and Jimmy Green.

In addition to several solo albums and his work with Journey, Schon&#x27;s work also includes: a pair of albums with keyboardist Jan Hammer, short-term collaborations with Sammy Hagar (HSAS and Planet Us) and Paul Rodgers, stints with Bad English (a supergroup that featured Journey&#x27;s Jonathan Cain and Deen Castronovo and Cain&#x27;s former Babys bandmates John Waite and Ricky Phillips) and Hardline (which also featured Castronovo). Even as Journey&#x27;s latest lineup plays to a still-faithful body of fans, Schon has immersed himself in side projects such as &quot;Piranha Blues&quot; (1999); &quot;Black Soup Cracker&quot;, a funk outfit that features former Prince associates Rosie Gaines and Michael Bland; and Soul SirkUS with Jeff Scott Soto.

Schon can be heard on other albums including three tracks on Michael Bolton&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger&quot;, with the Schon sound most recognizable on &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot;. He also joined Larry Graham to play in an all-star band for cult funk artist and ex-wife of Miles Davis, Betty Davis. In addition, Schon (along with then Journey manager Herbie Herbert) also contributed to Lenny White&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Big City&quot;, specifically the instrumental jam &quot;And We Meet Again&quot;.

On February 9, 2018, Schon played a charity show at San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot;, benefiting North Bay Fire Relief. The group recruited featured former Journey drummer Deen Castronovo (who also sang some of the vocals), former Journey keyboardist Gregg Rolie, and bassist Marco Mendoza of The Dead Daisies. The concert was released as a live album and DVD on May 19, 2023.

In 2019, Schon announced a tour to be called Neal Schon&#x27;s Journey Through Time. The tour was stated to feature Castronovo, Rolie and Mendoza.

Schon played &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on electric guitar for the opening game of the 2022 NBA Finals.

==Guitars==
Schon&#x27;s first guitar was an acoustic Stella, followed two years later by a Gibson ES-335. When the 335 was stolen, he replaced it with a &#x27;56 Les Paul Goldtop reissue that he used for many years. Schon has used Gibson guitars over the years, having also used Fender and Ovation guitars during Journey&#x27;s Departure tour. He had a limited edition signature Les Paul model called the &quot;Neal Schon Signature Model Custom Les Paul&quot;, of which Gibson made only 35, according to the Gibson Custom website (80 according to Neal Schon&#x27;s website). He has previously employed Godin guitars on his 1995 solo album &quot;Beyond the Thunder&quot;, and more recently uses Paul Reed Smith guitars. In the late 1980s, Schon manufactured (through Jackson Guitars and later Larrivee) and played his own line of guitars. Simply named Schon, about 200 of the Jackson-produced models were made.

As of 2008, Schon currently prefers guitar pedals from Xotic, a Vox Satriani model and occasionally uses a Buddy Guy wah pedal.

==Personal life==

Schon&#x27;s first marriage was to Tena Austin in 1976. After divorcing Austin in 1986, Schon married Beth Buckley a year later. They were together for approximately five years and had two children together. In 1993 he married Dina Gioeli, divorcing in 1999. In 2001, he married Amber Kozan, with whom he had two more children. They divorced in 2008. In September 2011, Schon publicly confirmed he was in a relationship with Michaele Salahi. The two said they had dated years previously in the 1990s. On October 14, 2012, Schon proposed to Salahi onstage during a charity concert at the Lyric Opera House in Baltimore, Maryland, offering her an oval 11.42 carat diamond engagement ring. The couple married on December 15, 2013, in a live broadcast wedding that was held in the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, California.

Schon has confirmed that he has tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears, common in musicians who have toured extensively.

<doc id="208403" wikidata="Q433161" url="?curid=208403" title="Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox">
<text>Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox (8 October 1515 – 7 March 1578), born Lady Margaret Douglas, was the daughter of the Scottish queen dowager Margaret Tudor and her second husband Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and thus the granddaughter of King Henry VII of England and the half-sister of King James V. She was the grandmother of King James VI and I.

In her youth she was high in the favour of her uncle, Henry VIII, but later incurred his anger for her unauthorised engagement to Lord Thomas Howard, who died imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1537. In 1544, she married Scottish nobleman Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. Her son Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, married her niece Mary, Queen of Scots, and was the father of James VI and I.

==Early life==

Margaret was born at Harbottle Castle in Northumberland on 8 October 1515. Her mother had crossed the border from Scotland when her father was facing difficulties in Scotland. In October 1528, Angus was threatened by James V of Scotland and sent Margaret back over the River Tweed into England at Norham Castle. After a brief stay at Berwick Castle accompanied by her nurse or &#x27;gentlewoman&#x27; Isobel Hoppar, Margaret joined the household of her godfather, Cardinal Wolsey. When Wolsey died in 1530, Lady Margaret was invited to the royal Palace of Beaulieu, where she resided in the household of Princess Mary. Because of her nearness to the English crown, Lady Margaret Douglas was brought up chiefly at the English court in close association with Mary, her first cousin, the future Queen Mary I, who remained her lifelong friend; even when her father fled to England in May 1529 and remained there until 1542, Margaret never entered her father&#x27;s custody, remaining in royal custody instead. Margaret gave Princess Mary gifts on New Year&#x27;s Day, in 1543 her gift was a satin gown of carnation silk in Venice fashion. At Christmastime at Greenwich Palace in 1530, 1531, and 1532, Henry VIII gave Margaret the generous sum of 10 marks (£6-13s–4d).

When Anne Boleyn&#x27;s court was established in October 1533, Margaret was brought to court from the Palace of Beaulieu and appointed as a lady-in-waiting. There she met Anne Boleyn&#x27;s uncle, Lord Thomas Howard (not to be confused with his brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk), and they began their courtship. Thomas was a younger son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, by his second marriage to Agnes Tilney. By the end of 1535 Thomas and Margaret had fallen in love and become secretly engaged.

King Henry turned against Anne Boleyn in May 1536. When in early July 1536 he learned of Margaret&#x27;s engagement to Thomas Howard (Anne&#x27;s uncle), he was furious. Henry had declared his daughters Mary and Elizabeth bastards, leaving Margaret very high in the line of succession; for her to contract an unauthorised marriage was politically outrageous, especially with the son of a powerful nobleman and near kin of the disgraced queen. Both Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret were committed to the Tower of London. On 18 July 1536, Parliament, by an Act of Attainder, condemned Thomas to death for attempting to &#x27;interrupt ympedyte and lett the seid Succession of the Crowne&#x27;. The Act also forbade the marriage of any member of the king&#x27;s family without his permission. The death sentence was not carried out, and Lord Thomas languished in the Tower even though Lady Margaret was required to renounce their relationship by King Henry&#x27;s Premier Thomas Cromwell. Howard remained in the Tower, where he caught an illness and died on 31 October 1537.

Margaret, as a member of the Royal Family, was safe from execution. While in the Tower, Lady Margaret fell ill, and the King allowed her to be moved to Syon Abbey under the supervision of the abbess. There are many reports that her illness was because she was pregnant, and upon learning of it, the King ordered his niece to be confined in the Abbey. She was released from the Abbey on 29 October 1537. According to G. J. Meyer in his work &quot;The Tudors&quot;, King Henry VIII had interpreted the marriage between Lord Thomas Howard and Margaret Douglas to be an attempt by Lord Howard to &quot;make himself the king of England.&quot; However, the many love letters between Margaret Douglas and Lord Thomas reveal a true love affair wrongfully ended by the paranoia of King Henry VIII.

Margaret was restored to favour and given a gilt cup made by the goldsmith Morgan Wolf as a New Year&#x27;s Day gift for 1539. Margaret and the Duchess of Richmond were appointed to greet Henry VIII&#x27;s bride, Anne of Cleves, at Greenwich Palace, join her household, and convey her to the king. This would have been a great honour, but instead Henry chose to meet Anne at Rochester.

In 1540, Margaret was again in disgrace with the king when she had an affair with Lord Thomas Howard&#x27;s half-nephew Sir Charles Howard. He was the son of Thomas&#x27; elder half-brother Lord Edmund Howard, and a brother of Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth wife, Katherine Howard. Katherine Howard gave Margaret a gold &quot;pair of beads&quot;, a rosary, as a New Year&#x27;s Day gift.
In 1543, Margaret was one of the few witnesses of King Henry&#x27;s final marriage to Katherine Parr, Dowager Lady Latimer, at Hampton Court. Margaret became one of Queen Katherine&#x27;s chief ladies. Katherine Parr and Margaret had known each other since they both had come to court in the 1520s.

==Marriage and diplomacy==

In 1544, Lady Margaret married a Scottish exile, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox (1516–1571), who later became regent of Scotland in 1570–1571. In total the couple had eight or nine children, four boys: Henry, Henry, Philip and Charles, and four unnamed daughters, though only two sons—Henry Stuart (1546–1567), born in 1546 at Temple Newsam; and Charles Stuart (1555–1576), who later married Elizabeth Cavendish in 1574—survived to manhood; one of their other siblings was called Philip, presumably after the Spanish king and husband of Margaret&#x27;s cousin, Mary I. Elizabeth Cavendish, wife of Charles, Earl of Lennox, was the daughter of Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick.

In June 1548, during the war of the Rough Wooing, Margaret&#x27;s father, the Earl of Angus, wrote to her with the news that her uncle, George Douglas, and others of the family had been captured at Dalkeith Palace. Her father hoped that she and her husband could arrange that they were well treated as prisoners. The Earl of Lennox forwarded the letter to the Duke of Somerset, writing that his father-in-law would have done better to ask others for help. Margaret wrote to her father from Wressle Castle in March 1549, complaining that he had avoided meeting her husband. She asked him to seek an honourable peace through the acknowledgement of her marriage, &quot;what a memorial it should be to you!&quot; In 1551, Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, visited London, and Margaret came south from Temple Newsam to visit her at Edward VI&#x27;s court.

During the reign of Queen Mary I of England, Lady Margaret had rooms in Westminster Palace. In November 1553, the queen told the ambassador, Simon Renard, that Margaret was best suited to succeed her to the throne. Margaret was the chief mourner at Queen Mary&#x27;s funeral in December 1558. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth I of England, Margaret moved to Yorkshire, where her home at Temple Newsam became a centre for Roman Catholic intrigue.

Margaret succeeded in marrying her elder son, Lord Darnley, to his first cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, thus uniting their claims to the English throne. Queen Elizabeth I disapproved of this marriage and had Lady Margaret sent to the Tower of London in 1566. After Darnley&#x27;s murder in 1567, she was released. Margaret wrote to Mary demanding justice and revenge for her son&#x27;s death. She denounced her daughter-in-law, but was eventually later reconciled with Mary. Her husband assumed the government of Scotland as regent, but was assassinated in 1571.

On 3 August, the governor of Scotland, Regent Morton wrote to her about the capture of Edinburgh Castle from the supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots. An English commander at the siege, William Drury, had obtained some of the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots. Morton thought that Margaret was best placed to ask and influence Drury to send the jewels back to him in Scotland.

In 1574, she again aroused Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s anger by marrying her younger son Charles to Elizabeth Cavendish, the stepdaughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury. She was again sent to the Tower, unlike the Countess of Shrewsbury, but was pardoned after her son Charles&#x27; death in 1576.

Lady Margaret&#x27;s diplomacy largely contributed to the future succession of her grandson, James VI of Scotland, to the English throne.

==Death and legacy==

After the death of her younger son, she helped care for his daughter, Lady Arbella. However, she did not outlive him by very long, and died at Hackney in March 1578. A few days before her death, she dined with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and this led to rumours that she had been poisoned, which were included in the book &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;. There is no historical evidence to substantiate this.

Although she died in debt, she was given a grand funeral in Westminster Abbey, at the expense of Queen Elizabeth I, with a hundred poor women in attendance. She was buried in the same grave as her son Charles in the south aisle of Henry VII&#x27;s chapel in the Abbey. It has been said that her grandson erected the fine monument, but it was commissioned in October 1578 by her executor and former servant Thomas Fowler. Her recumbent effigy, made of alabaster, wears a French cap and ruff with a red fur-lined cloak, over a dress of blue and gold. On either side of the tomb chest are weepers of her four sons and four daughters.

Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester had eight tapestries at Kenilworth Castle in 1588 which had been bought from &quot;Lady Lennox&quot;. The subjects included &quot;Josias&quot;, &quot;Demophon and Achilles&quot;, and the &quot;History of Noah&quot;. At his death in 1624, Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox had a bed in his lodgings at the gatehouse of Whitehall Palace that had belonged to Margaret Douglas, and she had &quot;worked&quot; or embroidered the curtains.

The Lennox Jewel was most likely made for Lady Lennox in the 1570s although the date and occasion of its commission is the subject of some controversy. In 1842, the jewel was bought by her descendant, Queen Victoria. The locket, considered &quot;one of the most important early jewels in the Royal Collection&quot;, is on display in the Holyrood Palace.

== Poetry ==

Margaret Douglas is known for her poetry. Many of her works are written to her lover, Lord Thomas Howard, and are preserved in the Devonshire MS. Her close friends, Mary Shelton and the Duchess of Richmond, were the main contributors, as well as Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Thomas Wyatt.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The story begins in 1878, the 11th year of the Meiji era in Japan, and follows a former assassin of the Bakumatsu, known as Hitokiri Battosai. After his work against the , he becomes Himura Kenshin, a wandering swordsman who protects the people of Japan with a vow never to take another life. Watsuki wrote the series based on his desire to make a manga series different from others published at the time, with Kenshin being a former assassin and the story taking a more serious tone as it progressed.

&quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from April 1994 to September 1999. Its chapters were collected in 28 volumes; it was later republished in a 22-volume edition and a 14-volume edition. The manga was adapted into an anime television series, produced by SPE Visual Works and animated by Studio Gallop and later by Studio Deen, aired from January 1996 to September 1998. In addition to an animated feature film, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Motion Picture&quot;, two series of original video animations (OVAs) were also produced; &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal,&quot; which adapted stories from the manga that were not featured in the anime, and &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection,&quot; a sequel to the manga. In 2017, Watsuki began publishing a direct sequel, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc,&quot; in &quot;Jump Square&quot;. A second anime television series adaptation by Liden Films premiered in July 2023. In addition, other media based on the franchise has been produced, including a series of five live-action theatrical film adaptations, beginning with &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; in 2012 and ending with &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning&quot; in 2021, and video games for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable. Several art and guidebooks have been published, and writer Kaoru Shizuka has written three official light novels, which were published by Shueisha.

The manga, as well as the first light novel and guidebook, have been published in North America by Viz Media. The &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga had over 72 million copies in circulation by 2019, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The series has received praise from various publications for manga, anime, and other media, particularly for the characters&#x27; designs and historical setting.

==Plot ==

The series takes place in 1878, eleven years after the beginning of the Meiji era. After participating in the Boshin War as the assassin , Himura Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan, offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders he once committed. Having vowed to never kill again, he now wields a reverse-bladed katana. Upon arriving in Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who is fighting a murderer who claims to be the and is tarnishing the name of the swordsmanship school that she teaches. Kenshin decides to help her and defeats the fake &quot;Battōsai&quot;. After discovering that Kenshin is the true , Kaoru offers him a place to stay at her dojo, noting that he is peace-loving and not cold-hearted, as his reputation had implied. Kenshin accepts and begins to form lifelong relationships with others, including Sagara Sanosuke, a former member of the Sekihō Army; Myōjin Yahiko, an orphan from a samurai family who also lives with Kaoru as her student; and doctor Takani Megumi, who has become involved in the opium trade. However, he also deals with old and new enemies, including the former leader of the Oniwabanshū, Shinomori Aoshi.

After several months living in the dojo, Kenshin faces Saitō Hajime, a rival from Bakumatsu who is now a police officer. This challenge turns out to be a test to face his successor, Shishio Makoto, who plans to conquer Japan by destroying the Meiji Government, starting with Kyoto. Feeling that Shishio&#x27;s faction may attack his friends, Kenshin meets Shishio alone to defeat him. However, many of his friends, including a young Oniwabanshū named Makimachi Misao, whom he meets during his travels, decide to help him in his fight. After his first meeting with him, Kenshin realizes that he must become stronger to defeat Shishio without becoming the cold assassin he was in the past and returns to the man who taught him kenjutsu, Hiko Seijūrō, to learn the school&#x27;s final technique. Finally accepting the help of his friends, he defeats Shishio, who dies after exceeding the limits of his abnormal body condition, after which a reformed Shinomori stays in Kyoto with the surviving Oniwabanshū.

When Kenshin and his friends return to Tokyo, he finds Yukishiro Enishi, who plans to take revenge. At this point, it is revealed that, during the Bakumatsu, Kenshin was to be married to Yukishiro Tomoe, who sought to avenge the death of her first fiancé, whom he had assassinated, but instead they fell in love and he proposed to her. Because she was related to the Edo guards who sought to kill Kenshin, they realized her deception and captured her to use as bait. In the final fight against the group&#x27;s leader, Kenshin accidentally killed Tomoe after she took a blow meant for him. Seeking revenge for the death of his sister, Enishi kidnaps Kaoru and Kenshin and his friends set out to rescue her. A final battle between Kenshin and Enishi ensues, with Kenshin emerging victorious. Misao brings Tomoe&#x27;s diary to Enishi, who keeps it in a village to hide along with his missing father.

Four years later, Kenshin has married Kaoru and has a son named Himura Kenji. Now at peace with himself, Kenshin gives his reverse-blade sword to Yahiko as a ceremonial gift.

== Production ==
=== One-shots ===
A prototype series titled &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; appeared as a pair of separate short stories published in 1992 and 1993. The first story, published in December 1992 in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump Winter Special&quot; issue of 1993, featured an earlier version of Kenshin stopping a crime lord from taking over the Kamiya family dojo. Watsuki described the first &quot;Rurouni&quot; story, echoing the &quot;Megumi Arc,&quot; as a &quot;pilot&quot; for &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. According to Watsuki, the final &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; series was not composed entirely of his free will. Describing the creation of historical stories as &quot;hard,&quot; Watsuki initially wanted to make his next series in a contemporary setting. An editor approached Watsuki and asked him to make a new historical story. With the historical concept, Watsuki intended to use the Bakumatsu period from &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; (&quot;Burn, O Sword&quot;) with a story akin to &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;. Watsuki experimented with various titles, including &quot;Nishin&quot; (&quot;Two-Hearts&quot;) &quot;Kenshin&quot;, &quot;Yorozuya&quot; (&quot;Jack-of-All-Trades&quot;) &quot;Kenshin&quot;, and variations of &quot;Rurouni&quot; and &quot;Kenshin&quot; with different kanji in that order.

The second &quot;Rurouni&quot; story, published in April 1993 in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; 21–22 double issue of that year, featured Kenshin helping a wealthy girl named Raikōji Chizuru. Watsuki recalled experiencing difficulty when condensing &quot;everything&quot; into 31 pages for that story. He said that he &quot;put all [his] soul into it,&quot; but sighs when looking at it from his perspective after the publication of the first &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume. Watsuki said that the second &quot;Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot; received mediocre reviews and about 200 letters. He referred to it as a &quot;side story.&quot;

The design model for Hiko Seijuro, Kenshin&#x27;s master, in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is the character of the same name from his one-shot manga &quot;Crescent Moon of the Warring States,&quot; but Watsuki also added some influences from Hiken Majin Hajerun in Takeshi Obata&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Lamp-Lamp&quot;. At the time, Watsuki said that he was fascinated by images of &quot;manliness&quot; and that Hiko was one of the first characters to reflect this fascination. Since Watsuki&#x27;s debut work contained a tall, black-haired man in &quot;showy&quot; armor, he wanted to make a character &quot;completely opposite&quot; to the debut character; the new character ended up &quot;coming out like a girl&quot;. According to Watsuki, he used &quot;no real motif&quot; when creating Kenshin and placed a cross-shaped scar on his face &quot;not knowing what else to do&quot;. Like several characters, Kenshin was influenced by the Shinsengumi, with Kenshin being affected by Okita Sōji and Saitō Hajime in order to give him an air of mystery.

=== Publication and influences ===

Ever since writing his first storyboards for the manga, Watsuki did sketches of Kenshin&#x27;s appearance and noticed that he looked like Kurama from Yoshihiro Togashi&#x27;s manga &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. Watsuki considered himself younger back and that he preferred always drawing goodlooking men in contrast to Hiko Seijuro from a previous one-shot. When competing with these series, Watsuki felt &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; competed more with &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; that focused more on drama rather than action like &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. In contrast to the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; young lead Yusuke Urameshi, Kenshin was written as an adult with a dark past based on the Edo period in order to make the series stand out. Nevertheless, the manga managed to compete well against other &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga from the 1990s including &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. Kenshin&#x27;s age was also a departure from common archetypes in manga as the themes and lore in the story made him an adult in contrast to other young protagonist besides &quot;City Hunter&quot;. Nevertheless, he was careful with how writing these characters as they get old. During his childhood, Watsuki used to practice kendo, which influenced the making of the series. Although Watsuki developed various one-shots before the official serialization of the series, while naming the characters, he based some of their names on places he used to live, such as Makimachi Misaos&#x27;s &quot;Makimachi&quot; and Sanjō Tsubame, who are named after places in Niigata.

Since the manga started, an editor from Shueisha suggested Watsuki to check the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; fighting games which helped as a form influence for his characters. However, he tried writing a realistic series and avoid supernatural powers regardless of the young demography with few exceptions being Yukishiro Enishi&#x27;s ability to perform double jumps to counterattack Kenshin&#x27;s aerial style. When thinking about the ending, Watsuki always thought that a mass murderer should die even if he is on a self antonment journey, seeing &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot; as a famous example of a hero&#x27;s death. When the manga series started to be published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, Watsuki had little hope in the development of the series. He planned to finish the story in approximately 30 chapters, ending with Kenshin&#x27;s departure from Tokyo similarly to the one from volume 7. Kenshin&#x27;s enemies would have been people from Kyoto who would send an assassin to kill Kenshin. When the Oniwabanshū were introduced during the serialization, Watsuki noted that the series could be longer as he had created various main characters. At that time, there was a survey, and the series had become very popular.

For its seventh volume, Watsuki&#x27;s boss suggested to him that it was time to make a longer story arc, which resulted in the creation of the fights between Kenshin and Shishio Makoto. The arc was only meant to be serialized for one year, but it ended up being one year and a half long. This arc was also done to develop Kenshin&#x27;s character, as he considered him not to have a weak point. Watsuki commented that his artistic skills were honed with this arc, as he could draw everything he wanted to. The last arc from the manga was meant to be much shorter, but it turned out to be a fairly long one as he could not present it simplistically. Watsuki originally made this arc prior to the series&#x27; start, having already thought about how Kenshin&#x27;s scar would have been made. Because of the dark style of the Kyoto arc, Watsuki created the comical Mikimachi Misao in order to contrast Kenshin&#x27;s serious side.

Being fascinated by the Shinsengumi, Watsuki designed the characters by basing their characteristics on those of the real Shinsengumi members and also using fictional representations of them and other historical characters from the Bakumatsu period of Japan. The historical characters were considered a hard task by Watsuki. Due to problems with the characterization of Sagara Sōzō, Watsuki decided to illustrate Saitō Hajime in his own style, avoiding the historical figure. He felt very good about Saitō&#x27;s character, having noted that he fit very well in the manga. However, Watsuki mentioned that many Japanese fans of the Shinsengumi complained about the personality of Saitō, as he was made sadistic. Additionally, the final shot of Kenshin returning to Kaoru&#x27;s dojo was inspired by the final shot of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime&#x27;s first opening theme, &quot;Sobakasu&quot;, by Judy and Mary.

In the final arc of the manga, Watsuki wanted to make the five comrades in this storyline as &quot;scum-like&quot; as possible. But because he created villains with no ideals or beliefs, it was difficult to portray them as an enjoyable read. The story took on a darker tone as most of the characters believed Kaoru was killed by Yukishiro Enishi, which made Kenshin question his own way of living and escape to a village of wanderers. Watsuki did not enjoy the angst in Kenshin, so his friend Myōjin Yahiko took over as the series&#x27; protagonist until Kenshin recovered. Even though the plot for the &quot;remembrance episodes&quot; of Kenshin&#x27;s past was already set before serialization started, which was three and a half years before her debut, Watsuki was filled with regrets about how he portrayed Yukishiro Tomoe for unspecified reasons. The final villains, the Sū-shin, had no personality models and were created simply to &quot;fill out the numbers&quot;. As the story advanced towards Kenshin&#x27;s final battle, Watsuki realized that the other characters would have no &quot;glamour&quot; and created the Sū-shin on the spot.

=== Ending ===
Watsuki also had ideas to create a &quot;Hokkaido episode, a sequel,&quot; but wanted to start a new manga, so he ended &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; with the last arc he made. Due to the dark nature of Kenshin&#x27;s life, Watsuki ended the manga in the Jinchu arc, afraid that if he continued writing, the series would not fit the manga demography. In 2012, Watsuki revealed that when he clashed with the editorial staff at the end of the series, his editor, Hisashi Sasaki, understood his intentions, saw that he was at his physical limit, and backed him up. He said it was out of respect and appreciation for the readers that he ended the popular series while it was still popular. Nevertheless, Watsuki was happy with how he ended &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. He felt it was a good place to end the narrative. In contrast, most series keep being pushed and pushed until they lose popularity and are cancelled. Watsuki was glad &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; did not end like this.

For the series&#x27; ending, Watsuki conceived new designs with the potential for a sequel in the future. Initially, Watsuki had planned to make Kenshin&#x27;s hair shorter before the end; however, he found this to be similar to the character Multi in &quot;To Heart&quot;. Additionally, Himura Kenji was introduced in the finale as the son of Kenshin and Kaoru; even though the character was &quot;cliché&quot;, Watsuki felt that Kenji had to appear. An elder Sanosuke was drafted by Watsuki to appear in the manga&#x27;s finale, but this idea was scrapped. In the manga&#x27;s final story arc, the design was used for Sanosuke&#x27;s father, Higashidani Kamishimoemon. The author added that he felt attachment towards Enishi and that he would someday like to use Enishi in a future work.

Another idea explored for a sequel was the handling of Yahiko as a teenager. Watsuki had redesigned his appearance. He wanted Yahiko to impress manga readers so that he could be the protagonist of a possible series sequel. He said this goal influenced his design of Yahiko with Kenshin&#x27;s physical appearance as well as Sanosuke&#x27;s personality. He added Sanosuke&#x27;s kanji for to the back of his clothes and was pleased that various readers recognized it. Although he suggested he was not going to make a sequel, he said the main characters would be Yahiko, Sanjō Tsubame, and Tsukayama Yutarō. Watsuki thought about writing a story in which Yahiko and Tsubame would have a son, Myōjin Shin&#x27;ya, who would become a skilled swordsman.

== Themes ==
The series&#x27; main theme is responsibility, as seen through Kenshin&#x27;s actions, as he wants to atone for all the people he killed during the Bakumatsu by aiding innocent people by wielding a non-lethal sword. Marco Olivier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolizes Kenshin&#x27;s oath not to kill again, which has been found challenging by other warriors appearing in the series. This theme also encourages former drug dealer Takani Megumi to become a doctor upon learning of Kenshin&#x27;s past and actions. Another theme is power, which is mostly seen by Sagara Sanosuke and Myojin Yahiko. However, like Megumi, these two characters are also influenced by the main character, as they wish to become stronger to assist Kenshin across the plot. Additionally, the series discourages revenge, as seen in the final arc when Yukishiro Enishi believes he succeeded in getting his revenge on Kenshin but starts having hallucinations of his late sister with a sad expression on her face. As an &quot;outlet&quot; for Watsuki&#x27;s kendo emotions, Yahiko &quot;knows a pain that hero-types like Himura Kenshin and Sagara Sanosuke can never know&quot;. As a result, Yahiko was made a stronger character little by little to relate to the demography. eventually giving him a stronger characterization during the Kyoto arc, which surprised his readers.

When questioned about the series&#x27; theme being Kenshin&#x27;s self-redemption, Watsuki mentioned that when he was young, he used to read manga and that it influenced his writing of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. He added that he wanted to make the story different from other comics as he considers the main character, Kenshin, neither a good nor evil character. Since volume 7, Watsuki mentioned the series took on a more adult tone due to the various conflicts in the story, but commented it was influenced by the manga he read. Through the series&#x27; development, Watsuki was deciding if Kamiya Kaoru&#x27;s character was going to die before the end. However, he later decided to keep Kaoru alive as he came to the conclusion that he wanted a happy ending and that the manga was aimed at young readers. In &quot;The Oxford Handbook of American Folklore and Folklife Studies&quot;, Kenshin is regarded as a &quot;far cry&quot; from American superheroes due to his androgynous look and self-deprecating personality. However, the character is said to be relatable to the Eastern audience through Kenshin&#x27;s quest for redemption, which is called the main theme of the manga. The manga is further noted to have a balance between individualism and community.

Watsuki said he was an &quot;infatuated&quot; type of person rather than a &quot;passionate&quot; kind of person; therefore, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is a &quot;Meiji Swordsman Story&quot; as opposed to a &quot;Meiji Love Story&quot;. According to the book &quot;Bringing Forth a World: Engaged Pedagogy in the Japanese University&quot;, the manga reflects the confusion of Japanese society after the big economy disenchantment in the early 1990s. It confronts visualizations of Japanese education in a manner that contrasts school books, especially because of the series&#x27; young demography. Since the manga focuses on realism but is aimed at young readers, the series is notable for changing the portrayals of samurais in order to create a more optimistic take in comparison to real-life events. The unique take on Kenshin&#x27;s handling gave the manga the concept of &quot;neo shonen&quot; due to how different it was from previous &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; series.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===

Written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from April 12, 1994, to September 21, 1999.

A single-chapter follow-up to the series that follows the character of Yahiko Myōjin, , was originally published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 2000 after the conclusion of the series. Left out of the original volumes, it was added as an extra to the final release.

In December 2011, Shueisha announced Watsuki would be putting his series, &quot;Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-&quot;, on hold to begin a &quot;reboot&quot; of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, called &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, as a tie-in to the live-action film. The series began in the June 2012 issue of &quot;Jump Square&quot;, which was released on May 2, 2012, and ended in the July 2013 issue on June 4, 2013. The reboot depicts the battles that were featured in the first live-action film. Another special, &quot;Act Zero&quot;, was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in August 2012 as a prologue to &quot;Restoration&quot; and included in its first volume. In 2014, Watsuki wrote a two-chapter spin-off titled &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Master of Flame&quot; for &quot;Jump SQ.&quot;, which tells how Shishio met Yumi and formed the Juppongatana.

Watsuki and his wife, Kaworu Kurosaki, collaborated on a two-chapter spin-off titled &quot;Rurouni Kenshin Side Story: The Ex-Con Ashitaro&quot; for the ninth anniversary of &quot;Jump SQ.&quot; in 2016. It acts as a prologue to &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc&quot;, which began in September 2017 as a sequel to the original manga series. In 2021, Watsuki created the manga that was exclusively shown at an exhibition celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. It serves as an epilogue to chapter 81 of the original manga and shows the first time Kenshin used his sakabatō. The chapter was later adapted into the episode 34 of the 2023 &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime series, &quot;Sakabato First Attack&quot;.

&quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Viz Media. The first volume of the series was released on October 7, 2003. Although the first volumes were published on an irregular basis, since volume 7, Viz has established a monthly basis due to good sales and consumer demands. Therefore, the following volumes were published until July 5, 2006, when the final volume was released. &quot;Yahiko no Sakabatō&quot; was also published in English in &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; on August 1, 2006. Between January 29, 2008, and March 16, 2010, Viz re-released the manga in a nine-volume omnibus format called &quot;Viz Big Edition&quot;, which collects three volumes in one.

They released a similar &quot;3-in-1 Edition&quot; across nine volumes between January 3, 2017, and January 1, 2019. Viz uses the actual ordering of Japanese names, with the family name or surname before the given name, within the series to reduce confusion and because &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is a historical series.

=== Audio dramas ===
Several drama CDs that adapt stories from the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga were released. They feature different voice actors than those that later worked on the anime adaptation. In Volume 5 of the manga, Watsuki stated that he was anticipating the third installment, which would adapt the Udō Jin-e arc. He expected it to be &quot;pretty close&quot; to his original, but with additional lines for Sanosuke and Yahiko.

=== Merchandise ===
Watsuki commented that there had been a lot of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; merchandise released for the Japanese market.

== Reception ==
=== Sales and popularity ===
&quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; has been highly popular, having sold over 55 million copies in Japan alone up until February 2012, making it one of Shueisha&#x27;s top ten best-selling manga series. In 2014, it was reported that the series had 70 million copies in circulation. By December 2019, the manga had over 72 million copies in circulation, including digital releases. Volume 27 of the manga ranked second in the &quot;Viz Bookscan Top Ten&quot; during June 2006, while volumes 21 and 20 ranked second and tenth, respectively, in the &quot;Top 10 Graphic Novels of Viz&quot; of 2005. &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; volume 24 ranked 116th on &quot;USA Today&quot;″s best-selling book list for the week ending February 26, 2006. During the third quarter of 2003, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; ranked at the top of ICv2&#x27;s Top 50 Manga Properties. In the same poll from 2005, it was featured at the top once again based on sales from English volumes during 2004. In the Top Ten Manga Properties from 2006 from the same site, it ranked ninth. In November 2014, readers of &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine voted &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; as the thirteenth &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s greatest manga series of all time. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; ranked 31st.

=== Critical response ===
The manga has received praise and criticism from various publications. Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey found that the manga had a good balance between character development, comedy, and action scenes. Watsuki&#x27;s artwork was said to have improved as the series continued, noting that characters also had reactions during fights. Steve Raiteri from Library Journal praised the series for its characters and battles. However, he noted that some fights were too violent, so he recommended the series to older teenagers as well as adults. Surat described the series as an example of a &quot;neo-shōnen&quot; series, where a shōnen series also appeals to a female audience; Surat stated that in such series, character designs are &quot;pretty&quot; for female audiences but not too &quot;girly&quot; for male audiences. Surat cited Shinomori Aoshi and Seta Sōjirō, characters who ranked highly in popularity polls even though, in Surat&#x27;s view, Aoshi does not engage in &quot;meaningful&quot; battles and Sōjirō is a &quot;kid&quot;. Surat explained that Aoshi appears &quot;like a Clamp character wearing Gambit&#x27;s coat and Sōjirō always smiles despite the abuse inflicted upon him. Surat said that the character designs for the anime television series were &quot;toughened up a bit&quot;. He added that the budget for animation and music was &quot;top-notch&quot; because Sony produced the budget. Watsuki&#x27;s writing involving romance and Kenshin&#x27;s psychological hidden weakpoints also earned positive responses from other sites, with AnimeNation also comparing it to Clamp&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; based on the multiple elements of the series. In general, Mania found Watsuki&#x27;s art appealing as well as its evolution across the twenty-eight volumes, as it made female characters more attractive while the male characters seemed simpler while retaining the early handsome looks.

As a result of the series taking a darker tone in later story arcs with Kenshin facing new threats and at the same time his &quot;Battosai&quot; self, Kat Kan from &quot;Voice of Youth Advocates&quot; recommended it to older teens. Kan also found that anime viewers will also enjoy Watsuki&#x27;s drawings due to the way he illustrates battles. This is mostly noted in the &quot;Kyoto arc&quot;, where Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey applauded the fight between Himura Kenshin and anti-hero Saito Hajime, which acts as the prologue of such a narrative. Mania remarks on the buildup Aoshi, Saito, and other characters bring to the story due to how they share similar goals in the same arc, with newcomer Misao helping to balance the style by bringing more comical interactions with the protagonist. Although the site Manga News enjoyed Seta Sojiro&#x27;s fight and how it connected with Shishio&#x27;s past, they said the sixteenth manga&#x27;s best part was Kenshin&#x27;s fight against Shishio due to the buildup and symbolism the two characters have. The eventual climax led to further praise based on how menacing Shishio is shown in the battle against his predecessor, although he questioned if Kenshin had been a superior enemy if he had kept back his original killer persona.

Critics expressed mixed opinions in regards to the final arc. Zac Bertschy from Anime News Network (ANN) praised the story from the manga but noted that by volume 18 of the series, Watsuki started to repeat the same type of villains who were united to kill Kenshin, similar to &quot;Trigun&quot;. Although he praised Watsuki&#x27;s characters, he commented that some of them needed some consistency due to various &quot;bizarre&quot; antagonists. Due to Kaoru, Kenshin, and Sanosuke missing from the final arc during the Jinchu arc, Manga News described Aoshi as the star of the series&#x27; 24th volume due to how he explores the mysteries behind Enishi&#x27;s revenge and his subsequent actions that made him stand out, most notably because he had been absent for multiple chapters. IGN reviewer A.E. Sparrow liked the manga&#x27;s ending, praising how the storylines are resolved and how most of the supporting cast ends up. He also praised the series&#x27; characters, remarking that Kenshin &quot;belongs in any top ten of manga heroes.&quot; &quot;Otaku USA&quot; reviewer Daryl Surat said that the manga&#x27;s quality was good until the &quot;Revenge Arc&quot;, where he criticized the storyline and the new characters. Carlo Santos from the same site praised Enishi and Kenshin&#x27;s final fight despite finding the ending predictable. While also liking their final showdown, Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment felt that the twist that happens shortly after the battle is over serves to show Enishi&#x27;s long-life trauma and, at the same time, Kenshin&#x27;s compassion towards others.

In &quot;Bringing Forth a World: Engaged Pedagogy in the Japanese University&quot;″s seventh chapter, &quot;The Renegotiation of Modernity&quot;, by media studies professor Maria Grajdian, Kenshin&#x27;s heroic nature as a wanderer was compared to both Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter due to how he wishes to protect the weak people, seeing nothing wrong with such trait. This is heavily explored in the series when confronting the young Seta who had opposite values in terms how should the strong men act. This soft masculinity is exemplified as a result. There is also a balance between Kenshin&#x27;s supernatural strength and small design, led a major impact in the audience due to how likable the protagonist is. His introduction marks his values with the sword which also affected Kaoru, Yahiko&#x27;s and Sanosuke&#x27;s values upon their meetings. In doing so, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; laid&quot; more than twenty years ago the foundation of a fresh paradigm of humanity based on tenderness and mutual acceptance as a counter-movement to the individualism, competition and efficiency that characterize the project of modernity&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Before becoming an official manga author, &quot;Naruto&quot;″s author, Masashi Kishimoto, decided that he should try creating a manga since &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; had not published a title from that genre. However, during his years of college, Kishimoto started reading Hiroaki Samura&#x27;s &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; and &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, which used the said genre. Kishimoto recalls having never been surprised by manga ever since reading &quot;Akira&quot; and finding that he was still not able to compete against them. Hideaki Sorachi cited &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; as a major source of inspiration for his manga series, &quot;Gintama&quot;. He also commented that the series influenced the existence of modern historical works, such as manga and video games. Kenshin&#x27;s design partially inspired Koyoharu Gotouge for the appearance of Tanjiro Kamado, protagonist of &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;.

For the series 25th anniversary in January 2021, 15 manga authors sent congratulatory messages: three of Watsuki&#x27;s former assistants, Eiichiro Oda (&quot;One Piece&quot;), Hiroyuki Takei (&quot;Shaman King&quot;), and Shinya Suzuki (&quot;Mr. Fullswing&quot;); Nobuyuki Anzai (&quot;Flame of Recca&quot;); Riichiro Inagaki (&quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;); Takeshi Obata (&quot;Death Note&quot;); Masashi Kishimoto (&quot;Naruto&quot;); Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro (&quot;Toriko&quot;); Hideaki Sorachi (&quot;Gintama&quot;); Yasuhiro Nightow (&quot;Trigun&quot;); Kazuhiro Fujita (&quot;Ushio &amp; Tora&quot;); Yusei Matsui (&quot;Assassination Classroom&quot;); and Kentaro Yabuki (&quot;Black Cat&quot;). In an interview for the event, Oda told Watsuki that &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is popular due to his loyalty to his fans.

Watsuki commented that Kenshin&#x27;s tendency to defeat his enemies without killing them became a common trend for protagonists from other &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;, series such as Monkey D. Luffy from &quot;One Piece&quot; and Naruto Uzumaki from &quot;Naruto&quot;.

<text>Bedworth ( or locally ) is a market town in the borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth, Warwickshire, England. It is situated between Coventry, 6 miles (9.5 km) to the south, and Nuneaton, to the north. In the 2021 census the town had a population of 31,090.
==Geography==
Bedworth lies northwest of London, east of Birmingham and north northeast of the county town of Warwick.

Bedworth has six main suburban districts, namely Collycroft, Mount Pleasant, Bedworth Heath, Coalpit Field, Goodyers End and Exhall. Exhall is a generic name for the area surrounding junction 3 of the M6 motorway, comprising parts of both Bedworth and Coventry. Around to the east of Bedworth is the large village of Bulkington, and around to the south-west, separated by a short gap is the village of Ash Green.

Bedworth is almost contiguous with Coventry, and is defined as being part of the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area.

The River Sowe rises in Bedworth flowing through Exhall, northern and eastern Coventry, Baginton and Stoneleigh, before joining the River Avon south of Stoneleigh.

The town is locally pronounced as &#x27;Beduth&#x27; though as Bedworth almost everywhere else.
==History==

Originally a small market town with Saxon origins, Bedworth was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bedeword&quot;. The first record of a priest at Bedworth was from 1297. The town suffered great decline as a result of the Black Death in the 14th century. In 1590, the town was described as being home to just 14 families. By 1730, Bedworth had recovered somewhat as a result of local coal mining, and was described as containing 260 houses.

Following the passage of the Five Mile Act 1665, which forbade Nonconformist church goers from assembling for worship and preaching within five miles of a corporate town such as Coventry. Bedworth, being exactly five miles from Coventry became a local centre for Nonconformists who assembled at the town. In 1686 the Reverend Julius Saunders established the Old Meeting congregation just north of the five-mile post. An old plaque that was on the mile-post can still be seen on a gate post of the Almshouses. In 1726 a Presbyterian Nonconformist chapel now of the United Reformed Church was built here which still stands, and was restored in 2012.

Bedworth developed into an industrial town in the 18th and 19th centuries, due largely to coal mining and the overspill of ribbon weaving and textile industries from nearby Coventry: Located on the Warwickshire coalfield, coal mining in the area was recorded as early as the 13th century, but grew to a large scale as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The industry peaked in 1939 when there were 20 pits in the area producing over 5.8 million tons of coal. The last colliery in Bedworth, Newdigate Colliery closed in 1982, and Coventry Colliery on the edge of the town closed in 1991. The ribbon weaving industry had been introduced to the area by French Huguenot immigrants in the 18th century and thrived for nearly a century, until it was largely wiped out in the 1860s following the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty which removed tariffs on imported French silks, causing enormous hardship to the town. Hat making however grew and largely replaced the ribbon trade, and lasted until the 1950s.

The opening of the Coventry Canal in 1789 and later, the Coventry to Nuneaton railway in 1850 enhanced the town&#x27;s growth. More recently, the M6 motorway was opened just south of the town in 1971.

From 1894 Bedworth was a civil parish within the Foleshill Rural District. In 1928 Bedworth was incorporated as an urban district in its own right. In 1932 the urban district was enlarged by the addition of Exhall and parts of Foleshill, Astley and Walsgrave on Sowe parishes. It was further enlarged in 1938 by the addition of Bulkington. In 1974 the Bedworth Urban District was merged with the Municipal Borough of Nuneaton to create the borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth.

==Features==

Among the most notable buildings in Bedworth are the Nicholas Chamberlaine Almshouses on All Saints&#x27; Square in the town centre, which are built in Tudor style and date from 1840, These replaced the original buildings which had been funded by a legacy from the local benefactor Nicholas Chamberlaine (1632–1715) through his will. The almshouses were restored in the 1980s, and are now Grade II* listed.

The majority of the town centre was redeveloped in the 1960s and early-1970s, with the typical architecture of that period, and consists of a pedestrianised shopping precinct. The town centre itself contains some of the usual high street retail names as well as many charity shops, card shops and banks.

The main venue in Bedworth is the Bedworth Civic Hall which opened in 1973 in the town centre, which has an attached arts centre.
South of the town centre is the Miners&#x27; Welfare Park, which opened in 1923, originally to provide a recreation space for miners and their families. Now managed by the local council it includes playing fields, sports facilities, footpaths and gardens. A new play area, on the site of the previous aviary and paddling pool near the cricket ground within the park, was dedicated in June 2012 to Sergeant Simon &#x27;Val&#x27; Valentine. He was born and brought up in Bedworth, a soldier of 2nd battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who died in August 2009 while serving his country in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The town centre was closed and thousands of townspeople paid their respects at Sergeant Valentine&#x27;s funeral in 2009. 

The former Bedworth water tower is probably the most noticeable landmark building in Bedworth; built in 1898 in the then fashionable Romanesque style, at approximately high, it is visible from miles around and has been Grade II listed since 1987. It originally had a 60,000 gallon water tank, but became obsolete in 1988, when a new water mains was installed into Bedworth. The tower is home to a pair of peregrine falcons, first noted in 1998. In 2015 it was sold to be converted into six luxury apartments.

Along Mill Street until recently were rows of former weavers&#x27; cottages which were once inhabited by Huguenot weavers. Some of these were still used as shops, although most had become derelict. They have been demolished as part of the redevelopment of Tesco.

==Economy==

With most of its historic industries gone, there is still some specialist manufacturing that continues in the town; one firm in Bedworth, Toye, Kenning &amp; Spencer, specialises in producing items such as hats and caps, banners, flags, medal ribbons and Masonic regalia.

At the Bayton Road industrial estate in Exhall is a manufacturing firm; Premiere Group, which specialises in producing sheet metal products, primarily for the automotive sector. The firm won the contract to produce 12,000 Olympic torches for the 2012 Olympic Games. The German mechatronic car component manufacturer Brose that supplies 80 vehicle manufacturers worldwide has its UK factory in the estate. The estate was also the home of Abbey Panels which prior to 2002 produced prototype vehicle bodies for many car manufacturers including the first run of alloy bodied Jaguar XK120s in 1948. They also produced aluminium alloy racing car bodies for Jaguar&#x27;s Le Mans winning cars of the 1950s, along with Formula 1 car bodies in the same era. The company continues as Loades Limited with a site on Bayton Road, but oriented to steel buildings for commercial properties named after their founder Edward Loades. 

The domestic appliance insurer Domestic &amp; General has offices in the town centre,
as does Warwickshire County Council.

==Politics==
Bedworth is within the parliamentary constituency of North Warwickshire and Bedworth, the local MP since 2024 has been Rachel Taylor of the Labour Party.

Local government services are provided by Warwickshire County Council and Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council

==Religion==

===Church of England===
The town centre has a church dedicated to All Saint&#x27;s known locally as All Saints&#x27; Parish Church (Church of England). A church has stood at the site since the 14th century, and it still retains its original tower from that period. The rest of the church has been rebuilt several times, the current building dates from the late Victorian era, when it was rebuilt during 1888-1890 out of Runcorn sandstone at a cost of £8,000 raised by public subscription. The church is grade II* listed.

===Roman Catholic===
St Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church, a prominent building in the town centre. The first church at the site opened in June 1883. Over later years, a number of additions were made, including the porch and tower. The church was made a parish church in 1919, and in September 1923 it was consecrated in its current form by Archbishop McIntyre.

In the early-1970s the interior of the church was modernised, with the tabernacle, altar, pulpit, font, Mary and Child, and the Sacred Heart and Risen Christ, all made by the noted Maltese artist and sculptor Carmel Cauchi.

The church is part of the Rugby Deanery in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham.

===Other Christian denominations===
There are also, Bedworth Methodist Church, and the United Reformed Church in Mill Street in the town centre, Bedworth Baptist Church on Coventry Road near the football ground as well as Life Church on Bulkington Road. A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is in Deronda Close, behind The Newdigate Arms. Zion Baptist Church is on Newdigate Road and is a striking 1977 replacement of the original 1796 chapel on High Street, which was demolished to make way for the Civic Centre (See external links.)

==Armistice Day==

Bedworth has billed itself as the &quot;town that never forgets&quot; due to its tradition of large Armistice Day commemorations on 11 November, which are well attended by the population, who gather in the town to watch the veterans&#x27; armistice parade that concludes with the laying of poppy wreaths at the war memorial, to pay their respects to those who fought and died in the armed forces. Local youth groups like the Girls&#x27; Brigade, and cadets march through the town as part of the parade, with bands playing commemorative music. Second World War Douglas C-47 Skytrain &#x27;Dakota&#x27; military transport aircraft, also known as the civilian version Douglas DC-3, scatter remembrance poppy petals over the town, aiming at the war memorial if the weather permits. Before 2005 Spitfire fighters were used.

Bedworth chose to keep 11 November as Armistice Day, even after 1939, when the rest of the country moved to the nearest Sunday. In more recent times, the tradition was kept up by Frank Parsons. The former Royal Marine died in 2011, but his work over the previous 25 years not only kept Bedworth&#x27;s tradition - unique in the United Kingdom - alive, but also lent significant weight to the campaign to move Remembrance Day back to 11 November.

==Transport==

Bedworth has good transport links being situated immediately north of the M6 motorway at junction 3, with access via several slip roads onto the A444 dual carriageway bypass. The A444 also provides fast access to Nuneaton, the Ricoh Arena, the Arena Retail Park and northern/central Coventry.
===Rail===
Bedworth railway station in the town centre is on the Coventry to Nuneaton railway line, and was reopened in 1988 after the original station at the same site was closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching Axe. Historically two more stations were in the vicinity of Bedworth which are now closed: Just south of Bedworth was Hawkesbury Lane railway station, also on the Coventry-Nuneaton line, which also closed in 1965, Just east of Bedworth was Bulkington railway station on the Trent Valley Line which closed in 1931.

<doc id="208412" wikidata="Q133720" url="?curid=208412" title="Eddy Duchin">
<text>Edwin Frank Duchin (April 1, 1909 – February 9, 1951), commonly known as Eddy Duchin or alternatively Eddie Duchin, was an American popular music pianist and bandleader during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early career==
Duchin was born on April 1, 1909, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, to Bessarabian Jewish immigrants Tillie (née Baron; 1885 – March 21, 1962) and Frank Duchin (June 2, 1885 – May 15, 1957).

After graduating from Beverly High School, he attended the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and was originally a pharmacist before turning full-time to music and beginning his new career with Leo Reisman&#x27;s orchestra at the Central Park Casino in New York, an elegant nightclub where he became popular in his own right, causing strife between him and Reisman. By 1932, Reisman&#x27;s contract with the Central Park Casino was being terminated, leaving violinist Leo Kahn as the interim leader of the orchestra. After 6 weeks, Duchin had assumed Kahn&#x27;s place as the orchestra&#x27;s leader. He became widely popular thanks to regular radio broadcasts that boosted his record sales, and he was one of the earliest pianists to lead a commercially successful large band.

==Musical style==

Playing what later came to be called &quot;sweet&quot; music rather than jazz, Duchin opened a new gate for similarly styled, piano-playing sweet bandleaders such as Henry King, Joe Reichman, Nat Brandwynne, Dick Gasparre, Little Jack Little, and particularly Carmen Cavallaro (who acknowledged Duchin&#x27;s influence) to compete with the large jazz bands for radio time and record sales.

Duchin had no formal music training—which was said to frustrate his musicians at times—but he developed a style rooted in classical music that some saw as the forerunner of Liberace&#x27;s ornate, gaudy approach. Still, there were understatements in Duchin&#x27;s music. By no means was Duchin a perfect pianist, but he was easy to listen to without being rote or entirely predictable. He was a pleasing stage presence whose favourite technique was to play his piano cross-handed, using only one finger on the lower hand, and he was respectful to his audiences and to his classical influences.

Duchin often used beautiful, soft-voiced singers such as Durelle Alexander and Lew Sherwood to accommodate his sweet and romantic songs, giving them extra appeal and making them more interesting.

He had a 1940 hit with the song &quot;So You&#x27;re the One&quot; written for him by Hy Zaret, Alex Kramer and Joan Whitney.

==Late career==
Duchin entered the U.S. Navy during World War II, serving as a combat officer in a destroyer squadron in the Mediterranean and Pacific. He attained the rank of lieutenant commander (O4). Duchin&#x27;s military awards included the Navy Commendation ribbon with Combat &quot;V&quot;, Combat Action ribbon, American Area Campaign medal, the European-Africa-Middle Eastern Area Campaign medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Area Campaign medal, and the World War II Victory medal. After his discharge from the military, Duchin was unable to reclaim his former stardom in spite of a stab at a new radio show in 1949.

==Personal life==
Duchin met his future wife, the socialite Marjorie Oelrichs, at the Waldorf in New York City, and wed at Oelrichs&#x27; mother&#x27;s apartment at the Hotel Pierre on June 5, 1935, officiated by Judge Vincent Lippe. They had one son, Peter Duchin, born July 28, 1937. Tragically, Marjorie died just six days after the birth. Duchin had a second child, born August 15, 1938, with model Marguerite O&#x27;Malley; and a third, Annette Kalten, born April 26, 1940, with Millie Yammarino. In 1947, he married a second time to Spanish-Filipina Maria Teresa &quot;Chiquita&quot; Parke-Smith (1912-1980), daughter of Teresa Parke-Smith Bertran de Lis y Pastor.

On February 9, 1951, Eddy Duchin died at age 41 at Memorial Hospital in Manhattan of acute myelogenous leukemia. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.

In the 1996 memoir &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot;, his son Peter wrote of the factual discrepancies in the film &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot;.

The Duchin Lounge in the Sun Valley Lodge was reportedly named after Marjorie Duchin by W. Averell Harriman, who raised Eddy Duchin&#x27;s son Peter as his own after both of his parents had died.

==Legacy==
By the mid-1950s, Columbia Pictures, having enjoyed success with musical biographies, mounted a feature film based on the bandleader&#x27;s life. &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot; (1956) is a fictionalized tearjerker, with Tyrone Power in the title role, and piano dubbed by Carmen Cavallaro. The film did well in theaters.

&quot;Dancing with Duchin&quot;, an anthology of some of Duchin&#x27;s recordings, was released in 2002.

<doc id="208413" wikidata="Q12880211" url="?curid=208413" title="Coal mining">
<text>Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground or from a mine. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a &quot;pit&quot;, and above-ground mining structures are referred to as a &quot;pit head&quot;. In Australia, &quot;colliery&quot; generally refers to an underground coal mine.

Coal mining has had many developments in recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large open-cut and longwall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of draglines, trucks, conveyors, hydraulic jacks, and shearers.

The coal mining industry has a long history of significant negative environmental impacts on local ecosystems, health impacts on local communities and workers, and contributes heavily to the global environmental crises, such as poor air quality and climate change. For these reasons, coal has been one of the first fossil fuels to be phased out of various parts of the global energy economy. The major coal producing countries, though, such as China, Indonesia, India and Australia, have not reached peak production, with production increases replacing falls in Europe and the United States and proposed mines under development. The coal mining industry employs almost 2.7 million workers.

==History==


==Methods of extraction==
Coal extraction methods vary depending on whether the mine is an underground mine or a surface (also called an open cast) mine. Additionally, coal seam thickness and geology are factors in the selection of a mining method. The most economical method of coal extraction for surface mines is the electric shovel or drag line. The most economical form of underground mining is the long wall, which involves using two spinning drums with carbide bits that runs along sections of the coal seam. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a coal preparation plant. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography, especially altitude and slope; climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; groundwater conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.

Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately , are usually surface mined.

Coal that occurs at depths of are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam . Coals occurring below are usually deep mined. However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to below ground level, for instance Tagebau Hambach in Germany.

===Surface mining===

When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut, also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip, mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.

Most open cast mines in the United States extract bituminous coal. In Canada, Australia, and South Africa, open cast mining is used for both thermal and metallurgical coals. In New South Wales open casting for steam coal and anthracite is practiced. Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production. Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.

====Strip mining====
Strip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam. This earth to be removed is referred to as &#x27;overburden&#x27; and is removed in long strips. The overburden from the first strip is deposited in an area outside the planned mining area and referred to as out-of-pit dumping. Overburden from subsequent strips is deposited in the void left from mining the coal and overburden from the previous strip. This is referred to as in-pit dumping.

It is often necessary to fragment the overburden by use of explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the overburden, filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The overburden is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as draglines, shovel and trucks, excavator and trucks, or bucket-wheels and conveyors. This overburden is put into the previously mined (and now empty) strip. When all the overburden is removed, the
underlying coal seam will be exposed (a &#x27;block&#x27; of coal). This block of coal may be drilled and blasted (if hard) or otherwise loaded onto trucks or conveyors for transport to the coal preparation (or wash) plant. Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it. This method is most suitable for areas with flat terrain.

Equipment to be used depends on geological conditions. For example, to remove overburden that is loose or unconsolidated, a bucket wheel excavator might be the most productive. The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.

====Contour mining====
The contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, a variety of methods were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill.

The limitations of contour strip mining are both economic and technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may not be technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.

====Mountaintop removal mining====

Mountaintop coal mining is a surface mining practice involving removal of mountaintops to expose coal seams, and disposing of associated mining overburden in adjacent &quot;valley fills&quot;. Valley fills occur in steep terrain where there are limited disposal alternatives.

Mountaintop removal mining combines area and contour strip mining methods. In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring near the top of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden is deposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves the ridge and hilltops as flattened plateaus. The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of creating &quot;head-of-hollow-fills&quot;, or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.

Spoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow. In preparation for filling this area, vegetation and soil are removed and a rock drain constructed down the middle of the area to be filled, where a natural drainage course previously existed. When the fill is completed, this underdrain will form a continuous water runoff system from the upper end of the valley to the lower end of the fill. Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.

===Underground mining===

Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping point limited by geology, ventilation, or economics, a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or retreat mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.

Modern pillar sections use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, which can prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment have left a work area. The mobile roof supports are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile roof support&#x27;s legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile roof supports leave an area.

There are six principal methods of underground mining:
* Longwall mining accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.
* Continuous mining utilizes a continuous miner machine with a large rotating steel drum equipped with tungsten carbide picks that scrape coal from the seam. Operating in a &quot;room and pillar&quot;, also known as &quot;bord and pillar&quot; system, where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30-foot (5–10 m) &quot;rooms&quot; or work areas cut into the coalbed—it can mine as much as 14 tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day. Continuous miners account for about 45 percent of underground coal production. Conveyors transport the removed coal from the seam. Remote-controlled continuous miners are used to work in a variety of difficult seams and conditions, and robotic versions controlled by computers are becoming increasingly common. Continuous mining is a misnomer, as room and pillar coal mining is very cyclical. In the US, one can generally cut up to around . This may be increased with MSHA permission. In South Africa, the limit may be as high as . After the cutting limit is reached, the continuous miner assembly is removed and the roof is supported by the use of a roof bolter, after which the face has to be serviced before it can be advanced again. During servicing, the &quot;continuous&quot; miner moves to another face. Some continuous miners can bolt and rock dust the face, two major components of servicing, while cutting coal, while a trained crew may be able to advance ventilation, to truly earn the &quot;continuous&quot; label. However, very few mines are able to achieve it. Most continuous mining machines in use in the US lack the ability to bolt and dust. This may partly be because the incorporation of bolting makes the machines wider, and therefore, less maneuverable.
* Room and pillar mining consists of coal deposits that are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to keep up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however, where there was space to leave the head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the &quot;in situ&quot; coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (&quot;see&quot; retreat mining).
* Blast mining or conventional mining, is an older practice that uses explosives such as dynamite to break up the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a central loading area. This process consists of a series of operations that begins with &quot;cutting&quot; the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.
* Retreat mining is a method in which the pillars or coal ribs used to hold up the mine roof are extracted; allowing the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This is one of the most dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability of when the roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.

==Production==


Coal is mined commercially in over 50 countries. 7,921 million metric tons (Mt) of coal were produced in 2019, a 70% increase over the 20 years since 1999. In 2018, the world production of brown coal (lignite) was 803.2 Mt, with Germany the world&#x27;s largest producer at 166.3 Mt. China is most likely the second largest producer and consumer of lignite globally although specific lignite production data is not made available.

Coal production has grown fastest in Asia, while Europe has declined. Since 2011, world coal production has been stable, with decreases in Europe and US offset by increases from China, Indonesia and Australia. The top coal mining nations are:
=== Economic impact ===
Energy production from coal mining is highly concentrated in certain jurisdictions, which also concentrates much of the social and economic impacts of the industry to these regions. The industry directly employs over seven million workers worldwide, which, in turn, creates millions of indirect jobs. 

In several parts of the world, producers have reached peak coal as some economies shift away from fossil fuels to address climate change. A 2020 study found that renewables jobs could feasibly be created in these geographies to replace many of the coal mining jobs as part of a just transition; however, renewable energy was not suitable in some of the geographies with high concentrations of miners, such as in China, which is far and away the leading coal-mining nation.
=== Waste and refuse ===
====Disasters====
==Modern mining==

The use of sophisticated sensing equipment to monitor air quality is common and has replaced the use of small animals such as canaries, often referred to as &quot;miner&#x27;s canaries&quot;.

In the United States, the increase in technology has significantly decreased the mining workforce. in 2015 US coal mines had 65,971 employees, the lowest figure since EIA began collecting data in 1978. However, a 2016 study reported that a relatively minor investment would allow most coal workers to retrain for the solar energy industry.

== Safety ==

===Dangers to miners===
Coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is long. In the U.S., 104,895 coal miners were killed in mine accidents since 1900, 90 percent of the fatalities occurring in the first half of the 20th century. 3,242 died in 1907, the worst year ever; in 2020 there were five.

Open cut hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse, rock burst, outbursts, and gas explosions.

Firedamp explosions can trigger the far more dangerous coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire mine. Most of these risks are greatly reduced in modern mines, and multiple fatality incidents are now rare in most parts of the developed world. Modern coal mining in the US has an average 23 deaths per year due to mine accidents (2001–2020).
However, in lesser developed countries and some developing countries, many miners continue to die annually, either through direct accidents in coal mines or through adverse health consequences from working under poor conditions. China, in particular, has the highest number of coal mining related deaths in the world, with official statistics claiming that 6,027 deaths occurred in 2004. To compare, 28 deaths were reported in the U.S. in the same year. Coal production in China is twice that in the US, while the number of coal miners is around 50 times that of the US, making deaths in coal mines in China 4 times as common per worker (108 times as common per unit output) as in the US.

Mine disasters have still occurred in recent years in the U.S., Examples include the Sago Mine disaster of 2006, and the 2007 mine accident in Utah&#x27;s Crandall Canyon Mine, where nine miners were killed and six entombed. In the decade 2005–2014, US coal mining fatalities averaged 28 per year. The most fatalities during the 2005–2014 decade were 48 in 2010, the year of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia, which killed 29 miners.

Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers). The use of water sprays in mining equipment reduces the risk to miners&#x27; lungs.

====Damps ====

Build-ups of a hazardous gas are known as damps, possibly from the German word which means steam or vapor:
* Black damp: a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in a mine can cause suffocation, and is formed as a result of corrosion in enclosed spaces so removing oxygen from the atmosphere.
* After damp: similar to black damp, after damp consists of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen and forms after a mine explosion.
* Fire damp: consists of mostly methane, a highly flammable gas that explodes between 5% and 15% – at 25% it causes asphyxiation.
* Stink damp: so named for the rotten egg smell of the hydrogen sulfide gas, stink damp can explode and is also very toxic.
* White damp: air containing carbon monoxide which is toxic, even at low concentrations
* A heavy curtain used to direct air currents in mines and prevent the buildup of dangerous gases is known as a &quot;damp sheet&quot;.

====Noise====

Noise is also a contributing factor to potential adverse effects on coal miners&#x27; health. Exposure to excessive noise can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Hearing loss developed as a result of occupational exposures is coined occupational hearing loss. To protect miners&#x27; hearing, the US Mine Safety and Health Administration&#x27;s (MSHA) guidelines for noise place a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for noise at 90 dBA time-weighted over 8 hours. A lower cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs.

Noise exposures vary depending on the method of extraction. For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88–112 dBA. Within longwall sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures. Auxiliary fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within continuous mining sections. Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to adverse effects on workers&#x27; hearing. The use of administrative controls and engineering controls can be used to reduce noise exposures.

===Safety improvements===

Improvements in mining methods (e.g. longwall mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as safety-lamps or more modern electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, electrical equipment, and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with gas engines. Another innovation in recent years is the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor&#x27;s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. These numbers, however, include all mining activities, and oil and gas mining contribute to the majority of fatalities. Coal mining resulted in 47 fatalities that year. One study, though, has suggested that hazards of modern mining are now more accretive with workers facing long-term health impacts, such as sleep deprivation, that build up over time.

==Environmental impacts==
==Coal mining by country==
Top 10 hard and brown coal producers in 2012 were (in million metric tons): China 3,621, United States 922, India 629, Australia 432, Indonesia 410, Russia 351, South Africa 261, Germany 196, Poland 144, and Kazakhstan 122.

===Australia===
Coal has been mined in every state of Australia, but mainly in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. It is mostly used to generate electricity, and 75% of annual coal production is exported, mostly to eastern Asia.

In 2007, 428 million tonnes of coal was mined in Australia. In 2007, coal provided about 85% of Australia&#x27;s electricity production. In the fiscal year 2008/09, 487 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 261 million tonnes was exported. In the fiscal year 2013/14, 430.9 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 375.1 million tonnes was exported. In 2013/14, coal provided about 69% of Australia&#x27;s electricity production.

In 2013, Australia was the world&#x27;s fifth-largest coal producer, after China, the United States, India, and Indonesia. However, in terms of proportion of production exported, Australia is the world&#x27;s second largest coal exporter, as it exports roughly 73% of its coal production. Indonesia exports about 87% of its coal production.

A court in Australia has cited climate change in ruling against a new coal mine.

===Canada===

Canada was ranked as the 15th coal producing country in the world in 2010, with a total production of 67.9 million tonnes. Canada&#x27;s coal reserves, the 12th largest in the world, are located largely in the province of Alberta.

The first coal mines in North America were located in Joggins and Port Morien, Nova Scotia, mined by French settlers beginning in the late 1600s. The coal was used for the British garrison at Annapolis Royal, and in the construction of the Fortress of Louisbourg.

===Chile===

Compared to other South American countries Chile has limited coal resources. Only Argentina is similarly poor. Coal in Chile is mostly sub-bituminous with the exception of the bituminous coals of the Arauco Basin in central Chile.

===China===

China is by far the largest producer of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China&#x27;s coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6–12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China&#x27;s total energy uses 67% from coal mines.

===Colombia===
Some of the world&#x27;s largest coal reserves are located in South America, and an opencast mine at Cerrejón in Colombia is one of the world&#x27;s largest open pit mines. The output of the mine in 2004 was 24.9 million tons (compared to total global hard coal production of 4,600 million tons). Cerrejón contributed about half of Colombia&#x27;s coal exports of 52 million tons that year, with Colombia ranked sixth among major coal exporting nations. The company planned to expand production to 32 million tons by 2008. The company has its own 150 km standard-gauge railroad, connecting the mine to its coal-loading terminal at Puerto Bolívar on the Caribbean coast. There are two 120-car unit trains, each carrying 12,000 tons of coal per trip. The round-trip time for each train, including loading and unloading, is about 12 hours. The coal facilities at the port are capable of loading 4,800 tons per hour onto vessels of up to 175,000 tons of dead weight. The mine, railroad and port operate 24 hours per day. Cerrejón directly employs 4,600 workers, with a further 3,800 employed by contractors. The reserves at Cerrejón are low-sulfur, low-ash, bituminous coal. The coal is mostly used for electric power generation, with some also used in steel manufacture. The surface mineable reserves for the current contract are 330 million tons. However, total proven reserves to a depth of 300 metres are 3,000 million tons.

The expansion of the Cerrejón mine has been blamed for the forced displacement of local communities.

===Germany===

Germany has a long history of coal mining, going back to the Middle Ages. Coal mining greatly increased during the Industrial Revolution and the following decades. The main mining areas were around Aachen and the Ruhr area, along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany, and until 1945 also in Upper Silesia, while the Saarland was repeatedly under French control. These areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing, and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.

Coal mining reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. After 1950, the coal producers started to struggle financially. In 1975, a subsidy was introduced (&quot;Kohlepfennig&quot;, &quot;coal penny&quot; as part of the electricity bill), which was discontinued in the 1990s. In 2007, due to EU regulations, the Bundestag decided to end subsidies by 2018. As a consequence, RAG AG, the owner of the two remaining coal mines in Germany, Prosper Haniel and Ibbenbüren, announced it would close all mines by 2018, thus ended underground coal mining in Germany.

Open pit lignite mining for electricity continues in Nordrhein-Westfalen, and in the eastern states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.

===Greece===
Lignite has been mined in Greece since 1873, and today supplies approximately 75% of the country&#x27;s energy. The main mining areas are located in Western Macedonia (Ptolemaida) and the Peloponnese (Megalopolis).

===India===
Coal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River. Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853. After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt per year by 1920, following increased demand in the First World War, but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 Mt by 1942 and 30 Mt by 1946. After independence, the country embarked upon five-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to 33 Mt. During the 1st Plan period, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India undertaking, in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India.

===Japan===
The richest Japanese coal deposits have been found on Hokkaido and Kyushu.

Japan has a long history of coal mining dating back into the Japanese Middle Ages. It is said that coal was first discovered in 1469 by a farming couple near Ōmuta, central Kyushu. In 1478, farmers discovered burning stones in the north of the island, which led to the exploitation of the Chikuhõ coalfield.

Following Japanese industrialization, additional coalfields were discovered in northern Japan. One of the first mines in Hokkaido was the Hokutan Horonai coal mine.

===New Zealand===
===Poland===
===Russia===
Russia ranked as the fifth largest coal producing country in 2010, with a total production of 316.9 Mt. Russia has the world&#x27;s second largest coal reserves. Although Russian oil and gas exports get a lot more attention, Russia is the world&#x27;s third largest coal exporter and these exports are an important source of foreign revenue and are important for the coal mining communities. Russia and Norway share the coal resources of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, under the Svalbard Treaty.

===Spain===

Spain was ranked as the 30th coal producing country in the world in 2010. The coal miners of Spain were active in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. In October 1934, in Asturias, union miners and others suffered a fifteen-day siege in Oviedo and Gijon. There is a museum dedicated to coal mining in the region of Catalonia, called Cercs Mine Museum.

In October 2018, the Sánchez government and Spanish Labour unions settled an agreement to close ten Spanish coal mines at the end of 2018. The government pre-engaged to spend 250 million Euro to pay for early retirements, occupational retraining and structural change. In 2018, about 2,3 per cent of the electric energy produced in Spain was produced in coal-burning power plants.

===South Africa===

South Africa is one of the ten largest coal producing countries and the fourth largest coal exporting country in the world.

===Taiwan===

In Taiwan, coal is distributed mainly in the northern area. All of the commercial coal deposits occurred in three Miocene coal-bearing formations, which are the Upper, the Middle, and the Lower Coal Measures. The Middle Coal Measures was the most important with its wide distribution, great number of coal beds and extensive potential reserves. Taiwan has coal reserves estimated to be 100–180 Mt. However, coal output had been small, amounting to 6,948 metric tonnes per month from 4 pits before it ceased production effectively in 2000. 

The abandoned coal mine in Pingxi District, New Taipei, has now turned into the Taiwan Coal Mine Museum.

=== Turkey ===
===Ukraine===

In 2012 coal production in Ukraine amounted to 85.946 million tonnes, up 4.8% from 2011. Coal consumption that same year grew to 61.207 million tonnes, up 6.2% compared with 2011.

More than 90 percent of Ukraine&#x27;s coal production comes from the Donets Basin. The country&#x27;s coal industry employs about 500,000 people. Ukrainian coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, and accidents are common. Furthermore, the country is plagued with extremely dangerous illegal mines.

===United Kingdom===

===United States===

Coal began being mined in the United States in the early 18th century, and commercial mining started around 1730 in Midlothian, Virginia.
The U.S. share of world coal production remained steady at about 20 percent from 1980 to 2005, at about 1 billion short tons per year. The United States was ranked as the second highest coal producing country in the world in 2010, and possesses the largest coal reserves in the world. In 2008 then-President George W. Bush stated that coal was the most reliable source of electricity. 

In 2011, former U.S. president Barack Obama said that the U.S. should rely more on cleaner sources of energy that emit lower or no carbon dioxide pollution. For a time, while domestic coal consumption for electric power was being displaced by natural gas, exports grew. U.S. net coal exports increased ninefold from 2006 to 2012, peaked at 117 million short tons in 2012, then declined to 63 million tons in 2015. In 2015, 60% of net US exports went to Europe, 27% to Asia. US coal production increasingly comes from strip mines in the western United States, such as from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.

Coal has come under continued price pressure from natural gas and renewable energy, which has resulted in a rapid decline of coal in the U.S. and several notable bankruptcies including Peabody Energy. On 13 April 2016 the company reported that its revenue had reduced by 17 percent as coal prices fell and that it had lost two billion dollars the previous year. It then filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 13 April 2016. &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; addressed retraining coal workers for solar photovoltaic employment because of the rapid rise in U.S. solar jobs. A 2016 study indicated that this was technically possible and would account for only 5% of the industrial revenue from a single year to provide coal workers with job security in the energy industry as whole.

Donald Trump pledged to bring back coal jobs during the 2016 US presidential election, and as president he announced plans to reduce environmental protection, particularly by repealing the Clean Power Plan (CPP). However, industry observers have warned that this might not lead to a boom in mining jobs 

A 2019 projection by the Energy Information Administration estimated that coal production without CPP would decline over coming decades at a faster rate than indicated in the agency&#x27;s 2017 projection, which had assumed the CPP was in effect.

<doc id="208414" wikidata="Q6730997" url="?curid=208414" title="Magical Girl Pretty Sammy">
<text>is a Japanese original video animation (OVA) series produced by AIC and Pioneer LDC, and released from 1995 to 1997 as three videos. It features character Sasami from the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; series as a magical girl, and is noted for recasting the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; characters in new roles. It has been dubbed into English by Pioneer USA. It also spawned two television series - &quot;Magical Project S&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Magical Girl Pretty Sammy&quot; originated not in animation but in voice drama, beginning in 1993 with the release of &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki CD Special 1 (Creation of the Universe Journey Across Space-Time)&quot;. Here, Washu&#x27;s newest invention, the Dimensional Controller, is glitched by the girls, creating several parallel &quot;Tenchi!&quot; worlds. Stories from the drama would later be adapted for &quot;Tenchi Universe&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Time and Space Adventures&quot; arc (episodes 11-13). A second CD release, &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, incorporated ideas revisited again in the series, drawing on Tsunami as the source of Pretty Sammy&#x27;s magical powers.

The music video for &quot;Pretty Sammy, the Magical Girl&quot;, originally part of the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Soundfile&quot;, marked Pretty Sammy&#x27;s anime debut. After having a kiss between her and Tenchi interrupted by the villainous Kiyone, Sasami must transform into her magical alter-ego to save her love and teach his kidnappers a lesson. Though the &quot;Soundfile&quot; was never released officially in the U.S., this short can be seen during the end credits of the &quot;Mihoshi Special&quot;.

The &quot;Mihoshi Special&quot; OVA was the first time Sammy was ever featured as a full-fledged character in the animated medium, and after her appearance in Episode 12 of &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; (&quot;Tenchi Muyo! TV: Time and Space Adventures Part 2&quot;) in a costume that more resembles Sailor Moon&#x27;s than her original outfit, the magical girl would go on to star in OVA specials and television series of her own.

==Overview==

Sasami Kawai is a cute young Japanese girl who is asked by magical queen-to-be Tsunami of Juraihelm to become &quot;Magical Girl Pretty Sammy&quot;, a champion of justice. She is constantly harassed by Pixy Misa, an evil, but friendly magical girl created by a rival candidate for queen of the magical world, Ramia. Sasami is unaware that Pixy Misa is actually her best friend, Misao Amano, who herself is unaware of the transformation forced on her via hypnosis by Ramia&#x27;s brother, Rumiya.

Collectively, the various &quot;Pretty Sammy&quot; vehicles spoof the magical girl genre of anime (particularly &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, with the &quot;champion of justice&quot; theme), using the characters from AIC&#x27;s popular &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; series. Ryo-Ohki (who is a male in both of the &quot;Pretty Sammy&quot; series, but a female in &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; material) is Pretty Sammy&#x27;s assistant and plays the same role that Luna (of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series) has done, including keeping the fact he can talk a secret.

Both the OVAs and the TV series are notable for the quality of the musical tracks. Many of the tracks are parodies of popular karaoke tunes.

The other major characters of &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; appear in various roles in the OVA. They include: Tenchi, Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Ayeka, and Ryoko.

<doc id="208417" wikidata="Q1127368" url="?curid=208417" title="Japanese battleship Musashi">
<text>was one of four planned s built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), beginning in the late 1930s. The &quot;Yamato&quot;-class ships were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing almost fully loaded and armed with nine main guns. Their secondary armament consisted of four triple-gun turrets formerly used by the s. They were equipped with six or seven floatplanes to conduct reconnaissance.

Commissioned in mid-1942, &quot;Musashi&quot; was modified to serve as the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and spent the rest of the year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk, Japan&#x27;s main wartime naval base in the South Pacific theatre, in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, &quot;Musashi&quot; was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by a team of researchers employed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

==Design and description==

Since the IJN anticipated it would be unable to produce as many ships as the United States, the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class ships with their great size and heavy armament were designed to be individually superior to American battleships. &quot;Musashi&quot; had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. She had a waterline beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. Her crew consisted of 2,500 officers and ratings in 1942, and about 2,800 in 1944.

The battleship had four sets of Kampon geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 12 Kampon water-tube boilers, giving the ship a maximum speed of . She had a stowage capacity of of fuel oil, giving a range of at a speed of .

===Armament===
&quot;Musashi&quot;″s main battery consisted of nine 45-calibre 460-milliimetre Type 94 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets, numbered from front to rear. The guns had a rate of fire of 1.5 to 2 rounds per minute. The ship&#x27;s secondary battery consisted of twelve 60-calibre 155-millimetre 3rd Year Type guns mounted in four triple turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one on each side amidships. These had become available once the &quot;Mogami&quot;-class cruisers were rearmed with  guns. Heavy anti-aircraft defence was provided by a dozen 40-calibre 127-millimetre (5 in) Type 89 dual-purpose guns in six twin turrets, three on each side of the superstructure. &quot;Musashi&quot; also carried thirty-six 25-millimetre (1 in) Type 96 light anti-aircraft (AA) guns in 12 triple-gun mounts, all mounted on the superstructure. The ship was also provided with two twin mounts for the licence-built Type 93 anti-aircraft machine guns, one on each side of the bridge.

While the ship was under repair in April 1944, the two 155 mm wing turrets were removed and replaced with three triple 25 mm gun mounts each. A total of sixteen triple 25 mm mounts and twenty-five single mounts were added at that time, giving the ship a light AA armament of 115 guns.

===Armour===
The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt was identical to &#x27;s at thick and angled outwards 20 degrees at the top. Below it was a strake of armour that ranged in thickness from over the magazines and machinery spaces, respectively; it tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge. The deck armour ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armour plate thick on the face, on the sides, and 270 millimetres on the roof. The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armour thick, and the turrets of the 155 mm guns were protected by armour plates. The sides of the conning tower were thick and its roof was 200 millimetres thick. Underneath the magazines were armour plates to protect the ship from mine damage. &quot;Musashi&quot; contained 1,147 watertight compartments (1,065 underneath the armour deck, 82 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

===Aircraft===
&quot;Musashi&quot; was fitted with two catapults on her quarterdeck and could stow up to seven floatplanes in her below-decks hangar. The ship operated Mitsubishi F1M biplanes and Aichi E13A1 monoplanes and used a , stern-mounted crane for recovery.

===Fire control and sensors===
The ship was equipped with four rangefinders, one atop her forward superstructure and one in each of her main gun turrets, and another unit atop her rear superstructure. Each gun turret was equipped with an rangefinder. Low-angle fire was controlled by two Type 98 fire-control directors mounted above the rangefinders on the superstructure. Type 94 high-angle directors controlled the 127 mm AA guns, with Type 95 short-range directors for the 25 mm AA guns.

&quot;Musashi&quot; was built with a Type 0 hydrophone system in her bow, usable only while stationary or at low speed. In September 1942, a Type 21 air-search radar was installed on the roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version, and a Type 13 early-warning radar was also fitted.

==Construction==

To cope with &quot;Musashi&quot;″s great size and weight, the construction slipway was reinforced, nearby workshops were expanded, and two floating cranes were built. The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 29 March 1938 at Mitsubishi&#x27;s Nagasaki shipyard, and was designated &quot;Battleship No. 2&quot;. Throughout construction, a large curtain made of hemp rope weighing prevented outsiders from viewing construction.

Launching the &quot;Musashi&quot; also presented challenges. The ship&#x27;s thick launch platform, made of nine Douglas fir planks bolted together, took two years to assemble (from keel-laying in March 1938) because of the difficulty in drilling perfectly straight bolt holes through 4 metres of fresh timber. The problem of slowing and stopping the massive hull once inside the narrow Nagasaki Harbour was met by attaching of heavy chains on both sides of the hull to create dragging resistance in the water. The launch was concealed by measures that included a citywide air-raid drill staged on launch day to keep people inside their homes. &quot;Musashi&quot; was launched on 1 November 1940, coming to a stop only further than the hull&#x27;s expected travel distance across the harbour. The entry of such a large mass into the water caused a wave, which swept the harbour and local rivers, flooding homes and capsizing small fishing boats. &quot;Musashi&quot; was fitted out at nearby Sasebo, with Captain Kaoru Arima assigned as her commanding officer.

Towards the end of fitting out, the ship&#x27;s flagship facilities, including those on the bridge and in the admiral&#x27;s cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet&#x27;s desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister ship &quot;Yamato&quot; was too far along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of &quot;Musashi&quot; by two months, to August 1942.

==Service==
&quot;Musashi&quot; was commissioned at Nagasaki on 5 August 1942, and assigned to the 1st Battleship Division, together with &quot;Yamato&quot;, and . Beginning five days later, the ship conducted machinery and aircraft-handling trials near Hashirajima. Her secondary armament of twelve 127 mm guns, 12 triple 25 mm gun mounts, and four anti-aircraft machine guns was fitted 3–28 September 1942 at Kure, as well as a Type 21 radar. The ship was working up for the rest of the year. Arima was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November.

&quot;Musashi&quot; was assigned to the Combined Fleet, commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, on 15 January 1943 and sailed for Truk three days later, arriving on 22 January. On 11 February, she replaced her sister ship &quot;Yamato&quot; as the fleet&#x27;s flagship. On 3 April, Yamamoto left &quot;Musashi&quot; and flew to Rabaul, New Britain to personally direct &quot;Operation &quot;I-Go&quot;&quot;, a Japanese aerial offensive in the Solomon Islands. His orders were intercepted and deciphered by Magic, and American Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters shot down his transport aircraft and killed him in Operation Vengeance while he was en route from New Britain to Ballale, Bougainville. On 23 April, his cremated remains were flown back to Truk and placed in his cabin on board &quot;Musashi&quot;.

On 17 May, in response to American attacks on Attu Island, &quot;Musashi&quot;—together with the aircraft carrier , two heavy cruisers, and nine destroyers—sortied to the northern Pacific. When no contact was made with American forces, the ships sailed to Kure on 23 May, where Yamamoto&#x27;s ashes were taken from the vessel in preparation for a formal state funeral. Immediately afterwards, &quot;Musashi&quot;″s task force was significantly reinforced to counterattack American naval forces off Attu, but the island was captured before the force could intervene. On 9 June, Arima was relieved by Captain Keizō Komura. On 24 June, while being overhauled at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, &quot;Musashi&quot; was visited by Emperor Hirohito and high-ranking naval officers. From 1 to 8 July, the ship was fitted with a pair of Type 22 radars at Kure. She sailed for Truk on 30 July and arrived there six days later, where she resumed her position as fleet flagship for Admiral Mineichi Koga.

In mid-October, in response to suspicions of planned American raids on Wake Island, &quot;Musashi&quot; led a large fleet—three carriers, six battleships, and 11 cruisers—to intercept American forces, but failed to make contact and returned to Truk on 26 October. She spent the remainder of 1943 in Truk Lagoon. Komura was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and transferred to the 3rd Fleet on 7 December as chief of staff; Captain Bunji Asakura assumed command of &quot;Musashi&quot;.
The ship remained in Truk Lagoon until 10 February 1944, when she returned to Yokosuka. On 24 February, &quot;Musashi&quot; sailed for Palau, carrying one Imperial Japanese Army battalion and another of Special Naval Landing Forces and their equipment. After losing most of her deck cargo in a typhoon, she arrived at Palau on 29 February and remained there for the next month. On 29 March, &quot;Musashi&quot; departed Palau under cover of darkness to avoid an expected air raid, and encountered the submarine , which fired six torpedoes at the battleship; five of them missed, but the sixth blew a hole in diameter near the bow, flooding her with 3,000 tonnes of water. The torpedo hit killed seven crewmen and wounded another eleven. After temporary repairs, &quot;Musashi&quot; sailed for Japan later that night and arrived at Kure Naval Arsenal on 3 April. From 10 to 22 April, she was repaired, while her anti-aircraft armament was substantially increased in the space freed up by removal of the beam-mounted triple turrets. When she undocked on 22 April, the ship&#x27;s secondary battery comprised six 15.5 cm guns, twenty-four 12.7 cm guns, one hundred and thirty 25 mm guns, and four 13.2 mm machine guns. She also received new radars (which were still primitive compared to American equipment) and depth-charge rails on her fantail.

In May 1944, Asakura was promoted to rear admiral; &quot;Musashi&quot; departed Kure for Okinawa on 10 May, then for Tawi-Tawi on 12 May. She was assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, with her sister ship. On 10 June, the battleships departed Tawi-Tawi for Batjan under the command of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, in preparation for Operation Kon, a planned counterattack against the American invasion of Biak. Two days later, when word reached Ugaki of American attacks on Saipan, his force was diverted to the Mariana Islands. After they rendezvoused with Ozawa&#x27;s main force on 16 June, the battleships were assigned to Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s 2nd Fleet. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Musashi&quot; was not attacked. Following Japan&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the battle (also known as the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;), the Second Fleet returned to Japan. On 8 July, &quot;Musashi&quot; and her sister embarked 3,522 men and equipment of the Army&#x27;s 106th Infantry Regiment of the 49th Infantry Division and sailed for Lingga Island, where they arrived on 17 July.

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===
Captain Toshihira Inoguchi relieved Asakura in command of &quot;Musashi&quot; on 12 August 1944 and was promoted to rear admiral on 15 October. Three days later, the ship sailed for Brunei Bay, Borneo to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for &quot;Operation &quot;Sho&quot;-1&quot;, the planned counterattack against the American landings at Leyte. The Japanese plan called for Ozawa&#x27;s carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Kurita&#x27;s 1st Diversion Force (also known as the Central Force) could enter Leyte Gulf and destroy American forces landing on the island. &quot;Musashi&quot;, together with the rest of Kurita&#x27;s force, departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October.

The following day, the submarine torpedoed and sank the heavy cruiser near Palawan. The destroyer rescued 769 survivors and transferred them to &quot;Musashi&quot; later in the day.

====Loss at Sibuyan Sea====
On 24 October, while transiting the Sibuyan Sea, Kurita&#x27;s ships were spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft from the fleet carrier . Just over two hours later, the battleship was attacked by eight Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers from &quot;Intrepid&quot; at 10:27. One bomb struck the roof of Turret No. 1, failing to penetrate. Two minutes later, &quot;Musashi&quot; was struck starboard amidships by a torpedo from a Grumman TBF Avenger, also from &quot;Intrepid&quot;. The ship took on 3,000 tonnes of water and a 5.5-degree list to starboard that was later reduced to 1 degree by counterflooding compartments on the opposite side. During this attack, two Avengers were shot down.

An hour and a half later, another eight Helldivers from &quot;Intrepid&quot; attacked &quot;Musashi&quot; again. One bomb hit the upper deck and failed to detonate; another hit the port side of the deck and penetrated two upper decks before exploding above one of the engine rooms. Fragments broke a steam pipe in the engine room and forced its abandonment, as well as that of the adjacent boiler room. Power was lost to the port inboard propeller shaft and the ship&#x27;s speed dropped to . Anti-aircraft fire shot down two Helldivers during this attack. Three minutes later, nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship, scoring three torpedo hits on the port side. One hit abreast Turret No. 1, the second flooded a hydraulic machinery room, forcing the main turrets to switch over to auxiliary hydraulic pumps, and the third flooded another engine room. More counterflooding reduced the list to one degree to port, but the amount of flooding reduced the ship&#x27;s forward freeboard by . During this attack, &quot;Musashi&quot; fired &quot;sanshikidan&quot; anti-aircraft shells from her main armament; one shell detonated in the middle gun of Turret No. 1, possibly because of a bomb fragment in the barrel, and wrecked the turret&#x27;s elevating machinery.

At 13:31, the ship was attacked by 29 aircraft from fleet carriers and . Two Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters strafed the ship&#x27;s deck and Helldivers scored four more bomb hits near her forward turrets. &quot;Musashi&quot; was hit by four more torpedoes, three of which were forward of Turret No. 1, causing extensive flooding. The ship was now listing one degree to starboard, and had taken on so much water that her bow was now down and her speed had been reduced to . Two hours later, nine Helldivers from attacked with armour-piercing bombs, scoring four hits. The ship was hit by three more torpedoes, opening up her starboard bow and reducing her speed to . At 15:25, &quot;Musashi&quot; was attacked by 37 aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, the fleet carrier and the light carrier . The ship was hit by 13 bombs and 11 more torpedoes during this attack, for a loss of three Avengers and three Helldivers. Her speed was reduced to , her main steering engine was temporarily knocked out and her rudder was briefly jammed 15 degrees to port. Counterflooding reduced her list to six degrees to port from its previous maximum of ten degrees. &quot;Musashi&quot; had been struck by an estimated total of 19 torpedoes and 17 bombs.

Kurita left &quot;Musashi&quot; to fend for herself at 15:30, and encountered her again at 16:21 after reversing course. The ship was headed north, with a list of 10 degrees to port, down at the bow with her forecastle awash. He detailed a heavy cruiser and two destroyers to escort her while frantic efforts were made to correct her list, including flooding another engine room and some boiler rooms. Her engines stopped before she could be beached. At 19:15, her list reached 12 degrees and her crew was ordered to prepare to abandon ship, which they did fifteen minutes later when the list reached 30 degrees. &quot;Musashi&quot; capsized at 19:36 and sank in of water at . Inoguchi chose to go down with his ship; 1,376 of her 2,399-man crew were rescued. About half of her survivors were evacuated to Japan, and the rest took part in the defence of the Philippines. The destroyer rescued 635 of &quot;Maya&quot;″s survivors from &quot;Musashi&quot;.

==Wreck==
===Discovery===
For over 70 years after her sinking, various attempts were made by shipwreck hunters to locate the wreck of the Japanese battleship, but none succeeded. &quot;Musashi&quot;, like other Japanese warships, did not have its name on its sides, making it more difficult for divers and shipwreck hunters to find her. A research team sponsored by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen eventually found her after eight years of searching for the wreck, going through various historical records in different countries, and deploying the high-tech yacht and a remotely operated vehicle to aid in their search. In March 2015, Allen announced that the team had found &quot;Musashi&quot; under the Sibuyan Sea, some beneath the surface.

The ship had been thought to have sunk in one piece; in reality, it exploded underwater, scattering debris across the ocean floor. The bow section from the number one barbette forward is upright on the sea floor, while the stern is upside down. The forward superstructure and funnel is detached from the rest of the ship and lies on its port side. In the live streaming video tour conducted by the expedition team, a mount for the seal of the Imperial Japanese Navy—a chrysanthemum made out of teak, long rotted away—can be seen amid the debris. The video also showed damage made by U.S. torpedoes, including a warped bow and hits under the ship&#x27;s main gun. Other items found in the area of the wreck, as well as other features found inside, led maritime experts to claim with 90% certainty that the wreck was &quot;Musashi&quot;.

To further confirm the identity of the wreck, Shigeru Nakajima, an electrical technician on &quot;Musashi&quot; who survived by jumping overboard after the order to abandon ship was given, told the Associated Press that he was &quot;certain&quot; that the wreck was &quot;Musashi&quot; upon seeing its anchor and the imperial seal mount. He also expressed his gratitude to the expedition team for having located the shipwreck.

===Preservation and protection===
The discovery of the wreck beneath the surface of the Sibuyan Sea raised issues in the Philippines because the provincial government of Romblon, which has jurisdiction over the shipwreck site, and the Philippine Coast Guard were unaware that Allen and his team had an ongoing expedition in the area, though Governor Eduardo Firmalo publicly welcomed discovery of the ship. In response to the find, the Philippine Coast Guard stated that foreign-owned vessels need clearance from the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, the Customs Bureau, and the Immigration Bureau before entering Philippine waters.

Although discovering the shipwreck was very important to the Japanese people because of the presence aboard of over 1,000 Japanese sailors&#x27; remains, the National Museum of the Philippines stated that &quot;any further activity [pertaining to the shipwreck would] be governed by established rules and regulations.&quot; The Museum pointed out that the wreck site of &quot;Musashi&quot;, as stated by the law, is considered an archaeological site under Romblon&#x27;s jurisdiction, and was &quot;giving priority to verifying the discovery, obtaining and sharing key information, facilitating the protection and preservation of the site, and formulating appropriate next steps.&quot;

<doc id="208418" wikidata="Q907398" url="?curid=208418" title="Musashi Province">
<text>was a province of Japan, which today comprises Tokyo Metropolis, most of Saitama Prefecture and part of Kanagawa Prefecture. It was sometimes called . The province encompassed Kawasaki and Yokohama. Musashi bordered on Kai, Kōzuke, Sagami, Shimōsa, and Shimotsuke Provinces.

Musashi was the largest province in the Kantō region.

==History==
Musashi had its ancient capital in modern Fuchū, Tokyo, and its provincial temple in what is now Kokubunji, Tokyo. By the Sengoku period, the main city was Edo, which became the dominant city of eastern Japan. Edo Castle was the headquarters of Tokugawa Ieyasu before the Battle of Sekigahara and became the dominant city of Japan during the Edo period, being renamed Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration.

&quot;Hikawa-jinja&quot; was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of the province; 
 and there are many branch shrines.

The former province gave its name to the battleship of the Second World War.

===Timeline of important events===
* 534 (&quot;Ankan 1, 12th month&quot;): The Yamato court sends a military force to appoint Omi as the governor of Musashi Province, his rival, Wogi was executed by the court. Omi presented four districts of Musashi Province to the court as royal estates.
* July 18, 707 (&quot;Keiun 4, 15th day of the 6th month&quot;): Empress Genmei is enthroned at the age of 48. 

* 707 (&quot;Keiun 4&quot;): Copper was reported to have been found in Musashi province in the region which includes modern day Tokyo. 
* 708 (&quot;Keiun 5&quot;): The era name was about to be changed to mark the accession of Empress Genmei; but the choice of &quot;Wadō&quot; as the new &quot;nengō&quot; for this new reign became a way to mark the welcome discovery of copper in the Chichibu District of what is now Saitama Prefecture. The Japanese word for copper is &quot;dō&quot; (銅); and since this was indigenous copper, the &quot;wa&quot; (the ancient Chinese term for Japan) could be combined with the &quot;dō&quot; (copper) to create a new composite term—&quot;wadō&quot;—meaning &quot;Japanese copper&quot;.
* May 5, 708 (&quot;Wadō 1, 11th day of the 4th month&quot;): A sample of the newly discovered Musashi copper was presented in Genmei&#x27;s Court where it was formally acknowledged as &quot;Japanese copper.&quot; The Wadō era is famous for the first Japanese coin (和同開珎, &quot;wadokaiho&quot; or &quot;wadokaichin&quot;).
*1590 (&quot;Tenshō 18&quot;): Siege of Odawara. Iwatsuki Domain and Oshi Domain founded in Musashi Province.

<doc id="208419" wikidata="Q1071147" url="?curid=208419" title="Japanese-Language Proficiency Test">
<text>The , or JLPT, is a standardized criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language proficiency for non-native speakers, covering language knowledge, reading ability, and listening ability. The test is held twice a year in Japan and selected countries (on the first Sunday of July and December), and once a year in other regions (either on the first Sunday of December or July depending on region). The JLPT is conducted by the Japan Foundation for tests overseas (with cooperation of local host institutions), and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services for tests in Japan.

The JLPT consists of five independent levels of certification, with 5 the lowest and 1 the highest. Until 2009, the test had four levels of certification. JLPT certificates do not expire or become invalid over time.

==History==
The JLPT was first held in 1984 in response to the growing demand for standardized Japanese language certification. Initially, 7,000 people took the test. Until 2003, the JLPT was one of the requirements for foreigners entering Japanese universities. Since 2003, the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) is used by most universities for this purpose; unlike the JLPT, which is solely a multiple-choice exam, the EJU contains sections which require the examinee to write in Japanese.

==Uses and equivalencies==

JLPT certification can be used for many official purposes in Japan. For example, JLPT N1 or N2 certification can help foreign nationals receive preferential immigration treatment in some circumstances. Similarly, those who have passed either N1 or N2 (regardless of citizenship) are exempt from the Japanese language section of the middle school equivalency examination, which is required to enter a Japanese high school if the applicant did not graduate from a Japanese middle school, and N1 certification is sometimes accepted as an alternative to the Examination for Japanese University Admission for foreign students who wish to study at Japanese universities.

JLPT certification can also be required as a component of licensing in Japan. N1 certification is a prerequisite for foreign medical professionals who wish to take examinations to be licensed in Japan, and for certain foreign nationals who wish to attend nursing school in Japan. Further, under Japan&#x27;s Economic partnership agreement with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, a JLPT certificate is required for Indonesian, Filipino, and Vietnamese nurse or caregiver candidates who visit Japan.

Although the Japan Foundation does not provide an official table of comparison between the JLPT and other language proficiency exams, Japanese language textbooks and language courses at the university level tend to use the table on the right to compare JLPT results to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) scale. Beginning in July 2025, JLPT score reports will include an official indication of corresponding CEFR levels.

==Administration==

In Japan, the JLPT is administered by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Japan Educational Exchanges and Services (JEES). Overseas, the Japan Foundation co-proctors test administration with local cultural exchange and/or educational institutions, or with committees specially established for this purpose.

==Test format==
The revised test pattern was implemented in 2010. The test consists of five levels, with N1 the highest level and N5 the lowest. According to the exam, N1 represents &quot;the ability to understand Japanese used in a variety of circumstances&quot;, N2 represents &quot;the ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations, and in a variety of circumstances to a certain degree&quot;, N3 represents &quot;the ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations to a certain degree&quot;, N4 represents &quot;the ability to understand basic Japanese&quot;, and N5 represents &quot;the ability to understand some basic Japanese&quot;. No &quot;Test Content Specification&quot; is published as it is discouraged to study from kanji and vocabulary lists.

===Scoring===
Passing is based on scaled scores calculated using item-response theory so that equivalent performance on tests from different years and different levels of difficulty yields the same scaled score. Raw scores are not directly used to determine conditions for passing, nor are they reported, except in rough form in the &quot;Reference Information&quot; of the score report, which tells test takers whether their raw scores were 67% or above, between 34% and 66%, or below 34%. This reference information is given for vocabulary, grammar, and reading on the N4 and N5, and for vocabulary and grammar (but not reading) on the N1, N2, and N3.

Since 2010, passing the test requires both achieving an overall pass mark for the total points, and passing each section individually. The overall pass mark depends on the level, and varies between 100/180 (55.55%) for the N1 and 80/180 (44.44%) for the N5. Meanwhile, scores of at least 31.67% are required for each section in order to ensure that test takers cannot pass by doing very well on one section and very poorly on another.

===Estimated study time===

Self-reported study hour comparison data for students residing in Japan, published by the Japanese Language Education Center:

==Applications and results==

The application period is usually around early March until late April for July&#x27;s examination and around early August until late September for December&#x27;s exam.

Results for the December test are announced the following February for examinees in Japan, and March for overseas candidates. Test results are sent to the examinees through the testing organization or center to which they applied. From 2012, with online registration, results are available online before they are mailed out (late August for the July test). All examinees receive a report indicating their scores by section. Those who pass also receive a &quot;Certificate of Proficiency&quot;.

As of 2004, when there were 302,198 total test takers, the JLPT was offered annually in 40 countries including Japan. Since 2009, two exams have been held each year in East Asia, and the yearly number of test takers had risen to 1,168,535 by 2019. As of 2021, the regions with the most test takers were Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.


==Previous format (1984–2009)==

Until 2009, the test had four levels. JLPT certificates do not expire, so results from the previous format remain valid.

All instructions on the test were written in Japanese, although their difficulty is adjusted to remain appropriate to each test level. The subject matter covered at each level of the examination was based upon the , first published in 1994 and revised in 2004. This specification served as a reference for examiners to compile test questions, rather than as a study guide for candidates. It consisted of kanji lists, expression lists, vocabulary lists, and grammar lists for all four JLPT levels. However, about 20% of the kanji, vocabulary, and grammar in any one exam may have been drawn from outside the prescribed lists at the discretion of exam compilers.

The independent source the Japanese Language Education Center publishes the following study hour comparison data:

===Test sections===
In its previous format, the JLPT was divided into three sections: &quot;Characters and Vocabulary&quot; (100 points), &quot;Listening Comprehension&quot; (100 points), and &quot;Reading Comprehension and Grammar&quot; (200 points).

The first section (文字･語彙, &quot;moji, goi&quot;) tests knowledge of vocabulary and various aspects of the Japanese writing system. This includes identifying the correct kanji characters for given situations, selecting the correct hiragana readings for given kanji, choosing the appropriate terms for given sentences, and choosing the appropriate usage of given words.

The second section (聴解, &quot;chōkai&quot;) comprises two sub-sections that test listening comprehension. The first involves choosing the picture which best represents the situation presented by a prerecorded conversation. The second is of a similar format but presents no visual clues.

Section three (読解･文法, &quot;dokkai, bunpō&quot;) uses authentic or semi-authentic reading passages of various lengths to test reading comprehension. Questions include prompts to fill in blank parts of the text and requests to paraphrase key points. Grammar questions request that examinees select the correct grammar structure to convey a given point or test conjugations and postpositional particle agreement.

===Comparison with new format===

Two changes in levels of tests were made from the previous four-level format: firstly, a new level was inserted between the old level 3 and level 2, and secondly, the content of the top level exam (old level 1) was changed to test slightly more advanced skills, though the passing level was not changed, possibly through equating of test scores. Vocabulary in particular is said to be taken from an increased pool of 18,000 words.

The addition of the new N3 was done to address the problem of the difficulty gap between levels 3 and 2: in the past, there had been requests for revisions to address the fact that examinees who had passed the Level 3 test often had trouble with passing the Level 2 test because of the large gap in the level of skill needed to pass those two levels. There was also a desire to measure abilities more advanced than those targeted by the current Level 1 test, hence the top-level exam was modified.

The correspondence is as follows:
* N1: slightly more advanced than the original level 1, but the same passing level
* N2: the same as the original level 2
* N3: in between the original level 2 and level 3
* N4: the same as the original level 3
* N5: the same as the original level 4

The revised test continues to test the same content categories as the original, but the first and third sections of the test have been combined into a single section. Sections on oral and writing skills were not introduced. Further, a requirement to pass individual sections was added, rather than only achieving an overall score.

It has been argued that changes to the exam were connected to the introduction of new language policies instituted by the Ministry of Education regarding the education of minorities in Japan.

<doc id="208421" wikidata="Q431443" url="?curid=208421" title="Leiji Matsumoto">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist, and creator of several anime and manga series. His widow Miyako Maki is also a manga artist.

Matsumoto was famous for his space operas such as &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;. His style was characterized by mythological and often tragic storylines with strong moral themes, noble heroes, feminine heroines, and a love of strange worlds and melancholic atmosphere.

== Early life ==
Leiji Matsumoto was born on January 25, 1938, in Kurume, Fukuoka. He was the middle child of a family of seven brothers, and, in his early childhood, Matsumoto was given a 35mm film projector by his father, and watched American cartoons during the Pacific War. During this time, he gained an interest in science fiction novels by authors Unno Juza and H. G. Wells. Matsumoto started drawing at the age of six, and began drawing manga three years later after seeing the works of Osamu Tezuka. At 18, he moved to Tokyo to become a manga artist.

==Career==

In 1954, Matsumoto made his debut under his real name, Akira Matsumoto, with &quot;Mitsubachi no bōken&quot; in the magazine &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;.

Matsumoto&#x27;s big break came with &quot;Otoko Oidon&quot;, a series that chronicled the life of a rōnin (a young man preparing for university entrance exams), in 1971. In 1972 he created the mature-themed dark comedy Western &quot;seinen&quot; series &quot;Gun Frontier&quot; for the &quot;Play Comic&quot; magazine, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Around the same time he started a series of unconnected short stories set during World War II, &quot;Senjo Manga Series&quot;, which would eventually become popular under the title &quot;The Cockpit&quot;.

He was involved in &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974) and created the highly popular series &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; (1977) and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; (1977). In 1978, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; and &quot;Senjo Manga Series&quot;. Animated versions of &quot;Captain Harlock&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; are set in the same universe, which spawned several spin offs and related series, most notably &quot;Queen Emeraldas&quot; and &quot;Queen Millennia&quot;.

Matsumoto supervised the creation of several music videos for the French house group Daft Punk, set to tracks from their album &quot;Discovery&quot;. These videos were issued end-to-end (making a full-length animated movie) on a DVD release titled &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot;.

Approximately two dozen bronze statues – each four feet tall – of characters and scenes from &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; were erected in the downtown area of Tsuruga in 1999. Each statue includes a plaque at its base explaining the character and features Matsumoto&#x27;s signature.
Matsumoto worked with Yoshinobu Nishizaki on &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (known outside Japan under various names, but most commonly as &quot;Star Blazers&quot;). Matsumoto created a manga loosely based on the series, and the Yamato makes cameo appearances (sans crew) in several of his works including the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; manga.

A later work by Matsumoto called &quot;Great Yamato&quot; featuring an updated Yamato was renamed &quot;Great Galaxy&quot; due to legal issues with Nishizaki. As of 2009, Matsumoto and Nishizaki were working on independent anime projects featuring the acclaimed &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, with the conditions that Matsumoto cannot use the name &quot;Yamato&quot; or the plot or characters from the original, and Nishizaki cannot use the conceptual art, character or ship designs of the original.

In August 2014, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his debut, Matsumoto launched the manga &quot;Captain Harlock: Jigen Kōkai&quot; (&quot;Captain Harlock: Dimensional Voyage&quot;), illustrated by Kōichi Shimahoshi, in the pages of Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Champion Red&quot; magazine. &quot;Dimensional Voyage&quot; is a retelling of the original 1978 &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; manga. It had been licensed in the United States by Seven Seas Entertainment.

== Personal life ==
Matsumoto was married to manga artist and Licca-chan creator Miyako Maki.

On November 15, 2019, Matsumoto suffered severe respiratory problems and collapsed during an event in Turin, Italy, for the 40th-anniversary tour celebrating the Captain Harlock anime adaptation. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition and had a breathing tube inserted after he was admitted to the emergency unit. However, he was considered to be out of danger two days later.

==Death==
Matsumoto died of acute heart failure at a hospital in Tokyo on February 13, 2023, at the age of 85. Various manga artists offered condolences, including Yasuhiro Nightow, Nozomu Tamaki, and his wife Maki. &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; voice actress Masako Nozawa and translator Zack Davisson also gave their condolences.

<doc id="208423" wikidata="Q1027770" url="?curid=208423" title="Gowron">
<text>Gowron, son of M&#x27;Rel, is a fictional character who appeared in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Portrayed by Robert O&#x27;Reilly, he is the leader of the Klingon Empire, known as the Chancellor. O&#x27;Reilly had appeared earlier in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; as Scarface in the second season episode &quot;Manhunt&quot;, and was cast as Gowron due to his comedic ability and his piercing and extremely unsettling gaze, or what O&#x27;Reilly himself humorously referred to as &quot;that crazy loon eyeball thing&quot;.

Appearing first in &quot;Reunion&quot;, where he is named Chancellor, Gowron defends his position against the challenge of the Duras family in the two-part episode &quot;Redemption&quot;. Following the advice of Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) in &quot;Rightful Heir&quot;, he incorporates the clone of Kahless into the Klingon government without disrupting his own leadership. In &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, he initiates a conflict with the Federation over fears that the Cardassians have been infiltrated by the Founders. After Cardassia sides with the Dominion, he allies with Starfleet throughout the rest of the war. However, he later grows jealous of the success of General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) and undermines the war effort, resulting in Worf killing him in a duel.

O&#x27;Reilly also appeared as the character in video games, such as &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: Klingon Honor Guard&quot;. Critics responded positively to the appearances of the character, equating his actions to those of a politician. He ranked 20th in a list of the best characters in the franchise by IGN, while Keith DeCandido called him one of the &quot;more memorable characters&quot;.

==Concept and development==

Prior to his casting as Gowron, Robert O&#x27;Reilly appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; second season episode &quot;Manhunt&quot; as a character referred to as Scarface. When casting was underway for the Jonathan Frakes directed episode &quot;Reunion&quot;, Frakes was looking for an actor who could portray a Klingon with a sense of humour. O&#x27;Reilly later remarked that he was considered because of what he called &quot;that crazy loon eyeball thing&quot;. He went directly from a performance of &quot;King Lear&quot; where he portrayed the character Edmund, and introduced elements of that character into the Klingon. O&#x27;Reilly described Gowron&#x27;s initial appearances as being &quot;the only one with honor, and he was sort of a crazed warrior who did not want to be anywhere near &#x27;hew-mons&#x27;&quot;. He felt that like Edmund, Gowron was an outsider who became a leader. He said that they were &quot;very, very similar in nature&quot;, and said that this set the character apart from the other Klingons who had appeared on the show until that point. Michael Westmore was in charge of designing the prosthetics for O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s performances as Gowron, describing it as one of his favourites of all the Klingons he&#x27;s worked on because of the beard that comes down the side of his face.

O&#x27;Reilly made his first appearance in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; in the third season episode &quot;The House of Quark&quot;. Writer Ronald D. Moore explained that his work on the episode came about because of his previous work on the Klingon-centric &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, and was pleased to bring over elements from his previous series—including Gowron. O&#x27;Reilly felt lucky to appear in the episode, as it was the expectation of many actors who played recurring characters in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; that they wouldn&#x27;t transition to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Outside of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly appeared in character for an advert for Hallmark Cards to promote a Klingon Bird of Prey starship Christmas ornament.

Later, when he discovered that Michael Dorn would be returning to &quot;Star Trek&quot; on television in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, he hoped that it might be an opening for more Klingons on the show, including the return of Gowron. O&#x27;Reilly said that &quot;When I got the script for &#x27;The Way of the Warrior&#x27;, I was thrilled to get the job, to work with Michael again and to see Gowron and Worf together&quot;. He praised the relationship between the characters of Worf and Gowron, saying &quot;[Worf is] always reminding Gowron about honor, but we&#x27;re on two totally different sides when it comes to honor. It makes for great drama.&quot; At the time he was confident that this wouldn&#x27;t be Gowron&#x27;s last appearance, but hoped that the character wouldn&#x27;t be overused so that he would continue to have an impact when he did.

Gowron&#x27;s final appearance in &quot;Star Trek&quot; was in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; seventh season episode &quot;Tacking into the Wind&quot; where he is killed by Worf after the Klingon Chancellor displays some increasingly dishonorable tactics towards Martok. However, in the original draft it was not intended for the character to die; instead it would have ended with Gowron heading back to the Klingon homeworld, and promoting Martok to Field Marshal after placing him in charge of organising the Klingon forces in the Dominion War. It was Michael Piller&#x27;s suggestion that Gowron should die, and this idea made its way into the episode via Moore&#x27;s screenplay. O&#x27;Reilly described Gowron at the end saying that &quot;He went out as this bad, terrible Klingon, which I disagreed with strongly, but that&#x27;s fine.&quot;

Following the death of Gowron on screen, O&#x27;Reilly continued to attend &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions in character, often appearing on stage alongside J. G. Hertzler as Martok. One of their trademarks is a song about Klingons, and O&#x27;Reilly has had a bat&#x27;leth created to look like a stringed guitar. He explained in an interview that &quot;We love doing Klingons. For me, it was a dream come true, it was nice to come back to it. And the fans just love it. We tried it once and the fans just went crazy.&quot; The pair debuted the in-makeup appearances at a convention in the late 2000s in Germany, and after generating the longest photo op queue at the event, they decided to take it to the stage. Larry Nemecek praised their convention appearances, saying &quot;They are fan favourites because they are big, gregarious guys. They slap people on the back. They have a good time. They tease people back. They do it for the audience.&quot;

==Appearances==

===&quot;The Next Generation&quot;===
Gowron makes his first appearance in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Reunion&quot; as one of two possible successors to the role of Chancellor of the Klingon High Council (the other candidate is Duras (Patrick Massett), his longtime rival). K&#x27;mpec (Charles Cooper), the incumbent Chancellor, suspects that either Duras or Gowron had been poisoning him, and appoints Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) as &quot;Arbiter of Succession&quot; to determine who will be the next Chancellor. However, before the arbitration process can be resolved, Worf&#x27;s (Michael Dorn) one-time mate, K&#x27;Ehleyr (Suzie Plakson), discovers the evidence that implicates Ja&#x27;rod (the father of Duras) in the Romulan attack on the Klingon outpost Khitomer, and to prevent her from disclosing it, Duras murders her. Claiming right of vengeance, Worf challenges Duras to a duel and kills him, resulting in Gowron&#x27;s ascension to the Chancellorship.

Gowron reappears in the two-part episode &quot;Redemption&quot;, with his position now under threat from the Duras sisters, Lursa (Barbara March) and B&#x27;Etor (Gwynyth Walsh), who are driving for Duras&#x27; illegitimate son Toral (JD Cullum) to be appointed Chancellor. It is revealed that the Duras clan has been in league with the Klingons&#x27; traditional enemies the Romulans, and their attempt to seize power ends when the allies abandon them. Gowron also restores the honor of Worf&#x27;s house during this episode&#x27;s events.

Following these events, he was mentioned in &quot;Unification&quot; as attempting to write the Federation&#x27;s aid out of the official history of those events. Gowron is once more challenged in the episode &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; by the apparently resurrected Kahless the Unforgettable. It is ultimately revealed that this Kahless was in fact a clone, whom Gowron appoints to the symbolic post of Emperor of the Klingon Empire following the suggestion of Worf.

===&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;===
Gowron&#x27;s first appearance in the series is in the episode &quot;The House of Quark&quot;. He rules over a dispute of the status of the House of Kozak. In the episode &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, Gowron launches a Klingon assault upon the Cardassian Union, claiming that the newly installed civilian Detapa Council is infested with Changlings from the Dominion, a powerful organization from the Gamma Quadrant that is attempting to gain a foothold in the Alpha Quadrant. When the Federation Council condemns his actions, Gowron formally withdraws the Empire from the Khitomer Accords, thus ending the alliance with the Federation.

Despite this, Gowron journeys to the station, hoping to get Worf to argue on behalf of the Klingons. He does not take Worf&#x27;s refusal well, and reinstates his discommendation (this time also executing the consequential removing of the House of Mogh from the High Council, seizing the Houses&#x27; assets, lands and titles, meaning Worf and his kin were made full outcasts). Later in the episode, the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; is forced to fight several Klingon ships, at a predetermined meeting point in space, to rescue Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) and the rest of the Detapa Council. The &quot;Defiant&quot; returns to the station, only to find it surrounded by a fleet of Klingon battleships, led by both General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) and Gowron himself. The Chancellor issues Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) a final ultimatum: turn over Dukat and the Detapa Council, or else. Sisko refuses, warning that the station is not quite as helpless as they were led to believe. However, Gowron attacks Deep Space Nine anyway in an attempt to capture the Detapa Council. A fragile peace is reached by the end of the episode when it is found DS9 is more than capable of defending itself.

In the episode &quot;Broken Link&quot;, Gowron risks a war with the United Federation of Planets, demanding the disputed Archanis sector. Starfleet comes to the conclusion that Gowron is in fact a Changeling through faulty information leaked to Odo (René Auberjonois). Sisko, Odo, Worf and O&#x27;Brien (Colm Meaney) infiltrate a Klingon ceremony to try to expose him in the follow-up episode &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;, unexpectedly aided by Gowron&#x27;s top advisor General Martok, with Worf challenging Gowron to a duel with Bat&#x27;leths. Worf wins the duel, and is about to deliver the final blow, but Odo realizes in time that the Changeling is in fact Martok, who he exposes and who is subsequently killed by Gowron&#x27;s men. In spite of this, Gowron does not change his policies though he agrees to a cease-fire between the Klingons and the Federation.

In the fifth season two-parter, &quot;In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, Gowron restores the broken peace with the Federation in the Khitomer Accords after the Cardassian Union joins the Dominion and the real Martok is rescued from a Dominion prison. Gowron makes his final appearances in &quot;When It Rains…&quot; and &quot;Tacking into the Wind&quot;, where he assumes direct command of Klingon military forces and launches multiple reckless attacks with minimal success, wanting Martok (who he regards as a rival) to suffer a string of defeats. Martok, although he knows that this is Gowron&#x27;s intention, tells Worf not to involve himself. Worf disregards Martok&#x27;s request and confronts Gowron, killing him in hand-to-hand combat. Under Klingon law, Worf is entitled to assume the leadership of the Empire, but he refuses the Chancellorship in favor of Martok.

Despite the questionable nature of Gowron&#x27;s actions towards the end of his life, he does die in honorable combat, as evidenced by Worf&#x27;s performance of the traditional Klingon death howl (done as a warning to those in Sto-Vo-Kor – the place of the honored dead in Klingon mythology – that a warrior is about to arrive) over the body.

===Video games===
O&#x27;Reilly appeared as Gowron in full motion video sequences in &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;, an interactive movie/computer game released by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1996. This package also included a &quot;language lab&quot; designed to teach users basic Klingon, where O&#x27;Reilly once again appeared in character. O&#x27;Reilly also voiced Gowron in the PC game &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: Klingon Honor Guard&quot;; the plot of the game has the player character track down potential assassins of the Klingon leader. O&#x27;Reilly also played a separate Klingon, Kavok, in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s next performance as Gowron was in the MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; in the mission &quot;Leap of Faith,&quot; released in January 2021. In the mission the player, alongside General Martok and Matriarch J&#x27;Ula, find Gowron in Koth; a realm for those unworthy of Sto-Vo-Kor or Gre&#x27;thor. He is in Koth because of the dishonorable actions of his ancestor Aakar (also portrayed by O&#x27;Reilly) as Aakar&#x27;s dishonor doomed his descendants for three generations. He agrees to be the personal servant of Fek&#x27;lhr in the mission&#x27;s conclusion to guarantee the player and J&#x27;Ula&#x27;s success in enacting their plan to corner and stop Aakar. At the end of the arc, thanks to the death of Aakar, Gowron is granted his place in Sto-Vo-Kor.

==Reception and commentary==

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s performance in the first part of &quot;Redemption&quot; was described as &quot;triumphant&quot; by Keith DeCandido, and &quot;superb&quot; in &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; when reviewing those episodes for Tor.com. He also called the character &quot;one of the franchise’s more memorable recurring characters&quot;. When DeCandido reviewed &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, he said that Gowron had become an opportunist, furthering the establishment of his &quot;self serving ways&quot; in &quot;Unification&quot;. He added that in this manner, Gowron was shown to be a politician &quot;over and over&quot;.

Regarding the appearance of Gowron in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;, Bob Strauss described O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s delivery as &quot;bug-eyed aplomb&quot; in a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. The character was ranked as the 20th best of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise by Benjamin Maxwell for IGN, where Gowron was described as both &quot;a friend or foe to the Federation – and he was both during his short tenure as chancellor – this character was always true to the Klingon way.&quot; Maxwell also believed that the lack of change shown by the character during the course of his appearances in both &quot;TNG&quot; and &quot;DS9&quot; demonstrated the &quot;truest representation&quot; of a Klingon. In 2009, IGN rated Gowron the 20th best character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; up to that time, noting his role as Chancellor of the Klingon High Council and appearances on &quot;Star Trek:The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek:Deep Space Nine&quot;.

In March 2019, SyFy rated Gowron as the 7th greatest Klingon of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In particular, they noted actor O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s powerful performances in both TNG and DS-9 over the arc of the character’s story, and how Gowron&#x27;s critical position in the Klingon Empire as Chancellor, especially in the Dominion war saga, reveals the difference between personal ambition and honorable conduct.

<text>Atherstone is a market town and civil parish in the North Warwickshire district of Warwickshire, England. Located in the far north of the county, Atherstone is on the A5 national route, and is adjacent to the border with Leicestershire which is here formed by the River Anker. It is situated between the larger towns of Tamworth and Nuneaton. Atherstone is the administrative centre of the North Warwickshire district, with the offices of North Warwickshire Borough Council located in the town.

Atherstone has had its own local tradition of holding an annual Shrove Tuesday Ball Game in the streets, which has been played annually for over 800 years since 1199.

In the 2021 census the population of the civil parish of Atherstone was at 9,212. The population of the larger built-up area which includes the adjoining village of Mancetter was 11,259.

==History==
===Roman===
Atherstone has a long history dating back to Roman times: The Roman road, the Watling Street (most of which later became part of the A5) ran through what is now Atherstone, and an important defended Roman settlement named &quot;Manduessedum&quot; existed at Mancetter near the site of modern-day Atherstone. It is widely believed that the forces of the rebel Queen Boudica were defeated in their final battle against the Romans at a location near Manduessedum in around AD 60. This was suggested as the most likely location of the battle by among others, the eminent archaeologist Graham Webster, although no firm evidence has emerged to confirm this to be the case.

===Medieval===
The Domesday Book of 1086, records that Atherstone (then named &quot;Aderestone&quot;) was held by Countess Godiva. The name likely originated from the Old English &quot;Aedelred&#x27;s tun&quot; &#x27;tun&#x27; meaning farmstead or town. After the Norman Conquest, the manor of Atherstone was given to Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester who bestowed it to the monks of Bec Abbey of Normandy. In 1246 the monks of the Abbey obtained a charter from Henry III to hold a weekly market at Atherstone, thus transforming the settlement into a market town. In the 14th century, the town flourished, and Ralph Basset founded a house of Augustinian friars here in 1375, although this never became very important.

The ancient St Mary&#x27;s Church in Atherstone dates from the early 12th century. The chapel was granted to Henry Cartwright in 1542, then left abandoned and neglected until 1692 when Samuel Bracebridge settled a yearly sum for the parson of Mancetter to preach there every other Sunday in the winter season. After this, St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel seems to have experienced something of a revival. Its square tower being rebuilt in the fashionable &quot;Gothic&quot; style in 1782, and then was further redesigned in 1849 by Thomas Henry Wyatt and David Brandon.

====Battle of Bosworth====
On 21 August 1485, Henry Tudor, and up to 11,000 troops stayed at Atherstone the day before the Battle of Bosworth. Tudor was said to have stayed at the Three Tuns Inn in Long Street, while his troops camped in a meadow north of the parish church. Reputedly, whilst in Atherstone, Tudor secretly met with the powerful noblemen Thomas Stanley and his brother William Stanley who pledged their support for Tudor, which would prove decisive in the subsequent battle. The battle, which is believed to have occurred away near Market Bosworth in Leicestershire, resulted in Tudor&#x27;s forces defeating those of King Richard III, enabling Tudor to claim the throne and become King Henry VII, establishing the Tudor dynasty. A theory exists, that the battle actually took place in the fields of Merevale above Atherstone, although this is not widely accepted. The main argument put in favour of this theory, is that financial reparations were made to Atherstone after the battle and not to Market Bosworth.

The battle has now been definitively located around the &#x27;Fenn Lanes&#x27;, which run from near Atherstone to Sutton Cheney. The battle site is NW of Stoke Golding, roughly halfway between Atherstone and Market Bosworth, and near the junction with the road running south from Market Bosworth.

===Tudor period===
In Tudor times, Atherstone was a thriving commercial centre for weaving and clothmaking. The town&#x27;s favourable location laid out as a long ‘ribbon development’ along Watling Street, ensured its growth as a market town. While it remained an agricultural settlement in medieval times, attempts were made to encourage merchants and traders through the creation of burgage plots, a type of land tenure that provided them with special privileges. A manuscript discovered by Marjorie Morgan among the muniments of Cambridge&#x27;s King&#x27;s College (Ms. C9), refers to the creation of nine new burgage strips from land belonging to seven of the tenants in Atherstone vill.

By the late Tudor period Atherstone had become a centre for leatherworking, clothmaking, metalworking and brewing. Local sheep farmers and cattle graziers supplied wool and leather to local tanners and shoemakers (an industry that continued until the 1970s), while metalworkers, locksmiths and nailers fired their furnaces with local coal and the alemakers supplied thirsty palates on market days.

The surviving inventories from 16th century Mancetter provide a fascinating glimpse into Atherstone&#x27;s Elizabethan merchants and traders, before the town was economically overshadowed by the bustling cities of Coventry and Birmingham. They show Atherstone at this time as a typical Midlands market town, taking full advantage of its location and agricultural setting.

===17th century to present===

The argument that Altherstone declined in favour of emerging cities in the 18th century has been challenged. In the 1750s, Altherstone was very much still a vibrant settlement, possessing both a book club and a bowling-green. It was regularly frequented by the leisure-seeking gentry, including Sir Roger Newdigate and his circle of friends.

The Coventry Canal reached Atherstone in 1769, and the railways arrived in 1847, with the opening of the Trent Valley Railway, upon which Atherstone has its station. These transport links helped the industrialisation of the town.

Atherstone was once an important hatting town, and became well known for its felt hat industry. The industry began in the 17th century and at its height in the early 20th century there were seven firms employing 3,000 people. Due to cheap imports and a decline in the wearing of hats, the trade had declined substantially by the 1970s with just three companies remaining, Denham &amp; Hargrave Ltd, Vero &amp; Everitt Ltd and Wilson &amp; Stafford Ltd. The production of felt hats in the town ceased altogether with the closure of the Wilson &amp; Stafford factory in 1999. As of 2018 the factory received the go-ahead to be redeveloped into canalside residential apartments. However, the remains of the town&#x27;s last hat manufacturing site, on Coleshill Road, were scheduled for demolition in 2022, after the local council decided it could not be safely redeveloped for residential use.

==Governance==
Atherstone is part of the parliamentary constituency of North Warwickshire and Bedworth. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the area being Rachel Taylor of the Labour Party. The local authority is North Warwickshire Borough Council, which, since May 2023, has been under no overall control. As a civil parish, Atherstone also has a Town Council; Atherstone Town Council has 15 councillors representing three wards.

==Geography==

Atherstone is situated northwest of Nuneaton, southeast of Tamworth, north of Coventry, northeast of Birmingham, and east-southeast of Leicester. The village of Mancetter has become contiguous with Atherstone to the southeast, although it remains a separate civil parish. Atherstone is close to the River Anker which forms the boundary between Warwickshire and Leicestershire. The village of Witherley is located on the opposite bank of the river in neighbouring Leicestershire. Other nearby villages include Sheepy Magna, Ratcliffe Culey, Fenny Drayton, Grendon, Dordon, Baxterley, Baddesley Ensor and Hartshill. The town of Coleshill is to the southeast.

The A5 road (former Watling Street) historically ran through the town centre, but a dual carriageway bypass was opened in 1963.

Atherstone is one of the closest towns to the geographic centre of England, which since 2002 has been recognised as being at Lindley Hall Farm, around east of Atherstone, across the county border in Leicestershire.

==Economy==
Atherstone used to be known for its hatting industry. In part due to its central location in the UK, Atherstone&#x27;s economy has expanded rapidly since the 1980s, with several major companies such as 3M (1964) TNT (1987), Aldi (1990s) setting up their head office operations and/or national distribution centres in the town. The British Home Stores warehouse which had operated in the town for 40 years, closed in August 2016, It is now used by Royal Mail as a regional sorting office.

==Transport==
Atherstone is on the main A5 national route and close to the M42 motorway.

The Coventry Canal and a series of eleven locks runs through the town, as does the West Coast Main Line railway. Atherstone has its railway station on this line, with an hourly service 7 days a week to both London and Crewe via Stafford. The current level of service was introduced in 2008, and is a big improvement on the service two decades earlier there were only five trains a day, just going between Stafford and Rugby.

The historic station building, built in 1847, was under threat of demolition in the early 1980s. Thanks to a local group, the Railway and Steam Traction Society, listed status was obtained, with the building celebrating its 150th anniversary in 1997. Building work won a special Ian Allan conservation award. As of 2008, the railway station building is occupied by a local veterinary practice.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC CWR, BBC Radio Leicester can also be received, Capital Midlands, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands.

The town is served by the local newspapers, Atherstone Herald and Tamworth Herald.

==Recreation==
The major football team in the town is Atherstone Town, known as &#x27;the Adders&#x27;. This is after the tradition which has Atherstone being a corruption of the name &quot;Adders – stone&quot;. Their ground is located on Sheepy Road. 
Atherstone&#x27;s team started out as Atherstone Town Football Club in 1887 but folded in 1979, from 1979 to 2003 Atherstone&#x27;s football team was known as Atherstone United Football Club but folded again mid-season in 2003. The team then reverted to its previous name Atherstone Town Football Club. The club made the national headlines in October 2013 when during an FA Cup 3rd Qualifying round against Barrow A.F.C. crowd violence erupted during the first half when a small &quot;minority&quot; of Atherstone supporters ran across the pitch and attacked a number of Barrow supporters. The ringleaders and other participants of the crowd trouble were subsequently arrested, charged and sentenced to various jail terms. Since this incident the club has established itself as a family and community orientated club.

The rugby union team is Atherstone Rugby Football Club who play in the Warwickshire Two League. Their ground is situated on Ratcliffe Road. The same ground is shared by Atherstone Town Cricket Club, Atherstone Rangers Junior Football Club and is the home of Atherstone Adders Hockey Club, who play at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Academy.

Atherstone Leisure Complex is at the north end of Long Street and consists of a swimming pool and gym. Atherstone Memorial Hall is also part of the leisure complex.

===Shrovetide Ball Game===
An annual tradition in Atherstone is the Shrove Tuesday Ball Game played on a public highway with large crowds. The game celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1999.

The game is a complete free-for-all played along Watling Street (the old Roman road) at the point where it forms the main street of Atherstone town. The ball is decorated with red, white and blue ribbons that are exchanged for money by who ever is able to obtain one and is made of thick leather to make it too heavy to kick far. The match starts at 3:00pm when the ball is thrown from the balcony of the local Conservative Club (since the closure of the local branch of Barclays Bank, from whose upper floor the ball was previously thrown, in 2019) and continues until about 5:00pm. However the ball may legitimately be deflated or hidden after 4:30pm. There are no teams and no goals, though in the last century the match was played between a team from Warwickshire and one from Leicestershire. There is only one rule: players are not allowed to kill one another. Whoever is able to hang onto the ball at the end of the game not only wins the game but is allowed to keep the ball as well. The game is controlled by a number of &quot;marshalls&quot; some of whom are former winners. Police are present but for the two hours the game is in progress stand back and allow the action to continue. Legend has it that many an old feud is settled on Ball Game day. This Shrove Tuesday ball game has been held annually since the early 12th century and is one of Atherstone&#x27;s claims to fame. The 2019 edition of the game was noted for being extremely violent with several videos of the event being uploaded to social media. Event organisers disputed the accounts of violence as &quot;nothing new&quot;.

The origin of the game, in the reign of King John, is thought to have been a &quot;Match of Gold that was played between the Warwickshire Lads and the Leicestershire Lads on Shrove Tuesday&quot;.

The &#x27;ball&#x27; used is specially made each year and is &#x27;thrown out&#x27; by a prominent sporting or show business personality. Shop windows are boarded-up and traffic is diverted on the afternoon whilst the game, in which hundreds of people take part, progresses along the town&#x27;s main streets.

==Naval connections==
Atherstone has strong naval connections. Three Royal Navy ships have been named HMS &quot;Atherstone&quot; after the town: the vessels were commissioned in 1916, 1939, and most recently, 1985.

==Education==
Primary age schools in Atherstone include the Outwoods Primary School, the Racemeadow Primary Academy, and St Benedict&#x27;s RC Primary Academy.

The Queen Elizabeth Academy is the state secondary school in the town.

<text>Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn and the 18th-largest in the Solar System. It is about in diameter, about a tenth of that of Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. It is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Solar System. Consequently, its surface temperature at noon reaches only , far colder than a light-absorbing body would be. Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide variety of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrain.

Enceladus was discovered on August 28, 1789, by William Herschel, but little was known about it until the two Voyager spacecrafts, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, flew by Saturn in 1980 and 1981. In 2005, the spacecraft &quot;Cassini&quot; started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. In particular, &quot;Cassini&quot; discovered water-rich plumes venting from the south polar region. Cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, molecular hydrogen, other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling about per second. More than 100 geysers have been identified. Some of the water vapor falls back as &quot;snow&quot;; the rest escapes and supplies most of the material making up Saturn&#x27;s E ring. According to NASA scientists, the plumes are similar in composition to comets. In 2014, NASA reported that &quot;Cassini&quot; had found evidence for a large south polar subsurface ocean of liquid water with a thickness of around . The existence of Enceladus&#x27; subsurface ocean has since been mathematically modelled and replicated.

These observations of active cryoeruptions, along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus participates in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior and driving the geological activity.

&quot;Cassini&quot; performed chemical analysis of Enceladus&#x27;s plumes, finding evidence for hydrothermal activity, possibly driving complex chemistry. Ongoing research on &quot;Cassini&quot; data suggests that Enceladus&#x27;s hydrothermal environment could be habitable to some of Earth&#x27;s hydrothermal vent&#x27;s microorganisms, and that plume-found methane could be produced by such organisms.

==History==

===Discovery===

Enceladus was discovered by William Herschel on August 28, 1789, during the first use of his new 40-foot telescope, then the largest in the world, at Observatory House in Slough, England. Its faint apparent magnitude (&quot;HV&quot; = +11.7) and its proximity to the much brighter Saturn and Saturn&#x27;s rings make Enceladus difficult to observe from Earth with smaller telescopes. Like many satellites of Saturn discovered prior to the Space Age, Enceladus was first observed during a Saturnian equinox, when Earth is within the ring plane. At such times, the reduction in glare from the rings makes the moons easier to observe. Prior to the &quot;Voyager&quot; missions the view of Enceladus improved little from the dot first observed by Herschel. Only its orbital characteristics were known, with estimations of its mass, density and albedo.

=== Naming ===

Enceladus is named after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names of each of the first seven satellites of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel&#x27;s son John Herschel in his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.

Geological features on Enceladus are named by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) after characters and places from Richard Francis Burton&#x27;s 1885 translation of &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Impact craters are named after characters, whereas other feature types, such as fossae (long, narrow depressions), dorsa (ridges), planitiae (plains), sulci (long parallel grooves), and rupes (cliffs) are named after places. The IAU has officially named 85 features on Enceladus, most recently Samaria Rupes, formerly called Samaria Fossa.

==Shape and size==

Enceladus is a relatively small satellite composed of ice and rock. It is a scalene ellipsoid in shape; its diameters, calculated from images taken by &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; ISS (Imaging Science Subsystem) instrument, are between the sub- and anti-Saturnian poles, between the leading and trailing hemispheres, and between the north and south poles.

Enceladus is only one-seventh the diameter of Earth&#x27;s Moon. It ranks sixth in both mass and size among the satellites of Saturn, after Titan (), Rhea (), Iapetus (), Dione () and Tethys ().

==Orbit and rotation==
Enceladus is one of the major inner satellites of Saturn along with Dione, Tethys, and Mimas. It orbits at from Saturn&#x27;s center and from its cloud tops, between the orbits of Mimas and Tethys. It orbits Saturn every 32.9 hours, fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation. Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Dione, completing two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione.

This resonance maintains Enceladus&#x27;s orbital eccentricity (0.0047), which is known as a forced eccentricity. This non-zero eccentricity results in tidal deformation of Enceladus. The dissipated heat resulting from this deformation is the main heating source for Enceladus&#x27;s geologic activity. Enceladus orbits within the densest part of Saturn&#x27;s E ring, the outermost of its major rings, and is the main source of the ring&#x27;s material composition.

Like most of Saturn&#x27;s larger satellites, Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike Earth&#x27;s Moon, Enceladus does not appear to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.

===Source of the E ring===
Plumes from Enceladus, which are similar in composition to comets, have been shown to be the source of the material in Saturn&#x27;s E ring. The E ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.

Mathematical models show that the E ring is unstable, with a lifespan between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s, some astronomers suspected that Enceladus is the main source of particles for the ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; first two close flybys in 2005.

The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) &quot;detected a large increase in the number of particles near Enceladus&quot;, confirming it as the primary source for the E ring. Analysis of the CDA and INMS data suggest that the gas cloud &quot;Cassini&quot; flew through during the July encounter, and observed from a distance with its magnetometer and UVIS, was actually a water-rich cryovolcanic plume, originating from vents near the south pole.

Visual confirmation of venting came in November 2005, when &quot;Cassini&quot; imaged geyser-like jets of icy particles rising from Enceladus&#x27;s south polar region. (Although the plume was imaged before, in January and February 2005, additional studies of the camera&#x27;s response at high phase angles, when the Sun is almost behind Enceladus, and comparison with equivalent high-phase-angle images taken of other Saturnian satellites, were required before this could be confirmed.)

==Geology==

===Surface features===
&quot;Voyager 2&quot; was the first spacecraft to observe Enceladus&#x27;s surface in detail, in August 1981. Examination of the resulting highest-resolution imagery revealed at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth (young) terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas. Extensive linear cracks and scarps were observed. Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains, these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old.

Accordingly, Enceladus must have been recently active with &quot;water volcanism&quot; or other processes that renew the surface. The fresh, clean ice that dominates its surface makes Enceladus the most reflective body in the Solar System, with a visual geometric albedo of 1.38 and bolometric Bond albedo of . Because it reflects so much sunlight, its surface only reaches a mean noon temperature of , somewhat colder than other Saturnian satellites.

Observations during three flybys on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, revealed Enceladus&#x27;s surface features in much greater detail than the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observations. The smooth plains, which &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were found within the older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface has been subjected to extensive deformation since the craters were formed.

Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus&#x27;s interior is liquid today, even though it should have been frozen long ago.

====Impact craters====

Impact cratering is a common occurrence on many Solar System bodies. Much of Enceladus&#x27;s surface is covered with craters at various densities and levels of degradation. This subdivision of cratered terrains on the basis of crater density (and thus surface age) suggests that Enceladus has been resurfaced in multiple stages.

&quot;Cassini&quot; observations provided a much closer look at the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus&#x27;s craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater is a prime example of a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.

====Tectonic features====
&quot;Voyager 2&quot; found several types of tectonic features on Enceladus, including troughs, scarps, and belts of grooves and ridges. Results from &quot;Cassini&quot; suggest that tectonics is the dominant mode of deformation on Enceladus, including rifts, one of the more dramatic types of tectonic features that were noted. These canyons can be up to 200 km long, 5–10 km wide, and 1 km deep. Such features are geologically young, because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.

Evidence of tectonics on Enceladus is also derived from grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains such as the Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. Unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features.

In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running the length of the feature. &quot;Cassini&quot; observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.

In addition to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several other types of tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down only a few hundred meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture.

Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and seen at a much higher resolution by &quot;Cassini&quot;. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.

====Smooth plains====
Two regions of smooth plains were observed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters than in the cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. &quot;Cassini&quot; has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. &quot;Cassini&quot; images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed a number of small impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.

The expanded surface coverage provided by &quot;Cassini&quot; has allowed for the identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus&#x27;s leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is on the opposite side of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn&#x27;s tides on Enceladus.

====South polar region====

Images taken by &quot;Cassini&quot; during the flyby on July 14, 2005, revealed a distinctive, tectonically deformed region surrounding Enceladus&#x27;s south pole. This area, reaching as far north as 60° south latitude, is covered in tectonic fractures and ridges. The area has few sizable impact craters, suggesting that it is the youngest surface on Enceladus and on any of the mid-sized icy satellites. Modeling of the cratering rate suggests that some regions of the south polar terrain are possibly as young as 500,000 years or less.

Near the center of this terrain are four fractures bounded by ridges, unofficially called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;. They appear to be the youngest features in this region and are surrounded by mint-green-colored (in false color, UV–green–near IR images), coarse-grained water ice, seen elsewhere on the surface within outcrops and fracture walls. Here the &quot;blue&quot; ice is on a flat surface, indicating that the region is young enough not to have been coated by fine-grained water ice from the E ring.

Results from the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIMS) instrument suggest that the green-colored material surrounding the tiger stripes is chemically distinct from the rest of the surface of Enceladus. VIMS detected crystalline water ice in the stripes, suggesting that they are quite young (likely less than 1,000 years old) or the surface ice has been thermally altered in the recent past. VIMS also detected simple organic (carbon-containing) compounds in the tiger stripes, chemistry not found anywhere else on Enceladus thus far.

One of these areas of &quot;blue&quot; ice in the south polar region was observed at high resolution during the July 14, 2005, flyby, revealing an area of extreme tectonic deformation and blocky terrain, with some areas covered in boulders 10–100 m across.

The boundary of the south polar region is marked by a pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus&#x27;s rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus&#x27;s interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus&#x27;s southern mid-latitudes to its south pole.

Consequently, the moon&#x27;s ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus&#x27;s lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north–south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.

====South polar plumes====
Following &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; encounters with Enceladus in the early 1980s, scientists postulated it to be geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the E ring. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the E ring, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the E ring, perhaps through venting of water vapor. The first &quot;Cassini&quot; sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus&#x27;s south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement.

Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed a deflection or &quot;draping&quot; of the magnetic field, consistent with local ionization of neutral gas. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus&#x27;s atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. Unlike the magnetometer, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.
&quot;Cassini&quot; flew through this gas cloud on a few encounters, allowing instruments such as the ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) and the cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) to directly sample the plume. (See &#x27;Composition&#x27; section.) The November 2005 images showed the plume&#x27;s fine structure, revealing numerous jets (perhaps issuing from numerous distinct vents) within a larger, faint component extending out nearly from the surface. The particles have a bulk velocity of , and a maximum velocity of . &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; UVIS later observed gas jets coinciding with the dust jets seen by ISS during a non-targeted encounter with Enceladus in October 2007.

The combined analysis of imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data suggests that the observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth&#x27;s geysers or fumaroles. Fumaroles are probably the closer analogy, since periodic or episodic emission is an inherent property of geysers. The plumes of Enceladus were observed to be continuous to within a factor of a few. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions is thought to be tidal heating.

The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly as a function of the position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open. Strike-slip tectonics may also drive localized extension along alternating (left- and right- lateral) transtensional zones (e.g., pull-apart basins) over the Tiger Stripes, thereby regulating jet activity within these regions. 

Much of the plume activity consists of broad curtain-like eruptions. Optical illusions from a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry previously made the plumes look like discrete jets.

The extent to which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some debate. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.

===Internal structure===

Before the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission, little was known about the interior of Enceladus. However, flybys by &quot;Cassini&quot; provided information for models of Enceladus&#x27;s interior, including a better determination of the mass and shape, high-resolution observations of the surface, and new insights on the interior.

Initial mass estimates from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed almost entirely of water ice. However, based on the effects of Enceladus&#x27;s gravity on &quot;Cassini&quot;, its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than those of Saturn&#x27;s other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.

 suggested that Iapetus and the other icy satellites of Saturn formed relatively quickly after the formation of the Saturnian subnebula, and thus were rich in short-lived radionuclides. These radionuclides, like aluminium-26 and iron-60, have short half-lives and would produce interior heating relatively quickly. Without the short-lived variety, Enceladus&#x27;s complement of long-lived radionuclides would not have been enough to prevent rapid freezing of the interior, even with Enceladus&#x27;s comparatively high rock–mass fraction, given its small size.

Given Enceladus&#x27;s relatively high rock–mass fraction, the proposed enhancement in 26Al and 60Fe would result in a differentiated body, with an icy mantle and a rocky core. Subsequent radioactive and tidal heating would raise the temperature of the core to 1,000 K, enough to melt the inner mantle. For Enceladus to still be active, part of the core must have also melted, forming magma chambers that would flex under the strain of Saturn&#x27;s tides. Tidal heating, such as from the resonance with Dione or from libration, would then have sustained these hot spots in the core and would power the current geological activity.

In addition to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus&#x27;s shape to determine if it is differentiated. used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster at some point in the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by &quot;Cassini&quot; show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in addition to silicates.

====Subsurface ocean====
Evidence of liquid water on Enceladus began to accumulate in 2005, when scientists observed plumes containing water vapor spewing from its south polar surface, with jets moving 250 kg of water vapor every second at up to into space. Soon after, in 2006 it was determined that Enceladus&#x27;s plumes are the source of Saturn&#x27;s E Ring. The sources of salty particles are uniformly distributed along the tiger stripes, whereas sources of &quot;fresh&quot; particles are closely related to the high-speed gas jets. The &quot;salty&quot; particles are heavier and mostly fall back to the surface, whereas the fast &quot;fresh&quot; particles escape to the E ring, explaining its salt-poor composition of 0.5–2% of sodium salts by mass.

Gravimetric data from &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s December 2010 flybys showed that Enceladus likely has a liquid water ocean beneath its frozen surface, but at the time it was thought the subsurface ocean was limited to the south pole. The top of the ocean probably lies beneath a thick ice shelf. The ocean may be deep at the south pole.

Measurements of Enceladus&#x27;s &quot;wobble&quot; as it orbits Saturn—called libration—suggests that the entire icy crust is detached from the rocky core and therefore that a global ocean is present beneath the surface. The amount of libration (0.120° ± 0.014°) implies that this global ocean is about deep. For comparison, Earth&#x27;s ocean has an average depth of 3.7 kilometers.

====Composition====

The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft flew through the southern plumes on several occasions to sample and analyze its composition. As of 2019, the data gathered is still being analyzed and interpreted. The plumes&#x27; salty composition (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) indicates that the source is a salty subsurface ocean.

The INMS instrument detected mostly water vapor, as well as traces of molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane, propane, acetylene and formaldehyde. The plumes&#x27; composition, as measured by the INMS, is similar to that seen at most comets. &quot;Cassini&quot; also found traces of simple organic compounds in some dust grains, as well as larger organics such as benzene (), and complex macromolecular organics as large as 200 atomic mass units, and at least 15 carbon atoms in size.

The mass spectrometer detected molecular hydrogen (H2) which was in &quot;thermodynamic disequilibrium&quot; with the other components, and found traces of ammonia ().

A model suggests that Enceladus&#x27;s salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be a consequence of serpentinization of chondritic rock that leads to the generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that could support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus&#x27;s plumes.

Further analysis in 2019 was done of the spectral characteristics of ice grains in Enceladus&#x27;s erupting plumes. The study found that nitrogen-bearing and oxygen-bearing amines were likely present, with significant implications for the availability of amino acids in the internal ocean. The researchers suggested that the compounds on Enceladus could be precursors for &quot;biologically relevant organic compounds&quot;.

===Possible heat sources===

During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region near the south pole. Temperatures in this region ranged from 85 to 90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm to be explained by solar heating, indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted, but it cannot explain the source of the heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200 mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.

Several explanations for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a subsurface reservoir of liquid water, sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of clathrates, and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus has not yet been settled.

Heating in Enceladus has occurred through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, giving it a warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through unidentified mechanisms. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and suggest that it is in thermal equilibrium.

The observed power output of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so the main source of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.

====Tidal heating====
Tidal heating occurs through the tidal friction processes: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the crust of an object. In addition, to the extent that tides produce heat along fractures, libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating. Tidal dissipation of Enceladus&#x27;s ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean. A computer simulation that used data from &quot;Cassini&quot; was published in November 2017, and it indicates that friction heat from the sliding rock fragments within the permeable and fragmented core of Enceladus could keep its underground ocean warm for up to billions of years. It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past, the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean, such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size.

A 2016 analysis claimed that &quot;a model of the tiger stripes as tidally flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain the persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that eruptions are maintained over geological timescales.&quot; Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia. The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past.

====Radioactive heating====
The &quot;hot start&quot; model of heating suggests Enceladus began as ice and rock that contained rapidly decaying short-lived radioactive isotopes of aluminium, iron and manganese. Enormous amounts of heat were then produced as these isotopes decayed for about 7 million years, resulting in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. Although the heat from radioactivity would decrease over time, the combination of radioactivity and tidal forces from Saturn&#x27;s gravitational tug could prevent the subsurface ocean from freezing.

The present-day radiogenic heating rate is 3.2 ergs/s (or 0.32 gigawatts), assuming Enceladus has a composition of ice, iron and silicate materials. Heating from long-lived radioactive isotopes uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232 and potassium-40 inside Enceladus would add 0.3 gigawatts to the observed heat flux. The presence of Enceladus&#x27;s regionally thick subsurface ocean suggests a heat flux ≈10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating in the silicate core.

==== Chemical factors ====
Because no ammonia was initially found in the vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.

In July 2009 it was announced that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity. However, the observed 4.7 gigawatts heat flux is enough to power the cryovolcanism without the presence of ammonia.

==Origin==

===Mimas–Enceladus paradox===
Mimas, the innermost of the round moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula

:formula_1

where &quot;ρ&quot; is the (mass) density of the satellite, &quot;n&quot; is its mean orbital motion, &quot;r&quot; is the satellite&#x27;s radius, &quot;e&quot; is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, &quot;μ&quot; is the shear modulus and &quot;Q&quot; is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of &quot;qtid&quot; for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a &#x27;basic&#x27; low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an &#x27;excited&#x27; high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable.

For Mimas, only a low-energy state is expected to be stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).

The significantly higher density of Enceladus relative to Mimas (1.61 vs. 1.15 g/cm3), implying a larger content of rock and more radiogenic heating in its early history, has also been cited as an important factor in resolving the Mimas paradox.

It has been suggested that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an &#x27;excited state&#x27; of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.

===Proto-Enceladus hypothesis===
Enceladus is losing mass at a rate of 200 kg/second. If mass loss at this rate continued for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.

===Date of formation===
In 2016, a study of how the orbits of Saturn&#x27;s moons should have changed due to tidal effects suggested that all of Saturn&#x27;s satellites inward of Titan, including Enceladus (whose geologic activity was used to derive the strength of tidal effects on Saturn&#x27;s satellites), may have formed as little as 100 million years ago.
A later study from 2019 estimated that the ocean is around one billion years old.

=== Potential habitability ===
Enceladus ejects plumes of salted water laced with grains of silica-rich sand, nitrogen (in ammonia), and organic molecules, including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane (), propane (), acetylene () and formaldehyde (), which are carbon-bearing molecules. This indicates that hydrothermal activity —an energy source— may be at work in Enceladus&#x27;s subsurface ocean. Models indicate that the large rocky core is porous, allowing water to flow through it, transferring heat and chemicals. It was confirmed by observations and other research. Molecular hydrogen (), a geochemical source of energy that can be metabolized by methanogen microbes to provide energy for life, could be present if, as models suggest, Enceladus&#x27;s salty ocean has an alkaline pH from serpentinization of chondritic rock.

The presence of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global ocean circulation patterns, with an energy source and complex organic compounds in contact with Enceladus&#x27;s rocky core, may advance the study of astrobiology and the study of potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial life. Geochemical modeling results concerning not-yet-detected phosphorus indicate the moon meets potential abiogenesis-requirements. However, phosphates have been detected from a cryovolcanic plume detected by Cassini and is discussed in a paper in the June 14, 2023, issue of Nature entitled &quot;Detection of Phosphates Originating From Enceladus&#x27;s Ocean&quot;.

The presence of a wide range of organic compounds and ammonia indicates their source may be similar to the water/rock reactions known to occur on Earth and that are known to support life. Therefore, several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability. Some of the proposed missions are: Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex), Enceladus Life Finder (ELF), Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE), and Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH).

In June 2023, astronomers reported that the presence of phosphates on Enceladus has been detected, completing the discovery of all the basic chemical ingredients for life on the moon.

On December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, &quot;these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life.&quot;

=== Hydrothermal vents ===
On April 13, 2017, NASA announced the discovery of possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus&#x27;s sub-surface ocean floor. In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus&#x27;s south pole, flying within of the surface, as well as through a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.

The presence of ample hydrogen in Enceladus&#x27;s ocean means that microbes – if any exist there – could use it to obtain energy by combining the hydrogen with carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. The chemical reaction is known as &quot;methanogenesis&quot; because it produces methane as a byproduct, and is at the root of the tree of life on Earth, the birthplace of all life that is known to exist.

== Exploration ==

=== &quot;Voyager&quot; missions ===
The two Voyager spacecraft made the first close-up images of Enceladus. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was the first to fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000 km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn&#x27;s diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, &quot;Voyager&quot; scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus&#x27;s surface. In 2017, a reprocessing of departure images from the probe revealed a possible precovery image of Enceladus&#x27; plumes.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed closer to Enceladus (87,010 km) on August 26, 1981, allowing higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region closer to the equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter&#x27;s highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.

=== &quot;Cassini&quot; ===
The answers to many remaining mysteries of Enceladus had to wait until the arrival of the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft on July 1, 2004, when it entered orbit around Saturn. Given the results from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images, Enceladus was considered a priority target by the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission planners, and several targeted flybys within 1,500 km of the surface were planned as well as numerous, &quot;non-targeted&quot; opportunities within 100,000 km of Enceladus. The flybys have yielded significant information concerning Enceladus&#x27;s surface, as well as the discovery of water vapor with traces of simple hydrocarbons venting from the geologically active south polar region.

These discoveries prompted the adjustment of &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; flight plan to allow closer flybys of Enceladus, including an encounter in March 2008 that took it to within 48 km of the surface. &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; extended mission included seven close flybys of Enceladus between July 2008 and July 2010, including two passes at only 50 km in the later half of 2008. &quot;Cassini&quot; performed a flyby on October 28, 2015, passing as close as and through a plume. Confirmation of molecular hydrogen () would be an independent line of evidence that hydrothermal activity is taking place in the Enceladus seafloor, increasing its habitability.

&quot;Cassini&quot; has provided strong evidence that Enceladus has an ocean with an energy source, nutrients and organic molecules, making Enceladus one of the best places for the study of potentially habitable environments for extraterrestrial life.

On December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, &quot;these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life.&quot;

=== Proposed mission concepts ===
The discoveries &quot;Cassini&quot; made at Enceladus have prompted studies into follow-up mission concepts, including a probe flyby (Journey to Enceladus and Titan or JET) to analyze plume contents &quot;in situ&quot;, a lander by the German Aerospace Center to study the habitability potential of its subsurface ocean (Enceladus Explorer), and two astrobiology-oriented mission concepts (the Enceladus Life Finder and Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE)).

The European Space Agency (ESA) was assessing concepts in 2008 to send a probe to Enceladus in a mission to be combined with studies of Titan: Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM). TSSM was a joint NASA/ESA flagship-class proposal for exploration of Saturn&#x27;s moons, with a focus on Enceladus, and it was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal for funding. In February 2009, it was announced that NASA/ESA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of TSSM, although &quot;TSSM&quot; will continue to be studied and evaluated.

In November 2017, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner expressed interest in funding a &quot;low-cost, privately funded mission to Enceladus which can be launched relatively soon.&quot; In September 2018, NASA and the Breakthrough Initiatives, founded by Milner, signed a cooperation agreement for the mission&#x27;s initial concept phase. The spacecraft would be low-cost, low mass, and would be launched at high speed on an affordable rocket. The spacecraft would be directed to perform a single flyby through Enceladus&#x27; plumes in order to sample and analyze its content for biosignatures. NASA provided scientific and technical expertise through various reviews, from March 2019 to December 2019.

In 2022, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey by the National Academy of Sciences recommended that NASA prioritize its newest probe concept, the Enceladus Orbilander, as a Flagship-class mission, alongside its newest concepts for a Mars sample-return mission and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. The Enceladus Orbilander would be launched on a similarly affordable rocket, but would cost about $5 billion, and be designed to endure eighteen months in orbit inspecting Enceladus&#x27; plumes before landing and spending two Earth years conducting surface astrobiology research.

<text>Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique that extracts rock or minerals from the earth.

Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface where the overburden is relatively thin. In contrast, deeper mineral deposits can be reached using underground mining.
Open-pit mining is considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world. It causes significant effects to miners&#x27; health, as well as damage to the ecological land and water. Open-pit mining causes changes to vegetation, soil, and bedrock, which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology, groundwater levels, and flow paths. Additionally, open-pit produces harmful pollutants depending on the type of mineral being mined, and the type of mining process being used.

==Extraction==

Miners typically drill a series of test holes to locate an underground ore body. From the extracted samples, they can determine the extent of the ore. This helps them determine the likely location of the veins or benches of ore and its commercial value. Open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries.

Open-cast mines are dug on benches, which describe vertical levels of the hole. The interval of the benches depends on the deposit being mined, the mineral being mined, and the size of the machinery that is being used. Generally, large mine benches are 12 to 15 metres thick. In contrast, many quarries do not use benches, as they are usually shallow. Mining can be conducted on more than one bench at a time, and access to different benches is done with a system of ramps. The width of each bench is determined by the size of the equipment being used, generally 20–40 metres wide. Downward ramps are created to allow mining on a new level to begin. This new level will become progressively wider to form the new pit bottom.

Most walls of the pit are generally mined on an angle less than vertical. Waste rock is stripped when the pit becomes deeper, therefore this angle is a safety precaution to prevent and minimize damage and danger from rock falls. However, this depends on how weathered and eroded the rocks are, and the type of rocks involved. It also depends on the amount of structural weaknesses occur within the rocks, such as a faults, shears, joints or foliations.

The walls are stepped. The inclined section of the wall is known as the batter, and the flat part of the step is known as the bench or berm. The steps in the walls help prevent rock falls continuing down the entire face of the wall. In some instances additional ground support is required and rock bolts, cable bolts and shotcrete are used. De-watering bores may be used to relieve water pressure by drilling horizontally into the wall, which is often enough to cause failures in the wall by itself.

A haul road is usually situated at the side of the pit, forming a ramp up which trucks can drive, carrying ore and waste rock.

== After closure ==
Open-pit mines are typically worked until either the mineral resource is exhausted, or an increasing ratio of overburden to ore makes further mining uneconomic. After open-pit mines are closed, they are sometimes converted to landfills for disposal of solid waste. Some form of water control is usually required to keep the mine pit from becoming a lake. Several former open-pit mines have been deliberately converted into artificial lakes, forming areas such as the Lusatian Lake District, the Central German Lake District or the Upper Palatinate Lake District. A particular concern in the formation of these lakes is acid mine drainage.

==Impacts==
===Waste===
Open-pit mines create a significant amount of waste. Almost one million tons of ore and waste rock can move from the largest mines per day, and a couple thousand tons moved from small mines per day. There are generally four main operations in a mine that contribute to this load: drilling, blasting, loading, and hauling.

Waste rock is hauled to a waste dump. Waste dumps can be piled at the surface of the active pit, or in previously mined pits.

Leftover waste from processing the ore is called tailings, and is generally in the form of a slurry. This is pumped to a tailings dam or settling pond, where the water is reused or evaporated. Tailings dams can be toxic due to the presence of unextracted sulfide minerals, some forms of toxic minerals in the gangue, and often cyanide which is used to treat gold ore via the cyanide leach process. If proper environmental protections are not in place, this toxicity can harm the surrounding environment.

===Pollutants===
Open-pit mining involves the process of disrupting the ground, which leads to the creation of air pollutants. The main source of air pollutants comes from the transportation of minerals, but there are various other factors including drilling, blasting and the loading and unloading of overburden. These type of pollutants cause significant damage to public health and safety in addition to damaging the air quality. The inhalation of these pollutants can cause issues to the lungs and ultimately increase mortality. Furthermore, the pollutants affect flora and fauna in the areas surrounding open-pit mines.

Open-pit gold mining is one of the highest potential mining threats on the environment as it affects the air and water chemistry. The exposed dust may be toxic or radioactive, making it a health concern for the workers and the surrounding communities.

===Deforestation===
Open-pit nickel mining has led to environmental degradation and pollution in developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia. In 2024, nickel mining and processing was one of the main causes of deforestation in Indonesia. Open-pit cobalt mining has led to deforestation and habitat destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

==Hydrology in mining==
Open-pit mines operating in an area with heavy groundwater features may eventually face hydrology-related problems. This includes heaving and bursting of the mine floor due to excessive uplift pressure. A groundwater control system must be installed to fix problems caused by hydrology. The formation of an appropriate open-pit slope design, changes throughout the life of a mine. It is based mainly on an ever-increasing understanding of the rock mass conditions, including groundwater and associated pressures that may be acting within the slopes. The reduction of groundwater related to pore pressures is a crucial aspect of determining whether or not a geotechnical engineering design for open-pit slopes is attainable. Groundwater control systems, which include dewatering and depressurization wells, may also have a large impact on local groundwater. Because of this, an optimization-based version of the control system is required to ensure that local and regional hydro-geological impacts are within acceptable ranges.

Open Pit depressurization is the process of removing tensions or pressure from different areas of a mine. Depressurization helps to make open-pit mines more stable and secure. By using an integrated mine slope depressurization program the likelihood that mine plans can be achieved, and at an acceptable level of risk increase drastically. Depressurization allows considerable expansions of a mine, and can extend the life of the mine by 10 to 15 years. One technique used in depressurization is annealing. Annealing is the slow heating and cooling of a metal, alloy or glass. This slow heating and cooling relieves the internal stress of surrounding areas. Annealing will increase a material&#x27;s workability and durability, which overall increases open-pit mine safety. When groundwater pressures cause problems in open-pit mines, horizontal drains are used to aid in accelerating the slope depressurization process. Which helps to prevent large scale slope failure in the mine. Horizontal drains are used to lower pore pressure by reducing groundwater head, which enhances slope stability.

==Untopping==
A form of open-cast quarrying may be carried out as &#x27;untopping&#x27;. This is done where a previous underground mine is becoming uneconomic or worked-out, but still leaves valuable rock in place, often as a result of room and pillar mining. Untopping removes the overburden from above this, opens up the mine from above, and then allows the previously &#x27;trapped&#x27; minerals to be won.

Untopping was a feature of Welsh slate workings in the 1930s and 2000s, where Martyn Williams-Ellis, manager at Llechwedd found that earlier Victorian workings could be kept profitable with the newly mechanised techniques for bulk excavation to extract their pillars, and more recently across a number of worked-out mines.

==Rehabilitation==
After mining ends at a location, the mine area may undergo land rehabilitation. Waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out, to further stabilize them. If the ore contains sulfides it is usually covered with a layer of clay to prevent ingress of rain and oxygen from the air, which can oxidize the sulfides to produce sulfuric acid, a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage. This is then generally covered with soil, and vegetation is planted to help consolidate the material. Eventually this layer will erode, but it is generally hoped that the rate of leaching or acid will be slowed by the cover such that the environment can handle the load of acid and associated heavy metals. There are no long term studies on the success of these covers due to the relatively short time in which large-scale open-pit mining has existed. It may take hundreds to thousands of years for some waste dumps to become &quot;acid neutral&quot; and stop leaching to the environment. The dumps are usually fenced off to prevent livestock denuding them of vegetation. The open pit is then surrounded with a fence, to prevent access, and it generally eventually fills up with ground water. In arid areas it may not fill due to deep groundwater levels. In Germany, the world&#x27;s largest producer of lignite (virtually all of which these days is mined open-pit), the former mines are usually converted to artificial lakes. To mitigate the problem of acid mine drainage mentioned above, flooding is often done with the water of nearby rivers instead of using groundwater alone. In some cases, calcium oxide or other basic chemicals have to be added to the water to neutralize the pH-value.

==Typical open cut grades==
Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.

Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

<text>John Keiran Barry Moylan Nicholas (6 July 1919 – 3 March 2002) was a British legal scholar. He was Professor of Comparative Law at the University of Oxford from 1971 to 1978, and Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, from 1978 to 1989.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born on 6 July 1919 to Archibald John Nicholas and Rose (née Moylan). He was educated at Downside School, a Catholic private school in Somerset, England. He then matriculated into Brasenose College, Oxford, where he studied classics. In 1939, he achieved first class honours in Literae Humaniores. After taking a leave to serve in World War II, he returned to study jurisprudence, graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts in 1946.

==Academic career==
Nicholas began teaching at Brasenose College in 1946, and he served as its principal from 1978 to 1989. He gave up the position at the appointed age of 70, but he did not retire. Additionally, he served as reader in Roman Law at All Souls College from 1949 to 1971 and Professor of Comparative Law at the University of Oxford from 1971 to 1978.

Nicholas&#x27; &quot;An Introduction to Roman Law&quot; is a standard text in the study of Roman law.

Upon Nicholas&#x27; death on 3 March 2022, Peter Birks memorialized his work on behalf of the British Academy.

<doc id="208439" wikidata="Q2044417" url="?curid=208439" title="Not the Nine O'Clock News">
<text>Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News is a British television sketch comedy show which was broadcast on BBC2 from 16 October 1979 to 8 March 1982. Originally shown as a comedy alternative to the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on BBC1, it features satirical sketches on news stories and popular culture of the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as parody songs, comedy sketches, re-edited videos, and spoof television formats. The programme features Rowan Atkinson, Pamela Stephenson, Mel Smith, and Griff Rhys Jones, as well as Chris Langham in the first series.

==Format==
The format was a deliberate departure from the stream-of-consciousness comedy pioneered by &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, returning to a more conventional sketch format. Sketches were mostly self-contained, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, and often had a degree of naturalism in performance. The series launched the careers of several high-profile actors and writers, and also led to other comedic series including &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;.

The series benefited from video editing and recording techniques. The pace was enhanced by jump-cutting between library clips, usually of politicians, royalty, or celebrities. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher complained when, by adroit image editing, the programme implied she had crashed a car. Effects used in pop videos, provided by the Quantel Paintbox, were often a highlight of the musical numbers.

==History==
===Background===
&quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was produced by John Lloyd. Lloyd pitched the idea to the heads of BBC Comedy and Light Entertainment and was given a six-episode series on condition that he collaborate with Sean Hardie, who had worked in current affairs at the BBC.

Initially, Lloyd and Hardie were considering doing a lampoon of current affairs programmes &quot;à la&quot; &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, with Rowan Atkinson portraying an old-fashioned host attacking liberal and/or modern trends. The programme was to be called &quot;Sacred Cows&quot;, but the news programme was chosen because of its larger number of sources. The name of the series derived from its scheduling, as it originally aired on BBC2 at the same time as the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on BBC1.

===Aborted first series===
Aside from Atkinson, the original cast comprised Christopher Godwin, John Gorman, Chris Langham, Willoughby Goddard, and Jonathan Hyde, and the first episode of a planned series was scheduled for 2 April 1979; this also featured Chris Emmett (impersonating Denis Healey), and Robert Llewelyn (impersonating Bob Hope).

As the programme was originally scheduled to air in the time slot occupied by &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, John Cleese was to have introduced the first episode in a sketch referring to a technicians&#x27; strike in progress at the time that hindered the production of the series, explaining (in character as Basil Fawlty) that there was no programme that week, so a &quot;tatty revue&quot; would be broadcast instead. However, the 1979 general election intervened, and the programme was pulled as being too political, being replaced with a repeat of the American sitcom &quot;Rhoda&quot;.

The sketch with Cleese was broadcast later that year when the final episode of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; went out during the broadcast run of the first series of &quot;Not The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, though the significance of the sketch was lost to some degree. This link is included on the Region 2 DVD boxset of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Basil&#x27;s waiter Manuel, played by Andrew Sachs, also appeared at the end of the unaired episode, trying to get a joke about the Ayatollah&#x27;s contact lenses.

Other sketches of the unaired pilot episode were also lifted or remade on episodes throughout the first series. Healey&#x27;s and Hope&#x27;s impressions were achieved by the use of &quot;talking head&quot; puppets, which in the mid-1980s would become a characteristic staple of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, produced by Lloyd in its early series.

===In production===
Lloyd and Hardie decided to re-cast the series, retaining Langham and Atkinson. They wanted to bring in a woman, but Victoria Wood turned the programme down. Lloyd met Pamela Stephenson at a party, and she agreed to join. Atkinson, Langham, and Stephenson were joined by Mel Smith, who was scheduled to work on the pilot, but declined after reading the script (he called the finished pilot in retrospect &quot;the worst half hour of TV&quot; that he had ever seen). The first series was criticised for being &quot;a poor mix of stand up, and a mild portion of sketches&quot; and newspaper reviews referred to it as &quot;extremely offensive&quot; and that it &quot;should not be allowed on TV&quot;. Ratings were dismal as well: the first episode had fewer than a million viewers.

However, the network controller reportedly liked the programme so much, that a second series of seven episodes was commissioned, also helped by budgetary cuts at BBC, which were repeatedly lampooned in the second series&#x27; premiere episode, entitled &quot;The Outrageously Expensive Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Such cuts also forced the show to drastically reduce the use of outside scenes (which were recorded on film) as well as minor players. The shock value prominent during the first season was also toned down in favour of a more &quot;offbeat&quot; tone.

In February 1980, in between series 1 and series 2 of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, Mel Smith appeared as a news reader named &quot;Reginald Bowes and Cat&quot; in the &quot;Goodies&quot; episode &quot;Animals&quot;. His segment of the show was preceded by the caption &quot;Not the News at Ten&quot;.

For the second series, Langham was replaced by Griff Rhys-Jones, who had already been a regular player during the first series, aside from having directed the radio programme &quot;The Atkinson People&quot;. The second series of &quot;Not the Nine O’Clock News&quot; won the Silver Rose at the Montreux Festival and a BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1982. The show&#x27;s later series achieved improved ratings and became critically acclaimed.

&quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; became a stage production in Oxford and London in 1982, but the main performers decided to end the project while it was a success: Stephenson began a Hollywood film career, Atkinson recorded the first series of &quot;Blackadder&quot; in 1983, and Smith and Jones became a double act in &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;. An American adaptation, &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot; ran for seven years, from 1983 to 1990 on the Home Box Office cable television channel.

===Content===
Satire was a key theme in the series&#x27; comedy. For example, one spoof news element might include a routine announcement that NASA had once again announced a delay in the launch of its Space Shuttle owing to technical difficulties, as the screen showed the shuttle on its launch pad with oxygen streaming off the tanks, overlaid with the sound of a car engine turning over but not starting. An opening graphic featured the same blue screen and white analogue clock ticking down to 9:00 p.m. as preceded the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, followed by an announcement of the time in a similar voice and, in parody, the announcement that this was &quot;definitely &quot;not&quot; the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;&quot;. Skits could include scenes such as a group of rural Americans at a barbecue singing several minutes of comically implausible songs like &quot;I&#x27;m prepared to believe that Nixon wasn&#x27;t a crook; I&#x27;m prepared to believe &quot;Love Story&quot;&#x27;s a readable book...&quot; and finally concluding, &quot;I believe that the devil is ready to repent; – but I can&#x27;t believe Ronald Reagan is president.&quot;

A well-known sketch from the second season (1980) features Mel Smith as Professor Timothy Fielding, who brought a gorilla named Gerald (played by Atkinson) to a TV studio for an interview. Fielding claims that he trained the ape to learn to speak. As the sketch progresses, it turns out that Gerald is amazingly articulate and obviously smarter than Fielding. This leads to a classic exchange, where Fielding claims: &quot;&quot;When I caught Gerald in &#x27;68 he was completely wild.&quot;, whereupon Gerald interrupts: &quot;Wild? I was absolutely livid!&quot;&quot;. 

===Legacy===
The programme is credited with bringing alternative comedy to British television: Lloyd once commented he wanted to do a &quot;modern, working-class&quot; comedy in contrast to other series of the time, such as &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, as well as attempting to replicate the satire boom of the early 1960s that launched the careers of John Cleese, Dudley Moore, Eric Idle, Tim Brooke-Taylor and others. This also happened at a time that the magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, &quot;The Second City&quot; troupes and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; became showcases of alternative comedy in North America.

In 2005, Atkinson, Smith, Stephenson, Langham, and producer Lloyd reunited to talk to Sue MacGregor about the series. Langham&#x27;s departure was touched upon, with Lloyd seeming to take the blame, though Atkinson had campaigned for Langham to be kept in the cast (Langham refused to speak to his former cast mates for several years after he was fired, until appearing as a regular on &quot;Smith and Jones&quot; in the 1990s). &quot;The Reunion&quot; was broadcast on Radio 4 on 31 July 2005.

A documentary featuring the cast reminiscing about the making of the programme was shown on BBC Two on 28 December 2009, before one of the 1995 compilation shows was aired (despite a &quot;complete episode&quot; being billed in television listings). The documentary was repeated on 3 August 2013, just over two weeks after the death of Mel Smith.

==Crew==
The main writers included Colin Bostock-Smith, Andy Hamilton, Peter Brewis, Richard Curtis, and Clive Anderson. However, the producers accepted scripts for sketches from a wide range of writers (including a then-undergraduate Stephen Fry), and ensured the programme remained topical by recording sketches only days before broadcast. Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;) was musical director. Bill Wilson directed the first three series, while Geoff Posner handled the fourth.

==Episodes==
A total of 27 episodes of 25–30-minute duration were broadcast over four series.

Series 1 had been due to start on 2 April 1979, but was postponed due to a general election being called for 3 May, with the programme being deemed &quot;too political&quot;.

The series has rarely been repeated; eight re-cut and condensed (to make it &quot;faster and funnier than ever&quot;) &quot;episodes&quot; made for a video edition in 1995 are shown instead. This is primarily because the original episodes in their entirety lampooned events that were in the news at the time. The last repeat of the show was on Sunday 27 March 2016 at 22:55 on Gold.

==Commercial releases==

===Video and DVD===
Two highly edited VHS releases of the series, entitled &quot;The Gorilla Kinda Lingers&quot; and &quot;Nice Video, Shame about the Hedgehog&quot;, were released in 1995.

In August 2003, these videos were released on DVD under the title of &quot;The Best of Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News: Volume One&quot;, with &quot;The Best of Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News: Volume Two&quot; following a year later. Both of these are available in one set, unavailable separately, in Region 1.

===Records===
Three vinyl albums were released at the time the series was screening, entitled &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;Hedgehog Sandwich&quot;, and &quot;The Memory Kinda Lingers&quot;. These albums were very successful, with the first two both reaching the top ten of the UK albums chart, a rare feat for a spoken word album. &quot;Hedgehog Sandwich&quot; also peaked at number 89 in Australia.

The original version of &quot;The Memory Kinda Lingers&quot; is a double LP. The second disc is titled &quot;Not in Front of the Audience&quot; and is a live recording of the cast&#x27;s stage production. &quot;Hedgehog Sandwich&quot; and the first disc of &quot;The Memory Kinda Lingers&quot; were later combined on a BBC double-length cassette and double-CD set.

&quot;The Ayatollah Song&quot; b/w &quot;Gob on You&quot; (as featured in the TV show) and &quot;I Like Trucking&quot; b/w &quot;Supa Dupa&quot; were also released as singles.

The 1980 single &quot;Typing Pool&quot; by &#x27;Pam and the Paper CClips(EMI 5015), is variously ascribed to Pamela Stephenson and NtNON. It was written by Roger and Nigel Planer, who were among the show&#x27;s many writers.

===Books and miscellaneous===
Three books were released to tie in with the series: &quot;Not! The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, a collection of classic material rewritten and restructured as a parody of the short-lived magazine &quot;Now!&quot;; &quot;Not the Royal Wedding&quot; (the royal wedding in question being the marriage of Charles and Diana); and &quot;Not the General Election&quot;, a tie-in with the 1983 general election. The first was reprinted in 1995 as &quot;Not for Sale&quot;. &quot;Not the Royal Wedding&quot; was promoted by a little-known radio spin-off, &quot;Not the Nuptials&quot;, transmitted on BBC Radio 1. The same station had also previously produced a behind-the-scenes documentary on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; as part of their magazine series &quot;Studio B15&quot;.

Two &quot;page-a-day&quot; tear-off calendars, edited by John Lloyd and containing several contributions from Douglas Adams, were released in the early 1980s (&quot;Not 1982&quot; and &quot;Not 1983&quot;). Also published around this time was a spoof Orwellian edition of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, &quot;Not the 1984 Times&quot;, which – although widely assumed to be – was not connected to the series.

<text>David Adler (January 3, 1882 – September 27, 1949) was an American architect who mostly practiced around Chicago, Illinois. He was prolific throughout his career, designing over 200 buildings in over thirty-five years. He was also a long-time board member of the Art Institute of Chicago.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Adler was born on January 3, 1882 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to a German Jewish family, the son of Isaac David Adler, a prosperous wholesale manufacturer of men&#x27;s clothing, and Therese Hyman Adler. One of David Adler&#x27;s sisters, Frances, became a prominent interior designer. (He also had an older brother, Murray, who died in 1883 of diphtheria.) Adler attended Milwaukee public schools until age 16, when he left Wisconsin to enroll in the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. Adler enrolled at Princeton University in 1900, studying art, architectural history and Greek. At Princeton, Adler designed a remodel for the Charter Club, an upperclassmen&#x27;s eating club.

The source of Adler&#x27;s interest in architecture is uncertain. Adler began illustrating at Lawrenceville, drawing for school publications. He struggled at Princeton, but showed aptitude in his architecture class. After graduating in 1904, he traveled extensively, mostly to study the architecture of Europe. He studied for three semesters at Technische Universität München in Germany. From 1906 to 1911, Adler studied at the École des Beaux-Arts. An avid cyclist, Adler would travel to the countryside of France, Italy, and England to visit country houses and collect picture postcards.

===Career===
After returning to the United States in 1911, he began working as an architect for Howard Van Doren Shaw in Chicago, Illinois. Shaw was considered the foremost architect of country houses in the Chicago area. After six months of study, he opened a new office with a friend from Paris, Henry Dangler, in Orchestra Hall. Together, the pair secured commissions for country estates for William E. Clow, Jr., Ralph Poole, Benjamin Nields, Morris E. Berney, David B. Jones, and Charles B. Pike. However, Adler had never received an architectural license, failing the exam in 1917. Because of this, Dangler had to sign off on Adler&#x27;s drawings because they legally had to be signed by a registered architect.

After Dangler died in 1917, Adler needed to partner with another architect with a structural background who could sign off on his projects. He began working with Robert Work. In 1918, Adler purchased an 1864 farmhouse in Libertyville, Illinois for his estate, and extensively remodeled it. Aspiring architect Paul Schweikher, who would go on to have a significant residential practice of his own, studied under Adler for a year starting in 1923. In 1928, with thirty commissions to his name and support from fellow architects, the state examining board presented Adler with an honorary license.

From this point forward, Adler operated his practice alone. The Roaring Twenties was Adler&#x27;s most prosperous time, but he struggled during the subsequent Great Depression. An injury in 1935 during a fox hunt further slowed Adler. Also that year, Adler met with Jerrod Loebl and John A. Holabird, who were commissioned by the Armour Institute of Technology to find a new head of architecture for the school. Adler recommended Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was eventually selected for the job. Over his career, Adler designed 45 country houses, 27 in the Chicago area.

A number of Adler&#x27;s works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:

===Personal life===
Adler married Katherine Keith, an Illinois socialite and writer, in 1916. In 1925, he was named a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago, a position that he held for the rest of his life. He became a widower in 1930 after his wife was killed in a car accident in Europe. Adler was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1941 and a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1945. Adler died of a heart attack in his sleep, aged 67, in Libertyville. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

Adler&#x27;s religious beliefs are uncertain, although he certainly attempted to appear Protestant. His parents were German Jews. However, at Technische Universität München, Adler identified his beliefs as Episcopalian; this may have been due to the discrimination facing Jews at the time. Adler married Katherine Keith in a Universalist church. Adler&#x27;s father was cremated—a funeral rite that was not sanctioned by the Jewish religion—and interred at a non-denominational cemetery owned by the Episcopal Church. His mother was also buried in a non-denominational cemetery, indicating that his parents may have similarly downplayed their Jewish faith or converted entirely. Adler&#x27;s clientele were mostly Presbyterian and probably would have not knowingly commissioned a non-WASP to design their houses.

<doc id="208446" wikidata="Q358052" url="?curid=208446" title="Adler Planetarium">
<text>The Adler Planetarium is a public museum in Chicago, Illinois, dedicated to astronomy and astrophysics. It was founded in 1930 by local businessman Max Adler. Located on the northeastern tip of Northerly Island on Lake Michigan, the Adler Planetarium was the first planetarium in the United States. It is part of Chicago&#x27;s Museum Campus, which includes the John G. Shedd Aquarium and The Field Museum. The Planetarium&#x27;s mission is to inspire exploration and understanding of the universe.

The Adler Planetarium opened to the public on May 12, 1930. Its architect, Ernest A. Grunsfeld Jr., was awarded the gold medal of the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1931 for its design. In 1987, it was declared a National Historic Landmark.

The Adler has three theaters, space science exhibitions, including the Gemini 12 space capsule, and a collection of antique scientific instruments and print materials. In addition, the Adler Planetarium hosts the Doane Observatory, a research-active public observatory.

The planetarium is surrounded by sculptures including: &quot;Man Enters the Cosmos&quot; by Henry Moore (1980); &quot;Spiral Galaxy&quot; by John David Mooney (1998); and &quot;America&#x27;s Courtyard&quot; by Ary Perez and Denise Milan.

==History of the Adler==

===Establishment===
In 1913, Oskar von Miller of the Deutsches Museum commissioned Carl Zeiss Works to design a mechanism that projects an image of celestial bodies onto a dome. This was achieved by Walther Bauersfeld and the invention became known as a planetarium when it debuted in 1923. Its popularity spread, and by 1929, there were fifteen planetariums in Germany, two in Italy, one in Russia, and one in Austria. Max Adler, a former executive with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in Chicago, Illinois, had recently retired to focus on philanthropic endeavors, primarily on behalf of musical and Jewish communities. However, after listening to a friend describe a Munich planetarium, Adler decided that a planetarium would fit in well within the emerging Museum Campus in Chicago. Adler visited the Munich planetarium with his cousin, architect Ernest Grunsfeld Jr., whom Adler commissioned to design the Chicago structure. He also learned about a sale of astronomical instruments and antiques by W. M. Mensing in Amsterdam, which he purchased the following year. The Mensing Collection became the focus of the Astronomical Museum. Adler offered $500,000 in 1928 for the construction of the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere.

The planetarium was originally considered for the part of the Museum of Science and Industry, an endeavor led by Adler&#x27;s brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald. Rosenwald was determined to convert the former Palace of Fine Arts of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition into a museum but was struggling to manage the many required renovations. 

The delays caused Adler to look elsewhere for a location. The South Park Commissioners, the precursor to the Chicago Park District, had just completed Northerly Island, the first of five intended (but otherwise never executed) recreational islands that were to be consistent with Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 &quot;Plan of Chicago&quot;. The Adler Planetarium and Astronomical Museum opened on Adler&#x27;s birthday, May 12, 1930. The Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Grunsfield a gold medal for his design. The planetarium hosted the 44th meeting of the American Astronomical Society later that year.

===Timeline===
1923 – Walther Bauersfeld, scientific director of the firm of Carl Zeiss in Jena, Germany, designs an optical projection device that effectively creates the illusion of a night sky. With this innovation, the modern planetarium is born.

1928 – Max Adler and architect Ernest Grunsfeld travel to Germany. Adler is so impressed by the modern planetarium that he donates funds to construct the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere.1930 – Max Adler purchases the collection of A. W. Mensing at an auction in Amsterdam. This collection of antique scientific instruments provided the foundation for Adler&#x27;s collection. The Adler Planetarium opened to the public on Max Adler&#x27;s birthday, May 12. Phillip Fox, Ph.D., a professor of astronomy at Northwestern University, is appointed the Planetarium&#x27;s first director.

1933 – The Century of Progress Exposition takes place on what is now the Museum Campus.

1941 – Philip Fox is deployed to the Army; Assistant Director Maude Bennot is appointed acting director of the Planetarium during his absence.

1952 – Max Adler dies.

1967 – The board of trustees is created to share in the responsibilities and management of the Adler Planetarium with the commissioners of the Chicago Park District. The Adler Planetarium refurbishes the building and replaces the original Zeiss projector with a new Mark VI Zeiss unit.

1973 – A new underground expansion opens to the public on May 12, 1973, Adler Planetarium&#x27;s 43rd birthday.

1976 – The Board of Trustees assumes full management responsibility for the planetarium but continues to receive support from the Chicago Park District.

1977 – The Doane Observatory opens.

1991 – The museum unveils the results of the $6.5 million renovation project. After 23 years of leadership, Dr. Joseph M. Chamberlain retires.

1999 – The 60,000 square foot Sky Pavilion, designed by Lohan Associates of Chicago, opens to the public. The addition features four new exhibition galleries, including the historic Atwood Sphere and the Definiti (formerly StarRider) Theater.

2005 – Retired NASA Astronaut James A. Lovell Jr. serves as chairman of Adler&#x27;s 75th-anniversary celebration.

2007 – The Adler unveils its new Space Visualization Laboratory, bringing the latest images of space science to the public.

2010 – The Adler begins transformation of the historic Sky Theater. The renamed Grainger Sky Theater opened in May 2011. At the time, the Grainger was the most technologically advanced dome theater in the world. Thomas Roszak Architecture designed the Clark Family Welcome Gallery using an LED-lit fabric and aluminum structure that includes educational interactive material projected on the fabric walls.

2012 – Paul H. Knappenberger Jr. Ph.D., announces his retirement after 21 years of service.

2013 – The Board of Trustees elects astrophysicist and academic leader Michelle B. Larson, Ph.D., as president and CEO. Dr. Larson becomes the Adler&#x27;s ninth leader and the first female president.

2015 – Major upgrade of the Doane Observatory completed.

==Research==
The Adler Planetarium&#x27;s Astronomy department and Webster Institute for the History of Astronomy conduct and publish research for both the scientific community as well as the general public.

Adler astronomers possess expertise in many areas of astronomy as well as other closely related science fields. Their studies include planetary geology, star formation, gamma-rays, and telescope observing.

Originally founded as the Webster Institute for the History of Astronomy, the Collections department cares for, studies, and interprets the planetarium collections. Since the opening of the Adler, the collection has grown to approximately 8,000 objects, books, works on paper, archival collections, paintings, and photographs. The Adler hosts archives from Derek J. de Solla Price, Michael J. Crowe, and Jim Lovell, as well as the largest collection of historic scientific instruments in the Western Hemisphere.

The Space Visualization Laboratory (SVL) was inaugurated in 2007 to virtually explore the Universe.

The Adler Citizen Science Department is also the U.S. headquarters of The Zooniverse, a citizen science platform and a global collaboration across several institutions that design and build citizen science projects. As of early 2014, the Zooniverse has engaged more than 1.1 million online volunteers as active scientists by discovering planets, mapping the surface of Mars, and detecting solar flares.

Far Horizons is the Adler&#x27;s high-altitude balloon program. Participants design, build, and launch experiments flown to heights above on high-altitude balloons. The program offers real-world opportunities for students and the community to participate in science, mathematics, physics, and engineering challenges.

Opened in 1977, the Doane Observatory is the largest aperture telescope available to the public in the Chicago area. With its diameter mirror, the Doane can gather over 5,000 times more light than an unaided human eye, allowing guests to see celestial objects like the Moon, planets, stars, and galaxies that are trillions of kilometers, if not many light years, away. The original telescope, a Cassegrain reflecting telescope built by the Adler optical and machine shop staff, was retired in 1987 and replaced with the current telescope.

In 2013, the Adler Planetarium undertook the first major renovation of the Doane Observatory. Completed in 2015, renovations included the addition of an indoor classroom, a restroom, accessible entry ramps, and telescope and technology upgrades.

The Adler Planetarium is a member institution of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope project.

==Theaters==
The Adler Planetarium features three domed theaters. The largest, the Grainger Sky Theater, has a dome that measures in diameter. In 2008, when funding for an advanced projection system was being debated in Congress, politician John McCain infamously characterized the upgrade as a new &quot;overhead projector&quot;.

==Programs==

&#x27;Adler After Dark&#x27;, the Adler Planetarium&#x27;s 21+ evening event, was voted &quot;Best After Hours Event&quot; of 2013 by the Chicago Reader and &quot;Best Date Night&quot; by Chicago Parent. Guests at Adler After Dark have open museum access, themed programs, sky shows and views of the Chicago skyline. &#x27;Astro Overnights&#x27; give families a chance to spend a night under the stars at the Adler. Guests have open museum access, a sky show and educational programming. The Astronomy Department at the Adler presents current topics in astronomy through a quarterly lecture series.

The Adler hosts quarterly &#x27;Hack Days&#x27;, intended to encourage software developers, designers, scientists, engineers, artists and people who just like to create and build, to work together to solve problems. Participants at the Adler&#x27;s summer camps build rockets, launch high-altitude balloons, and explore the edge of space. The Adler&#x27;s hands-on summer camps are designed for children ages 5–14.

<text>Dankmar Adler (July 3, 1844 – April 16, 1900) was a German-born American architect and civil engineer. He is best known for his fifteen-year partnership with Louis Sullivan, during which they designed influential skyscrapers that boldly addressed their steel skeleton through their exterior design: the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, Missouri (1891), the Chicago Stock Exchange Building (1894), and the Guaranty Building in Buffalo, New York (1896).

==Early years==
Adler was born in Stadtlengsfeld, Germany; his mother, Sara Eliel, died when he was born. In 1854, he came to the United States with his father Liebman Adler, a rabbi. They took up residence in Detroit, and Liebman became the rabbi of Congregation Beth-El. Subsequently, they moved to Chicago. Adler had some elementary-level education in the City of Detroit, and Ann Arbor, before leaving school to become a draftsman.

==Career==
Adler served in the Union Army during the Civil War with Battery &quot;M&quot;, 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment. He was a private. He did engineering work in the Chattanooga and Atlanta Campaigns.

After the war, he worked as an architect in Chicago, working first with Augustus Bauer and next with Ozias S. Kinney. In 1871, Adler formed a partnership with Edward Burling that ultimately created more than 100 buildings.

Adler eventually started his own firm. He hired Louis Sullivan as a draughtsman and designer in 1880, and made him a partner three years later.

Adler&#x27;s partnership with Sullivan was short-lived; due to a slump in their architectural practice brought on by the Panic of 1893, and Adler&#x27;s desire to bring his two sons into the firm, there arose a rift with Sullivan, the result of which was that Adler left the partnership to join an elevator firm as engineer and salesman. After a short period, Adler returned to architecture, in partnership with his two sons, but never regaining the prominence he had with Sullivan.

Adler and Sullivan&#x27;s Auditorium Building (1889) is an early example of splendid acoustical engineering, as is their Kehilath Anshe Ma&#x27;ariv Synagogue. Both drew upon the fine acoustics in Adler&#x27;s earlier Central Music Hall. Adler was an acclaimed expert in acoustics, yet he was unable to explain fully the excellent acoustic properties of his buildings.

With his partner Burling and thereafter, as a partner in Adler and Sullivan, Adler was instrumental in rebuilding much of Chicago following the Great Chicago Fire. Adler is considered a leader in the Chicago school of architecture. In addition to their pioneering accomplishments with steel-framed buildings and skyscrapers, Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan were early employers and mentors of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, whose consistent praise for Adler (&quot;the &#x27;American Engineer&#x27; my &#x27;Big Chief&#x27;&quot;) surpassed even that which he reserved for Sullivan, whom he called his &quot;lieber meister&quot;.

The last major building Adler designed was Temple Isaiah.

==Personal life==
On June 25, 1872, Adler married Dila Kohn (July 5, 1850 – December 3, 1918). Their children include: Abraham K. Adler (September 13, 1873 – October 30, 1914), Sidney Adler (June 26, 1876 – November 25, 1925) and Sadie Adler (born 1878).

Adler died in Chicago, and is buried there at Mount Mayriv Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Photographs and other archival materials are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Dankmar Adler Collection of letters, papers, and photographs also includes an autobiography.

<text>Workington is a coastal town and civil parish at the mouth of the River Derwent on the west coast in Cumbria, England. At the 2011 census it had a population of 25,207.

==Location==
The town is south-west of Carlisle, north-east of Whitehaven, west of Cockermouth, and south-west of Maryport.

==History==

The area around Workington was long a producer of coal and steel.

Between 79 and 122 CE, Roman forts, mile-forts and watchtowers were built along the Cumbrian coast, as defences against attacks by the Scoti of Ireland and the Caledonii, the most powerful tribe in what is now Scotland. The 16th-century &quot;Britannia&quot;, written by William Camden, describes ruins of these defences.

A Viking sword was discovered at Northside. This is seen to suggest there was a settlement at the river mouth.

The place-name Workington is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 946, as &quot;Wurcingtun&quot;. It appears as &quot;Wirchingetona&quot; in about 1150, meaning &quot;the town or settlement of Weorc or Wirc&#x27;s people&quot;.

Several bridges were damaged or destroyed by the River Derwent during the 2009 Workington floods.

===Regeneration===

In 2006, Washington Square, a £50 million shopping centre and mixed-use complex, was opened to replace the run-down St John&#x27;s Arcade, built in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2007, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors named Washington Square the &quot;best commercial project&quot; in North West England.

Works of public art installed in the town centre include:
*Glass canopies designed by Alexander Beleschenko
*&quot;The Coastline&quot; by Simon Hitchens
*&quot;The Hub&quot; by BASE Structures and Illustrious
*The Grilles architectural metalwork at Central Car Park by Tom Lomax in association with pupils from St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School and Alan Dawson.
*Central Way public toilets with tiles designed in collaboration by ceramic artist Paul Scott and writer Robert Drake, in addition to a fish tank containing species from the Solway provided by the Lake District Coast Aquarium in Maryport by Paul Scott and Robert Drake
*Lookout Clock, an interactive town clock designed by Andy Plant and Matt Wand

While efforts have been made to find local names for the major streets of the new shopping centre, the initial planning title of Washington Square has been retained.

===Workington Stadium plans===
In February 2019 plans for a new stadium for Workington were announced. This would in involve the demolition of Borough Park and Derwent Park.

In June 2019, it was announced by the new leadership of Allerdale Borough Council that a new sports stadium would not be built.

===Cloffocks development===
A plan to build a Tesco Extra store on the Cloffocks provoked controversy and opposition from local people; a planning application was placed in 2006 by Tesco, after it acquired the Cloffocks site for £18 million; Tesco had been competing with Asda for the site since 2003. Campaigners opposed the sale, stating that the land was common ground and belonged to the people of Workington. In 2010 the Countess of Lonsdale invoked her rights to mine the land, in an attempt to prevent the development. In 2011 a closed meeting of Allerdale councillors discussed the sale of the site, but the council rescinded on its decision to sell it to Tesco in June 2011. Tesco stated that it was still seeking a site for a store of around Workington to replace the established one.

===Closure of MEP&#x27;s European Parliament office===
In 2014, North West MEP Julie Ward closed her Workington office and relocated it to Manchester.

==Workington man==
During the 2019 general election, the concept of the &quot;Workington man&quot; was devised by a think tank as a key election target.

In November 2019, Nigel Farage visited Workington to campaign on behalf of the Brexit Party.

==Governance==
The town is part of the parliamentary constituency of Whitehaven and Workington. In the 2024 general election, the Labour Party candidate for Whitehaven and Workington, Josh MacAlister, was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP), with a 31.7 per cent Labour majority by a margin of 13,286 votes. 

Historically it has been a Labour-supporting area, the town had elected a Conservative MP only twice since World War II, at the 1976 by-election and 2019 general election.

Before Brexit, Workington was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency.

For local government purposes, Workington is administered by Cumberland. 

It was formerly covered by the Seaton + Northside, St Michaels, Moorclose + Moss Bay, Harrington + Salterbeck, and St Johns wards on Allerdale Borough Council. The divisions for Cumbria County Council were Seaton, St Michaels, St Johns + Great Clifton,
Moorclose + Moss Bay, and Harrington.

Workington has a parish council: Workington Town Council. The current mayor (2024–2025) is Neil Schofield.

==Geography==
Workington lies astride the River Derwent, on the West Cumbrian coastal plain. It is bounded to the west by the Solway Firth, part of the Irish Sea, and to the east by the Lake District.

The town has various districts, many of them established as housing estates. North of the river these include Seaton, Barepot, Northside, Port and Oldside. On the south side are the districts of Stainburn, Derwent Howe, Ashfield, Banklands, Frostoms (Annie Pit), Mossbay, Moorclose, Salterbeck, Bridgefoot, Lillyhall, Harrington, High Harrington, Clay Flatts, Kerry Park, Westfield and Great Clifton. The Marsh and Quay, a large working-class area of the town around the docks and a major part of the town&#x27;s history, was demolished in the early 1980s. Much of its former area is now covered by Clay Flatts Industrial Estate.
==Economy==
===Iron and steel===

The Cumbria iron-ore field lies to the south of Workington, and produced extremely high grade phosphorus-free haematite. The area had a long tradition of iron smelting, but this became particularly important with the invention by Sir Henry Bessemer of the Bessemer process, the first process for mass production of mild steel, which previously had been an expensive specialist product. For the first 25 years of the process, until Gilchrist and Thomas improved upon it, phosphorus-free haematite was required. With Cumbria as the world&#x27;s premier source, and the local coalfield providing energy for steel production, the world&#x27;s first large-scale steelworks was opened in the Moss Bay area of the town. The Bessemer converter continued to work until July 1974. The Moss Bay Steelworks closed in 1982, despite receiving notable infrastructural investment and improvement almost immediately before the closure.

During the Second World War, a strategically important electric steel furnace which produced steel for aircraft engine ball bearings was moved to Workington from Norway to prevent it falling into Axis hands.

Workington was the home of &quot;Distington Engineering Company&quot; (DEC), the engineering arm of British Steel Corporation (BSC), which specialised in the design of continuous casting equipment. DEC, known to the local people as &quot;Chapel Bank&quot;, had an engineering design office, engineering workshops and a foundry that at one time contained six of the seven electric arc furnaces built in Workington. The seventh was situated at the Moss Bay plant of BSC. In the 1970s, as BSC adapted to a more streamlined approach to the metals industry, the engineering design company was separated from the workshops and foundry and re-designated as Distington Engineering Contracting. Employing some 200 people, its primary purpose was the design, manufacture, installation and commissioning of continuous casting machines. This business is now owned by the TATA Group and employs 400 staff.

One offshoot of the steel industry was the production of railway rails. Workington rails were widely exported and a common local phrase was that Workington rails &quot;held the world together.&quot; Originally made from Bessemer steel, but after the closure of the Moss Bay Steelworks, steel for the plant was brought by rail from Teesside. The plant was closed in August 2006, but welding work on rails produced at Corus Groups&#x27; French plant in Hayange continued at Workington for another two years, as the Scunthorpe site initially proved incapable of producing rails adequately.

===After coal and steel===
After the loss of the two industries on which Workington was built, coal and steel, Workington and the whole of West Cumbria became an unemployment blackspot. Industries in the town today include chemicals, cardboard, the docks (originally built by the United Steel Co.), waste management and recycling old computers for export, mainly to poorer countries. The town also houses the British Cattle Movement Service, a government agency set up to oversee the British beef and dairy industry after the BSE crisis in Britain. It is based in the former steelworks offices. Many Workington residents are employed outside the town in the nuclear industry located in and around Sellafield, West Cumbria&#x27;s dominant employment sector.

===Vehicle Manufacture===

British Leyland opened a factory in Lillyhall, just outside Workington, initially to build the Leyland National bus in the 1970s and 1980s. Produced primarily for the state-owned National Bus Company, the Leyland National was styled by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti, and included a roof-mounted heating unit in a pod at the rear of the bus. The Lillyhall factory later built the Leyland Titan, Leyland Olympian and Leyland Lynx buses.

In the 1980s, Leyland manufactured Pacer railbus and Sprinter-type commuter trains at Workington. The bodyshells of the Pacer trains were based on the Leyland National bus design, designed as a cheap stop-gap by British Rail.

Volvo Buses acquired Leyland Buses in 1988. By 1993, the factory had closed with the loss of 200 jobs. The former bus plant is now a warehouse for the logistics company Eddie Stobart, which bought the property in 1995.

==Transport==
Workington is linked by the A596 road to Maryport, to Whitehaven via A595 road, by the A66 road to Penrith and continues to Scotch Corner in County Durham. The town has its own bus station and bus services to other towns and villages in Cumbria, such as Cockermouth, Keswick, Penrith, Carlisle, Wigton, Maryport, Whitehaven, Frizington, Egremont and Thornhill.

The Cumbrian Coast line provides rail connections from to and , with occasional through trains to Lancaster and Preston.

Workington North railway station opened on 30 November 2009 as a temporary means of crossing the river after road bridges had been closed by flooding. A free train service between Workington (Main) and Maryport was funded by the government.

The Workington Transport Heritage Trust, preserves the transport heritage of Workington and the surrounding area and is run by volunteers.

Workington was the headquarters of the haulage company J. Roper (Workington) Ltd, which was based in Moss Bay.

Workington is also home to the headquarters of family haulage business J.R Dixon Ltd

==Arts and entertainment==

Workington is home to three theatres: the Carnegie Theatre, Theatre Royal and Workington Opera House. In the past Workington was a big town for variety acts and theatre and hosted many top acts including Tommy Cooper and Shirley Bassey. Workington Opera House also hosted many circus shows that included elephants and other circus animals performing on stage.

The Carnegie Theatre and Theatre Royal are still open and put on performances all year round. The Workington Opera House is currently closed after its last use as a bingo hall. The &quot;Opera Action&quot; group plans to restore it as a working theatre.

The town once had four cinemas (the Carnegie, the Hippodrome, the Oxford and the Ritz), all now closed. There remains only the Parkway Cinema at Dunmail Park. During the 1950s, films were also shown at the Opera House.

===Cultural festivals===
On 19 September 2009, Valentine Rock took place; a 19-band charity music festival. It was staged at the Ernest Valentine Ground home of Workington Cricket Club. Artists included The , Novellos, With Lights Out, Volcanoes, Breed, Colt 45, Relics, Telf, Thir13een, Slagbank, Hangin&#x27; Threads and Hand of Fate. Profits went to the RNLI and West Cumberland Lions.

In 2008, the Paint Your Town Red Festival invited Liverpool comic and actor Ricky Tomlinson. Described as &#x27;The biggest free festival in Workington&#x27;s history&#x27;, the 2008 festival included a free children&#x27;s fun fair in Vulcan Park and stage and street entertainment. Attractions included &quot;Jimmy James and his Soul Explosion&quot;, &quot;Dearham Band&quot; and the all-female band &quot;Irresistible&quot;. Keswick&#x27;s &quot;Cars of the Stars&quot; museum provided a stunt driving display.
==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Caldbeck and local relay transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland on 102.2 FM and Workington Academy Radio, a student based radio station that broadcast to the Workington Academy. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Times &amp; Star. 

==Sport==
===Uppies and Downies===
Workington is home to the ball game known as Uppies and Downies, a traditional version of football with medieval origins in mob football or an even earlier form. Since 2001, matches have raised over £75,000 for local charities. An Uppies and Downies ball is made from four pieces of cow leather. It is in circumference and weighs about . Only three hand-made balls are produced every year and each is dated.

===Football===

The town has a football team, Workington A.F.C., with its stadium at Borough Park. Formerly a professional football team it now competes as a non-League club. &quot;Dronnies&quot;, a group of steel workers that had migrated to the town from Dronfield, Derbyshire, formed the nucleus of the original Workington F.C. in 1888. It was one of the first teams managed by Bill Shankly.

Workington A.F.C. was replaced in the Football League by Wimbledon F.C. in 1977.

===Rugby League===

The town has a semi-professional rugby league team, Workington Town, based at Derwent Park Fibrus Community Stadium.

===Rugby Union===

Workington is the home to the rugby union team Workington Zebras, which plays its matches on the Ellis Sports Ground.

===Bowling===
There are two bowling greens, one in Vulcan Park and another on High Cloffocks, south of the River Derwent. Teams and individuals from both greens compete in local, regional and national competitions.

===Golf===
Workington&#x27;s first golf club appeared in 1893 and played north of the River Derwent near Siddick. Known as West Cumberland Golf Club, it used a nine-hole course until the First World War, when it closed. After the war the club formed again as Workington Golf Club and moved to the present Hunday Wood location. Five-times Open Champion and renowned course architect James Braid was consulted on the layout. Considered &quot;one of the premier courses in Cumbria&quot;, it was influenced in the 1950s by F. G. Hawtree and by Howard Swan today.

===Speedway===

Workington Comets are the town&#x27;s professional speedway team, which competes in the British Speedway Premier League.

Before World War II racing was staged at Lonsdale Park, next to Borough Park, on the banks of the River Derwent. The sport did not return to the town until 1970. In 1987, Derwent Park was a temporary home to the Glasgow Tigers, which briefly became the Workington Tigers before withdrawing from the league. Speedway returned to Workington, and the team has operated with varying degrees of success, but in 2008 it won the Young Shield and the Premier League Four-Team and Pairs Championships. An academy team under the banner of Northside Stars, develops young riders who show potential at the Northside training track and may make future first teams.

===Cricket===

Workington Cricket Club plays at the Ernest Valentine Ground, on the High Cloffock near the River Derwent and the town centre. It is a thriving club with three senior teams and a growing junior section putting out six teams. It is affiliated to Cumbria Cricket League, Cumbria Cricket Board, Cumbria Junior Cricket League and the West Allerdale &amp; Copeland Cricket Association.

Cumbria Cricket Board Open Courses are led by coaches at the town&#x27;s Stainburn School. These are open to Years 4–10 pupils.

===Angling===
Workington and District Sea Angling Club takes part in regular monthly matches. It meets every month in the Union Jack Club, Senhouse Street, Workington. It also arranges tuition for its anglers.

Freshwater anglers are active on local rivers, especially the River Derwent.

===Athletics===
Workington has opportunities for track and field, triathlon, road running, cross-country, fell running and orienteering. All of its schools and clubs are affiliated to the Cumbria Athletics Association, except orienteering which is organised through its own national federation. Athletes tend to join clubs which concentrate on their particular discipline. Cumberland Fell Runners; Cumberland Athletics Club; Derwent and West Cumberland AC; Seaton Athletics Club; Workington Zebras AC and West Cumberland Orienteering Club are the most popular at present.

Primary schools have a well organised inter-school programme. Secondary schools focus especially on the Allerdale District School&#x27;s Championships, which lead on to the Cumbria Schools Championships. The results of Cumbria&#x27;s championships guide selection of the county teams to compete in the English Schools Athletic Association Championships. Over the years, Workington athletes have earned English Schools Championship honours.

===Motorbike road riding===
There is a Cumbria Coalition of Motorcycle Clubs. The West Cumbrian motorcycle club, the Roadburners, was established in 1989 and regularly features at local and national motorbike rallies and charity road runs. It welcomes new members interested in multi-cylinder machines. The National Chopper Club also has some local members.

<text>Filoviridae () is a family of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Two members of the family that are commonly known are Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Both viruses, and some of their lesser known relatives, cause severe disease in humans and nonhuman primates in the form of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

All filoviruses are classified by the US as select agents, by the World Health Organization as Risk Group 4 Pathogens (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as Category A Priority Pathogens, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Category A Bioterrorism Agents, and are listed as Biological Agents for Export Control by the Australia Group.

==Use of term==
The family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; is a virological taxon that was defined in 1982 and emended in 1991, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2011. The family currently includes the six virus genera &quot;Cuevavirus&quot;, &quot;Dianlovirus&quot;, &quot;Ebolavirus&quot;, &quot;Marburgvirus, Striavirus,&quot; and &quot;Thamnovirus&quot; and is included in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. The members of the family (i.e. the actual physical entities) are called filoviruses or filovirids. The name &quot;Filoviridae&quot; is derived from the Latin noun &quot;filum&quot; (alluding to the filamentous morphology of filovirions) and the taxonomic suffix &quot;-viridae&quot; (which denotes a virus family).

===Note===
According to the rules for taxon naming established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the name &quot;Filoviridae&quot; is always to be capitalized, italicized, never abbreviated, and to be preceded by the word &quot;family&quot;. The names of its members (filoviruses or filovirids) are to be written in lower case, are not italicized, and used without articles.

==Life cycle==
The filovirus life cycle begins with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or RNA replicase) partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Filovirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3&#x27; end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3&#x27; end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5&#x27; end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.

==Family inclusion criteria==

A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; is a member of the family &quot;Filoviridae&quot; if:
* it causes viral hemorrhagic fever in certain primates
* it infects primates, pigs or bats in nature
* it needs to be adapted through serial passage to cause disease in rodents
* it exclusively replicates in the cytoplasm of a host cell
* it has a genome ≈19 kbp in length
* it has an RNA genome that constitutes ≈1.1% of the virion mass
* its genome has a molecular weight of ≈4.2
* its genome contains one or more gene overlaps
* its genome contains seven genes in the order 3&#x27;-UTR-&quot;NP&quot;-&quot;VP35&quot;-&quot;VP40&quot;-&quot;GP&quot;-&quot;VP30&quot;-&quot;VP24&quot;-&quot;L&quot;-5&#x27;-UTR
* its &quot;VP24&quot; gene is not homologous to genes of other mononegaviruses
* its genome contains transcription initiation and termination signals not found in genomes of other mononegaviruses
* it forms nucleocapsids with a buoyant density in CsCl of ≈1.32 g/cm3
* it forms nucleocapsids with a central axial channel (≈10–15 nm in width) surrounded by a dark layer (≈20 nm in width) and an outer helical layer (≈50 nm in width) with a cross striation (periodicity of ≈5 nm)
* it expresses a class I fusion glycoprotein that is highly &quot;N&quot;- and &quot;O&quot;-glycosylated and acylated at its cytoplasmic tail
* it expresses a primary matrix protein that is not glycosylated
* it forms virions that bud from the plasma membrane
* it forms virions that are predominantly filamentous (U- and 6-shaped) and that are ≈80 nm in width, and several hundred nm and up to 14 μm in length
* it forms virions that have surface projections ≈7 nm in length spaced ≈10 nm apart from each other
* it forms virions with a molecular mass of ≈3.82; an S20W of at least 1.40; and a buoyant density in potassium tartrate of ≈1.14 g/cm3
* it forms virions that are poorly neutralized &quot;in vivo&quot;

==Family organization==
==Phylogenetics==
The mutation rates in these genomes have been estimated to be between 0.46 × 10−4 and 8.21 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The most recent common ancestor of sequenced filovirus variants was estimated to be 1971 (1960–1976) for Ebola virus, 1970 (1948–1987) for Reston virus, and 1969 (1956–1976) for Sudan virus, with the most recent common ancestor among the four species included in the analysis (Ebola virus, Tai Forest virus, Sudan virus, and Reston virus) estimated at 1000–2100 years. The most recent common ancestor of the Marburg and Sudan species appears to have evolved 700 and 850 years before present respectively. Although mutational clocks placed the divergence time of extant filoviruses at ~10,000 years before the present, dating of orthologous endogenous elements (paleoviruses) in the genomes of hamsters and voles indicated that the extant genera of filovirids had a common ancestor at least as old as the Miocene (~16–23 million or so years ago).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cite doi| 10.7717/peerj.556&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Filoviridae cladogram is the following:
==Paleovirology==
Paleoviral elements are known from each of the four main divergent clades of filoviruses. While orthologous elements in mammal genomes support a minimum age for filoviruses of tens of million of years, the existence of filoviruses and their elements in divergent lineages of fishes suggests that the virus family is hundreds of millions of years old. Paleoviruses that appear to be derived from filovirus-like viruses have been identified in the genomes of many small-bodied species including bats, rodents, shrews, tenrecs, tarsiers, marsupials and fishes. Although most filovirus-like elements appear to be pseudogenes, evolutionary and structural analyses suggest that orthologs isolated from several species of the bat genus &quot;Myotis&quot; and the rodent family Spalacidae have been maintained by selection. 

==Vaccines==
There are presently very limited vaccines for known filovirus. An effective vaccine against EBOV, developed in Canada, was approved for use in 2019 in the US and Europe. Similarly, efforts to develop a vaccine against Marburg virus are under way.

==Mutation concerns and pandemic potential==
There has been a pressing concern that a very slight genetic mutation to a filovirus such as EBOV could result in a change in transmission system from direct body fluid transmission to airborne transmission, as was seen in Reston virus (another member of genus Ebolavirus) between infected macaques. A similar change in the current circulating strains of EBOV could greatly increase the infection and disease rates caused by EBOV. However, there is no record of any Ebola strain ever having made this transition in humans.

The Department of Homeland Security’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center considers the risk of a mutated Ebola virus strain with aerosol transmission capability emerging in the future as a serious threat to national security and has collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to design methods to detect EBOV aerosols.

<text>USA Today (often stylized in all caps) is an American daily middle-market newspaper and news broadcasting company. Founded by Al Neuharth in 1980 and launched on September 14, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett&#x27;s corporate headquarters in New York, NY.
Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper&#x27;s dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.

As of 2023, &quot;USA Today&quot; has the fifth-largest print circulation in the United States, with 132,640 print subscribers. It has two million digital subscribers, the fourth-largest online circulation of any U.S. newspaper.

&quot;USA Today&quot; is distributed in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and an international edition is distributed in Asia, Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Islands.

==History==
===20th century===
&quot;USA Today&quot; was first conceived on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as &quot;Project NN&quot; met with the then-chairman of Gannett, Al Neuharth, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Early regional prototypes of &quot;USA Today&quot; included &quot;East Bay Today&quot;, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, an afternoon newspaper that Gannett owned at the time. On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback. Gannett&#x27;s board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled &quot;USA Today&quot;, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett&#x27;s chief executive officer.

Gannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. &quot;USA Today&quot; began publishing on September 14, 1982, initially in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas, for a newsstand price of 25¢ (equivalent to ¢ in ). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected.
The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a spot color format. The paper&#x27;s overall style and elevated use of graphics—developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Brya—were derided by critics, who referred to it as a &quot;McPaper&quot; or &quot;television you can wrap fish in&quot;, because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of television news, rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of content. Although &quot;USA Today&quot; had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.

Gannett invested in an expensive network of printing factories and distribution during the rollout of &quot;USA Today&quot;, meaning that the paper could be printed and distributed quickly. One of the results of this was &quot;USA Today&quot; having the luxury of a later time cutoff for journalists to submit stories, such that the paper was able to include sports scores from games that finished late in the next morning&#x27;s paper. The sports section of &quot;USA Today&quot;, with its complete set of results, was well-regarded and generally seen as one of the main selling points of the paper.

On July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from predominantly black-and-white to full-color photography and graphics in all four sections. The following week, on July 10, &quot;USA Today&quot; launched an international edition intended for U.S. readers abroad, followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to Singapore. On April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page section called &quot;Baseball &#x27;85&quot;, which previewed the 1985 Major League Baseball season.

By the fourth quarter of 1985, &quot;USA Today&quot; had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4 million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5 million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, &quot;USA Today&quot; began production of its international edition in Switzerland. &quot;USA Today&quot; operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233 million after taxes. According to figures released by Gannett in July 1987, the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett&#x27;s corporate revenue projections.

On January 29, 1988, &quot;USA Today&quot; published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing Super Bowl XXII; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its Labor Day weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, &quot;USA Today&quot; launched a third international printing site, based in Hong Kong. The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics, selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.

By July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that &quot;USA Today&quot; had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6 million, an all-time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 1, 1991, &quot;USA Today&quot; launched a fourth print site for its international edition in London for the United Kingdom and the British Isles. The international edition&#x27;s schedule was changed as of April 1, 1994, to Monday through Friday, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, &quot;USA Today&quot; opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and Moscow in 1996.

On April 17, 1995, &quot;USA Today&quot; launched its website to provide real-time news coverage; in June 2002, the site expanded to include a section providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth international publishing site was launched in Frankfurt, Germany, to print and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.

On October 4, 1999, &quot;USA Today&quot; began running advertisements on its front page for the first time. In 2017, some pages of USA Today&#x27;s website features Auto-Play functionality for video or audio-aided stories.

===21st century===
On February 8, 2000, Gannett launched &quot;USA Today Live&quot;, a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture also provided integration with the &quot;USA Today&quot; website, which transitioned from a text-based format to feature audio and video clips of news content.

The paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in Milan, Italy, followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing facility in Charleroi, Belgium.

In 2001, two interactive units were launched: on June 19, &quot;USA Today&quot; and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network (now Careers.com), a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the September 11 attacks. That November, &quot;USA Today&quot; migrated its operations from Gannett&#x27;s previous corporate headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to the company&#x27;s next headquarters in nearby McLean. The company moved its headquarters to New York, NY in 2024.
In 2004, Jack Kelley, a senior foreign correspondent for USA Today, was found to have fabricated foreign news reports over the past decade. Kelley resigned.

On December 12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of the online and print entities of &quot;USA Today&quot;, with USAToday.com&#x27;s vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson promoted to co-executive editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.

In December 2010, &quot;USA Today&quot; launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of all types.

===Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks===
On August 27, 2010, &quot;USA Today&quot; announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms (including USAToday.com and its related mobile applications) and launch of a new publication called &quot;USA Today Sports&quot;.

On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new sans-serif font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories (replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000); an updated &quot;Newsline&quot; feature featuring larger, &quot;newsier&quot; headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of mastheads and white space to present a cleaner style.

===2012 redesign===

On September 14, 2012, &quot;USA Today&quot; underwent the first major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper&#x27;s first edition. Developed in conjunction with brand design firm Wolff Olins, the print edition of &quot;USA Today&quot; added a page covering technology stories, expanded travel coverage within the Life section, and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements. The &quot;globe&quot; logo used since the paper&#x27;s inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day&#x27;s top stories.

The paper&#x27;s website was also extensively overhauled using a new, in-house content management system known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout. The site was designed and developed to be more interactive, faster, provide &quot;high impact&quot; advertising units (known as Gravity), and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate &quot;USA Today&quot; content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett Digital migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform. Developers built a separate platform to provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices. The Gravity ad won Digiday&#x27;s Best Publishing Innovation in Advertising in 2016, thanks to an 80% full-watch user engagement rate on desktop, and 96% on mobile.

Following the relaunch, the editorial team behind &quot;USA Today&quot; Investigations ramped up its &quot;longread&quot; article plans, following the success of the series &quot;Ghost Factories&quot;. With differing platform requirements, &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; mobile website did not offer any specialized support for these multi-chapter stories. Nearing the end of 2012, more than one-third of &quot;USA Today&quot; readership was browsing only using their mobile phones, and the majority of these users were accessing the mobile website (as opposed to the iOS and Android applications) with the newer, less-obtrusive advertising strategy. Gannet Digital designed, developed, and released the longread mobile experience to coincide with the launch of Brad Heath&#x27;s series &quot;Locked Up&quot;, which won the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award in October 2013.

Gannett Digital&#x27;s focus on its mobile content experience paid off in 2012 with multiple awards; including the Eppy for Best Mobile Application, the Mobile Excellence award for Best User Experience, the MOBI award for Editorial Content, and Mobile Publisher of the Year.

The &quot;USA Today&quot; site design was launched on desktop, mobile and TV throughout 2013 and 2014, although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design.

===Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring===
On October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of &quot;USA Today&quot; (part of what was internally known within Gannett as the &quot;Butterfly&quot; initiative) for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers – &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;, the &quot;Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle&quot;, the Fort Myers-based &quot;The News-Press&quot; and the Appleton, Wisconsin-based &quot;The Post-Crescent&quot;. The launch of the syndicated insert caused &quot;USA Today&quot; to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of &quot;USA Today&quot; in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the Palm Springs, California-based &quot;The Desert Sun&quot; and the Lafayette, Louisiana-based &quot;Advertiser&quot; being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing &quot;positive feedback&quot; to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the Alliance for Audited Media to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of &quot;USA Today&quot;.

On January 4, 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; acquired the consumer product review website Reviewed. In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett launched a condensed &quot;USA Today&quot; insert into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort to shore up circulation after it regained its position as the highest-circulated weekday newspaper in the United States in October 2013. On September 3, 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations. In October 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; and OpenWager Inc. entered into a partnership to release a Bingo mobile app called USA Today Bingo Cruise.

On December 3, 2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between &quot;USA Today&quot; and the company&#x27;s 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national scale. The &quot;Courier Journal&quot; had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the Louisville, Kentucky-based newspaper; Gannett&#x27;s other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the Journal Media Group, gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network (foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) through early January 2016.

In the late 2010s, as the print run declined, Gannett pulled back from the extensive and expensive distribution network, opting to have shorter deadlines, and printing the remaining copies from fewer facilities while potentially trucking them longer distances to still be available in the morning.

In May 2021, &quot;USA Today&quot; introduced a paywall for some of its online stories.

On June 16, 2022, it was reported that &quot;USA Today&quot; removed 23 articles written by journalist Gabriela Miranda after an inquiry related to one of her articles triggered an internal investigation and found that Miranda had fabricated sources on articles pertaining to the Texas Heartbeat Act, Ukrainian women&#x27;s issues due to the Russian invasion, and an article on sunscreen. Miranda resigned.

==Layout and format==

In the main edition of the paper circulated in the United States and Canada, each edition consists of four sections: News (the &quot;front page&quot; section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been split into two sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled &quot;Weekend&quot;; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, film reviews and trends, and a travel supplement called &quot;Destinations &amp; Diversions&quot; (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one, and Sports and Life in the other.

The paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition. &quot;USA Today&quot; has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past: the first issue released during the standard calendar weekend was published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday &quot;Extra&quot; edition updating coverage of the Gulf War from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the 1996 Summer Olympics. &quot;USA Today&quot; prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section, with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section, will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.

Each section is differentiated by a certain color in a box on the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper&#x27;s early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot colors, as the presses used at &quot;USA Today&quot;″s printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections. Orange is used for bonus sections (sections E+), which are published occasionally for business travel trends and the Olympics. Other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA basketball tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but later changed to the regular sports red in their sports bonus sections. To strengthen their association with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Gannett incorporated the &quot;USA Today&quot; color scheme into a standardized broadcast graphics package that was phased in across its television station group (which was spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna) starting in late 2012. The package used the color scheme in a rundown graphic on most stations, persisting throughout their newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics.

Unlike other papers, the left-hand quarter of each section are &quot;reefers&quot; (front-page paragraphs &quot;referring&quot; to stories on inside pages), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside. The lead reefer is the cover page feature &quot;Newsline&quot;, which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, &quot;USA Today&quot; cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps of the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world. Temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as &quot;t&quot; for thunderstorms, referencing the expected weather conditions. The colorized forecast map was created by staff designer George Rorick (who left &quot;USA Today&quot; for a similar position at &quot;The Detroit News&quot; in 1986) and was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges. National precipitation maps for the next three days (the next five days before the 2012 redesign) and four-day forecasts and air quality indexes for 36 major U.S. cities (16 cities prior to 1999), with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map, are also featured. Weather data is provided by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for &quot;USA Today&quot; for most of the paper&#x27;s existence (except from January 2002 to September 2012, when forecast data was provided by The Weather Channel through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett). In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is &quot;Weather Focus&quot;, a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.

On business holidays or days when bonus sections are included in the issue, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising is often covered in the Monday Money section, with a review of a recent television ad, and after Super Bowl Sunday, a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the &quot;Ad Track&quot; live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and another for companies trading on NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers. 

Book coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart which debuted on October 28, 1994, is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the full A.C. Nielsen television ratings chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the Mediabase survey for several genres of music based on radio airplay on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations as its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life, which provides prime time and late night listings (running from 8:00 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time), incorporates boilerplate &quot;Local news&quot; or &quot;Local programming&quot; descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW) cede airtime to allow their owned and affiliated stations to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts. The television page has never carried local scheduling information similar to those in local newspapers. Like most national papers, &quot;USA Today&quot; has no comic strips. 

One of the staples of the News section is &quot;Across the USA&quot;, a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length Associated Press reports highlighting one story in each state, the District of Columbia, and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the &quot;For the Record&quot; page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for the previous four days of league play plus individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for that day&#x27;s games) previously featured a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi-state lotteries. 

Some traditions have been retained. The lead story still appears on the upper-right side of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But &quot;USA Today&quot; is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a newsstand. The overall design and layout of &quot;USA Today&quot; have been described as neo-Victorian.

On most of the sections&#x27; front pages, in the lower left-hand corner, are &quot;USA Today Snapshots&quot; graphs, which offer statistics on lifestyle interests according to the section (for example, a snapshot in &quot;Life&quot; could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon their mood). These &quot;Snapshots&quot; graphs employ icons roughly pertaining to the graph&#x27;s subject (using the example above, the graph&#x27;s bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). Snapshots are loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source in fine print below the graph). 

The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called &quot;Open Air&quot;, which launched on March 7, 2008, and appears several times a year. Other advertorials appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.

===Opinion section===
The opinion section prints &quot;USA Today&quot; editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors, letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the &quot;USA Today&quot; editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view: alongside the editorial board&#x27;s piece on the day&#x27;s topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field. The Board of Contributors, which is distinct from the paper&#x27;s news staff, chooses the opinion pieces that appear in each edition.

From 1999 to 2002 and again from 2004 to 2015, the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding. Other members of the editorial board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry. The newspaper&#x27;s website calls this group &quot;demographically and ideologically diverse&quot;.

Beginning with the 1984 United States presidential election, &quot;USA Today&quot; did not endorse candidates for the President of the United States or any other state or federal political office, a policy which has been re-evaluated during each four-year election cycle by the paper&#x27;s Board of Contributors through an independent process, with any decision to override the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board&#x27;s members dissent or hold differing opinions. For most of its history, the paper&#x27;s political editorials (most of them linked to the presidential election cycle) had focused instead on major issues based on the differing concerns of voters. 

The avoidance of political editorials played a great part in &quot;USA Today&quot; long-standing reputation for &quot;fluff&quot;, but after its 30th anniversary revamp, the paper took a more active stance on political issues, calling for stronger gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. It heavily criticized the Republican Party for both the 2013 government shutdown and the 2015 revolts in the United States House of Representatives that ended with the resignation of John Boehner as House Speaker. It also called out then-President Barack Obama and other top members of the Democratic Party for what it perceived as &quot;inaction&quot; during 2013–14, particularly over the NSA scandal and the ISIL beheading incidents.

The editorial board broke from its &quot;non-endorsement&quot; policy for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of Republican nominee Donald Trump, calling him &quot;unfit for the presidency&quot; due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at the press, with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, CNN and the BBC, military veterans who had been prisoners of war, including 2008 Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran John McCain, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his &quot;checkered&quot; business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he had made during his campaign and criticisms by both Democrats and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to &quot;resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue&quot;. The board wrote that the piece was not a &quot;qualified endorsement&quot; of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for whom it was unable to reach a consensus (some editorial board members expressed that Clinton&#x27;s public service record would help her &quot;serve the nation ably as its president&quot;, while others had &quot;serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and... extreme carelessness in handling classified information&quot;), suggesting instead tactical voting against Trump and GOP seats in swing states, advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein or a write-in candidate for president; or to focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.

In February 2018, &quot;USA Today&quot; published an op-ed by Jerome Corsi, the DC bureau chief for the fringe conspiracy website InfoWars. Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist, was described by &quot;USA Today&quot; as an &quot;author&quot; and &quot;investigative journalist&quot;. Corsi was a prominent proponent of the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, and Infowars has promoted conspiracy theories such as 9/11 being an &quot;inside job&quot;.

In October 2018, &quot;USA Today&quot; was criticized by NBC News for publishing an editorial by President Trump that was replete with inaccuracies. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; fact-checker said that &quot;almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.&quot;

In 2020, &quot;USA Today&quot; endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The newspaper also published an opposing editorial by Vice President Mike Pence, which called for his and Trump&#x27;s re-election.

In 2024 after the presidential election, opinion fellow for USA Today Dace Potas published: Trump is president again and Democrats can blame Biden&#x27;s ego.

&quot;USA Today&quot; was the only one of 42 prominent American daily newspapers rated as &quot;moderate&quot; by the Boston University Library (all the others were rated as &quot;leans liberal&quot; or &quot;leans conservative&quot;), based on their editorial endorsements in the 2012 presidential election.

==Personnel==

In May 2012, Larry Kramer, a 40-year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media, was appointed president and publisher of &quot;USA Today&quot;, replacing David Hunke, who had been publisher of the newspaper since 2009. Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.

In July 2012, Kramer hired David Callaway, whom he had hired as lead editor of &quot;MarketWatch&quot; in 1999, two years after Kramer founded that website, as the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Callaway had previously worked at Bloomberg News covering banking, investment-banking, and asset management businesses throughout Europe, and at the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, where he co-wrote a daily financial column on &quot;comings and goings in the Boston business district&quot;.

The editor-in-chief is Caren Bohan

===&quot;USA Weekend&quot;===

USA Weekend was a sister publication that launched in 1953 as &quot;Family Weekly&quot;, a national Sunday magazine supplement intended for the Sunday editions of U.S. newspapers. It adopted its final title following Gannett&#x27;s purchase of the magazine in 1985. The magazine was distributed to approximately 800 newspapers nationwide at its peak, with most Gannett-owned local newspapers carrying it by default within their Sunday editions. It focused on social issues, entertainment, health, food and travel. On December 5, 2014, Gannett announced the end of &quot;USA Weekend&quot; after the December 26–28, 2014 edition, citing increasing operational costs and reduced advertising revenue. Most of its participating newspapers replaced it with the competing Sunday magazine &quot;Parade&quot;.

===&quot;USA Today Sports Weekly&quot;===

USA Today Sports Weekly is a weekly magazine that covers news and statistics from Major League Baseball, Minor League Baseball, NCAA baseball, the National Football League (NFL), and NASCAR. It debuted on April 5, 1991, as &quot;USA Today Baseball Weekly&quot;, a tabloid-sized publication published weekly on Wednesdays during the baseball season and bi-weekly during the off-season. The magazine expanded its sports coverage on September 4, 2002, adopting a general title after adding stories about the NFL. &quot;Sports Weekly&quot; added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, which lasted only through that year&#x27;s race season. It added coverage of NCAA college football on August 8, 2007. The editorial operations of &quot;Sports Weekly&quot; operated independently from &quot;USA Today&quot; until being integrated into the newspaper&#x27;s sports department in late 2005.

===The Big Lead===

The Big Lead is a sports blog operated by &quot;USA Today&quot; that was launched in February 2006 by Fantasy Sports Ventures, co-founded by Jason McIntyre and David Lessa. In April 2008, the blog established a strategic content and marketing partnership with Gannett. Gannett purchased The Big Lead in January 2012. The site is usually updated 10 to 15 times per day between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. It mainly covers sports, but also provides news and commentary on other news topics, ranging from politics to pop culture.

===&quot;USA Today: The Television Show&quot;===
In 1987, Gannett and producer/former NBC CEO Grant Tinker began developing a news magazine series for broadcast syndication that attempted to bring the breezy style of &quot;USA Today&quot; to television. The result was &quot;USA Today: The Television Show&quot; (later &quot;USA Today on TV&quot;, then shortened to simply &quot;USA Today&quot;), which premiered on September 12, 1988. Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus, Robin Young, Boyd Matson, Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper, the show was divided into four &quot;sections&quot; corresponding to the respective parts of the paper: News (the major headlines), Money (financial news and consumer reports), Sports (sports news and scores) and Life (entertainment and lifestyle stories). The series was syndicated by GTG Marketing, a subsidiary of GTG Entertainment, which promoted it as a prime access magazine show, hoping that stations would air it in a prime time slot.

Throughout its run, the series received poor reviews and low ratings. From the beginning, there was concern. After one week, Henry Siegel, owner of LBS Communications, called the show a &quot;calamity&quot; and among the most disastrous debuts in syndication history. The program also suffered from being scheduled in poor timeslots in certain markets, like New York City, the country&#x27;s largest media market, where WCBS-TV aired the program at 2:05 a.m., dragging down the national ratings, before canceling it in February 1989. It was then picked up by WNBC; after airing in the equally weak 5:30 a.m. slot, the series was moved to the more clear-eyed 9:30 a.m., but fared no better (in contrast, CITY-DT in Toronto ran it at 5:00 p.m.). Other stations quickly canceled or downgraded the program&#x27;s airings as it became clear that it was a dud; the original executive producer was fired and the show retooled with Magnus and Macatee as anchors and a new on-air look and sound. The series was renewed for a second season, but the setbacks led to the mid-season cancellation of the TV version of &quot;USA Today&quot; in November 1989, after one-and-a-half seasons. The final edition aired on January 7, 1990. The cancellation, a $13 million loss for GTG, was believed to make the show the costliest failure in syndication history.

Gannett announced plans to develop a &quot;USA Today&quot;-branded weekly half-hour television program titled &quot;Sports Page&quot; as part of a renewed initiative to extend the brand into television, but this program, planned for fall 2004, never launched.

===&quot;VRtually There&quot;===
&quot;VRtually There&quot; was a weekly virtual reality news program produced by the USA Today Network, which debuted on October 20, 2016. The program, which was carried on the &quot;USA Today&quot; mobile app and is still available on YouTube, showcased three original segments outlining news stories through a first-person perspective, recorded and produced by journalists from &quot;USA Today&quot; and its co-owned local newspapers. The program included &quot;cubemercials&quot;, lengthy commercials made by Gannett&#x27;s in-house creative studio, GET Creative, with the goal of enabling consumer engagement in totally immersive experiences through virtual reality. The last story was uploaded on August 1, 2017, less than a year after the series was created.

===&quot;For the Win&quot;===
&quot;USA Today&quot; operates a sports website called &quot;For the Win&quot;. It was launched in April 2013 and was the first sports property devoted to social news. The sports and sports leagues/organizations covered are the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Baseball (MLB), college football, college basketball, motorsports, soccer, golf, outdoor sports, and the African-American cable television network BET. A gateway to TicketSmarter to purchase sports and other event tickets is also hosted.

&quot;For the Win&quot; has sections covering pop culture and video games. Some articles for the latter are contributed by Good Luck Have Fun (GLHF), which describes itself as a gaming content agency that provides publishers around the globe, such as &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated,&quot; with text and video.

===Over-the-top and FAST channels===

In 2018, Gannett launched &quot;USA Today&quot;-branded over-the-top channels, &quot;USA Today News&quot; and &quot;USA Today SportsWire&quot; (later renamed as USA Today Sports), which would later relaunched in 2021 as free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels that are available on Tubi, The Roku Channel, Xumo Play, Plex, Amazon Freevee, Local Now and Samsung TV Plus.

* In 1986, the satirical magazine &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; published an issue that featured a parody of &quot;USA Today&quot;.
* &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) depicts a Hill Valley edition of &quot;USA Today&quot; from October 22, 2015. On that eventual date, the newspaper ran a recreation of the front page in tribute to the film, featuring the same headlines (sans a piece mentioning a state visit by &quot;Queen Diana&quot;, the princess having died in 1997).
* A 1991 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Homer Defined&quot;) featured a parody of the paper (&quot;U.S. of A. News&quot;), whose lead story was &quot;#2 is #1&quot;, in reference to pencils. Lisa criticizes the paper&#x27;s blandness, but Homer retorts, &quot;Hey, this is the only paper in America that&#x27;s not afraid to tell the truth, that everything is just fine.&quot;
* A 2010 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; (&quot;A Clockwork Origin&quot;) featured a parody of the paper (&quot;USB Today&quot;). The paper was also parodied on the 2007 direct-to-DVD special &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; as &quot;USA Toady&quot;, possibly as a reference to the character Hypnotoad.
* &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990) featured the &quot;Mars Today&quot; newspaper in the film&#x27;s Mars setting.
* The 2004 mockumentary feature film &quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot;, directed by Kevin Willmott, featured a parody of the newspaper titled &quot;CSA Today&quot;, in the film&#x27;s fictional alternate history setting that the Confederacy had won the American Civil War.

<text>Nigel Gregory Benn (born 22 January 1964) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1987 to 1996. He held world titles in two weight classes, including the WBO middleweight title in 1990, and the WBC super-middleweight title from 1992 to 1996. At the regional level, he held the Commonwealth middleweight title from 1988 to 1989. He scored wins over several world champions including Doug DeWitt, Iran Barkley, Thulani Malinga, Mauro Galvano, and Gerald McClellan.

Nicknamed &#x27;The Dark Destroyer&#x27;, Benn retired with an 83.3% knockout ratio. His notable fights include the defense of the world middleweight title against Iran Barkley in 1989, as well as the two world title contests against Chris Eubank in 1990 and 1993, and his fight against McClellan. He also successfully defended his world super-middleweight title in 1995. In the build-up to his ring walks, the chimes of Big Ben were often played before his entrance. 

==Early life and amateur career==
Benn was born in Ilford, East London, on 22 January 1964. Aged 18, Benn joined the Royal Fusiliers. He was stationed in West Germany for three years, and then in Northern Ireland for eighteen months. After leaving the army, Benn joined West Ham Amateur Boxing Club. Benn became the Amateur Boxing Association Middleweight Champion in 1986.

==Professional career==
Benn began his professional career in 1987, achieving 22 consecutive knockout wins. During this time, Benn won the vacant Commonwealth middleweight title with a second-round win over Abdul Umaru at Alexandra Pavilion on 20 April 1988.

In May 1989, Benn (22-0, 22 KOs) lost his Commonwealth title to Michael Watson in a highly anticipated bout at Finsbury Park, London (Nigel Benn vs. Michael Watson). The fight appeared on national television in the US. In the sixth round, Watson knocked Benn down with a jab, and Benn was counted out as he got to his feet.

His next fight against Jorge Amparo in Atlantic City, U.S. was his first fight abroad and the first to go the full distance, with Benn winning by a 10-round decision.

=== WBO middleweight champion ===

After two more wins against Sanderline Williams and Jose Quinones, Benn fought WBO middleweight title holder Doug DeWitt of the US in Atlantic City. Benn was knocked down in round two but recovered and knocked DeWitt down in round three, scoring three knockdowns in round eight to win the title.

His first defence took place in August 1990 against former WBC champion Iran Barkley. Benn won via the three-knockdown rule at the end of the first round. Benn returned to the UK and met British rival Chris Eubank three months later. They fought in Birmingham on 18 November 1990, and Benn lost his title to Eubank in the ninth round when the referee stepped in and declared Eubank the winner by technical knockout.

=== WBC super-middleweight champion ===

Beginning in 1991 with a seventh-round KO victory over Robbie Sims (Marvin Hagler&#x27;s half-brother), Benn went on a six-fight winning streak, leading to another world title challenge. Other wins in this period include a decision win against Thulani Malinga, which was considered disputed, and a one-punch KO victory against Dan Sherry.

On 10 October 1992, Benn successfully challenged Mauro Galvano for the WBC super-middleweight title in Palaghiaccio de Marino, Marino, Lazio, Italy. Galvano was unable to continue in the third due to a severe cut, and after a dispute at ringside over the official result, Benn was declared the winner by technical decision.

Benn&#x27;s move to the higher weight limit led him to refine his fight strategy and adopt a more considered approach. He defended his title against fellow Britons Nicky Piper and Lou Gent, and secured a rematch victory over Mauro Galvano, before facing Chris Eubank—now WBO super-middleweight champion—in a unification bout on 9 October 1993. The bout ended in a draw, with both fighters retaining their respective titles. Benn defended his title twice more in 1994 with unanimous decisions against Henry Wharton and Juan Carlos Giminez Ferreyra.

====Benn vs McClellan====

In February 1995, Benn successfully defended his 168lb title against WBC middleweight champion Gerald McClellan in a highly anticipated bout billed as &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;. Going into the fight, McClellan had won his last 21 fights—the last 14 of those by knockout; with 13 of those knockouts in the first three rounds. Due to this record, many in the British media saw Benn as an underdog.

In Round 1, Benn was knocked through the ropes as McClellan dominated early. Benn was forced to endure the early rounds, battling to survive in what became a brutal contest. From Rounds 4 to 6, Benn began to shift the momentum, as McClellan showed signs of distress, repeatedly losing his gumshield, backing off for extended periods, and blinking continuously. McClellan responded in Rounds 7 and 8, knocking Benn down again in the eighth round. However, McClellan, now visibly fatigued, was unable to capitalise on his advantage. Benn mounted a comeback and ultimately stopped McClellan by knockout in Round 10, with McClellan unable to rise from his knee. At the time of the stoppage, two judges had McClellan ahead, while the third had the fight even, although these scores did not account for the two knockdowns Benn delivered in the final round.

McClellan was severely injured as a result of the fight. After collapsing in his corner post-fight, McClellan was rushed to hospital where a blood clot was discovered on his brain. McClellan fell into a coma for two weeks. The injuries left him with significant impairments: he suffers from short-term memory problems, is almost completely blind, partially deaf, and uses a wheelchair. However, since 1995, McClellan has regained some of his hearing, having been 80% deaf and he can now walk with a cane. In 2007, McClellan, his sister and his children attended a benefit dinner organised and hosted by Benn to help McClellan with his ongoing medical expenses.

After his fight with McClellan, Benn had two further successful title defences, with wins against future WBC title-holder Vincenzo Nardiello and American Danny Perez. Benn then lost his title to Malinga in 1996 in a fight that saw Benn knock Malinga down in the fifth round, but in which he also met the canvas in the twelfth. Benn lost the contest by a split decision (118-109, 115–111, 112–114).

====Benn vs Collins I and II====
In 1996, Benn attempted to take the WBO super-middleweight title twice from Steve Collins—who had taken that particular title from Eubank and beat him in a rematch. Benn failed in both attempts. In the first fight, he lost by TKO in Round 4 after sustaining an ankle injury. In the rematch four months later, Benn was retired by his corner at the end of Round 6 with Benn on his stool. Benn retired from professional boxing altogether shortly after the fight.

===Return from retirement===

On 24 September 2019, Benn announced his intention to return to boxing at the age of 55, after a 23-year absence from the ring. Benn explained that he wanted &quot;closure&quot; after the unsatisfactory end to his boxing career in 1996. He revealed plans for a bout against former WBC super-middleweight world champion Sakio Bika (34-7-3), scheduled for 23 November 2019. The British Boxing Board of Control refused to sanction the fight, leading to its controversial sanctioning by the British and Irish Boxing Authority instead. However, the fight was subsequently called off after Benn suffered a shoulder injury in sparring. Benn, disappointed, reluctantly confirmed that he was abandoning his planned comeback.

==Life after boxing==

Benn was inducted into the World Boxing Council (WBC) Boxing Hall of Fame in 2013 and was honored alongside fellow Brit Joe Calzaghe as WBC middleweight champions in. His image is now on the sixth generation WBC super middleweight belt.

Benn works with at risk youth in Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia and is dedicated to his charity work. He is an ambassador to the New South Wales Police Citizens Youth Club&#x27;s (PCYC) and is an advocate for healthy living. Benn is also a Patron of the Shannon Bradshaw Trust, a UK children&#x27;s charity based in the North West of England, helping children with life-threatening conditions and their families.

Benn ran the 2013 City to Surf to raise funds for the most underfunded PCYC gym in Redfern, Sydney and has undertaken many fund raisers for the charity since improving the boxing facilities in the most impoverished areas of Sydney. Benn regularly assists Christian groups, counselling individuals with addiction and along with his wife Carolyne counsels couples who are facing marriage issues.

One of Benn&#x27;s sons, Conor Benn, turned professional in 2016 and is currently fighting at welterweight. Another son, Harley, turned professional in 2017.

In 2024, Benn joined fellow London boxers – Frank Bruno, Lennox Lewis and Chris Eubank – for a mini documentary, &quot;Four Kings&quot;. In the final episode, he revealed he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He was aware of his unresolved PTSD due to circumstances surrounding his older brother&#x27;s death. 

He attempted suicide in 1999 due to struggles with sex addiction, and the harm it was causing to his wife and children. He survived partly due to the hosepipe he used to recycle exhaust fumes back into his car repeatedly disconnecting. He considers his suicide attempt as a turning point in his life, becoming Christian shortly after and committing to remaining faithful to his wife.

<text>The Boomerang Nebula is a protoplanetary nebula located 5,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It is also known as the Bow Tie Nebula and catalogued as LEDA 3074547. The nebula&#x27;s temperature is measured at making it the coolest natural place currently known in the Universe.

The Boomerang Nebula is believed to be a star system evolving toward the planetary nebula phase. It continues to form and develop due to the outflow of gas from its core where a star in its late stage life sheds mass and emits starlight illuminating dust in the nebula. Millimeter scale dust grains mask portions of the nebula&#x27;s center so most escaping visible light is in two opposing lobes forming a distinctive hourglass shape as viewed from Earth. The outflowing gas is moving outwards at a speed of about 164 km/s and expanding rapidly as it moves out into space; this gas expansion results in the nebula&#x27;s unusually low temperature.

Keith Taylor and Mike Scarrott called it the &quot;Boomerang Nebula&quot; in 1980 after observing it with the Anglo-Australian telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory. Unable to view it with great clarity, the astronomers saw merely a slight asymmetry in the nebula&#x27;s lobes suggesting a curved shape like a boomerang. The nebula was photographed in detail by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1998 revealing a more symmetrical hourglass shape.

In 1995, using the 15-metre Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope in Chile, astronomers measured its temperature as one degree above absolute zero (−272.15 °C). This makes it the coldest place in the Universe found so far, besides laboratory-created temperatures. Even the 2.7 K background glow from the Big Bang is warmer than the nebula. It is the only naturally occurring object found so far that has a temperature lower than the background radiation.

In 2013, observations of the ALMA radio interferometer revealed other features of the Boomerang Nebula. The visible double lobe of the Boomerang Nebula was observed to be surrounded by a larger spherical volume of cold gas seen only in sub-millimeter radio wavelengths. The nebula&#x27;s outer fringes appear to be gradually warming.

As of mid-2017, it is believed that the star at the center of the nebula is a dying red giant.

<doc id="208468" wikidata="Q626885" url="?curid=208468" title="Arbalest">
<text>The arbalest (also arblast), a variation of the crossbow, came into use in Europe around the 12th century.
The arbalest was a large weapon with a steel prod, or bow assembly. Since the arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. The greater draw weight was offset by a shorter draw length, which limited the total potential energy that could be transferred into the crossbow bolt. A skilled arbalestier (arbalester) could loose two bolts per minute.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;arbalest&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;crossbow&quot;. &quot;Arbalest&quot; is a Medieval French word originating from the Roman name &#x27; (from &#x27; &#x27;bow&#x27; + &#x27; &#x27;missile-throwing engine&#x27;), which was then used for crossbows, although originally used for types of artillery. Modern French uses the word &#x27;, which is linguistically one step further from the stem (disappearance of the &quot;s&quot; phoneme in the last syllable, before the &quot;t&quot;).

The word applies to both crossbow and arbalest (the latter may be referred to as a &quot;heavy crossbow&quot;, but an actual heavy crossbow may not be the same as an arbalest). In some cases, the word has been used to refer to arbalists, the people who actually used the weapon.

<text>William Cosmo Monkhouse (18 March 184020 July 1901) was a British poet and critic.

==Biography==
Monkhouse was born and raised in London. His father, Cyril John Monkhouse, was a solicitor, and his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Delafosse. Monkhouse was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, but stopped his schooling at the age of seventeen to enter the board of trade as a junior supplementary clerk, from which grade he rose eventually to be the assistant-secretary to the finance department of the office. In 1870–1871 he visited South America in connection with the hospital accommodation for seamen at Valparaíso, Chile, and other ports; he served on different departmental committees, notably that of 1894–1896 on the Mercantile Marine Fund. Monkhouse was twice married: first, to Laura, daughter of James Keymer of Dartford; and, secondly, to Leonora Eliza, daughter of Commander Blount, R.N.

Cosmo Monkhouse was one of those who not only have a vocation, but an avocation. Cosmo&#x27;s first bias was to poetry, and in 1865 he issued &quot;A Dream of Idleness and Other Poems&quot;, a collection strongly coloured by his admiration for Wordsworth and Tennyson. It was marked by exceptional maturity and scarcely received the recognition it deserved. Perhaps owing to this circumstance, it was not until 1890 that he put forth &quot;Corn and Poppies&quot;, a collection containing at least one memorable effort in the well-known &quot;Dead March&quot;. Five years later, a limited edition of the striking ballad of &quot;The Christ upon the Hill&quot; appeared; it was illustrated with etchings by William Strang. After Cosmo&#x27;s death, his poetical output was completed by &quot;Pasiteles the Elder and other Poems&quot; (including &quot;The Christ upon the Hill&quot;).

In 1868 Monkhouse wrote a novel &quot;A Question of Honour&quot;. Then, after preluding with a &quot;Life of Turner&quot; in the &quot;Great Artists Series&quot; (1879), he devoted himself almost exclusively to art criticism. Besides many contributions to the &quot;Academy&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Magazine of Art&quot; and other periodicals, he published volumes on &quot;The Italian Pre-Raphaelites&quot; (1887), &quot;The Earlier English Water-Colour Painters&quot; (1890 and 1897), &quot;In the National Gallery&quot; (1895) and &quot;British Contemporary Artists&quot; (1899). He wrote a monograph on the illustrator of Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland entitled &quot;The Life and Work of Sir John Tenniel, R. I. (London: 1901)&quot;. He was a contributor to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; from the beginning. Monkhouse also wrote a life of Leigh Hunt in the &quot;Great Writers Series&quot; (1887). He wrote a monograph on Chinese ceramics entitled &quot;A history and description of Chinese Porcelain, (London; Chapman, 1901)&quot;.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition: &quot;As an art critic, Monkhouse&#x27;s judgments were highly valued. He had the rare gift of differing without offending, while he invariably secured respect for his honesty and ability. As a poet, his ambition was wide and his devotion to the art ... thorough.&quot;

Monkhouse died at Skegness on 2 July 1901.

==Family==
He was twice married: first in 1865 to Laura, daughter of James Keymer of Dartford in Kent; second in 1873 to Leonora Eliza, the daughter of Commander Blount, R.N., by whom he had two sons and six daughters.

<doc id="208480" wikidata="Q631444" url="?curid=208480" title="Shaftesbury">
<text>Shaftesbury () is a town and civil parish in Dorset, England. It is on the A30 road, west of Salisbury and north-northeast of Dorchester, near the border with Wiltshire. It is the only significant hilltop settlement in Dorset, being built about above sea level on a greensand hill on the edge of Cranborne Chase.

The town looks over the Blackmore Vale, part of the River Stour basin.

Shaftesbury is the site of the former Shaftesbury Abbey, which was founded in 888 by King Alfred and became one of the richest religious establishments in the country, before being destroyed in the dissolution in 1539. Adjacent to the abbey site is Gold Hill, a steep cobbled street used in the 1970s as the setting for Ridley Scott″s television advertisement for Hovis bread.

In the 2021 census the town&#x27;s civil parish had a population of 9,162.

==Toponymy==
Shaftesbury has acquired a number of names throughout its history. Writing in 1906, Sir Frederick Treves referred to four of these names from Celtic, Latin and English traditions in his book &quot;Highways &amp; Byways in Dorset&quot;:
The original Celtic name is first recorded in Medieval Welsh literature as &quot;Caer Vynnydd y Paladr&quot; (The Mountain Fort/City of the Spears) and Thomas Gale records the name as &quot;Caer Palladour&quot; in his work of 1709. Though &quot;Palladour&quot; was described by one 19th-century directory as &quot;mere invention&quot;, it has continued to be used as a poetic and alternative name for the town.

The English name was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Sceptesberie, and the use of &quot;Shaston&quot; () was recorded in 1831 in Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; and in 1840 in &quot;The parliamentary gazetteer of England and Wales&quot;.

Thomas Hardy used both &quot;Shaston&quot; and &quot;Palladour&quot; to refer to the town in the fictional Wessex of his novels such as &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;.

==History==
There is no substantive evidence that Shaftesbury was the &quot;Caer Palladur&quot; (or &quot;Caer Palladwr&quot;) of Celtic and Roman times, and instead the town&#x27;s recorded history dates from Anglo-Saxon times. By the early eighth century there was an important minster church here, and in 880 Alfred the Great founded a burgh (fortified settlement) here as a defence in the struggle with the Danish invaders. The burgh is recorded in the early-10th-century Burghal Hidage as one of only three that existed in the county (the others being at Wareham and &#x27;Bredy&#x27; – which is probably Bridport).
In 888 Alfred founded Shaftesbury Abbey, a Benedictine nunnery by the town&#x27;s east gate, and appointed his daughter Ethelgifu as the first abbess. Æthelstan founded two royal mints, which struck pennies bearing the town&#x27;s name, and the abbey became the wealthiest Benedictine nunnery in England. On 20 February 981 the relics of St Edward the Martyr, the teenage King of England, were transferred from Wareham and received at the abbey with great ceremony, thereafter turning Shaftesbury into a major site of pilgrimage for miracles of healing.

King Canute died here in 1035, though he was buried at Winchester. Edward the Confessor licensed a third mint for the town. By the time of the Norman conquest in 1066 Shaftesbury had 257 houses, though many were destroyed in the ensuing years of conflict, and by the time the Domesday Book was compiled twenty years later, there were only 177 houses remaining, though this still meant that Shaftesbury was the largest town in Dorset at that time. In the first English civil war (1135–1154) between Empress Matilda and King Stephen, an adulterine castle or fortified house was built on a small promontory at the western edge of the hill on which the old town was built. The site on Castle Hill, also known locally as Boltbury, is now under grass and is a scheduled monument.

In 1240 Cardinal Otto of Tonengo, legate to the Apostolic See of Pope Gregory IX visited the abbey and confirmed a charter of 1191, the first entered in the Glastonbury chartulary. During the Middle Ages the abbey was the central focus of the town; the abbey&#x27;s great wealth was acknowledged in a popular saying at the time, which stated that &quot;If the abbot of Glastonbury could marry the abbess of Shaftesbury their heir would hold more land than the king of England&quot;. In 1260 a charter to hold a market was granted. By 1340 the mayor had become a recognised figure, sworn in by the steward of the abbess. In 1392 Richard II confirmed a grant of two markets on different days. Edwardstowe, Shaftesbury&#x27;s oldest surviving building, was built on Bimport at some time between 1400 and 1539. Also in this period a medieval farm owned by the Abbess of Shaftesbury was established, on a site now occupied by the Tesco supermarket car park.
In 1539, the last Abbess of Shaftesbury, Elizabeth Zouche, signed a deed of surrender, the (by then extremely wealthy) abbey was demolished, and its lands sold, leading to a temporary decline in the town. Sir Thomas Arundell purchased the abbey and much of the town in 1540, but when he was later exiled for treason his lands were forfeit, and the lands passed to Pembroke then Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and finally to the Grosvenors.

Shaftesbury was a parliamentary constituency returning two members from 1296 to the Reform Act of 1832, when it was reduced to one, and in 1884 the separate constituency was abolished.

In &quot;Survey of Dorsetshire&quot;, written in about 1630 by Thomas Gerard of the Dorset village of Trent, Shaftesbury is described as a &quot;faire Thorough Faire, much frequented by Travellers to and from London&quot;.

The town was broadly Parliamentarian in the Civil War, but was in Royalist hands. Wardour Castle fell to Parliamentary forces in 1643; Parliamentary forces surrounded the town in August 1645, when it was a centre of local clubmen activity. The clubmen were arrested and sent to trial in Sherborne. Shaftesbury took no part in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685.

In the 17th century the cloth industry formed part of Shaftesbury&#x27;s economy, though much of the actual production took place as a cottage industry in the surrounding area. In the 18th century the town produced a coarse white woollen cloth called &#x27;swanskin&#x27;, that was used by fishermen of Newfoundland and for uniforms. Buttonmaking also became important around this time, though with the later advent of industrialisation this subsequently declined, resulting in unemployment, starvation and emigration, with 350 families leaving for Canada. Malting and brewing were also significant in the 17th and 18th centuries, and like other Dorset towns such as Dorchester and Blandford Forum, Shaftesbury became known for its beer.

The railways however bypassed the town, which had consequences for Shaftesbury&#x27;s economy; during the 19th century the town&#x27;s brewing industry was reduced to serving only local markets, as towns elsewhere in the country could transport their produce more cheaply. During the 19th century the population of the town grew little.
The town hall was built in 1837 by Earl Grosvenor after the guildhall was pulled down to widen High Street. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. Shaftesbury Town Hall is next to the 15th-century St Peter&#x27;s Church which is Grade II* listed. The Westminster Memorial Hospital was constructed on Bimport in the mid-19th century with a legacy from the wife of the Duke of Westminster.

In 1918 Lord Stalbridge, 2nd Baron Stalbridge, Hugh Grosvenor, sold a large portion of the town, which was purchased by a syndicate and auctioned piece by piece over three days. The entire Stalbridge Estate of some 13,500 acres was sold and the title became extinct with the death of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Baron Stalbridge in 1949. His only son and heir had been killed in a flying accident in 1930.

Most of Shaftesbury&#x27;s buildings date from no earlier than the 18th century, as the Saxon and most of the medieval buildings have not survived.

==Governance==
In the United Kingdom national parliament, Shaftesbury is in the North Dorset parliamentary constituency, represented since 2015 by Simon Hoare of the Conservative Party. In local government, Shaftesbury is administered by Dorset Council (a unitary authority) and Shaftesbury Town Council, which has responsibilities that include open spaces and recreational facilities, allotments, litter, street markets, public conveniences, grants to voluntary organisations, cemetery provision, bus shelters, crime prevention initiatives, civic events and the town hall, planning (as a consultee) and the war memorial.

Shaftesbury is covered by an electoral ward called Shaftesbury Town, which elects two members to Dorset Council. Prior to changes in 2019, the town elected one member of Dorset County Council and four members of North Dorset District Council.

==Geography==
The old centre of Shaftesbury is sited on a westward-pointing promontory of high ground in northeast Dorset, on the scarp edge of a range of hills that extend south and east into Cranborne Chase and neighbouring Wiltshire. The town&#x27;s built-up area extends down the promontory slopes to lower ground at St James, Alcester and Enmore Green, and eastwards across the watershed towards the hill&#x27;s dip slope. Shaftesbury&#x27;s altitude is between about at the lowest streets below the promontory, to about at Wincombe Business Park on the hilltop in the north, with the promontory and town centre being at about . Below the town to the west is the Blackmore Vale, which undulates between about . About west of the town and within the Blackmore Vale is the conical mound of Duncliffe Hill, visible for miles and home to Duncliffe Wood and a nature reserve. The countryside east of the town is part of the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Geologically, Shaftesbury&#x27;s hill mostly comprises Upper Greensand, which is overlain by Lower Chalk in the east. These date from the Cretaceous, with the greensand having been formed in the Albian and early Cenomanian, and the chalk also in the Cenomanian. The greensand is composed of three beds: the oldest and lowest is a layer of Cann Sand, which is found in the lower parts of the town, such as St James and Alcester, that are below the promontory; above this is a layer of Shaftesbury Sandstone, which generally forms the steepest slopes around the promontory, and on top of this is a layer of Boyne Hollow Chert, which is found on top of the hill and on which most of the town is built. Below the Cann Sand, on the lower slopes of the hill to the north, west and south of the town, are extensive landslip deposits.
==Economy==
In 2012 there were 3,400 people employed in Shaftesbury, 65% of whom were working full-time and 35% part-time. Excluding agriculture, the most important employment sectors were public administration, education and health (31% of non-agricultural employment), production and construction (29%), and distribution, accommodation and food (26%). Significant employers include Dorset County Council, Pork Farms, Guys Marsh Prison, Royal Mail, Tesco, Port Regis School, Wessex Electricals, Stalbridge Linen Services, Blackmore Press and Dorset Chilled Foods. There are two industrial estates in the town: Longmead Industrial Estate, covering , and Wincombe Business Park, covering .

In 2005 there were 75 shops in the town, with a total floorspace of . The retail catchment area for major food shopping extends about in all directions. National retail chains with a presence in the town include the Body Shop, Boots, Somerfield, Superdrug, Tesco and WHSmith.

A site has been identified for a projected parkway station on the West of England main railway line. It would be situated to the north of the town, beneath the A350 road, and a bus service would connect it with the town. Currently the nearest railway station is located in neighbouring Gillingham.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Shaftesbury&#x27;s civil parish had 3,493 dwellings, 3,235 households and a population of 7,314. The average age of inhabitants was 43, compared to 39.3 for England as a whole. 22.1% of inhabitants were age 65 or older, compared to 16.4% for England as a whole. 92% of Shaftesbury&#x27;s residents were born in the United Kingdom, compared to 86.2% for England as a whole. Previous census figures for the total population of the civil parish are shown in the table below:

==Culture, art and media==

Shaftesbury Arts Centre was established in 1957 and stages a variety of exhibitions, performances, workshops and training courses. It is based in the old covered market in the town centre and is a charitable company that is run wholly by its volunteer members.

Shaftesbury has two museums: Gold Hill Museum at the top of Gold Hill, and Shaftesbury Abbey Museum in the abbey grounds. Gold Hill Museum was founded in 1946 and displays many artefacts that relate to the history of Shaftesbury and the surrounding area, including Dorset&#x27;s oldest fire engine, dating from 1744. Shaftesbury Abbey Museum tells the story of the abbey and also has a herb garden and medieval orchard.

Shaftesbury Snowdrops is a Diamond Jubilee Community Legacy with the aim of creating a series of free and accessible snowdrop walks by planting snowdrops within the publicly open spaces and along the pathways throughout the town. The project was started in the winter of 2012 with the planting of 60,000 bulbs. Since 2013 there has been an annual Snowdrop Festival to encourage tourists to see the snowdrops in flower. Highlights of the festival include the Snowdrop Art Exhibition and the Snowdrop Lantern Parade. In 2014 Shaftesbury Snowdrops started a heritage collection of rare and unusual snowdrops. These are held in trust for the people of Shaftesbury and displayed in Shaftesbury Abbey during the annual Snowdrop Festival. The collection is being built through sponsorship and donations.

Gold Hill Fair usually occurs in the first weekend of July and has food stalls, arts stalls and local music that can be found in the abbey ruins.

In 2016, Shaftesbury&#x27;s first open arts fringe festival was organised and has since grown to become one of the key fringe festivals in the country. The fringe is always held on the first weekend in July and attracts an eccentric mix of performers from local singers to celebrity comics heading for Edinburgh. 
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Shaftesbury&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent, Vale FM, and Heart West. The town is home to a volunteer-run community radio station, Alfred, broadcasting local news, speech programming and music on 107.3 FM and online. It was awarded an Ofcom licence in 2020, having grown from a weekly podcast which went daily during the COVID-19 pandemic. The podcast won the gold award in the community radio awards in 2021.

===Representations===
Thomas Hardy used the names &quot;Shaston&quot; or &quot;Palladour&quot; to describe Shaftesbury in the fictional Wessex of his novels. In &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; he described the loss of the town&#x27;s former architectural glories, principally the abbey:

&quot;Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent apsidal abbey, the chief glory of south Wessex, its twelve churches, its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions—all now ruthlessly swept away—throw the visitor, even against his will, into a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel.&quot;

In the 1970s Ridley Scott used Gold Hill, a steep cobbled street in the town, as the setting for a television advertisement for Hovis bread, in which a bread delivery boy is seen pushing his bicycle up the street before freewheeling back down. The advertisement made the street nationally famous.

==Transport==
Shaftesbury is served by the A30, between Salisbury and Yeovil, and the A350, which connects Poole and Chippenham. The town is south of the main A303 trunk road between London and South West England.

Shaftesbury has never had a direct railway connection. The challenging topography likely played a significant role in this, as constructing a railway up the steep slopes would have been difficult and costly. In 1859, the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway established a station at Semley, north of Shaftesbury. This station allowed residents and visitors to access the broader railway network.

Semley station closed in the Beeching cuts of 1966. The closest railway station to Shaftesbury is now Gillingham railway station (Dorset), northwest of the town, on the West of England line from London Waterloo to Exeter.

Local bus services connect the town to surrounding villages and towns.

==Amenities==

Shaftesbury has a non-League football club, Shaftesbury F.C., who play at Cockrams. The Shaftesbury Lido, an open air swimming pool at Barton Hill, is open during the summer months.

Shaftesbury has a community hospital, opened in 1874 and named Westminster Memorial Hospital in memory of the Marquis of Westminster, whose widow donated the site. The town has a public library operated by Dorset Council.

==Notable people==

<text>The object-modeling technique (OMT) is an object modeling approach for software modeling and designing. It was developed around 1991 by Rumbaugh, Blaha, Premerlani, Eddy and Lorensen as a method to develop object-oriented systems and to support object-oriented programming. OMT describes object model or static structure of the system.

OMT was developed as an approach to software development. The purposes of modeling according to Rumbaugh are:
* testing physical entities before building them (simulation),
* communication with customers,
* visualization (alternative presentation of information), and
* reduction of complexity.

OMT has proposed three main types of models:
* &quot;Object model&quot;: The object model represents the static and most stable phenomena in the modeled domain. Main concepts are classes and associations with attributes and operations. Aggregation and generalization (with multiple inheritance) are predefined relationships.
* &quot;Dynamic model&quot;: The dynamic model represents a state/transition view on the model. Main concepts are states, transitions between states, and events to trigger transitions. Actions can be modeled as occurring within states. Generalization and aggregation (concurrency) are predefined relationships.
* &quot;Functional model&quot;: The functional model handles the process perspective of the model, corresponding roughly to data flow diagrams. Main concepts are process, data store, data flow, and actors.

OMT is a predecessor of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Many OMT modeling elements are common to UML.

Functional Model in OMT:
In brief, a functional model in OMT defines the function of the whole internal processes in a model with the help of &quot;Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)&quot;. It details how processes are performed independently.

The model is defined by the organization’s vision, mission, and values, as well as sets of boundaries for the organization—what products or services it will deliver, what customers or markets it will target, and what supply and delivery channels it will use. While the business model includes high-level strategies and tactical direction for how the organization will implement the model, it also includes the annual goals that set the specific steps the organization intends to undertake in the next year and the measures for their expected accomplishment. Each of these is likely to be part of internal documentation that is available to the internal auditor.</text><links>

<text>Events from the year 1809 in literature.

==Events==

*February 24 – The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, is destroyed by fire. When found drinking wine in the street while watching the conflagration, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the proprietor, is reported as saying: &quot;A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside.&quot; The putative manuscript of &quot;The History of Cardenio&quot; may have been lost in the blaze.
*March 1 – The literary and political periodical &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; is first published by John Murray in London.
*June 1 – Samuel Taylor Coleridge founds &quot;The Friend&quot;, a weekly periodical which runs for some 25 issues.
*July 7 – Jane Austen settles with her sister and mother at Chawton Cottage in Chawton, near Alton, Hampshire and she resumes writing regularly.
*September 18 – A new Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, London, opens to replace the first, which burnt down in 1808. The first play performed is &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Raised ticket prices cause the Old Price Riots, which last for 64 days, until the manager, John Philip Kemble, reverses the increases.
*&quot;Uncertain dates&quot;
**The Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, United States, is opened as &quot;The New Circus&quot; by the Circus of Pepin and Breschard. It becomes the oldest continually operating playhouse in the English-speaking world and the oldest in the United States.
**William Combe begins publication of the verse &quot;Tour of Dr Syntax in search of the Picturesque&quot; in Ackermann&#x27;s &quot;Political Magazine&quot; (London), illustrated by Thomas Rowlandson, satirising William Gilpin&#x27;s views on the picturesque.

<text>Ian Davenport (born 8 July 1966) is an English abstract painter and former Turner Prize nominee.

==Life and work==
Ian Davenport was born in Sidcup. He studied art at Northwich College of Art and Design, in Cheshire, and then at Goldsmiths College, from where he graduated in 1988. The same year he exhibited in the &quot;Freeze&quot; exhibition at Surrey Docks organised by Damien Hirst. In 1990 Davenport&#x27;s first solo show was held at Waddington Galleries and he was included in the British Art Show. In 1991, he was nominated for the annual Turner Prize. In 1999, he had a solo exhibition at Dundee Contemporary Arts and was a prizewinner at the John Moores exhibition 21 in Liverpool.

Many of his works are made by pouring paint onto a tilted surface and letting gravity spread the paint over the surface. For the &quot;Days Like These&quot; exhibition at Tate Britain in 2003, he made a thirteen-metre-high mural by dripping lines of differently-coloured paint down the wall from a syringe. His most comprehensive exhibition to date was held at Ikon Gallery in Birmingham in 2004. The same year he was commissioned by the Contemporary Art Society to make a wall painting for the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at Warwick University&quot;.&quot;

In September 2006, Davenport unveiled his largest public commission to date in the arches beneath Southwark Bridge, entitled &quot;Poured Lines: Southwark&quot;. He painted the West End Wall of the University of Oxford Department of Biochemistry.

In 2012, Davenport was commissioned to design an ‘Arty Wenlock’ for the London Olympics. It was installed on the Thames pathway between the Millennium Bridge and Tate Modern, for the duration of the games.

A monograph on him was published in 2014.

Davenport showed three decades of work in a solo survey exhibition at Dallas Contemporary, Texas, in 2018.

He is a Patron of Paintings in Hospitals, a charity that provides art for health and social care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<doc id="208527" wikidata="Q5869386" url="?curid=208527" title="History of the English penny (1066–1154)">
<text>This article traces the history of the [[Penny (English coin)|English penny]] from 1066 to 1154.

==The early Norman kings==
Following the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror continued the Anglo-Saxon coinage system. As a penny was a fairly large unit of currency at the time, when small change was needed a penny would be cut in half or into quarters at the mint of issue. Most pennies of Kings William I and II show a front-facing bust of the king on the obverse (which was a departure from the Anglo-Saxon kings, who mostly used a sideways-facing bust), surrounded by a legend, usually (&quot;King William&quot;, or &quot;William King of the English&quot; — The P may have been a late usage of the letter wynn, a P-shaped rune which had the sound value of a &quot;w&quot;). The reverse of the coin usually showed some form of cross, surrounded by the legend identifying the moneyer and mint.

Moneyers were personally responsible for maintaining the weight (at this time, 20 to 22 grains, 1.3 to 1.6 grams) and the silver fineness of the coins they produced — there are several recorded instances of moneyers who produced short-weight coins being mutilated or occasionally executed. Although there was only a small amount of space on the reverse, the moneyer&#x27;s &quot;identification details&quot; were considered more important than the mint and were not often abbreviated (although often &#x27;mis-spelt&#x27;). The moneyer&#x27;s name would appear after a small cross, and is usually followed by &quot;ON&quot; (&quot;of&quot;) and the town&#x27;s name. During the reign of William I (1066–1087) the demand for coins was so high that there were about 70 mints active; over 50 were active at the start of William II&#x27;s reign in 1087, but only 34 were still in operation at his death in 1100.

===Location of mints, 1066–1100 ===
During the reign of the first two Norman kings, mints were located in Barnstaple, Bath, Bedford, Bedwyn, Bridport, Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Canterbury, Cardiff, Chester, Chichester, Christchurch, Colchester, Cricklade, Derby, Devitum (probably St David&#x27;s, South Wales), Dorchester, Dover, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Guildford, Hastings, Hereford, Hertford, Huntingdon, Hythe, Ilchester, Ipswich, Launceston, Leicester, Lewes, Lincoln, London, Maldon, Malmesbury, Marlborough, Northampton, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Peterborough, Pevensey, Rhuddlan, Rochester, Romney, Salisbury, Sandwich, Shaftesbury, Shrewsbury, Southwark, Stafford, Stamford, Steyning, Sudbury, Tamworth, Staffordshire, Taunton, Thetford, Totnes, Wallingford, Wareham, Warwick, Watchet, Wilton, Winchcombe, Winchester, Worcester, and York.

During the relatively long reign of King Henry I (1100–1135) the penny remained the chief denomination, although round halfpennies and quarter pennies were introduced [these are mentioned in contemporary accounts] which proved very unpopular and only about &quot;twelve&quot; specimens (of halfpence, and &quot;no&quot; round quarters) are known to exist today. Fifteen major types of penny were produced, at around 54 mints which were intermittently active throughout the reign. The quality of the coins in the early part of the reign was poor, as the moneyers made a large profit by producing underweight coins or coins of debased fineness. In 1124 Henry called all 150 moneyers to Winchester and called them to account for their activities — 94 of them were convicted of issuing sub-standard coins and were mutilated, their right hands and one testicle being cut off, as a result of which the quality of coins improved for most of the remainder of his reign. The basic design of the coins remained the same as before with the obverse inscriptions variously being — &quot;Henry&quot;, &quot;King Henry&quot;, &quot;Henry King of England&quot;.

=== Location of mints, 1100–1135 ===
During the reign of King Henry I, mints were located in Barnstaple, Bath, Bedford, Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Canterbury, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chester, Chichester, Christchurch, Colchester, Derby, Dorchester, Dover, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hastings, Hereford, Huntingdon, Ilchester, Ipswich, Launceston, Leicester, Lewes, Lincoln, London, Northampton, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Pembroke, Pevensey, Rochester, Romney, Salisbury, Sandwich, Shaftesbury, Shrewsbury, Southampton, Southwark, Stafford, Stamford, Sudbury, Tamworth, Taunton, Thetford, Totnes, Wallingford, Wareham, Warwick, Watchet, Wilton, Winchcombe, Winchester, Worcester, and York.

One of the largest hoards of coins of Henry I was the Lincoln Melandry Hoard found in February 1972. This provided many new examples of coins minted by previously undocumented moneyers for the later issues of Henry I&#x27;s reign.

== The Anarchy ==
The period following the death of King Henry I is known as The Anarchy. Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son and heir had been drowned in 1120 in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster, so he had decided that he wished his daughter Matilda to succeed him. When he died, Matilda, also known as the Empress Maud, was in Normandy and her cousin Stephen of Blois managed to get back to London before she did, and claimed the throne - with the support of many barons who were unprepared for the novel idea of a woman ruler. Matilda and Stephen set up rival courts in Bristol and London and proceeded to issue coins from the mints under their control while the political unrest continued for the better part of 20 years. Stephen won the political battle, but when his own son and heir, Eustace, died in 1153 he agreed that Matilda&#x27;s son Henry would succeed him.

Many of the coins produced during the Anarchy are of poor quality.

=== King Stephen&#x27;s coins ===

There are approximately 5 principal varieties of coins produced by Stephen&#x27;s mints, normally containing the legend , but one issue bears the legend which cannot be translated but is thought to have been constructed by the moneyers to look like the previous reign&#x27;s , so they could disassociate themselves from the conflict and hedge their bets about who would win, while still providing the required number of new coins.

Stephen&#x27;s coins were minted at Bedford, Bramber, Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Canterbury, Cardiff, Carlisle, Castle Rising, Chester, Chichester, Cipen (possibly Ipswich), Colchester, Corbridge, Derby, Dorchester, Dover, Durham, Eden, Exeter, Gloucester, Hastings, Hedon near Hull, Hereford, Huntingdon, Ipswich, Launceston, Leicester, Lewes, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Pembroke, Peterborough, Pevensey, Rye, Salisbury, Sandwich, Shaftesbury, Shrewsbury, Southampton, Southwark, Stafford, Steyning, Sudbury, Swansea, Tamworth, Taunton, Thetford, Tutbury, Wareham, Warwick, Watchet, Wilton, Winchester, Worcester, and York.

=== Empress Maud&#x27;s coins ===
Matilda&#x27;s coins tend to show a cruder style than Stephen&#x27;s regular issues. The obverse legend is — &quot;Empress Matilda&quot;, — &quot;Countess Matilda&quot;, or simply — &quot;Matilda&quot;.

Matilda&#x27;s coins were minted at Bristol, Cardiff, Gloucester, Oxford, and Wareham, and possibly also at Calne and Canterbury.
