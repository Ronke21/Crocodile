<text>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is the second book in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; science fiction comedy &quot;trilogy&quot; by Douglas Adams. It was originally published by Pan Books as a paperback in 1980. Like the preceding novel, it was adapted from Adams&#x27; radio series, and became a critically acclaimed cult classic.

The book was inspired by the song &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; by British rock band Procol Harum. Following directly on from the events of the previous book, it continues the misadventures of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the crew of the starship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; on their journey across the universe and uncovering its bizarre mysteries.

==Synopsis==
Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, and Zaphod Beeblebrox leave the planet Magrathea on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. A Vogon ship bribed by Gag Halfrunt and a group of psychiatrists, fearful that the discovery of the Ultimate Question will end their profession, intercepts and fires at them. Meanwhile, Arthur gets frustrated that the ship is unable to produce any beverages beyond an undrinkable tea-like liquid that is &quot;almost but not quite entirely unlike tea&quot;. He gives a lengthy description of tea, causing Eddie the Shipboard Computer to become CPU-bound and unable to fight the Vogon ship off. Desperate, Zaphod decides to hold a s√©ance to call up his great-grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth to rescue them. The elder Zaphod scolds his descendant and sends him on a quest to find The Ruler of the Universe in order to solve the political and economic instability plaguing the universe. He transports Zaphod and Marvin to Ursa Minor Beta, the tropical home planet of the offices of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s publisher Megadodo Publications, and leaves the others on the depowered ship in a black void.

Acting on a thought from the portion of his brain unaffected by his lobotomy, Zaphod goes looking for Zarniwoop, the Guide&#x27;s lead editor, though his staff insist he has been out on an intergalactic cruise. A man named Roosta takes Zaphod to Zarniwoop&#x27;s offices. Frogstar fighters arrive and attack the building, towing it to one of their home planets, Frogstar World B, a planet whose society collapsed through an economic process called the &quot;Shoe Event Horizon&quot; which rendered its economy unable to support any enterprises besides shoe stores. The planet eventually became the site of the Total Perspective Vortex, a device that drives those who experience it mad due to showing them their insignificance compared to the infinite universe. Following Roosta&#x27;s instructions and escaping through Zarniwoop&#x27;s office&#x27;s windows, Zaphod is caught by Gargravarr, a disembodied mind undergoing a trial separation from his body, who takes Zaphod to be exposed to the Vortex. However, Zaphod is unfazed by the Vortex, suggesting to a perplexed Gargravarr that it showed Zaphod that he was the most important being in the universe.

Left on his own, Zaphod eventually finds a long-abandoned spaceliner whose passengers have been forcibly kept in 900 years of suspended animation by the autopilot after the collapse of their civilization until a new one could develop to load the ship with lemon-scented paper napkins. On the ship he discovers Zarniwoop, who reveals that Zaphod stepped into a computer simulation of the universe when he walked into his office, allowing Zaphod to survive the Vortex since the universe was designed for his benefit. Zarniwoop further reveals that the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; had been microscopically shrunk and placed in Zaphod&#x27;s pocket so that they can use it to find the true ruler of the universe, whom Zarniwoop has located. However, Zaphod abandons Zarniwoop, reunites with Ford, Arthur, and Trillian, and escapes to the nearest restaurant. This turns out to be Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, built atop the ruins of Frogstar World B and existing in a time bubble near the end of the universe, which it offers its guests spectacular views of. At the restaurant they meet Ford&#x27;s old acquaintance Hotblack Desiato, a member of the rock band Disaster Area, which is known for making the loudest sound in the universe and only perform their concerts remotely from an orbiting spaceship. During their dinner, Zaphod receives a telephone call from Marvin, who has been stranded on the planet for billions of years and is now working as a valet in the restaurant&#x27;s parking lot.

Zaphod suggests they leave, trying to steal a sleek, all-black spacecraft next to Hotblack Desiato&#x27;s limoship. With their ship on complete autopilot and unable to wrest the controls away from it, an agitated Zaphod admits that he still wants to solve the Question to the Ultimate Answer. Marvin abruptly tells them that the question is imprinted in Arthur&#x27;s brainwaves, but they are distracted before they can ask further. They learn that the ship is actually an uncrewed stunt ship for Disaster Area, which is programmed to fall into a local sun to create solar flares in synchronization with the climax of the band&#x27;s concert. They discover a partially installed emergency teleporter without a guidance system and Zaphod volunteers Marvin to stay behind and operate it so the others can escape. Zaphod and Trillian find themselves back aboard the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; under Zarniwoop&#x27;s control, where he is using the ship&#x27;s Improbability Drive to penetrate the Unprobability Field that is protecting the home planet of the Ruler of the Universe. On an unpopulated planet, they find the Ruler who has no idea he is the ruler, is not convinced of a broader universe outside of his home, and is even skeptical if anything around him exists. While an enraged Zarniwoop tries to reason with the Ruler, Zaphod and Trillian strand him and make their escape in the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;.

Meanwhile, Arthur and Ford find themselves aboard Ark Fleet Ship B, which is loaded with 15 million passengers from the planet Golgafrincham and is commanded by an inept captain who is only concerned with taking baths. Although the Golgafrinchans were ostensibly evacuated to escape a planetary disaster, in actuality the disaster was made up by the Golgafrinchans to divest themselves of a useless third of their population, later going extinct from a pandemic caused by dirty telephone receivers after they expelled all telephone sanitizers. The Ark crash-lands into a swamp on an undeveloped planet. Arthur and Ford leave to search for a signal from any passing spaceship, traveling for hundreds of miles around the continent. Along the way the planet&#x27;s primitive yet friendly hominid-like inhabitants usher them away from their home settlements and leave them fruit. After finding a glacier with a Magrathean inscription honoring Slartibartfast, they realize they are on pre-historic Earth in 2,000,000 BC, that the hominids are Neanderthals, that they have traveled across Europe from the future site of Arthur&#x27;s home city of Islington in Great Britain to Norway, and that the Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of the modern human race.

They return to the Golgafrinchans, only to find that they have been too preoccupied with trying to form council meetings about documentary-making, fiscal policy, searching for hot springs for the captain&#x27;s baths, and declaring war on uninhabited continents to bother with trying to discover fire, invent the wheel, or solve pressing issues. Ford tries to warn them that they will be annihilated in 2 million years, but they ignore him. Desperate, Arthur tries to teach the Neanderthals, who have been mysteriously wasting away since the Ark&#x27;s arrival, through a makeshift Scrabble set. When one of the Neanderthals spells out the word &quot;forty-two&quot; with the letter tiles, Ford realizes that the Neanderthals were part of the matrix of Deep Thought&#x27;s computer to determine the Ultimate Question and that the Golgafrinchans are interfering with the machination by displacing them. However, they also remember Marvin&#x27;s claim that the Ultimate Question was embedded in Arthur&#x27;s mind. Hoping that remnants of the programming exist in Arthur&#x27;s subconscious, they have Arthur pull out tiles at random from the Scrabble set, only to discover that the Question is &quot;What do you get if you multiply six by nine?&quot; The two resign to make the best of their life on prehistoric Earth. They go on a date with two Golgafrinchan women, and Arthur throws his copy of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; in the river.

==Audiobook adaptations==
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition, recorded in 1981 by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations, and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new unabridged edition of the audiobook.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #13 and commented that &quot;&quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; tries to do much of the same thing, but some of the zest seems to be missing; the ideas are fewer, the happenings less dramatic. The author seems sometimes to be straining for the same effects he effortlessly achieved in &quot;Hitchhiker&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="202351" wikidata="Q207396" url="?curid=202351" title="Guatemalan quetzal">
<text>The quetzal (; code: GTQ) is the currency of Guatemala, named after the national bird of Guatemala, the resplendent quetzal. In ancient Mayan culture, the quetzal bird&#x27;s tail feathers were used as currency. It is divided into 100 &quot;centavos,&quot; or &quot;len&quot; (plural &quot;lenes&quot;) in Guatemalan slang. The plural is &quot;quetzales&quot;.

==History==
The quetzal was introduced in 1925 during the term of President Jos√© Mar√≠a Orellana, whose image appears on the obverse of the one-quetzal bill. It replaced the Guatemalan peso at the rate of 60 pesos = 1 quetzal. Until 1987, the quetzal was pegged to and domestically equal to the United States dollar.

==Coins==

In 1925, coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10 centavos, , and 1 quetzal were introduced, although the majority of the 1 quetzal coins were withdrawn from circulation and melted. and 2 centavo coins were added in 1932. Until 1965, coins of 5 centavos and above were minted in 72% silver. and 1 quetzal coins were reintroduced in 1998 and 1999, respectively.

The coins currently in circulation are disc-shaped and include Guatemala&#x27;s national coat of arms on the obverse. The coins, and their reverse designs are:
*5 centavos: the tree of liberty and the motto &quot;&quot;LIBRE CREZCA FECUNDO&quot; (&quot;Grow free and fecund)&quot;&quot;
*10 centavos: a monolith from Quirigu√°
*25 centavos: an indigenous woman, Concepci√≥n Ram√≠rez
*50 centavos: Monja Blanca, the national flower
*1 quetzal: a stylized dove, the word &quot;Paz (Peace)&quot;, and the date ‚Äú&quot;29 de Diciembre de 1996 (29 December 1996)&quot;‚Äù

==Banknotes==
The first banknotes were issued by the Central Bank of Guatemala in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 100 quetzales, with quetzal notes added in 1933. In 1946, the Bank of Guatemala took over the issuance of paper money, with the first issues being overprints on notes of the Central Bank. Except for the introduction of 50 quetzal notes in 1967, the denominations of banknotes remained unchanged until and 1 quetzal coins replaced notes at the end of the 1990s.

In the top-right corner of the obverse face of each banknote, the value is displayed in Mayan numerals, representing Guatemala&#x27;s cultural history.

The Bank of Guatemala has introduced a polymer banknote of 1 quetzal on August 20, 2007, followed by a 5 quetzal polymer banknote on November 14, 2011. Both the 1 and 5 quetzal notes are once again on a paper substrate as of 2024.

<doc id="202352" wikidata="Q51600" url="?curid=202352" title="Sibilant">
<text>Sibilants (from : &#x27;hissing&#x27;) are fricative consonants of higher amplitude and pitch, made by directing a stream of air with the tongue towards the teeth. Examples of sibilants are the consonants at the beginning of the English words &quot;sip&quot;, &quot;zip&quot;, &quot;ship&quot;, and &quot;genre&quot;. The symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet used to denote the sibilant sounds in these words are, respectively, . Sibilants have a characteristically intense sound, which accounts for their paralinguistic use in getting one&#x27;s attention (e.g. calling someone using &quot;psst!&quot; or quieting someone using &quot;shhhh!&quot;).

In the hissing sibilants and , the back of the tongue forms a narrow channel (is &quot;grooved&quot;) to focus the stream of air more intensely, resulting in a high pitch. With the hushing sibilants (occasionally termed &quot;shibilants&quot;), such as English , , , and , the tongue is flatter, and the resulting pitch lower.

A broader category is stridents, which include more fricatives than sibilants such as uvulars. Sibilants are a higher pitched subset of the stridents. The English sibilants are:
while the English stridents are:
as and are stridents but not sibilants because they are lower in pitch.

Some linguistics use the terms stridents and sibilants interchangeably to refer to the greater amplitude and pitch compared to other fricatives.

&quot;Stridency&quot; refers to the perceptual intensity of the sound of a sibilant consonant, or obstacle fricatives or affricates, which refers to the critical role of the teeth in producing the sound as an obstacle to the airstream. Non-sibilant fricatives and affricates produce their characteristic sound directly with the tongue or lips etc. and the place of contact in the mouth, without secondary involvement of the teeth.

The characteristic intensity of sibilants means that small variations in tongue shape and position are perceivable, with the result that there are many sibilant types that contrast in various languages.

== Acoustics ==
Sibilants are louder than their non-sibilant counterparts, and most of their acoustic energy occurs at higher frequencies than non-sibilant fricatives‚Äîusually around 8,000¬†Hz.

== Sibilant types ==
All sibilants are coronal consonants (made with the tip or front part of the tongue). However, there is a great deal of variety among sibilants as to tongue shape, point of contact on the tongue, and point of contact on the upper side of the mouth.

The following variables affect sibilant sound quality, and, along with their possible values, are ordered from sharpest (highest-pitched) to dullest (lowest-pitched):
* Tongue shape: , alveolo-palatal, palato-alveolar, retroflex
* Place of articulation (point of contact on the upper side of the mouth): or denti-alveolar, , postalveolar, 
* Point of contact on the tongue: &quot;closed&quot; (see below), non-&quot;closed&quot;, , 

Generally, the values of the different variables co-occur so as to produce an overall sharper or duller sound. For example, a laminal denti-alveolar grooved sibilant occurs in Polish, and a subapical palatal retroflex sibilant occurs in Toda.

=== Tongue shape ===
The main distinction is the shape of the tongue. Most sibilants have a groove running down the centerline of the tongue that helps focus the airstream, but it is not known how widespread this is. In addition, the following tongue shapes are described, from sharpest and highest-pitched to dullest and lowest-pitched:

* Hollow (e.g. ): This hollow accepts a large volume of air that is forced through a typically narrow aperture that directs a high-velocity jet of air against the teeth, which results in a high-pitched, piercing &quot;hissing&quot; sound. Because of the prominence of these sounds, they are the most common and most stable of sibilants cross-linguistically. They occur in English, where they are denoted with a letter &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot;, as in &quot;soon&quot; or &quot;zone&quot;.
* Alveolo-palatal (e.g. ): with a convex, V-shaped tongue, and highly palatalized (middle of the tongue strongly raised or bowed).
* Palato-alveolar (e.g. ): with a &quot;domed&quot; tongue (convex and moderately palatalized). These sounds occur in English, where they are denoted with letter combinations such as &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot; or &quot;si&quot;, as in &quot;shin&quot;, &quot;chin&quot;, &quot;gin&quot; and &quot;vision&quot;.
* Retroflex (e.g. ): with a flat or concave tongue, and no palatalization. There is a variety of these sounds, some of which also go by other names (e.g. &quot;flat postalveolar&quot; or &quot;apico-alveolar&quot;). The or &quot;true&quot; retroflex sounds are the very dullest and lowest-pitched of all the sibilants.

The latter three post-alveolar types of sounds are often known as &quot;hushing&quot; sounds because of their quality, as opposed to the &quot;hissing&quot; alveolar sounds. The alveolar sounds in fact occur in several varieties, in addition to the normal sound of English &quot;s&quot;:
* Palatalized: Sibilants can occur with or without raising the tongue body to the palate (palatalization). Palatalized alveolars are transcribed e.g. and occur in Russian; they sound similar to the cluster occurring in the middle of the English phrase &quot;miss you&quot;.
* Lisping: Alveolar sibilants made with the tip of the tongue () near the upper teeth have a softer sound reminiscent of (but still sharper-sounding than) the &quot;lisping&quot; sound of English &quot;think&quot;. These sounds are relatively uncommon, but occur in some of the indigenous languages of California as well as in the Spanish dialects of western and southern Andaluc√≠a (southwest Spain), mostly in the provinces of C√°diz, M√°laga, Sevilla and Huelva. In these dialects, the lisping sibilant (sometimes indicated in Spanish dialectology as ) is the most common pronunciation of the letters &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, as well as &quot;c&quot; before &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, replacing the or that occur elsewhere in the country.

Speaking non-technically, the retroflex consonant sounds somewhat like a mixture between the regular English of &quot;ship&quot; and a strong American &quot;r&quot;; while the alveolo-palatal consonant sounds somewhat like a mixture of English of &quot;ship&quot; and the in the middle of &quot;miss you&quot;.

=== Place of articulation ===
Sibilants can be made at any articulation, i.e. the tongue can contact the upper side of the mouth anywhere from the upper teeth () to the hard palate (), with the in-between articulations being denti-alveolar, and postalveolar.

=== Point of contact on the tongue ===
The tongue can contact the upper side of the mouth with the very tip of the tongue (an &#x27; articulation, e.g. ); with the surface just behind the tip, called the &quot;blade&quot; of the tongue (a &#x27; articulation, e.g. ); or with the underside of the tip (a &quot;&quot; articulation). Apical and subapical articulations are always &quot;tongue-up&quot;, with the tip of the tongue above the teeth, while laminal articulations can be either tongue-up or &quot;tongue-down&quot;, with the tip of the tongue behind the lower teeth. This distinction is particularly important for retroflex sibilants, because all three varieties can occur, with noticeably different sound qualities.

For tongue-down laminal articulations, an additional distinction can be made depending on where exactly behind the lower teeth the tongue tip is placed. A little ways back from the lower teeth is a hollow area (or pit) in the lower surface of the mouth. When the tongue tip rests in this hollow area, there is an empty space below the tongue (a &quot;sublingual cavity&quot;), which results in a relatively duller sound. When the tip of the tongue rests against the lower teeth, there is no sublingual cavity, resulting in a sharper sound. Usually, the position of the tip of the tongue correlates with the grooved vs. hushing tongue shape so as to maximize the differences. However, the palato-alveolar sibilants in the Northwest Caucasian languages such as Ubykh are an exception. These sounds have the tongue tip resting directly against the lower teeth, which gives the sounds a quality that Catford describes as &quot;hissing-hushing&quot;. Ladefoged and Maddieson term this a &quot;&quot;closed&quot; laminal postalveolar&quot; articulation, and transcribe them (following Catford) as , although this is not an IPA notation.

== Symbols in the IPA ==

The following table shows the types of sibilant fricatives defined in the International Phonetic Alphabet:

Diacritics can be used for finer detail. For example, apical and laminal alveolars can be specified as &quot;vs&quot; ; a dental (or more likely &quot;denti-alveolar&quot;) sibilant as ; a palatalized alveolar as ; and a generic &quot;retracted sibilant&quot; as , a transcription frequently used for the sharper-quality types of retroflex consonants (e.g. the laminal &quot;flat&quot; type and the &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; type). There is no diacritic to denote the laminal &quot;closed&quot; articulation of palato-alveolars in the Northwest Caucasian languages, but they are sometimes provisionally transcribed as .

== Possible combinations ==
The attested possibilities, with exemplar languages, are as follows. Note that the IPA diacritics are simplified; some articulations would require two diacritics to be fully specified, but only one is used in order to keep the results legible without the need for OpenType IPA fonts. Also, Ladefoged has resurrected an obsolete IPA symbol, the under dot, to indicate &quot;apical postalveolar&quot; (normally included in the category of retroflex consonants), and that notation is used here. (Note that the notation is sometimes reversed; either may also be called &#x27;retroflex&#x27; and written .)


 is an ad-hoc transcription. The old IPA letters are also available.

 These sounds are usually just transcribed . Apical postalveolar and subapical palatal sibilants do not contrast in any language, but if necessary, apical postalveolars can be transcribed with an apical diacritic, as or . Ladefoged resurrects the old retroflex sub-dot for apical retroflexes, Also seen in the literature on e.g. Hindi and Norwegian is ‚Äì the domed articulation of precludes a subapical realization.

=== Whistled sibilants ===
Whistled sibilants occur phonemically in several southern Bantu languages, the best known being Shona. However, they also occur in speech pathology and may be caused by dental prostheses or orthodontics.

The whistled sibilants of Shona have been variously described‚Äîas labialized but not velarized, as retroflex, etc., but none of these features are required for the sounds. Using the Extended IPA, Shona &quot;sv&quot; and &quot;zv&quot; may be transcribed and . Other transcriptions seen include purely labialized and (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996) and labially co-articulated and (or and ). In the otherwise IPA transcription of Shona in Doke (1967), the whistled sibilants are transcribed with the non-IPA letters and .

Besides Shona, whistled sibilants have been reported as phonemes in Kalanga, Tsonga, Changana, Tswa‚Äîall of which are Southern African languages‚Äîand Tabasaran. The articulation of whistled sibilants may differ between languages. In Shona, the lips are compressed throughout, and the sibilant may be followed by normal labialization upon release. (That is, there is a contrast among &quot;s, sw, »ø, »øw&quot;.) In Tsonga, the whistling effect is weak; the lips are narrowed but also the tongue is retroflex. Tswa may be similar. In Changana, the lips are rounded (protruded), but so is /s/ in the sequence /usu/, so there is evidently some distinct phonetic phenomenon occurring here that has yet to be formally identified and described.

== Linguistic contrasts among sibilants ==

Not including differences in manner of articulation or secondary articulation, some languages have as many as four different types of sibilants. For example, Northern Qiang and Southern Qiang have a four-way distinction among sibilant affricates , with one for each of the four tongue shapes. Toda also has a four-way sibilant distinction, with one alveolar, one palato-alveolar, and two retroflex (apical postalveolar and subapical palatal). 

The now-extinct Ubykh language was particularly complex, with a total of 27 sibilant consonants. Not only all four tongue shapes were represented (with the palato-alveolar appearing in the laminal &quot;closed&quot; variation) but also both the palato-alveolars and alveolo-palatals could additionally appear labialized. Besides, there was a five-way manner distinction among voiceless and voiced fricatives, voiceless and voiced affricates, and affricates. (The three labialized palato-alveolar affricates were missing, which is why the total was 27, not 30.) The Bzyp dialect of the related Abkhaz language also has a similar inventory. 

Some languages have four types when palatalization is considered. Polish is one example, with both palatalized and non-palatalized laminal denti-alveolars, laminal postalveolar (or &quot;flat retroflex&quot;), and alveolo-palatal (). Russian has the same surface contrasts, but the alveolo-palatals are arguably not phonemic. They occur only geminate, and the retroflex consonants never occur geminate, which suggests that both are allophones of the same phoneme. 

Somewhat more common are languages with three sibilant types, including one hissing and two hushing. As with Polish and Russian, the two hushing types are usually postalveolar and alveolo-palatal since these are the two most distinct from each other. Mandarin Chinese is an example of such a language. However, other possibilities exist. Serbo-Croatian has alveolar, flat postalveolar and alveolo-palatal affricates whereas Basque has palato-alveolar and laminal and apical alveolar (apico-alveolar) fricatives and affricates (late Medieval peninsular Spanish and Portuguese had the same distinctions among fricatives).

Many languages, such as English or Arabic, have two sibilant types, one hissing and one hushing. A wide variety of languages across the world have this pattern. Perhaps most common is the pattern, as in English and Arabic, with alveolar and palato-alveolar sibilants. Modern northern peninsular Spanish has a single apico-alveolar sibilant fricative , as well as a single palato-alveolar sibilant affricate . However, there are also languages with alveolar and apical retroflex sibilants (such as Standard Vietnamese) and with alveolar and alveolo-palatal postalveolars (e.g. alveolar and laminal palatalized i.e. in Catalan and Brazilian Portuguese, the latter probably through Amerindian influence, and alveolar and dorsal i.e. proper in Japanese).

Only a few languages with sibilants lack the hissing type. Middle Vietnamese is normally reconstructed with two sibilant fricatives, both hushing (one retroflex, one alveolo-palatal). Some languages have only a single hushing sibilant and no hissing sibilant. That occurs in southern Peninsular Spanish dialects of the &quot;ceceo&quot; type, which have replaced the former hissing fricative with , leaving only .

Languages with no sibilants are fairly rare. Most have no fricatives at all or only the fricative . Examples include most Australian languages, and Rotokas, and what is generally reconstructed for Proto-Bantu. Languages with fricatives but no sibilants, however, do occur, such as Ukue in Nigeria, which has only the fricatives . Also, almost all Eastern Polynesian languages have no sibilants but do have the fricatives and/or : MƒÅori, Hawaiian, Tahitian, Rapa Nui, most Cook Islands MƒÅori dialects, Marquesan, and Tuamotuan.

Tamil only has the sibilant and fricative in loanwords, and they are frequently replaced by native sounds. The sibilants exist as allophones of and the fricative as an allophone of .

== Contested definitions ==

Authors including Chomsky and Halle group and as sibilants. However, they do not have the grooved articulation and high frequencies of other sibilants, and most phoneticians continue to group them together with bilabial , and (inter)dental , as non-sibilant anterior fricatives. For a grouping of sibilants and , the term &quot;strident&quot; is more common. Some researchers judge to be non-strident in English, based on measurements of its comparative amplitude, but to be strident in other languages (for example, in the African language Ewe, where it contrasts with non-strident ).

The nature of &quot;sibilants&quot; as so-called &#x27;obstacle fricatives&#x27; is complicated ‚Äì there is a continuum of possibilities relating to the angle at which the jet of air may strike an obstacle. The grooving often considered necessary for classification as a &quot;sibilant&quot; has been observed in ultrasound studies of the tongue for the supposedly &quot;non-sibilant&quot; voiceless alveolar fricative of English.

<text>Proto-Germanic (abbreviated PGmc; also called Common Germanic) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages.

Proto-Germanic eventually developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three Germanic branches during the fifth century BC to fifth century AD: West Germanic, East Germanic and North Germanic. North Germanic remained in contact with the other branches over a considerable time, especially with the Ingvaeonic languages (including English), which arose from West Germanic dialects, and had remained in contact with the Norse.

A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of the process described by Grimm&#x27;s law, a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European and its gradual divergence into a separate language. The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century AD.

The alternative term &quot;Germanic parent language&quot; may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments, spanning the Nordic Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe (second to first millennia¬†BC) to include &quot;Pre-Germanic&quot; (PreGmc), &quot;Early Proto-Germanic&quot; (EPGmc) and &quot;Late Proto-Germanic&quot; (LPGmc). While Proto-Germanic refers only to the reconstruction of the most recent common ancestor of Germanic languages, the Germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of Proto-Indo-European that would become Proto-Germanic underwent through the millennia.

The Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any complete surviving texts; it has been reconstructed using the comparative method. However, there is fragmentary direct attestation of (late) Proto-Germanic in early runic inscriptions (specifically the Vimose inscriptions, dated to the 2nd century CE, as well as the non-runic Negau helmet inscription, dated to the 2nd century BCE), and in Roman Empire-era transcriptions of individual words (notably in Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;, AD 90).

==Archaeology and early historiography==

Proto-Germanic developed out of pre-Proto-Germanic during the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe. According to the Germanic substrate hypothesis, it may have been influenced by non-Indo-European cultures, such as the Funnelbeaker culture, but the sound change in the Germanic languages known as Grimm&#x27;s law points to a non-substratic development away from other branches of Indo-European. Proto-Germanic itself was likely spoken after 500¬†BC, and Proto-Norse, from the second century AD and later, is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from Proto-Indo-European suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the Nordic Bronze Age.

The Proto-Germanic language developed in southern Scandinavia (Denmark, south Sweden and southern Norway) and the northern-most part of Germany in Schleswig Holstein and northern Lower Saxony, the &quot;Urheimat&quot; (original home) of the Germanic tribes. It is possible that Indo-European speakers first arrived in southern Scandinavia with the Corded Ware culture in the mid-3rd millennium BC, developing into the Nordic Bronze Age cultures by the early second millennium BC. According to Mallory, Germanicists &quot;generally agree&quot; that the &quot;Urheimat&quot; (&#x27;original homeland&#x27;) of the Proto-Germanic language, the ancestral idiom of all attested Germanic dialects, was primarily situated in an area corresponding to the extent of the Jastorf culture.

Early Germanic expansion in the Pre-Roman Iron Age (fifth to first centuries BC) placed Proto-Germanic speakers in contact with the Continental Celtic La T√®ne horizon. A number of Celtic loanwords in Proto-Germanic have been identified. By the first century AD, Germanic expansion reached the Danube and the Upper Rhine in the south and the Germanic peoples first entered the historical record. At about the same time, extending east of the Vistula (Oksywie culture, Przeworsk culture), Germanic speakers came into contact with early Slavic cultures, as reflected in early Germanic loans in Proto-Slavic.

By the third century, Late Proto-Germanic speakers had expanded over significant distance, from the Rhine to the Dniepr spanning about . The period marks the breakup of Late Proto-Germanic and the beginning of the (historiographically recorded) Germanic migrations. 

The earliest available complete sentences in a Germanic language are variably dated to the 2nd century AD, around 300 AD or the first century AD in runic inscriptions (such as the Tune Runestone). The language of these sentences is known as Proto-Norse, although the delineation of Late Common Germanic from Proto-Norse at about that time is largely a matter of convention. The first coherent text recorded in a Germanic language is the Gothic Bible, written in the later fourth century in the East Germanic variety of the Thervingi Gothic Christians, who had escaped persecution by moving from Scythia to Moesia in 348. Early West Germanic text is available from the fifth century, beginning with the Frankish Bergakker runic inscription.

==Evolution==
The evolution of Proto-Germanic from its ancestral forms, beginning with its ancestor Proto-Indo-European, began with the development of a separate common way of speech among some geographically nearby speakers of a prior language and ended with the dispersion of the proto-language speakers into distinct populations with mostly independent speech habits. Between the two points, many sound changes occurred.

===Theories of phylogeny===

====Solutions====
Phylogeny as applied to historical linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem is the question of what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form a tree with Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has Proto-Indo-European at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.

In the evolutionary history of a language family, philologists consider a genetic &quot;tree model&quot; appropriate only if communities do not remain in effective contact as their languages diverge. Early Indo-European had limited contact between distinct lineages, and, uniquely, the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour, as some of its characteristics were acquired from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of West Germanic developed in an especially non-treelike manner.

Proto-Germanic is generally agreed to have begun about 500¬†BC. Its hypothetical ancestor between the end of Proto-Indo-European and 500¬†BC is termed Pre-Proto-Germanic. Whether it is to be included under a wider meaning of Proto-Germanic is a matter of usage.

Winfred P. Lehmann regarded Jacob Grimm&#x27;s &quot;First Germanic Sound Shift&quot;, or Grimm&#x27;s law, and Verner&#x27;s law, (which pertained mainly to consonants and were considered for many decades to have generated Proto-Germanic) as pre-Proto-Germanic and held that the &quot;upper boundary&quot; (that is, the earlier boundary) was the fixing of the accent, or stress, on the root syllable of a word, typically on the first syllable. Proto-Indo-European had featured a moveable pitch-accent consisting of &quot;an alternation of high and low tones&quot; as well as stress of position determined by a set of rules based on the lengths of a word&#x27;s syllables.

The fixation of the stress led to sound changes in unstressed syllables. For Lehmann, the &quot;lower boundary&quot; was the dropping of final -a or -e in unstressed syllables; for example, post-PIE &gt; Gothic , &#x27;knows&#x27;. Elmer H. Antonsen agreed with Lehmann about the upper boundary but later found runic evidence that the -a was not dropped: &quot;√©kwakraz ‚Ä¶ wraita&quot;, &#x27;I, Wakraz, ‚Ä¶ wrote (this)&#x27;. He says: &quot;We must therefore search for a new lower boundary for Proto-Germanic.&quot;

Antonsen&#x27;s own scheme divides Proto-Germanic into an early stage and a late stage. The early stage includes the stress fixation and resulting &quot;spontaneous vowel-shifts&quot; while the late stage is defined by ten complex rules governing changes of both vowels and consonants.
By 250¬†BC Proto-Germanic had branched into five groups of Germanic: two each in the West and the North and one in the East.

===Phonological stages from Proto-Indo-European to end of Proto-Germanic===

The following changes are known or presumed to have occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic in the wider sense from the end of Proto-Indo-European up to the point that Proto-Germanic began to break into mutually unintelligible dialects. The changes are listed roughly in chronological order, with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list. The stages distinguished and the changes associated with each stage rely heavily on Ringe, who in turn summarizes standard concepts and terminology.

====Pre-Proto-Germanic (Pre-PGmc)====
This stage began with the separation of a distinct speech, perhaps while it was still forming part of the Proto-Indo-European dialect continuum. It contained many innovations that were shared with other Indo-European branches to various degrees, probably through areal contacts, and mutual intelligibility with other dialects would have remained for some time. It was nevertheless on its own path, whether dialect or language.

====Early Proto-Germanic====
This stage began its evolution as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European that had lost its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels as well as one or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, but it would have been strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.


====Late Proto-Germanic====
By this stage, Germanic had emerged as a distinctive branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as Germanic languages. It had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in plosives to one containing primarily fricatives, had lost the PIE mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent, and had merged two of its vowels. The stress accent had already begun to cause the erosion of unstressed syllables, which would continue in its descendants. The final stage of the language included the remaining development until the breakup into dialects and, most notably, featured the development of nasal vowels and the start of umlaut, another characteristic Germanic feature.

===Lexical evidence in other language varieties===
Loans into Proto-Germanic from other (known) languages or from Proto-Germanic into other languages can be dated relative to each other by which Germanic sound laws have acted on them. Since the dates of borrowings and sound laws are not precisely known, it is not possible to use loans to establish absolute or calendar chronology.

====Loans from adjoining Indo-European groups====

Most loans from Celtic appear to have been made before or during the Germanic Sound Shift. For instance, one specimen &#x27;ruler&#x27; was borrowed from Celtic &#x27;king&#x27; (stem ), with &quot;g&quot; ‚Üí &quot;k&quot;. It is clearly not native because PIE *&quot;ƒì&quot; ‚Üí &quot;ƒ´&quot; is typical not of Germanic but Celtic languages. Another is &#x27;foreigner; Celt&#x27; from the Celtic tribal name &quot;Volcae&quot; with &quot;k&quot; ‚Üí &quot;h&quot; and &quot;o&quot; ‚Üí &quot;a&quot;. Other likely Celtic loans include &#x27;servant&#x27;, &#x27;mailshirt&#x27;, &#x27;hostage&#x27;, &#x27;iron&#x27;, &#x27;healer&#x27;, &#x27;lead&#x27;, &#x27;Rhine&#x27;, and &#x27;fortified enclosure&#x27;. These loans would likely have been borrowed during the Celtic Hallstatt and early La T√®ne cultures when the Celts dominated central Europe, although the period spanned several centuries.

From East Iranian came &#x27;hemp&#x27; (compare Khotanese , Ossetian &#x27;flax&#x27;), &#x27;hops&#x27; (compare Osset ), &#x27;sheep&#x27; (compare Pers &#x27;yearling kid&#x27;), &#x27;tunic&#x27; (cf. Osset &#x27;shirt&#x27;), &#x27;cottage&#x27; (compare Pers &#x27;house&#x27;), &#x27;cloak&#x27;, &#x27;path&#x27; (compare Avestan , gen. ), and &#x27;work&#x27; (compare Av ). The words could have been transmitted directly by the Scythians from the Ukraine plain, groups of whom entered Central Europe via the Danube and created the Vekerzug Culture in the Carpathian Basin (sixth to fifth centuries BC), or by later contact with Sarmatians, who followed the same route. Unsure is &#x27;horse&#x27;, which was either borrowed directly from Scytho-Sarmatian or through Celtic mediation.

====Loans into non-Germanic languages====

Numerous loanwords believed to have been borrowed from Proto-Germanic are known in the non-Germanic languages spoken in areas adjacent to the Germanic languages.

The heaviest influence has been on the Finnic languages, which have received hundreds of Proto-Germanic or pre-Proto-Germanic loanwords. Well-known examples include PGmc &#x27;warlord&#x27; (compare Finnish ), (later ) &#x27;ring&#x27; (compare Finnish , Estonian ), &#x27;king&#x27; (Finnish ), &#x27;lamb&#x27; (Finnish ), &#x27;ransom&#x27; (Finnish ).

Loanwords into the Samic languages, Baltic languages and Slavic languages are also known.

===Non-Indo-European substrate elements===

The term substrate with reference to Proto-Germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that do not appear to be descended from Proto-Indo-European. The substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the Indo-Europeans and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language. The theory of a non-Indo-European substrate was first proposed by Sigmund Feist, who estimated that about a third of all Proto-Germanic lexical items came from the substrate.

Theo Vennemann has hypothesized a Basque substrate and a Semitic superstrate in Germanic; however, his speculations, too, are generally rejected by specialists in the relevant fields.

==Phonology==
===Transcription===
The following conventions are used in this article for transcribing Proto-Germanic reconstructed forms:
* Voiced obstruents appear as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;; this does not imply any particular analysis of the underlying phonemes as plosives , , or fricatives , , . In other literature, they may be written as graphemes with a bar to produce &quot;∆Ä&quot;, &quot;ƒë&quot;, &quot;«•&quot;.
* Unvoiced fricatives appear as &quot;f&quot;, &quot;√æ&quot;, &quot;h&quot; (perhaps , , ). may have become in certain positions at a later stage of Proto-Germanic itself. Similarly for , which later became or in some environments.
* Labiovelars appear as &quot;kw&quot;, &quot;hw&quot;, &quot;gw&quot;; this does not imply any particular analysis as single sounds (e.g. , , ) or clusters (e.g. , , ).
* The yod sound appears as &quot;j&quot; . Note that the normal convention for representing this sound in Proto-Indo-European is &quot;y&quot;; the use of &quot;j&quot; does not imply any actual change in the pronunciation of the sound.
* Long vowels are denoted with a macron over the letter, e.g. &quot;≈ç&quot;. When a distinction is necessary, and are transcribed as &quot;ƒì¬π&quot; and &quot;ƒì¬≤&quot; respectively. &quot;ƒì¬π&quot; is sometimes transcribed as &quot;√¶&quot; or &quot;«£&quot; instead, but this is not followed here.
* Overlong vowels appear with circumflexes, e.g. &quot;√¥&quot;. In other literature they are often denoted by a doubled macron, e.g. &quot;≈çÃÑ&quot;.
* Nasal vowels are written here with an ogonek, following Ringe&#x27;s usage, e.g. &quot;«´ÃÇ&quot; . Most commonly in literature, they are denoted simply by a following n. However, this can cause confusion between a word-final nasal vowel and a word-final regular vowel followed by , a distinction which was phonemic. Tildes (&quot;√£&quot;, &quot;ƒ©&quot;, &quot;≈©&quot;...) are also used in some sources.
* Diphthongs appear as &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;au&quot;, &quot;eu&quot;, &quot;iu&quot;, &quot;≈çi&quot;, &quot;≈çu&quot; and perhaps &quot;ƒìi&quot;, &quot;ƒìu&quot;. However, when immediately followed by the corresponding semivowel, they appear as &quot;ajj, aww, eww, iww&quot;. &quot;u&quot; is written as &quot;w&quot; when between a vowel and &quot;j&quot;. This convention is based on the usage in .
* Long vowels followed by a non-high vowel were separate syllables and are written as such here, except for &quot;ƒ´&quot;, which is written &quot;ij&quot; in that case.

===Consonants===
The table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Proto-Germanic, ordered and classified by their reconstructed pronunciation. The slashes around the phonemes are omitted for clarity. When two phonemes appear in the same box, the first of each pair is voiceless, the second is voiced. Phones written in parentheses represent allophones and are not themselves independent phonemes. For descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms, follow the links on the column and row headings.

Notes:
# was an allophone of before velar obstruents.
# was an allophone of before labiovelar obstruents.
# , and were allophones of , and in certain positions (see below).
# The phoneme written as &quot;f&quot; was probably still realised as a bilabial fricative () in Proto-Germanic. Evidence for this is the fact that in Gothic, word-final &quot;b&quot; (which medially represents a voiced fricative) devoices to &quot;f&quot; and also Old Norse spellings such as &quot;aptr&quot; , where the letter &quot;p&quot; rather than the more usual &quot;f&quot; was used to denote the bilabial realisation before .

====Grimm&#x27;s and Verner&#x27;s law====

Grimm&#x27;s law as applied to pre-proto-Germanic is a chain shift of the original Indo-European plosives. Verner&#x27;s Law explains a category of exceptions to Grimm&#x27;s Law, where a voiced fricative appears where Grimm&#x27;s Law predicts a voiceless fricative. The discrepancy is conditioned by the placement of the original Indo-European word accent.

&quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; did not undergo Grimm&#x27;s law after a fricative (such as &quot;s&quot;) or after other plosives (which were shifted to fricatives by the Germanic spirant law); for example, where Latin (with the original &quot;t&quot;) has &quot;stella&quot; &#x27;star&#x27; and &quot;oct≈ç&quot; &#x27;eight&#x27;, Middle Dutch has &quot;ster&quot; and &quot;acht&quot; (with unshifted &quot;t&quot;). This original &quot;t&quot; merged with the shifted &quot;t&quot; from the voiced consonant; that is, most of the instances of came from either the original or the shifted .

(A similar shift on the consonant inventory of Proto-Germanic later generated High German. McMahon says:&quot;Grimm&#x27;s and Verner&#x27;s Laws¬†... together form the First Germanic Consonant Shift. A second, and chronologically later Second Germanic Consonant Shift¬†... affected only Proto-Germanic voiceless stops¬†... and split Germanic into two sets of dialects, Low German in the north¬†... and High German further south¬†...&quot;)

Verner&#x27;s law is usually reconstructed as following Grimm&#x27;s law in time, and states that unvoiced fricatives: , , , are voiced when preceded by an unaccented syllable. The accent at the time of the change was the one inherited from Proto-Indo-European, which was free and could occur on any syllable. For example, PIE &#x27; &gt; PGmc. &#x27;brother&#x27; but PIE &#x27; &gt; PGmc. &#x27;mother&#x27;. The voicing of some according to Verner&#x27;s Law produced , a new phoneme. Sometime after Grimm&#x27;s and Verner&#x27;s law, Proto-Germanic lost its inherited contrastive accent, and all words became stressed on their root syllable. This was generally the first syllable unless a prefix was attached.

The loss of the Proto-Indo-European contrastive accent got rid of the conditioning environment for the consonant alternations created by Verner&#x27;s law. Without this conditioning environment, the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as grammatischer Wechsel. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period as well as in the later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless alternants. Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.

====Allophones====
Some of the consonants that developed from the sound shifts are thought to have been pronounced in different ways (allophones) depending on the sounds around them. With regard to original or Trask says:&quot;The resulting or were reduced to and in word-initial position.&quot;

Many of the consonants listed in the table could appear lengthened or prolonged under some circumstances, which is inferred from their appearing in some daughter languages as doubled letters. This phenomenon is termed gemination. Kraehenmann says:&quot;Then, Proto-Germanic already had long consonants ‚Ä¶ but they contrasted with short ones only word-medially. Moreover, they were not very frequent and occurred only intervocally almost exclusively after short vowels.&quot;

The voiced phonemes , , and are reconstructed with the pronunciation of stops in some environments and fricatives in others. The pattern of allophony is not completely clear, but generally is similar to the patterns of voiced obstruent allophones in languages such as Spanish. The voiced fricatives of Verner&#x27;s Law, which only occurred in non-word-initial positions, merged with the fricative allophones of , , and . Older accounts tended to suggest that the sounds were originally fricatives and later &quot;hardened&quot; into stops in some circumstances. However, Ringe notes that this belief was largely due to theory-internal considerations of older phonological theories, and in modern theories it is equally possible that the allophony was present from the beginning.

Each of the three voiced phonemes , , and had a slightly different pattern of allophony from the others, but in general stops occurred in &quot;strong&quot; positions (word-initial and in clusters) while fricatives occurred in &quot;weak&quot; positions (post-vocalic). More specifically:
* Word-initial and were stops and .
* A good deal of evidence, however, indicates that word-initial was , subsequently developing to in a number of languages. This is clearest from developments in Anglo-Frisian and other Ingvaeonic languages. Southern varieties of Modern Dutch (e.g. speakers from Limburg, Brabant, Southern Gelderland, as well as most Flemish speech varieties) still preserve the sound of in this position. (However, in most other Western and Northern Dutch varieties like the mainstream Randstad dialect, the historically distinct phonemes ‚ü®g‚ü© […£] and ‚ü®ch‚ü© [x] have merged into the &quot;hard g&quot; (&quot;harde g&quot; in Dutch), i.e. a voiceless uvular fricative [œá].) 
* Plosives appeared after homorganic nasal consonants: , , , . This was the only place where a voiced labiovelar could still occur.
* When geminate, they were pronounced as stops , , . This rule continued to apply at least into the early West Germanic languages, since the West Germanic gemination produced geminated plosives from earlier voiced fricatives.
* was after or . Evidence for after is conflicting: it appears as a plosive in Gothic &#x27;word&#x27; (not , with devoicing), but as a fricative in Old Norse . hardened to in all positions in the West Germanic languages.
* In other positions, fricatives occurred singly after vowels and diphthongs, and after non-nasal consonants in the case of and .

====Labiovelars====

Labiovelars were affected by the following additional changes:
# The PIE bouk√≥los rule continues to operate as a surface filter in Proto-Germanic; in newly generated environments where a labiovelar occurred next to , it was immediately converted to a plain velar. This caused alternations in certain verb paradigms, e.g. &#x27;to sing&#x27; versus &#x27;they sang&#x27;. Apparently, this delabialization also occurred with labiovelars following , showing that the language possessed a labial allophone as well. In this case the entire clusters , and are delabialized to , and .
# (Early) Proto-Germanic knew at least three different outcomes: after , it was preserved (e.g. &#x27;song&#x27;); next to and before in initial positions it was delabialized to (e.g. &#x27;god&#x27;, &#x27;to grind&#x27;); in all other positions usually became (e.g. &#x27;warm&#x27;, &#x27;snow&#x27;, &#x27;kidney&#x27;). Evidence for a sound change &gt; in initial positions is slim.
These various changes often led to complex alternations, e.g. &#x27;to see&#x27;, &#x27;they saw&#x27; (indicative), &#x27;they saw&#x27; (subjunctive), which were reanalysed and regularised differently in the various daughter languages.

====Consonant gradation====
Kroonen posits a process of consonant mutation for Proto-Germanic, under the name &quot;consonant gradation&quot;. (This is distinct from the consonant mutation processes occurring in the neighboring Samic and Finnic languages, also known as consonant gradation since the 19th century.) The Proto-Germanic consonant gradation is not directly attested in any of the Germanic dialects, but may nevertheless be reconstructed on the basis of certain dialectal discrepancies in root of the &quot;n&quot;-stems and the &quot;≈çn&quot;-verbs.

Diachronically, the rise of consonant gradation in Germanic can be explained by Kluge&#x27;s law, by which geminates arose from stops followed by a nasal in a stressed syllable. Since this sound law only operated in part of the paradigms of the &quot;n&quot;-stems and &quot;≈çn&quot;-verbs, it gave rise to an alternation of geminated and non-geminated consonants in the same paradigms. These were largely regularized by various ways of analogy in the Germanic daughter languages.

Since its formulation, the validity of Kluge&#x27;s Law has been contested. The development of geminate consonants has also been explained by the idea of &quot;expressive gemination&quot;. Although this idea remains popular, it does not explain why many words containing geminated stops do not have &quot;expressive&quot; or &quot;intensive&quot; semantics. The idea has been described as &quot;methodically unsound&quot;, because it attempts to explain the phonological phenomenon through psycholinguistic factors and other irregular behaviour instead of exploring regular sound laws.

The origin of the Germanic geminate consonants remains a disputed part of historical linguistics with no clear consensus at present.

The reconstruction of &quot;grading&quot; paradigms in Proto-Germanic explains root alternations such as Old English &#x27;star&#x27; &lt; vs. Old Frisian &#x27;id.&#x27; &lt; * and Norwegian (dial.) &#x27;to swing&#x27; &lt; vs. Middle High German &#x27;id.&#x27; &lt; as generalizations of the original allomorphy. In the cases concerned, this would imply reconstructing an &quot;n&quot;-stem nom. , gen. &lt; PIE &#x27;, &#x27; and an &quot;≈çn&quot;-verb 3sg. , 3pl. &lt; &#x27;, &#x27;.

===Vowels===
Proto-Germanic had four short vowels, five or six long vowels, and at least one &quot;overlong&quot; or &quot;trimoraic&quot; vowel. The exact phonetic quality of the vowels is uncertain.

Notes:

# could not occur in unstressed syllables except before , where it may have been lowered to already in late Proto-Germanic times.
# All nasal vowels except , , and only occurred word-finally, and of these, only also occurred word-finally. Word-internal nasal vowels only occurred before , and derived from their earlier respective short vowels (, , and ) followed by .

PIE &quot;…ô&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; merged into PGmc &quot;a&quot;; PIE &quot;ƒÅ&quot;, &quot;≈ç&quot; merged into PGmc &quot;≈ç&quot;. At the time of the merger, the vowels probably were and , or perhaps and . Their timbres then differentiated by raising (and perhaps rounding) the long vowel to . It is known that the raising of &quot;ƒÅ&quot; to &quot;≈ç&quot; can not have occurred earlier than the earliest contact between Proto-Germanic speakers and the Romans. This can be verified by the fact that Latin &#x27; later emerges in Gothic as &#x27; (that is, ). It is explained by Ringe that at the time of borrowing, the vowel matching closest in sound to Latin &quot;ƒÅ&quot; was a Proto-Germanic &quot;ƒÅ&quot;-like vowel (which later became &quot;≈ç&quot;). And since Proto-Germanic therefore lacked a mid(-high) back vowel, the closest equivalent of Latin &quot;≈ç&quot; was Proto-Germanic &quot;≈´&quot;: &gt; &gt; &gt; Gothic .

A new &quot;ƒÅ&quot; was formed following the shift from &quot;ƒÅ&quot; to &quot;≈ç&quot; when intervocalic was lost in &quot;-aja-&quot; sequences. It was a rare phoneme, and occurred only in a handful of words, the most notable being the verbs of the third weak class. The agent noun suffix (Modern English &quot;-er&quot; in words such as &quot;baker&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;) was likely borrowed from Latin around or shortly after this time.

====Diphthongs====
The following diphthongs are known to have existed in Proto-Germanic:
* Short: , , , (from i-umlaut of ) before or 
* Long: , , (possibly , )

Note the change &gt; before or in the same or following syllable. This removed (which became ) but created from earlier .

Diphthongs in Proto-Germanic can also be analysed as sequences of a vowel plus an approximant, as was the case in Proto-Indo-European. This explains why was not lost in (&#x27;new&#x27;); the second element of the diphthong &quot;iu&quot; was still underlyingly a consonant and therefore the conditioning environment for the loss was not met. This is also confirmed by the fact that later in the West Germanic gemination, -&quot;wj&quot;- is geminated to -&quot;wwj&quot;- in parallel with the other consonants (except ).

====Overlong vowels====

Proto-Germanic had two overlong or trimoraic long vowels &quot;√¥&quot; and &quot;√™&quot; , the latter mainly in adverbs (cf. &#x27;whereto, whither&#x27;). None of the documented languages still include such vowels. Their reconstruction is due to the comparative method, particularly as a way of explaining an otherwise unpredictable two-way split of reconstructed long &quot;≈ç&quot; in final syllables, which unexpectedly remained long in some morphemes but shows normal shortening in others.

Trimoraic vowels generally occurred at morpheme boundaries where a bimoraic long vowel and a short vowel in hiatus contracted, especially after the loss of an intervening laryngeal (-&quot;VHV&quot;-). One example, without a laryngeal, includes the class II weak verbs (&quot;≈ç&quot;-stems) where a -&quot;j&quot;- was lost between vowels, so that -&quot;≈çja&quot; ‚Üí &quot;≈ça&quot; ‚Üí &quot;√¥&quot; (cf. ‚Üí ‚Üí Gothic &#x27;to anoint&#x27;). However, the majority occurred in word-final syllables (inflectional endings) probably because in this position the vowel could not be resyllabified. Additionally, Germanic, like Balto-Slavic, lengthened bimoraic long vowels in absolute final position, perhaps to better conform to a word&#x27;s prosodic template; e.g., PGmc &#x27;eagle&#x27; ‚Üê PIE *&#x27; just as Lith &#x27;stone&#x27;, OSl &quot;kamy&quot; ‚Üê ‚Üê PIE *&#x27;. Contrast:
* contraction after loss of laryngeal: gen.pl. &#x27;wolves&#x27; ‚Üê ‚Üê pre-Gmc * ‚Üê PIE *&#x27;; ≈ç-stem gen.pl. * ‚Üê pre-Gmc *&#x27; ‚Üê PIE *&quot;.
* contraction of short vowels: a-stem nom.pl. &#x27;wolves&#x27; ‚Üê PIE *&quot;.

But vowels that were lengthened by laryngeals did not become overlong. Compare:
* ≈ç-stem nom.sg. *&quot;-≈ç&quot; ‚Üê *&quot;-ƒÅ&quot; ‚Üê PIE *&quot;&quot;;
* ≈ç-stem acc.sg. *&quot;-«≠&quot; ‚Üê *&quot;-ƒÅn&quot; ‚Üê *&quot;-ƒÅm&quot; (by Stang&#x27;s law) ‚Üê PIE *&quot;&quot;;
* ≈ç-stem acc.pl. *&quot;-≈çz&quot; ‚Üê *&quot;-ƒÅz&quot; ‚Üê *&quot;-ƒÅs&quot; (by Stang&#x27;s law) ‚Üê PIE *&quot;&quot;;

Trimoraic vowels are distinguished from bimoraic vowels by their outcomes in attested Germanic languages: word-final trimoraic vowels remained long vowels while bimoraic vowels developed into short vowels. Older theories about the phenomenon claimed that long and overlong vowels were both long but differed in tone, i.e., &quot;√¥&quot; and &quot;√™&quot; had a &quot;circumflex&quot; (rise-fall-rise) tone while &quot;≈ç&quot; and &quot;ƒì&quot; had an &quot;acute&quot; (rising) tone, much like the tones of modern Scandinavian languages, Baltic, and Ancient Greek, and asserted that this distinction was inherited from PIE. However, this view was abandoned since languages in general do not combine distinctive intonations on unstressed syllables with contrastive stress and vowel length. Modern theories have reinterpreted overlong vowels as having superheavy syllable weight (three moras) and therefore greater length than ordinary long vowels.

By the end of the Proto-Germanic period, word-final long vowels were shortened to short vowels. Following that, overlong vowels were shortened to regular long vowels in all positions, merging with originally long vowels except word-finally (because of the earlier shortening), so that they remained distinct in that position. This was a late dialectal development, because the result was not the same in all Germanic languages: word-final &quot;ƒì&quot; shortened to &quot;a&quot; in East and West Germanic but to &quot;i&quot; in Old Norse, and word-final &quot;≈ç&quot; shortened to &quot;a&quot; in Gothic but to &quot;o&quot; (probably ) in early North and West Germanic, with a later raising to &quot;u&quot; (the sixth century Salic law still has in late Frankish).

The shortened overlong vowels in final position developed as regular long vowels from that point on, including the lowering of &quot;ƒì&quot; to &quot;ƒÅ&quot; in North and West Germanic. The monophthongization of unstressed &quot;au&quot; in Northwest Germanic produced a phoneme which merged with this new word-final long &quot;≈ç&quot;, while the monophthongization of unstressed &quot;ai&quot; produced a new &quot;ƒì&quot; which did not merge with original &quot;ƒì&quot;, but rather with &quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot;, as it was not lowered to &quot;ƒÅ&quot;. This split, combined with the asymmetric development in West Germanic, with &quot;ƒì&quot; lowering but &quot;≈ç&quot; raising, points to an early difference in the articulation height of the two vowels that was not present in North Germanic. It could be seen as evidence that the lowering of &quot;ƒì&quot; to &quot;ƒÅ&quot; began in West Germanic at a time when final vowels were still long, and spread to North Germanic through the late Germanic dialect continuum, but only reaching the latter after the vowels had already been shortened.

====&quot;ƒì‚ÇÅ&quot; and &quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot;====

&quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot; is uncertain as a phoneme and only reconstructed from a small number of words; it is posited by the comparative method because whereas all provable instances of inherited (PIE) &quot;&quot; (PGmc. ) are distributed in Gothic as &quot;ƒì&quot; and the other Germanic languages as *&quot;ƒÅ&quot;, all the Germanic languages agree on some occasions of &quot;ƒì&quot; (e.g., Goth/OE/ON &#x27;here&#x27; ‚Üê late PGmc. ). Gothic makes no orthographic and therefore presumably no phonetic distinction between &quot;ƒì‚ÇÅ&quot; and &quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot;, but the existence of two Proto-Germanic long &quot;e&quot;-like phonemes is supported by the existence of two &quot;e&quot;-like Elder Futhark runes, Ehwaz and Eihwaz.

Krahe treats &quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot; (secondary &quot;ƒì&quot;) as identical with &quot;ƒ´&quot;. It probably continues PIE &quot;ƒìi&quot;, and it may have been in the process of transition from a diphthong to a long simple vowel in the Proto-Germanic period. Lehmann lists the following origins for &quot;ƒì‚ÇÇ&quot;:
* &quot;ƒìi&quot;: Old High German , &#x27;ham&#x27;, Goth &#x27;side, flank&#x27; ‚Üê PGmc ‚Üê ‚Üê PIE *&quot;&quot;-.
* &quot;ea&quot;: The preterite of class 7 strong verbs with &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;al&quot; or &quot;an&quot; plus a consonant, or &quot;ƒì‚ÇÅ&quot;; e.g. OHG &#x27;to plow&#x27; ‚Üê vs. preterite &quot;iar&quot;, &quot;ier&quot; ‚Üê 
* &quot;iz&quot;, after loss of -&quot;z&quot;: OEng , OHG &#x27;reward&#x27; (vs. OEng , Goth ) ‚Üê PGmc ‚Üê ‚Üê PIE *&quot;.
* Certain pronominal forms, e.g. OEng , OHG &#x27;here&#x27; ‚Üê PGmc , derivative of - &#x27;this&#x27; ‚Üê PIE *&quot; &#x27;this&#x27;
* Words borrowed from Latin &quot;ƒì&quot; or &quot;e&quot; in the root syllable after a certain period (older loans also show &quot;ƒ´&quot;).

====Nasal vowels====

Proto-Germanic developed nasal vowels from two sources. The earlier and much more frequent source was word-final &quot;-n&quot; (from PIE &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-m&quot;) in unstressed syllables, which at first gave rise to short &quot;-ƒÖ&quot;, &quot;-ƒØ&quot;, &quot;-≈≥&quot;, long &quot;-ƒØÃÑ&quot;, &quot;-ƒôÃÑ&quot;, &quot;-ƒÖÃÑ&quot;, and overlong &quot;-ƒôÃÇ&quot;, &quot;-ƒÖÃÇ&quot;. &quot;-ƒôÃÑ&quot; and &quot;-ƒôÃÇ&quot; then merged into &quot;-ƒÖÃÑ&quot; and &quot;-ƒÖÃÇ&quot;, which later developed into &quot;-«≠&quot; and &quot;-«´ÃÇ&quot;. Another source, developing only in late Proto-Germanic times, was in the sequences &quot;-inh-&quot;, &quot;-anh-&quot;, &quot;-unh-&quot;, in which the nasal consonant lost its occlusion and was converted into lengthening and nasalisation of the preceding vowel, becoming &quot;-ƒÖÃÑh-&quot;, &quot;-ƒØÃÑh-&quot;, &quot;-≈≥ÃÑh-&quot; (still written as &quot;-anh-&quot;, &quot;-inh-&quot;, &quot;-unh-&quot; in this article).

In many cases, the nasality was not contrastive and was merely present as an additional surface articulation. No Germanic language that preserves the word-final vowels has their nasality preserved. Word-final short nasal vowels do not show different reflexes compared to non-nasal vowels. However, the comparative method does require a three-way phonemic distinction between word-final &quot;*-≈ç&quot;, &quot;*-«≠&quot; and &quot;*-≈çn&quot;, which each has a distinct pattern of reflexes in the later Germanic languages:

The distinct reflexes of nasal &quot;-«≠&quot; versus non-nasal &quot;-≈ç&quot; are caused by the Northwest Germanic raising of final &quot;-≈ç&quot; to , which did not affect &quot;-«≠&quot;. When the vowels were shortened and denasalised, these two vowels no longer had the same place of articulation, and did not merge: &quot;-≈ç&quot; became (later ) while &quot;-«≠&quot; became (later ). This allowed their reflexes to stay distinct.

The nasality of word-internal vowels (from &quot;-nh-&quot;) was more stable, and survived into the early dialects intact.

Phonemic nasal vowels definitely occurred in Proto-Norse and Old Norse. They were preserved in Old Icelandic down to at least 1125, the earliest possible time for the creation of the &quot;First Grammatical Treatise&quot;, which documents nasal vowels. The PG nasal vowels from &quot;-nh-&quot; sequences were preserved in Old Icelandic as shown by examples given in the &quot;First Grammatical Treatise&quot;. For example:
* &#x27;shark&#x27; &lt; &lt; PG 
* &#x27;younger&#x27; &lt; &lt; PG (cf. Gothic )
The phonemicity is evident from minimal pairs like &#x27;younger&#x27; vs. &#x27;vex&#x27; &lt; , cognate with English &quot;weary&quot;. The inherited Proto-Germanic nasal vowels were joined in Old Norse by nasal vowels from other sources, e.g. loss of &quot;*n&quot; before &quot;s&quot;. Modern Elfdalian still includes nasal vowels that directly derive from Old Norse, e.g. &#x27;goose&#x27; &lt; Old Norse (presumably nasalized, although not so written); cf. German , showing the original consonant.

Similar surface (possibly phonemic) nasal/non-nasal contrasts occurred in the West Germanic languages down through Proto-Anglo-Frisian of 400 or so. Proto-Germanic medial nasal vowels were inherited, but were joined by new nasal vowels resulting from the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, which extended the loss of nasal consonants (only before &quot;-h-&quot; in Proto-Germanic) to all environments before a fricative (thus including &quot;-mf-&quot;, &quot;-n√æ-&quot; and &quot;-ns-&quot; as well). The contrast between nasal and non-nasal long vowels is reflected in the differing output of nasalized long &quot;*ƒÖÃÑ&quot;, which was raised to &quot;≈ç&quot; in Old English and Old Frisian whereas non-nasal &quot;*ƒÅ&quot; appeared as fronted &quot;«£&quot;. Hence:
* English &quot;goose&quot;, West Frisian , North Frisian &lt; Old English/Frisian &lt; Anglo-Frisian &lt; Proto-Germanic 
* En &quot;tooth&quot; &lt; Old English , Old Frisian &lt; Anglo-Frisian &lt; Proto-Germanic 
* En &quot;brought&quot;, WFris &lt; Old English , Old Frisian &lt; Anglo-Frisian &lt; Proto-Germanic (the past participle of ).

===Phonotactics===
Proto-Germanic allowed any single consonant to occur in one of three positions: initial, medial and final. However, clusters could only consist of two consonants unless followed by a suffix, and only certain clusters were possible in certain positions.

It allowed the following clusters in initial and medial position:
* Non-dental + &quot;l&quot;: &quot;pl&quot;, &quot;kl&quot;, &quot;fl&quot;, &quot;hl&quot;, &quot;sl&quot;, &quot;bl&quot;, &quot;gl&quot;, &quot;wl&quot;
* Non-alveolar + &quot;r&quot;: &quot;pr&quot;, &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;kr&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;, &quot;√ær&quot;, &quot;hr&quot;, &quot;br&quot;, &quot;dr&quot;, &quot;gr&quot;, &quot;wr&quot;
* Non-labial + &quot;w&quot;: &quot;tw&quot;, &quot;dw&quot;, &quot;kw&quot;, &quot;√æw&quot;, &quot;hw&quot;, &quot;sw&quot;
* Voiceless velar + &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot; + nasal: &quot;kn&quot;, &quot;hn&quot;, &quot;sm&quot;, &quot;sn&quot;

It allowed the following clusters in medial position only:
* Dental + &quot;l&quot;: &quot;tl&quot;, &quot;dl&quot;, &quot;√æl&quot;
* Liquid or labial + &quot;w&quot;: &quot;lw&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;
* Geminates: &quot;pp&quot;, &quot;tt&quot;, &quot;kk&quot;, &quot;ss&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;dd&quot;, &quot;gg&quot;, &quot;mm&quot;, &quot;nn&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;rr&quot;, &quot;jj&quot;, &quot;ww&quot;
* Consonant + &quot;j&quot;: &quot;pj&quot;, &quot;tj&quot;, &quot;kj&quot;, &quot;fj&quot;, &quot;√æj&quot;, &quot;hj&quot;, &quot;zj&quot;, &quot;bj&quot;, &quot;dj&quot;, &quot;gj&quot;, &quot;mj&quot;, &quot;nj&quot;, &quot;lj&quot;, &quot;rj&quot;, &quot;wj&quot;

It allowed continuant + obstruent clusters in medial and final position only:
* Fricative + obstruent: &quot;ft&quot;, &quot;ht&quot;, &quot;fs&quot;, &quot;hs&quot;, &quot;zd&quot;
* Nasal + obstruent: &quot;mp&quot;, &quot;mf&quot;, &quot;ms&quot;, &quot;mb&quot;, &quot;nt&quot;, &quot;nk&quot;, &quot;n√æ&quot;, &quot;nh&quot;, &quot;ns&quot;, &quot;nd&quot;, &quot;ng&quot; (however &quot;nh&quot; was simplified to &quot;h&quot;, with nasalisation and lengthening of the previous vowel, in late Proto-Germanic)
* Liquid + obstruent: &quot;lp&quot;, &quot;lt&quot;, &quot;lk&quot;, &quot;lf&quot;, &quot;l√æ&quot;, &quot;lh&quot;, &quot;ls&quot;, &quot;lb&quot;, &quot;ld&quot;, &quot;lg&quot;, &quot;lm&quot;, &quot;rp&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;, &quot;rk&quot;, &quot;rf&quot;, &quot;r√æ&quot;, &quot;rh&quot;, &quot;rs&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;, &quot;rd&quot;, &quot;rg&quot;, &quot;rm&quot;, &quot;rn&quot;

The &quot;s&quot; + voiceless plosive clusters (&quot;sp&quot;, &quot;st&quot;, &quot;sk&quot;) could appear in any position in a word.

===Later developments===
Due to the emergence of a word-initial stress accent, vowels in unstressed syllables were gradually reduced over time, beginning at the very end of the Proto-Germanic period and continuing into the history of the various dialects. Already in Proto-Germanic, word-final and had been lost, and had merged with in unstressed syllables. Vowels in third syllables were also generally lost before dialect diversification began, such as final &quot;-i&quot; of some present tense verb endings, and in &quot;-maz&quot; and &quot;-miz&quot; of the dative plural ending and first person plural present of verbs.

Word-final short nasal vowels were however preserved longer, as is reflected in Proto-Norse which still preserved word-final &quot;-ƒÖ&quot; ( on the Gallehus horns), while the dative plural appears as &quot;-mz&quot; ( on the Stentoften Runestone). Somewhat greater reduction is found in Gothic, which lost all final-syllable short vowels except &quot;u&quot;. Old High German and Old English initially preserved unstressed &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, but later lost them in long-stemmed words and then Old High German lost them in many short-stemmed ones as well, by analogy.

Old English shows indirect evidence that word-final &quot;-ƒÖ&quot; was preserved into the separate history of the language. This can be seen in the infinitive ending &quot;-an&quot; (&lt; ) and the strong past participle ending &quot;-en&quot; (&lt; ). Since the early Old English fronting of to did not occur in nasalized vowels or before back vowels, this created a vowel alternation because the nasality of the back vowel &quot;ƒÖ&quot; in the infinitive ending prevented the fronting of the preceding vowel: *&quot;-anƒÖ&quot; &gt; *&quot;-an&quot;, but *&quot;-anaz&quot; &gt; *&quot;-√¶n√¶&quot; &gt; *&quot;-en&quot;. Therefore, the Anglo-Frisian brightening must necessarily have occurred very early in the history of the Anglo-Frisian languages, before the loss of final &quot;-ƒÖ&quot;.

The outcome of final vowels and combinations in the various daughters is shown in the table below:

Some Proto-Germanic endings have merged in all of the literary languages but are still distinct in runic Proto-Norse, e.g. &quot;*-ƒ´z&quot; vs. &quot;*-ijaz&quot; ( &#x27;three daughters&#x27; in the Tune stone vs. the name in the Gallehus horns).

==Morphology==

Reconstructions are tentative and multiple versions with varying degrees of difference exist. All reconstructed forms are marked with an asterisk (*).

It is often asserted that the Germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with Greek, Latin, or Sanskrit. Although this is true to some extent, it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of Germanic than to any inherent &quot;simplicity&quot; of the Germanic languages. As an example, there are less than 500 years between the Gothic Gospels of 360 and the Old High German Tatian of 830, yet Old High German, despite being the most archaic of the West Germanic languages, is missing a large number of archaic features present in Gothic, including dual and passive markings on verbs, reduplication in Class VII strong verb past tenses, the vocative case, and second-position (Wackernagel&#x27;s Law) clitics. Many more archaic features may have been lost between the Proto-Germanic of 200¬†BC or so and the attested Gothic language. Furthermore, Proto-Romance and Middle Indic of the fourth century AD‚Äîcontemporaneous with Gothic‚Äîwere significantly simpler than Latin and Sanskrit, respectively, and overall probably no more archaic than Gothic. In addition, some parts of the inflectional systems of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit were innovations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European.

===General morphological features===
Proto-Germanic had six cases, three genders, three numbers, three moods (indicative, subjunctive (PIE optative), imperative), and two voices (active and passive (PIE middle)). This is quite similar to the state of Latin, Greek, and Middle Indic of AD¬†200.

Nouns and adjectives were declined in (at least) six cases: vocative, nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, genitive. The locative case had merged into the dative case, and the ablative may have merged with either the genitive, dative or instrumental cases. However, sparse remnants of the earlier locative and ablative cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms. Pronouns were declined similarly, although without a separate vocative form. The instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular; the instrumental survives only in the West Germanic languages, and the vocative only in Gothic.

Verbs and pronouns had three numbers: singular, dual, and plural. Although the pronominal dual survived into all the oldest languages, the verbal dual survived only into Gothic, and the (presumed) nominal and adjectival dual forms were lost before the oldest records. As in the Italic languages, it may have been lost before Proto-Germanic became a different branch at all.

===Consonant and vowel alternations===
Several sound changes occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic that were triggered only in some environments but not in others. Some of these were grammaticalised while others were still triggered by phonetic rules and were partially allophonic or surface filters.

Probably the most far-reaching alternation was between [*f, *√æ, *s, *h, *hw] and [*b, *d, *z, *g, *gw], the voiceless and voiced fricatives, known as Grammatischer Wechsel and triggered by the earlier operation of Verner&#x27;s law. It was found in various environments:
* In the person-and-number endings of verbs, which were voiceless in weak verbs and voiced in strong verbs.
* Between different grades of strong verbs. The voiceless alternants appeared in the present and past singular indicative, the voiced alternants in the remaining past tense forms.
* Between strong verbs (voiceless) and causative verbs derived from them (voiced).
* Between verbs and derived nouns.
* Between the singular and plural forms of some nouns.

Another form of alternation was triggered by the Germanic spirant law, which continued to operate into the separate history of the individual daughter languages. It is found in environments with suffixal -t, including:
* The second-person singular past ending *-t of strong verbs.
* The past tense of weak verbs with no vowel infix in the past tense.
* Nouns derived from verbs by means of the suffixes *-tiz, *-tuz, *-taz, which also possessed variants in -√æ- and -d- when not following an obstruent.

An alternation not triggered by sound change was Sievers&#x27; law, which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- depending on the length of the preceding part of the morpheme. If preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant, -j- appeared. In all other cases, such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, by two or more consonants, or by more than one syllable, -ij- appeared. The distinction between morphemes and words is important here, as the alternant -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable. A notable example was the verb suffix *-atjanƒÖ, which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word.

Related to the above was the alternation between -j- and -i-, and likewise between -ij- and -ƒ´-. This was caused by the earlier loss of -j- before -i-, and appeared whenever an ending was attached to a verb or noun with an -(i)j- suffix (which were numerous). Similar, but much more rare, was an alternation between -aV- and -aiC- from the loss of -j- between two vowels, which appeared in the present subjunctive of verbs: *-a≈≥ &lt; *-aj≈≥ in the first person, *-ai- in the others. A combination of these two effects created an alternation between -ƒÅ- and -ai- found in class 3 weak verbs, with -ƒÅ- &lt; -aja- &lt; -…ôja- and -ai- &lt; -…ôi- &lt; -…ôji-.

I-mutation was the most important source of vowel alternation, and continued well into the history of the individual daughter languages (although it was either absent or not apparent in Gothic). In Proto-Germanic, only -e- was affected, which was raised by -i- or -j- in the following syllable. Examples are numerous:
* Verb endings beginning with -i-: present second and third person singular, third person plural.
* Noun endings beginning with -i- in u-stem nouns: dative singular, nominative and genitive plural.
* Causatives derived from strong verbs with a -j- suffix.
* Verbs derived from nouns with a -j- suffix.
* Nouns derived from verbs with a -j- suffix.

===Nouns===
The system of nominal declensions was largely inherited from PIE. Primary nominal declensions were the stems in /a/, /≈ç/, /n/, /i/, and /u/. The first three were particularly important and served as the basis of adjectival declension; there was a tendency for nouns of all other classes to be drawn into them. The first two had variants in /ja/ and /wa/, and /j≈ç/ and /w≈ç/, respectively; originally, these were declined exactly like other nouns of the respective class, but later sound changes tended to distinguish these variants as their own subclasses. The /n/ nouns had various subclasses, including /≈çn/ (masculine and feminine), /an/ (neuter), and /ƒ´n/ (feminine, mostly abstract nouns). There was also a smaller class of root nouns (ending in various consonants), nouns of relationship (ending in /er/), and neuter nouns in /z/ (this class was greatly expanded in German). Present participles, and a few nouns, ended in /nd/. The neuter nouns of all classes differed from the masculines and feminines in their nominative and accusative endings, which were alike.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives agree with the noun they qualify in case, number, and gender. Adjectives evolved into strong and weak declensions, originally with indefinite and definite meaning, respectively. As a result of its definite meaning, the weak form came to be used in the daughter languages in conjunction with demonstratives and definite articles. The terms &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; are based on the later development of these declensions in languages such as German and Old English, where the strong declensions have more distinct endings. In the proto-language, as in Gothic, such terms have no relevance. The strong declension was based on a combination of the nominal /a/ and /≈ç/ stems with the PIE pronominal endings; the weak declension was based on the nominal /n/ declension.
===Determiners===
Proto-Germanic originally had two demonstratives (proximal // &#x27;this&#x27;, distal // &#x27;that&#x27;) which could serve as both adjectives and pronouns. The proximal was already obsolescent in Gothic (e.g. Goth acc. , dat. , neut. ) and appears entirely absent in North Germanic. In the West Germanic languages, it evolved into a third-person pronoun, displacing the inherited &quot;*iz&quot; in the northern languages while being ousted itself in the southern languages (i.e. Old High German). This is the basis of the distinction between English &quot;him&quot;/&quot;her&quot; (with &quot;h-&quot; from the original proximal demonstrative) and German / (lacking &quot;h-&quot;).

Ultimately, only the distal survived in the function of demonstrative. In most languages, it developed a second role as definite article, and underlies both the English determiners &quot;the&quot; and &quot;that&quot;. In the North-West Germanic languages (but not in Gothic), a new proximal demonstrative (&#x27;this&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;that&#x27;) evolved by appending &quot;-si&quot; to the distal demonstrative (e.g. Runic Norse nom.sg. , gen. , dat. ), with complex subsequent developments in the various daughter languages. The new demonstrative underlies the English determiners &quot;this&quot;, &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot;. (Originally, &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot; were dialectal variants of the masculine plural of &quot;this&quot;.)

===Verbs===
Proto-Germanic had only two tenses (past and present), compared to 5‚Äì7 in Greek, Latin, Proto-Slavic and Sanskrit. Some of this difference is due to deflexion, featured by a loss of tenses present in Proto-Indo-European. For example, Donald Ringe assumes for Proto-Germanic an early loss of the PIE imperfect aspect (something that also occurred in most other branches), followed by merging of the aspectual categories present-aorist and the mood categories indicative-subjunctive. (This assumption allows him to account for cases where Proto-Germanic has present indicative verb forms that look like PIE aorist subjunctives.)

However, many of the tenses of the other languages (e.g. future, future perfect, pluperfect, Latin imperfect) are not cognate with each other and represent separate innovations in each language. For example, the Greek future uses a &quot;-s-&quot; ending, apparently derived from a desiderative construction that in PIE was part of the system of derivational morphology (not the inflectional system); the Sanskrit future uses a &quot;-sy-&quot; ending, from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from Greek; while the Latin future uses endings derived either from the PIE subjunctive or from the PIE verb * &#x27;to be&#x27;. Similarly, the Latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from Italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding Greek or Sanskrit forms; and while the Greek and Sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate, there are no parallels in any other Indo-European languages, leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared Greek-Sanskrit innovation or separate, coincidental developments in the two languages. In this respect, Proto-Germanic can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses. Later Germanic languages did innovate new tenses, derived through periphrastic constructions, with Modern English likely possessing the most elaborated tense system (&quot;Yes, the house will still be being built a month from now&quot;). On the other hand, even the past tense was later lost (or widely lost) in most High German dialects as well as in Afrikaans.

Verbs in Proto-Germanic were divided into two main groups, called &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, according to the way the past tense is formed. Strong verbs use ablaut (i.e. a different vowel in the stem) and/or reduplication (derived primarily from the Proto-Indo-European perfect), while weak verbs use a dental suffix (now generally held to be a reflex of the reduplicated imperfect of PIE originally &#x27;put&#x27;, in Germanic &#x27;do&#x27;). Strong verbs were divided into seven main classes while weak verbs were divided into five main classes (although no attested language has more than four classes of weak verbs). Strong verbs generally have no suffix in the present tense, although some have a &quot;-j-&quot; suffix that is a direct continuation of the PIE &quot;-y-&quot; suffix, and a few have an &quot;-n-&quot; suffix or infix that continues the &quot;-n-&quot; infix of PIE. Almost all weak verbs have a present-tense suffix, which varies from class to class. An additional small, but very important, group of verbs formed their present tense from the PIE perfect (and their past tense like weak verbs); for this reason, they are known as preterite-present verbs. All three of the previously mentioned groups of verbs‚Äîstrong, weak and preterite-present‚Äîare derived from PIE thematic verbs; an additional very small group derives from PIE athematic verbs, and one verb &#x27;to want&#x27; forms its present indicative from the PIE optative mood.

Proto-Germanic verbs have three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The subjunctive mood derives from the PIE optative mood. Indicative and subjunctive moods are fully conjugated throughout the present and past, while the imperative mood existed only in the present tense and lacked first-person forms. Proto-Germanic verbs have two voices, active and passive, the latter deriving from the PIE mediopassive voice. The Proto-Germanic passive existed only in the present tense (an inherited feature, as the PIE perfect had no mediopassive). On the evidence of Gothic‚Äîthe only Germanic language with a reflex of the Proto-Germanic passive‚Äîthe passive voice had a significantly reduced inflectional system, with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural. Note that although Old Norse (like modern Faroese and Icelandic) has an inflected mediopassive, it is not inherited from Proto-Germanic, but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice.

Although most Proto-Germanic strong verbs are formed directly from a verbal root, weak verbs are generally derived from an existing noun, verb or adjective (so-called denominal, deverbal and deadjectival verbs). For example, a significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) causative verbs. These are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs. PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented suffix &quot;-√©iÃØe/√©iÃØo&quot; to the &quot;o&quot;-grade of a non-derived verb. In Proto-Germanic, causatives are formed by adding a suffix &quot;-j/ij-&quot; (the reflex of PIE &quot;-√©iÃØe/√©iÃØo&quot;) to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE &quot;o&quot;-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with Verner&#x27;s Law voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the &quot;-√©iÃØe/√©iÃØo&quot; suffix). Examples:
* (class 1) &#x27;to bite&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to bridle, yoke, restrain&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to make bite down&#x27;
* (class 1) &#x27;to rise&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to raise&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to rise&#x27;
* (class 2) &#x27;to bend&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to bend (transitive)&#x27;
* (class 3) &#x27;to burn&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to burn (transitive)&#x27;
* (class 3) &#x27;to perish&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to destroy&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to perish&#x27;
* (class 5) &#x27;to survive&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to save&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to survive&#x27;
* (class 5) &#x27;to lie down&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to lay&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to lie down&#x27;
* (class 6) &#x27;to travel, go&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to lead, bring&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to go&#x27;, &#x27;to carry across&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to travel&#x27; (an archaic instance of the &quot;o&quot;-grade ablaut used despite the differing past-tense ablaut)
* (class 7) &#x27;to weep&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to cause to weep&#x27;
* (class 1, preterite-present) &#x27;(s)he knows&#x27; ‚Üí &#x27;to teach&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;to cause to know&#x27;

As in other Indo-European languages, a verb in Proto-Germanic could have a preverb attached to it, modifying its meaning (cf. e.g. &#x27;to perish&#x27;, derived from &#x27;to become&#x27;). In Proto-Germanic, the preverb was still a clitic that could be separated from the verb (as also in Gothic, as shown by the behavior of second-position clitics, e.g. &#x27;and then he seized&#x27;, with clitics &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;then&#x27; interpolated into &#x27;he seized&#x27;) rather than a bound morpheme that is permanently attached to the verb. At least in Gothic, preverbs could also be stacked one on top of the other (similar to Sanskrit, different from Latin), e.g. &#x27;to reconcile&#x27;.

An example verb: &#x27;to take&#x27; (class 4 strong verb).

==Schleicher&#x27;s PIE fable rendered into Proto-Germanic==
August Schleicher wrote a fable in the PIE language he had just reconstructed, which, though it has been updated a few times by others, still bears his name. Below is a rendering of this fable into Proto-Germanic.

The first is a direct phonetic evolution of the PIE text. It does not take into account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period. For example, the original text uses the imperfect tense, which disappeared in Proto-Germanic. The second version takes these differences into account, and is therefore closer to the language the Germanic people would have actually spoken.

<text>Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is a country at the eastern edge of mainland Southeast Asia, with an area of about and a population of over 100¬†million, making it the world&#x27;s fifteenth-most populous country. One of the two Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states in Southeast Asia, Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.

Vietnam was inhabited by the Paleolithic age, with states established in the first millennium BC on the Red River Delta in modern-day northern Vietnam. Before the Han dynasty‚Äôs invasion, Vietnam was marked by a vibrant mix of religion, culture, and social norms. The Han dynasty annexed Northern and Central Vietnam, which were subsequently under Chinese rule from 111 BC until the first dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta, conquering Champa. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was effectively divided into two domains of ƒê√†ng Trong and ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i. The Nguy·ªÖn‚Äîthe last imperial dynasty‚Äîsurrendered to France in 1883. In 1887, its territory was integrated into French Indochina as three separate regions. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the nationalist coalition Viet Minh, led by the communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, launched the August Revolution and declared Vietnam&#x27;s independence from the Empire of Japan in 1945.

Vietnam went through prolonged warfare in the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. As a result of the treaties signed between the Viet Minh and France, Vietnam was also separated into two parts. The Vietnam War began shortly after, between the communist North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the anti-communist South Vietnam, supported by the United States. Upon the North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in 1976. An ineffective planned economy, a trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country further. In 1986, the CPV initiated economic and political reforms similar to the Chinese economic reform, transforming the country to a socialist-oriented market economy. The reforms facilitated Vietnamese reintegration into the global economy and politics.

Vietnam is a developing country with a lower-middle-income economy. It has high levels of corruption, censorship, environmental issues and a poor human rights record. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including the ASEAN, the APEC, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OIF, and the WTO. It has assumed a seat on the United Nations Security Council twice.

== Etymology ==

The name (, ch·ªØ H√°n: ), literally &quot;Viet South&quot;, means &quot;Viet of the South&quot; per Vietnamese word order or &quot;South of the Viet&quot; per Classical Chinese word order. A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Vi·ªát, ), was first documented in the 2nd century BC. The term &quot;&quot; (Yue) () in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph &quot;Êàâ&quot; for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as &quot;Ë∂ä&quot;. At that time, it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south.

Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC, &#x27;Yue&#x27;/&#x27;Vi·ªát&#x27; referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC, the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: L·∫°c Vi·ªát), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (B√°ch Vi·ªát, ).

The term &#x27;Baiyue&#x27;/&#x27;B√°ch Vi·ªát&#x27; first appeared in the book &quot;L√ºshi Chunqiu&quot; compiled around 239 BC. By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as &quot;ng∆∞·ªùi Vi·ªát&quot; (Viet people) or &quot;ng∆∞·ªùi Nam&quot; (southern people).

The form () is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem &quot;S·∫•m Tr·∫°ng Tr√¨nh&quot;. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in H·∫£i Ph√≤ng that dates to 1558. In 1802, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title &#x27;King of Nam Vi·ªát / Nanyue&#x27; ( in Chinese character) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused because the name was related to Zhao Tuo&#x27;s Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area &quot;Vi·ªát Nam&quot; instead, meaning &quot;South of the Viet&quot; per Classical Chinese word order but the Vietnamese understood it as &quot;Viet of the South&quot; per Vietnamese word order. Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long. It was revived in the early 20th century in Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u&#x27;s &quot;History of the Loss of Vietnam&quot;, and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDƒê). The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when the imperial government in Hu·∫ø adopted .

== History ==

=== Prehistory and early history ===
Archaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age. Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago, based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam. &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in L·∫°ng S∆°n and Ngh·ªá An provinces in northern Vietnam. The oldest &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum. Teeth attributed to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, Lang Gao and Lang Cuom. Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archaeological research.

By about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture, notable for its bronze casting used to make elaborate bronze ƒê√¥ng S∆°n drums. At this point, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of VƒÉn Lang and √Çu L·∫°c appeared, and the culture&#x27;s influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.

=== Dynastic Vietnam ===

According to Vietnamese legends, H·ªìng B√†ng dynasty of the H√πng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as X√≠ch Qu·ª∑ and later VƒÉn Lang). In 257 BC, the last H√πng king was defeated by Th·ª•c Ph√°n. He consolidated the L·∫°c Vi·ªát and √Çu Vi·ªát tribes to form the √Çu L·∫°c, proclaiming himself An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng. In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (&quot;Tri·ªáu ƒê√†&quot;) defeated An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng and consolidated √Çu L·∫°c into Nanyue. However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han‚ÄìNanyue War. For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule. Early independence movements, such as those of the Tr∆∞ng Sisters and Lady Tri·ªáu, were temporarily successful, though the region gained a longer period of independence as V·∫°n Xu√¢n under the Anterior L√Ω dynasty between AD 544 and 602. By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Kh√∫c family.

In AD 938, the Vietnamese lord Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn defeated the forces of the Chinese Southern Han state at B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng River and achieved full independence for Vietnam in 939 after a millennium of Chinese domination. By the 960s, the dynastic ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (&quot;Great Viet&quot;) kingdom was established, Vietnamese society enjoyed a golden era under the L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn dynasties. During the rule of the Tr·∫ßn dynasty, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát repelled three Mongol invasions. Meanwhile, the MahƒÅyƒÅna branch of Buddhism flourished and became the state religion. Following the 1406‚Äì7 Ming‚ÄìH·ªì War, which overthrew the H·ªì dynasty, Vietnamese independence was interrupted briefly by the Chinese Ming dynasty, but was restored by L√™ L·ª£i, the founder of the L√™ dynasty. The Vietnamese polity reached their zenith in the L√™ dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng (1460‚Äì1497). Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese polity expanded southward in a gradual process known as (&quot;Southward expansion&quot;), eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Kingdom.

From the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. First, the Chinese-supported M·∫°c dynasty challenged the L√™ dynasty&#x27;s power. After the M·∫°c dynasty was defeated, the L√™ dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern Tr·ªãnh lords and the southern Nguy·ªÖn lords, who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s. Vietnam was divided into North (Tr·ªãnh) and South (Nguy·ªÖn) from 1600 to 1777. During this period, the Nguy·ªÖn expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta, annexing the Central Highlands and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta. The division of the country ended a century later when the T√¢y S∆°n brothers helped Tr·ªãnh to end Nguy·ªÖn, they also established new dynasty and ended Tr·ªãnh. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguy·ªÖn lords, led by Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh unified Vietnam, and established the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, ruling under the name Gia Long.

=== French Indochina ===
In the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Ch√†m Islands to mark their presence. By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan. After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau‚ÄìJapan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with H·ªôi An. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the &quot;Padroado&quot; system were active in both Vietnamese realms of &quot;ƒê√†ng Trong&quot; (Cochinchina or Quinan) and &quot;ƒê√†ng Ngo√†i&quot; (Tonkin) in the 17th century. The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk. Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with H·ªôi An failed following a violent incident involving the East India Company. By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Ph·ªë Hi·∫øn.

Between 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in Vietnam. The first French missionaries arrived in 1658, under the Portuguese &quot;Padroado&quot;. From its foundation, the Paris Foreign Missions Society under &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; actively sent missionaries to Vietnam, entering Cochinchina first in 1664 and Tonkin first in 1666. Spanish Dominicans joined the Tonkin mission in 1676, and Franciscans were in Cochinchina from 1719 to 1834. The Vietnamese authorities began to feel threatened by continuous Christianisation activities. After several Catholic missionaries were detained, the French Navy intervened in 1843 to free them, as the kingdom was perceived as xenophobic. In a series of conquests from 1859 to 1885, France eroded Vietnam&#x27;s sovereignty. At the siege of Tourane in 1858, France was aided by Spain (with Filipino, Latin American, and Spanish troops from the Philippines) and perhaps some Tonkinese Catholics. After the 1862 Treaty, and especially after France completely conquered Lower Cochinchina in 1867, the VƒÉn Th√¢n movement of scholar-gentry class arose and committed violence against Catholics across central and northern Vietnam.

Between 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country was under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887. The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society. A Western-style system of modern education introduced new humanist values. Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in Saigon, and in Hanoi, the colony&#x27;s capital.

During the colonial period, guerrillas of the royalist C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement rebelled against French rule and massacred around a third of Vietnam&#x27;s Christian population. After a decade of resistance, they were defeated in the 1890s by the Catholics in reprisal for their earlier massacres. Another large-scale rebellion, the Th√°i Nguy√™n uprising, was also suppressed heavily. The French developed a plantation economy to promote export of tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee. However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government. An increasing dissatisfaction, even led to half-hearted, badly co-ordinated, and still worsely executed plots to oust the French, like the infamous Hanoi Poison Plot of 1908.

A nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, Phan Ch√¢u Trinh, Phan ƒê√¨nh Ph√πng, Emperor H√†m Nghi, and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh fighting or calling for independence. This resulted in the 1930 Y√™n B√°i mutiny by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDƒê), which the French quashed. The mutiny split the independence movement, as many leading members converted to communism.

The French maintained full control of their colonies until World War II, when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Afterwards, the Japanese Empire was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while the pro-Vichy French colonial administration continued. Japan exploited Vietnam&#x27;s natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945. This led to the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 which killed up to two million people.

=== First Indochina War ===
In 1941, the Vi·ªát Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh. The Vi·ªát Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation. After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon&#x27;s administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread. The Vi·ªát Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.

In July 1945, the Allies had decided to divide Indochina at the 16th parallel to allow Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to receive the Japanese surrender in the north while Britain&#x27;s Lord Louis Mountbatten received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.
But as the French were weakened by the German occupation, British-Indian forces and the remaining Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group were used to maintain order and help France reestablish control through the 1945‚Äì1946 War in Vietnam. H·ªì initially chose to take a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France, asking the French to withdraw their colonial administrators and for French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam. But the Provisional Government of the French Republic did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule. This resulted in the Vi·ªát Minh launching a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946. The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954. The defeat of French colonialists and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß allowed H·ªì to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.

The colonial administration was thereby ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 into three countries‚ÄîVietnam, and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the Demilitarised Zone, roughly along the 17th parallel north (pending elections scheduled for July 1956). A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists. This migration was in large part aided by the United States military through Operation Passage to Freedom. The partition of Vietnam by the Geneva Accords was not intended to be permanent, and stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after the elections. But in 1955, the southern State of Vietnam&#x27;s prime minister, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, toppled B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. This effectively replaced the internationally recognised State of Vietnam by the Republic of Vietnam in the south‚Äîsupported by the United States, France, Laos, Republic of China and Thailand‚Äîand H·ªì&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, supported by the Soviet Union, Sweden, Khmer Rouge, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Vietnam War ===

From 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including &quot;rent reduction&quot; and &quot;land reform&quot;, which resulted in significant political repression. This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions. In the South, Di·ªám countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in &quot;political reeducation centres&quot;. This programme incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957. The pro-Hanoi Vi·ªát C·ªông began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Di·ªám&#x27;s government. From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.
In 1963, Buddhist discontent with Di·ªám&#x27;s Catholic regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown. This led to the collapse of Di·ªám&#x27;s relationship with the United States, and ultimately to a 1963 coup in which he and Nhu were assassinated. The Di·ªám era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ and General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu took control in mid-1965. Thi·ªáu gradually outmaneuvered K·ª≥ and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971. During this political instability, the communists began to gain ground. To support South Vietnam&#x27;s struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States used the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for increasing its contribution of military advisers. US forces became involved in ground combat operations by 1965, and at their peak several years later, numbered more than 500,000. The US also engaged in sustained aerial bombing. Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers. Communist forces supplying the Vi·ªát C·ªông carried supplies along the H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh trail, which passed through Laos.

The communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 T·∫øt Offensive. The campaign failed militarily, but shocked the American establishment and turned US public opinion against the war. During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Hu·∫ø. Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s. This also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise South Vietnam. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973. In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. South Vietnam was ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under North Vietnamese military occupation.

=== Reunification and reforms ===
====1970s====
On 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8¬†million people. A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4¬†million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974‚Äîincluding 415,000 killed. In its aftermath, under L√™ Du·∫©n&#x27;s administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears, but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour. The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories. Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war. In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Ki√™n Giang, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh. The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989. However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated.

====1980s to present====
At the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the &quot;old guard&quot; government with new leadership. The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Linh, who became the party&#x27;s new general secretary. He and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as (&quot;Renovation&quot;) that carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a &quot;socialist-oriented market economy&quot;. Although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under &quot;ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi&quot;, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries. Subsequently, Vietnam&#x27;s economy achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also resulted in a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.

In 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he was Vietnam&#x27;s most powerful leader in decades. He died 19 July 2024, and was followed by To Lam as General Secretary of the Communist Party.

== Geography ==
Vietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8¬∞ and 24¬∞N, and the longitudes 102¬∞ and 110¬∞E. It covers a total area of or . The combined length of the country&#x27;s land boundaries is , and its coastline is long. At its narrowest point in the central Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh province, the country is as little as across, though it widens to around in the north. Vietnam&#x27;s land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the country&#x27;s land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%. The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering , is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits. The delta, covering about , is a low-level plain no more than above sea level at any point. It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances into the sea every year. The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers in the South China Sea.
Southern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country&#x27;s arable land and 22% of its total forested land. The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation. Several minor earthquakes have been recorded. The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi PƒÉng), which is located in L√†o Cai province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing high. From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc is the largest. The Hang S∆°n ƒêo√≤ng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba B·ªÉ Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.

=== Climate ===

Due to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam&#x27;s climate tends to vary considerably for each region. During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture. The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north. Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between over the year. In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between . Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from in December and January to in July and August. During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border. Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems. The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons. Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas.

=== Biodiversity ===
As the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity. This was noted in the country&#x27;s National Environmental Condition Report in 2005. It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world&#x27;s species. 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic. Vietnam&#x27;s fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians. There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic. Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites‚Äîthe H·∫° Long Bay and Phong Nha-K·∫ª B√†ng National Park‚Äîtogether with nine biosphere reserves, including C·∫ßn Gi·ªù Mangrove Forest, C√°t Ti√™n, C√°t B√†, Ki√™n Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Ngh·ªá An, C√† Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park.

Vietnam is also home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish. In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam. Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards&#x27;s pheasant. In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in C√°t Ti√™n National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010. In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world&#x27;s twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species. The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07¬†million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.
In Vietnam, wildlife poaching has become a major concern. In 2000, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Education for Nature ‚Äì Vietnam was founded to instill in the population the importance of wildlife conservation in the country. In the years that followed, another NGO called GreenViet was formed by Vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection. Through collaboration between the NGOs and local authorities, many local poaching syndicates were crippled by their leaders&#x27; arrests. A study released in 2018 revealed Vietnam is a destination for the illegal export of rhinoceros horns from South Africa due to the demand for them as a medicine and a status symbol.

The main environmental concern that persists in Vietnam today is the legacy of the use of the chemical herbicide Agent Orange, which continues to cause birth defects and many health problems in the Vietnamese population. In the southern and central areas affected most by the chemical&#x27;s use during the Vietnam War, nearly 4.8¬†million Vietnamese people have been exposed to it and suffered from its effects. In 2012, approximately 50 years after the war, the US began a US$43¬†million joint clean-up project in the former chemical storage areas in Vietnam to take place in stages. Following the completion of the first phase in ƒê√† N·∫µng in late 2017, the US announced its commitment to clean other sites, especially in the heavily impacted site of Bi√™n H√≤a.

The Vietnamese government spends over VNƒê10¬†trillion each year ($431.1¬†million) for monthly allowances and the physical rehabilitation of victims of the chemicals. In 2018, the Japanese engineering group Shimizu Corporation, working with Vietnamese military, built a plant for the treatment of soil polluted by Agent Orange. Plant construction costs were funded by the company itself. One of the long-term plans to restore southern Vietnam&#x27;s damaged ecosystems is through the use of reforestation efforts. The Vietnamese government began doing this at the end of the war. It started by replanting mangrove forests in the Mekong Delta regions and in C·∫ßn Gi·ªù outside H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City, where mangroves are important to ease (though not eliminate) flood conditions during monsoon seasons. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 104th globally out of 172 countries.

Apart from herbicide problems, arsenic in the ground water in the Mekong and Red River Deltas has also become a major concern. And most notoriously, unexploded ordnances (UXO) pose dangers to humans and wildlife‚Äîanother bitter legacy from the long wars. As part of the continuous campaign to demine/remove UXOs, several international bomb removal agencies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and the US have been providing assistance. The Vietnam government spends over VNƒê1¬†trillion ($44¬†million) annually on demining operations and additional hundreds of billions of ƒë·ªìng for treatment, assistance, rehabilitation, vocational training and resettlement of the victims of UXOs.
== Government and politics ==

Vietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with &quot;The Economist&quot; characterising its leadership as &quot;ardently capitalist communists&quot;. Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country&#x27;s politics and society. The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy.
The general secretary of the CPV performs numerous key administrative functions, controlling the party&#x27;s national organisation. The prime minister is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of five deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. Only political organisations affiliated with or endorsed by the CPV are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.
The National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral state legislature composed of 500 members. Headed by a chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly. The Supreme People&#x27;s Court of Vietnam, headed by a chief justice, is the country&#x27;s highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People&#x27;s Court stand the provincial municipal courts and many local courts. Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of state security. Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences.

In 2023, a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam. President V√µ VƒÉn Th∆∞·ªüng, Prime Minister Ph·∫°m Minh Ch√≠nh (since 2021) and the most powerful leader Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng (since 2011) as the Communist Party of Vietnam&#x27;s General Secretary. On 22 May 2024, T√¥ L√¢m, who previously served as the Minister of Public Security, was voted as the president of Vietnam by the National Assembly after V√µ VƒÉn Th∆∞·ªüng resigned on the same year due to corruption charges against him. On 3 August 2024, T√¥ L√¢m, who is also serving as the president, was elected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam as the general secretary following the death of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng on 19 July 2024. On 21 October 2024, the National Assembly appointed army general L∆∞∆°ng C∆∞·ªùng as president, succeeding T√¥ L√¢m.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Vietnam is divided into 57 provinces (, ch·ªØ H√°n: ). There are also six municipalities (), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.


Provinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (, &#x27;city under province&#x27;), townships () and counties (), which are in turn subdivided into towns () or communes ().

Centrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts () and counties, which are further subdivided into wards ().

=== Foreign relations ===

Throughout its history, Vietnam&#x27;s main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties. Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc. Despite these differences, Vietnam&#x27;s sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence. These include the 11th-century patriotic poem &quot;&quot;Nam qu·ªëc s∆°n h√†&quot; and the 1428 proclamation of independence &quot;B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o&quot;&quot;. Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea. Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO). It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations. As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries.

Vietnam&#x27;s current foreign policy is to consistently implement a policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, co-operation, and development, as well openness, diversification, multilateralisation with international relations. The country declares itself a friend and partner of all countries in the international community, regardless of their political affiliation, by actively taking part in international and regional cooperative development projects. Since the 1990s, Vietnam has taken several key steps to restore diplomatic ties with capitalist Western countries. It already had relations with communist Western countries in the decades prior. Relations with the United States began improving in August 1995 with both states upgrading their &quot;liaison&quot; offices to embassy status. As diplomatic ties between the two governments grew, the United States opened a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City while Vietnam opened its consulate in San Francisco. Full diplomatic relations were also restored with New Zealand, which opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995; Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made a historic visit to Vietnam in November 2000. He was the first U.S. leader ever to officially visit Hanoi and the first to visit Vietnam since U.S. troops withdrew from the country in 1975. Pakistan also reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000, with Vietnam reopening its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005. In May 2016, US President Barack Obama further normalised relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam. Despite their historical past, today Vietnam is considered to be a potential ally of the United States, especially in the geopolitical context of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in containment of Chinese expansionism.

=== Military ===

The Vietnam People&#x27;s Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army (VPA), the Vietnam People&#x27;s Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia. The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People&#x27;s Ground Forces, the Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy, the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard. The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000. In 2015, Vietnam&#x27;s military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4¬†billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending. Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, India, Japan, Laos, Russia, Singapore and the US. In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

=== Human rights and sociopolitical issues ===

The government of Vietnam, reduced from a totalitarian system to an authoritarian one, carries many legacies of its past; the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted. Under the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed. Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer L√™ C√¥ng ƒê·ªãnh was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested. Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience. Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues.

== Economy ==


Throughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture‚Äîprimarily wet rice cultivation. Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam. Since reunification, the country&#x27;s economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises. Under strict state control, Vietnam&#x27;s economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction. With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development.

In 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the CPV introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the reform programme. Private ownership began to be encouraged in industry, commerce and agriculture and state enterprises were restructured to operate under market constraints. This led to the five-year economic plans being replaced by the socialist-oriented market mechanism. As a result of these reforms, Vietnam achieved approximately 8% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1990 and 1997. The United States ended its economic embargo against Vietnam in early 1994. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused an economic slowdown to 4‚Äì5% growth per year, its economy began to recover in 1999, and grew at around 7% per year from 2000 to 2005, one of the fastest in the world. On 11 January 2007, Vietnam became the 150th member of the WTO (World Trade Organization). According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), growth remained strong despite the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010. Vietnam&#x27;s year-on-year inflation rate reached 11.8% in December 2010 and the currency, the Vietnamese ƒë·ªìng, was devalued three times.

Deep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India and the Philippines. This decline can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality. These policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the &quot;ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi&quot; programme, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare. Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets. Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Although Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with a total 2011 output of . In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the eighth-largest crude petroleum producer in the Asia and Pacific region. The US bought the biggest share of Vietnam&#x27;s exports, while goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import.

Based on findings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2022, the unemployment rate in Vietnam was 2.3%, the nominal GDP US$406.452¬†billion, and a nominal GDP per capita $4,086. Besides the primary sector economy, tourism has contributed significantly to Vietnam&#x27;s economic growth with 7.94¬†million foreign visitors recorded in 2015.

=== Agriculture ===

As a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products. It is now the world&#x27;s largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world&#x27;s market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s. Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world&#x27;s second largest exporter of coffee. The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products. Agriculture&#x27;s share of Vietnam&#x27;s GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.

====Seafood====
The overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016. The output of Vietnam&#x27;s fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector.

=== Science and technology ===

In 2010, Vietnam&#x27;s total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP. Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics. Ho√†ng T·ª•y pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, while Ng√¥ B·∫£o Ch√¢u won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms. Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight programme especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018. Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model. One of Vietnam&#x27;s main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by V∆∞∆°ng Quang Kh·∫£i, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country&#x27;s largest information technology service company, the FPT Group.
According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Vietnam devoted 0.19% of its GDP to science research and development in 2011. Vietnam was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2012, where it was ranked 76th. Between 2005 and 2014, the number of Vietnamese scientific publications recorded in Thomson Reuters&#x27; Web of Science increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia, albeit from a modest starting point. Publications focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is an important element of economic activity in the nation, contributing 7.5% of the total GDP. Vietnam hosted roughly 13 million tourists in 2017, an increase of 29.1% over the previous year, making it one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. The vast majority of the tourists in the country, some 9.7¬†million, came from Asia; namely China (4¬†million), South Korea (2.6¬†million), and Japan (798,119). Vietnam also attracts large numbers of visitors from Europe, with almost 1.9¬†million visitors in 2017; most European visitors came from Russia (574,164), followed by the United Kingdom (283,537), France (255,396), and Germany (199,872). Other significant international arrivals by nationality include the United States (614,117) and Australia (370,438).

The most visited destinations in Vietnam are the largest city, Ho Chi Minh City, with over 5.8¬†million international arrivals, followed by Hanoi with 4.6¬†million and H·∫° Long, including H·∫° Long Bay with 4.4¬†million arrivals. All three are ranked in the top 100 most visited cities in the world. Vietnam is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2018, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; ranked H·ªôi An as one of the world&#x27;s top 15 best destinations to visit.

=== Transport ===

Much of Vietnam&#x27;s modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports. It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam. Vietnam&#x27;s road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level. In 2010, Vietnam&#x27;s road system had a total length of about of which are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads. The length of the national road system is about with of its length paved. The provincial road system has around of paved roads while district roads are paved.

Bicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country, a legacy of the French, though the number of privately owned cars has been increasing in recent years. Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. Traffic collisions remain the major safety issue of Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people losing their lives daily. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growth of individual car ownership. Vietnam&#x27;s primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, a distance of nearly . From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north, and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to H·∫° Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Th√°i Nguy√™n, and the northeast line from Hanoi to L√†o Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway‚Äîshinkansen (bullet train)‚Äîusing Japanese technology. Vietnamese engineers were sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains. The planned railway will be a -long express route serving a total of 23 stations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with 70% of its route running on bridges and through tunnels. The trains will travel at a maximum speed of per hour. Plans for the high-speed rail line, however, have been postponed after the Vietnamese government decided to prioritise the development of both the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City metros and expand road networks instead.
Vietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in ƒê√† N·∫µng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the country&#x27;s largest airport handling the majority of international passenger traffic. According to a government-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2025, including Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Can Tho International Airport, and Long Thanh International Airport. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100¬†million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025. Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020. Several private airlines also operate in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, ƒê√† N·∫µng, H·∫£i Ph√≤ng, Ho Chi Minh City, H·∫° Long, Qui Nh∆°n, V≈©ng T√†u, C·ª≠a L√≤ and Nha Trang. Further inland, the country&#x27;s extensive network of rivers plays a key role in rural transportation with over of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.

=== Energy ===
Vietnam&#x27;s energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country&#x27;s power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW. Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer (BOT) investors.

Most of Vietnam&#x27;s power is generated by either hydropower or fossil fuel power such as coal, oil and gas, while diesel, small hydropower and renewable energy supplies the remainder. The Vietnamese government had planned to develop a nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source for electricity from nuclear power. The plan was abandoned in late 2016 when a majority of the National Assembly voted to oppose the project due to widespread public concern over radioactive contamination.

The household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country&#x27;s domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nh∆°n Tr·∫°ch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Ph√∫ Qu√Ω Wind Power Plant (6 MW), H·ªßa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and V≈©ng √Ång 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).

According to statistics from BP, Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4¬†billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6¬†trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.

=== Telecommunication ===

Telecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company. The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986. The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT. VNPT&#x27;s monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree. By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone. The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone. With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam&#x27;s telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
Vietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310¬†billion m3. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year&#x27;s discharge. Most of the country&#x27;s urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse. Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed. It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply. There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems. Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources. Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water.

In recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to develop access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration systems. There is a growing concern among local populations over the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well as the high levels of arsenic in groundwater sources. The government of Netherlands has been providing aid focusing its investments mainly on water-related sectors including water treatment projects. Regarding sanitation, 78% of Vietnam&#x27;s population has access to &quot;improved&quot; sanitation‚Äî94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. However, there are still about 21¬†million people in the country lacking access to &quot;improved&quot; sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015. In 2018, the construction ministry said the country&#x27;s water supply, and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology (IT) to sanitation issues but faced problems like limited funding, climate change, and pollution. The health ministry has also announced that water inspection units will be established nationwide beginning in June 2019. Inspections are to be conducted without notice, since there have been many cases involving health issues caused by poor or polluted water supplies as well unhygienic conditions reported every year.

== Demographics ==


, the population of Vietnam stands at approximately million people. The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7¬†million. According to the 2019 census, the country&#x27;s population was 96,208,984. Based on the 2019 census, 65.6% of the Vietnamese population live in rural areas while only 34.4% live in urban areas. The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation. The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population. Most of their population is concentrated in the country&#x27;s alluvial deltas and coastal plains. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country. Despite this, Vietnam is also home to various ethnic groups, of which 54 are officially recognised, including the Hmong, Dao, T√†y, Th√°i and N√πng. Many ethnic minorities such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam&#x27;s territory.

Since the partition of Vietnam, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including more than 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a programme of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas. The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders. Throughout Vietnam&#x27;s history, many Chinese people, largely from South China, migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees. Since the reunification in 1976, an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam.

=== Urbanisation ===

The number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%). Since 1986, Vietnam&#x27;s urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi economic programme, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively. The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate. Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country&#x27;s Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.

A study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam&#x27;s GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%. In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam&#x27;s GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people&#x27;s standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009. In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.

Many Vietnamese use mopeds for transportation, since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5¬†million in 2001 to 4.7¬†million in 2013. With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water, for example in the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster. The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for waste handling. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government&#x27;s efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort household waste, since waste sorting is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.
=== Languages ===
The national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon‚ÄìKhmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. Vietnam&#x27;s minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: T√†y, M∆∞·ªùng, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, N√πng, and Hmong. The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families. In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.
The French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce. Vietnam remains a full member of the International Organisation of the Francophonie () and education has revived some interest in the language. Russian, and to a lesser extent German, Czech and Polish are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, English has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French. The popularity of Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese have also grown as the country&#x27;s ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened. Third-graders can choose one of seven languages (English, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German) as their first foreign language. In Vietnam&#x27;s high school graduation examinations, students can take their foreign language exam in one of the above-mentioned languages.

=== Religion ===


Under Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion. All religions are equal before the law and each place of worship is protected under Vietnamese state law. Religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies. According to a 2007 survey 81% of Vietnamese people did not believe in a god. Based on government findings in 2009, the number of religious people increased by 932,000. The official statistics, presented by the Vietnamese government to the United Nations special rapporteur in 2014, indicate the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24¬†million of a total population of almost 90¬†million. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam in 2019, Buddhists account for 4.79% of the total population, Catholics 6.1%, Protestants 1.0%, Hoahao Buddhists 1.02%, and Caodaism followers 0.58%. Other religions includes Islam, Baha º√≠s and Hinduism, representing less than 0.2% of the population.

The majority of Vietnamese do not follow any organised religion, though many of them observe some form of Vietnamese folk religion. Confucianism as a system of social and ethical philosophy still has certain influences in modern Vietnam. MahƒÅyƒÅna is the dominant branch of Buddhism, while Theravada is practised mostly by the Khmer minority. About 8 to 9% of the population is Christian‚Äîmade up of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam in the 16th century and was firmly established by Jesuits missionaries (mainly Portuguese and Italian) in the 17th centuries from nearby Portuguese Macau. French missionaries (from the Paris Foreign Missions Society) together with Spanish missionaries (from the Dominican Order of the neighbouring Spanish East Indies) actively sought converts in the 18th, 19th, and first half of the 20th century. A significant number of Vietnamese people, especially in the South, are also adherents of two indigenous religions of syncretic Caodaism and quasi-Buddhist Hoahaoism. Protestantism was only recently spread by American and Canadian missionaries in the 20th century; the largest Protestant denomination is the Evangelical Church of Vietnam. Around 770,000 of the country&#x27;s Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, particularly the highland Montagnards and Hmong people. Although it is one of the country&#x27;s minority religions, Protestantism is the fastest-growing religion in Vietnam, expanding at a rate of 600% in recent decades. Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam, these include: Bani, Sunni and non-denominational sections of Islam which is practised primarily among the ethnic Cham minority. There are also a few Kinh adherents of Islam, other minority adherents of Baha&#x27;i, as well as Hindus among the Cham&#x27;s.

=== Education ===
Vietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008. Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country&#x27;s education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government. Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance. Regardless, Vietnam&#x27;s school enrolment is among the highest in the world. The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them. Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2¬†million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education. A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government&#x27;s strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval. The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education.

=== Health ===
By 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources. In 2016, Vietnam&#x27;s national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level. After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established. In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry. The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today. For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam&#x27;s land being defoliated.

Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria. The malaria mortality rate fell to about five per cent of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) cases, however, are on the rise. TB has become the second most infectious disease in the country after respiratory-related illness. With an intensified vaccination programme, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and new TB infections. In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses. That year, the United States announced Vietnam would be one of 15 states to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan. By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); 9,554 have died. The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. On average between 40 and 50 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population was estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005. More global aid is being delivered through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to fight the spread of the disease in the country. In September 2018, the Hanoi People&#x27;s Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. More than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi were found to be selling both meats. The decision prompted positive comments among Vietnamese on social media, though some noted that the consumption of dog meat will remain an ingrained habit among many people.

== Culture ==
Vietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere. Vietnam&#x27;s culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base. Some elements of the nation&#x27;s culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy. Vietnamese society is structured around (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month. The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture. Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in , where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them. In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture.

=== Media ===
Vietnam&#x27;s media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication. It is generally perceived that the country&#x27;s media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken. The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the &quot;Bamboo Firewall&quot;. The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam&#x27;s level of online political censorship to be &quot;pervasive&quot;, while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global &quot;internet enemies&quot;. Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.

=== Cuisine ===

Traditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste &quot;elements&quot; (): spicy (metal), sour (wood), salty (water), bitter (fire) and sweet (earth). Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird&#x27;s eye chilli, lime and basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide. The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country. Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as (salad roll), (rice noodle roll), (rice vermicelli soup) and noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants. Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices. Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include (Vietnamese iced coffee), (egg coffee), (salted pickled lime juice), (glutinous rice wine), (sugarcane juice) and (Vietnamese lotus tea).

Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the , and various temple and nature festivals.

<text>The Vogons are a fictional alien race from the planet Vogsphere in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;‚Äîinitially a BBC Radio series by Douglas Adams‚Äîwho are responsible for the destruction of the Earth, in order to facilitate an intergalactic highway construction project for a hyperspace express route. Vogons are slug-like but vaguely humanoid, are bulkier than humans, and have green skin. Vogons are described as &quot;one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy‚Äînot actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous&quot;, and having &quot;as much sex appeal as a road accident&quot; as well as being the authors of &quot;the third worst poetry in the universe&quot;. They are employed as the galactic government&#x27;s bureaucrats. According to Marvin the Paranoid Android, they are also the worst marksmen in the galaxy. They follow orders as they are told, and do not allow exceptions.

==Description==

===Appearance and personality===
Guide description:

Vogons are roughly human-sized, although much bulkier, with green or grey skin. Their noses are above their eyebrows, which are either ginger (in the television series) or white (in the film). The film&#x27;s commentary states that the idea behind the high flat noses was that they evolved both the noses and the severe bureaucracy from being repeatedly whacked by the paddle creatures under the sand on Vogsphere whenever they had an independent thought (in the film, the Vogon bureaucracy is centred on Vogsphere). In the radio series it is said that &quot;Their highly domed nose rises above their small piggy forehead&quot;.

Garth Jennings based the visual portrayal of the Vogons in the 2005 film on the work of cartoonist James Gillray (1757‚Äì1815). &quot;His creations were so grotesque...when we looked at them, we realised they &quot;were&quot; the Vogons&quot;.

===Origins===
The series tells that, far back in prehistory, when the first primeval Vogons crawled out of the sea, evolution gave up on them. Through sheer obstinacy, though, the Vogons survived (partly by adapting a misplaced, badly malformed, and dyspeptic liver into a brain). As the radio show says: &quot;What nature refused to give to them, they did without. Until their myriad anatomical deficiencies could be rectified with surgery.&quot; They then emigrated &quot;en masse&quot; to the MeagaBrantis star cluster (although the film has them staying on Vogsphere), the political hub of the galaxy. They banish the ruling philosophers to the tax office to lick stamps and within a few short Voge years took over pretty much all of the galactic civil service, where they form most of the Galactic bureaucracy, most notably in the Vogon Constructor Fleets (which, despite their name, patrol the galaxy demolishing planets). The only named Vogons in the stories are Jeltz (see below), Kwaltz (who appears in the film), Zarniwoop, revealed to be a Vogon in the Quintessential Phase, and Jeltz&#x27;s son Constant Mown. Two other named Vogon Constructor Fleet captains, Prostetnic Vogons Kutz and Yant, appear in Fit the Fourteenth announcing the demolition of the planets Avaruth and Regulo 7, respectively.

===Behaviour===
Vogons are described as officiously bureaucratic, a line of work at which they perform so well that the entire galactic bureaucracy is run by them.

On Vogsphere, the Vogons would sit upon very elegant and beautiful gazelle-like creatures, whose backs would snap instantly if the Vogons tried to ride them. The Vogons were perfectly happy with just sitting on them. Another favourite Vogon pastime is to import millions of beautiful jewel-backed scuttling crabs from their native planet, cut down giant trees of breathtaking beauty, and spend a happy drunken night smashing the crabs to bits with iron mallets and cooking the crab meat by burning the trees. In the movie, the Vogons seem to smash the crabs for no apparent reason besides pure pleasure at killing something.

In the film, Ford Prefect additionally tells Arthur Dent following the Guide&#x27;s Vogon article that Vogons lack the ability of thought or imagination, and some can&#x27;t even spell.

The Vogons&#x27; battle-cry, and counter-argument to dissent, is &quot;resistance is useless!&quot; (cf. &quot;Resistance is futile&quot;).

===Poetry===
Vogon poetry is described as &quot;the third worst poetry in the Universe&quot; (behind that of the Azgoths of Kria and that of Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings, the latter of which was destroyed when the Earth was). The main example used in the story is a short piece composed by Jeltz, which roughly emulates nonsense verse in style (example below).
The story relates that listening to it is an experience similar to torture, as demonstrated when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are forced to listen to the poetry (and say how much they liked it) prior to being thrown out of an airlock.

:&quot;Oh freddled gruntbuggly,&quot;
:&quot;Thy micturations are to me&quot;
:&quot;As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.&quot;
:&quot;Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,&quot;
:&quot;And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,&quot;
:&quot;Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts&quot;
:&quot;With my blurglecruncheon, see if I don&#x27;t!&quot;

A second example of Vogon poetry is found in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide interactive fiction game that was produced by Infocom; responding to the poetry forms a major part of game play. The first verse is as above; one version of the second verse follows:

:&quot;Bleem miserable venchit! Bleem forever mestinglish asunder frapt.&quot;
:&quot;Gashee morphousite, thou expungiest quoopisk!&quot;
:&quot;Fripping lyshus wimbgunts, awhilst moongrovenly kormzibs.&quot;
:&quot;Gerond withoutitude form into formless bloit, why not then? Moose.&quot;

An unused extended version of the poem is also excerpted in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s book &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Companion&quot;, in Appendix III.

A third example appears in &quot;The Quintessential Phase&quot; of the radio series, again written by Jeltz.

A fourth example appears in &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, the sixth book in the trilogy written by Eoin Colfer. The poem is also written by Jeltz.

==Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz==

The Vogon captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz is sadistic and unpleasant to look at, even by Vogon standards. He enjoys shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, and takes professional pride in his job of demolishing planets. He very rarely smiles: &quot;Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements.&quot;

It is revealed in &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; that Jeltz had been hired by Gag Halfrunt to destroy the Earth (though in the film it was Zaphod who gave the order by mistake). Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the Ultimate Question. When Halfrunt learns that Arthur Dent escaped the planet&#x27;s destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Zaphod&#x27;s great-grandfather.

In &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, after the Vogons infiltrate the Hitchhikers&#x27; Guide company offices to turn the Guide into a device capable of destroying all Earths in every dimension, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Arthur&#x27;s daughter, Random‚Äîa fate dodged by the characters in the Quintessential Phase.

&quot;Prostetnic Vogon&quot; is a title, rather than part of his name, as at the beginning of the Quandary Phase he is described as belonging to the &quot;Prostetnic class&quot;. Two other Prostetnic Vogons in the Constructor Fleet, Kutz and Yant, appear in the second episode of the Tertiary Phase alongside Jeltz announcing the demolition of their respective planets. In &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, Gag Halfrunt also refers to Jeltz as &quot;Captain of Vogons Prostetnic&quot;.

Jeltz appears in:

*&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;
*&quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;
*&quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;
*&quot;And Another Thing...&quot;
*&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (computer game)
* The Quintessential Phase.

In the first radio series, he was played by Bill Wallis, who also voiced Mr Prosser. Writer Marcus O&#x27;Dair found this &quot;an appropriate casting decision since the character is, to an extent, Jeltz&#x27;s Earth-bound alter ego.&quot; On television, the Vogon was portrayed by Martin Benson. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by Toby Longworth, although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by Richard Griffiths. In cartoon he is voiced by Rupert Degas.

Ronald E. Rice and Stephen D. Cooper considered Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz as a literary example of dysfunctional behaviour that may be facilitated by bureaucracies, comparable to the servants in Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Castle&quot; and the bureaucrats in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s movie &quot;Brazil&quot;: they &quot;all fulfill their job descriptions and use resources so efficiently that there is no recourse for the innocent, efficient, altruistic, or reasonable&quot;.

==Spacecraft==
The ships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet were described as &quot;impossibly huge yellow somethings&quot; (the colour being a parallel to bulldozers that demolish Arthur&#x27;s house) that &quot;looked more like they had been congealed than constructed&quot; and &quot;hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don&#x27;t&quot;; they are said to be undetectable to radar and capable of travel through hyperspace. They are not crewed exclusively by Vogons; a species known as the Dentrassi are responsible for on-board catering.

In the television version of the story, the craft are shaped like battleships, albeit with a flat bottom through which the demolition beams are fired. In the film version, the craft are grey and cubic, a continuation of the emphasis on bureaucracy in the Vogons&#x27; conception: &quot;Douglas [Adams]&#x27;s description of the Vogon ships hanging in the air in much the same way that bricks don&#x27;t [led to] these Vogon ships which are these massive concrete tower blocks, with hardly any windows, they just have a few doors around the base,&quot; says Joel Collins.

==Analysis and reception==
The name Vogons is a new lexeme, a word newly created by Douglas Adams that does not conform to a pattern of word formation. Stephen Webb found the appearance of this first alien race that features in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; also &quot;suitably strange, as aliens should be&quot;. The Vogons&#x27; behaviour in contrast turns out to be &quot;full of very human‚Äîand specifically English‚Äîflaws and tendencies&quot;, to the point that Amanda Dillon considered them &quot;probably the least othered alien in Adams&#x27;s work&quot;. The Vogons are an easily recognizable satire of human middle-management culture and bureaucracy. Dillon found them &quot;Adams&#x27;s most fully formed direct parody of the alien, and this makes them a source of laughter rather than fear&quot;. The &quot;silliness of Vogon bureaucracy&quot; in its exaggeration is represented by &quot;Adams&#x27;s clever use of bathos&quot; when he first uses very technical terms to describe their organizational processes but concludes with incongruously mundane words. For Vogons bureaucracy is an end-in-itself, &quot;at which human and logic fail&quot; and which intends to thwart real progress, making the scenes of interaction with these aliens &quot;absurd&quot;. Marilette Van der Colff also noted that the failure &quot;to notice its destructive influence on nature&quot; by the management and the unconcerned and sometimes deliberate destruction of animal species by humans in general is reflected in the Vogons.

Marcus O&#x27;Dair praised the realization in the movie: &quot;In this format, the Vogons really come into their own, their flattened faces, hunched backs and hopelessly overhanging bellies partly inspired by the work of eighteenth-century satirical cartoonist James Gillray.&quot; Author Martin Thomas Pesl included the Vogons in his list of the 100 most brilliant villains in world literature, under the category of despots. In his analysis of the depiction of extraterrestrials, Stephen Webb considered the Vogons &quot;engaging aliens&quot; despite their unpleasant traits, as they parodied middle-management behaviour so well that &quot;I can&#x27;t help but like them&quot;.

==In other media==
&quot;Vogons&quot; was an Atari 130XE game, the goal being to avoid three &quot;dreaded Vogons&quot; moving quickly around the screen.

<text>Abkhaz, also known as Abkhazian,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-2/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-3/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a Northwest Caucasian language most closely related to Abaza. It is spoken mostly by the Abkhaz people. It is one of the official languages of Abkhazia, where around 190,000 people speak it. Furthermore, it is spoken by thousands of members of the Abkhazian diaspora in Turkey, Georgia&#x27;s autonomous republic of Adjara, Syria, Jordan, and several Western countries. 27 October is the day of the Abkhazian language in Georgia.

== Classification ==
Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language and is thus related to Adyghe. The language of Abkhaz is especially close to Abaza, and they are sometimes considered dialects of the same language, Abazgi, of which the literary dialects of Abkhaz and Abaza are simply two ends of a dialect continuum. Grammatically, the two are very similar; however, the differences in phonology are substantial, it also contains elements characteristic of Kabardian; these are the main reasons for many others to prefer keeping the two separate, while others still refer to it as the Tapanta dialect of Abkhaz. Chirikba mentions that there are possible indications that proto-Northwest Caucasian, could have divided firstly into proto-Circassian and to proto-Ubykh-Abkhaz; Ubykh then being the closest relative to Abkhaz, with it only later on being influenced by Circassian.

== Geographical distribution ==

There is not an agreed number of speakers of Abkhaz, and there are widely different numbers. It is agreed that today most of the Abkhaz people do not live in Abkhazia. In the census conducted by the Republic of Abkhazia in 2011, Abkhazians comprised 50.8% of the population, around 122,175 people; of these 92,838 spoke it natively. Only two of the original dialects are still spoken in Abkhazia. The Bzyp dialect is still spoken in its homeland northwest of Sukhumi, stretching from the Bzyp River to the western environs of Sukhumi and the Psyrtskha valley, whereas the Abzhywa dialect is spoken south-east of Sukhumi. The rest of the Abkhaz speaking population inhabits other neighbouring areas.

The exact number of Abkhazians and Abkhaz speakers in Turkey is not clear. The Turkish census denotes 13,951, but the figures are dubious, since the numbers of Abkhazians that came from the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th have been documented at around 30 thousand. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; gives 150,000 Abkhazians living in Turkey, of these 50,000 still speak the language. The head of the Abkhaz federation says there are in between 500 and 700 thousand Abkhazians in Turkey. In general, Abkhaz seems to have been lost by most of the descendants, and bilingualism being low except in some specific areas, although there seems to be an effort for the new generation to learn the language with public schools being able to teach Abkhaz and together with 7,836 second language speakers. Abkhazian villages are concentrated around the cities of Adapazarƒ±, D√ºzce, Sinop, Hendek and Samsun in the northern part, and in the west around cities such as Bilecik, Ineg√∂l and Eski≈üehir; they are mainly found in the provinces of Sakarya and Bolu in the western part, and near the √áoruh river in the north-east.

Historically the dialects of Sadz, Ahchypsy and Tsabal were located in Abkhazia; Sadz being spoken from the Bzyp river to the Matsesta River, and further to the north-west bordering the Sochypsta River. Today they are exclusively spoken in the northwestern part of Turkey, specially in the Sakarya province, it being spoken in 14 villages.

The other major place where Abkhaz is spoken is in Karachay-Cherkessia, where the Northern dialects are spoken, although there they are considered as a separate language and form the literary Abaza language. They are spoken by 37,831 people in Russia, mostly in the south of Stavropol Krai in the area around Kislovodsk, and in the upper Kuma river area.

Abkhaz is also spoken as a minority language around the world. There is a considerable number of Abkhaz speakers in Adjara in southern Georgia, with the diaspora concentrating itself around the capital Batumi, with about 982 people considering Abkhaz their first language. In the Russian census of 2010, 6,786 speakers of Abkhaz were reported in Russia. In Ukraine there are around 1,458 according to the 2001 census, but of these only 317 speak Abkhazian. There were also communities in Syria, Jordan and Iraq with around 5,000 Abkhazians, although this number could reach 10,000 according to the Abkhazia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry. The biggest western diaspora is in Germany, with around 5,000 speakers, but other communities are found in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Austria, France, Belgium and so on.

== History ==
The earliest indisputable extant written records of the Abkhaz language are in the Arabic script, recorded by the Turkish traveller Evliya √áelebi in the 17th century. Abkhaz has been used as a literary language for only about 100 years.

It was suggested that certain inscriptions on Ancient Greek pottery which had been considered nonsense are in fact written in Abkhaz-Adydge languages. The methodology of the research was criticised and the results called improbable.

In 1918, Tbilisi State University became the first institution of higher education to teach Abkhazian language. The founders of the university began to take care of the development and scientific study of the Abkhazian language. At the meeting of the Council of Professors held at Tbilisi State University in 1918, Ivane Javakhishvili noted the scientific importance of studying Caucasian languages. In 1918, by the decision of the Council of Professors, Petre Charaia was invited to teach the Abkhazian language, and from 1925, this mission was continued by Dimitri Gulia and Simon Janashia.

== Status ==
Both Georgian and Abkhaz law enshrines an official status of the Abkhaz language in Abkhazia.

The 1992 law of Georgia, reiterated in the 1995 constitution, grants Abkhaz the status of second official language in the territory of Abkhazia ‚Äî along with Georgian.

In November 2007, the de facto authorities of Abkhazia adopted a new law &quot;on the state language of the Republic of Abkhazia&quot; that mandates Abkhaz as the language of official communication. According to the law, all meetings held by the president, parliament, and government must be conducted in Abkhaz (instead of Russian, which is currently a de facto administrative language) from 2010, and all state officials will be obliged to use Abkhaz as their language of everyday business from 2015. Some, however, have considered the implementation of this law unrealistic and concerns have been made that it will drive people away from Abkhazia and hurt the independent press due to a significant share of non-Abkhaz speakers among ethnic minorities as well as Abkhaz themselves, and a shortage of teachers of Abkhaz. The law is an attempt to amend a situation where up to a third of the ethnic Abkhaz population are no longer capable of speaking their ethnic language, and even more are unable to read or write it; instead, Russian is the language most commonly used in public life at present.

== Dialects ==
=== Classification ===
Abkhaz is generally viewed as having three major dialects:
* Abzhywa, spoken in the Caucasus, and named after the historical area of Abzhywa (–ê–±–∂—å—ã—É–∞), sometimes referred to as Abzhui, the Russified form of the name (&quot;Abzhuiski dialekt&quot;, derived from the Russian form of the name for the area, ).
* Bzyb or Bzyp, spoken in the Caucasus and in Turkey, and named after the Bzyb () area.
* Sadz, nowadays spoken only in Turkey, formerly also spoken between the rivers Bzyp and Khosta.

The literary language is based on the Abzhywa dialect.

Below is a classification of Abkhaz dialects according to Chirikba (1996):

*Common Abkhaz (Proto-Abkhaz)
**North Abkhaz
***&quot;Tapanta&quot;
**&quot;Ashkharywa&quot;
**South Abkhaz
***Southwestern
****&quot;Sadz&quot;
***Southeastern
****&quot;Ahchypsy&quot;, &quot;Bzyp&quot;
****&quot;Tsabal&quot;, &quot;Abzhywa&quot;
=== General characteristics ===
In some form or the other, all dialects are richer in phonemes than the standard Abzhywa dialect. The only dialects spoken in Abkhazia are Abzhywa and Bzyp. Northern dialects which are the basis for literary Abaza are spoken in Karachay-Cherkessia, while the other dialects such as Sadz are spoken in Turkey due to Russian invasions in the 19th century. While most differences are phonetic, differences in the lexicon are present, although mostly due to exterior contact. Bzyp contains the most preserved lexicon, with few borrowings. Abzhywa has adopted many loans from Kartvelian, specially Mingrelian; Sadz on the other hand has more words from Circassian. Northern dialects in general have more loanwords from Persian, Arabic, Turkish and Circassian.

== Phonology ==
===Consonants===
Abkhaz has a very large number of consonants (58 in the literary dialect), with three-way voiced/voiceless/ejective and palatalized/labialized/plain distinctions. By contrast, the language has only two phonemically distinct vowels, which have several allophones depending on the palatal and/or labial quality of adjacent consonants.

Labialised alveolo-palatal fricatives are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa. Plain alveolo-palatal consonants and the pharyngealised and labialised-pharyngealised uvular fricatives are unique to the Bzyp dialect.

The consonants highlighted in red and in brackets are the 4 kinds of labialisation described by Chirikba.


===Vowels===
The nature of the vowels of Abkhaz is not clear. Some linguists, characterise the vowel system as a 2 degree vertical vowel system; with the two vowels being distinguished by height, &#x27;”ô&#x27; being the high/close vowel, and &#x27;–∞&#x27; being the low/open. This system would very closely resemble the one found in Adyghe. The quality of &#x27;”ô&#x27; in this case, is usually represented as […®] if the vowel is in a stressed position, and being unaffected by its neighbouring consonants.

Other linguists however, mainly Russian ones, describe the vowels differently. They describe the sound of &#x27;”ô&#x27; being completely different from […®], and by their descriptions being closer to […ô]. The &#x27;–∞&#x27; is described as being particularly back, likely […ë].
== Writing system ==

Abkhaz has used the Cyrillic script since 1862. The first alphabet was a 37-character Cyrillic alphabet invented by Baron Peter von Uslar. In 1909 a 55-letter Cyrillic alphabet was used. A 75-letter Latin script devised by a Russian/Georgian linguist Nikolai Marr lasted for 2 years 1926‚Äì1928 (during the Latinization campaign). The Georgian script was adopted and used between 1938 and 1954, after that the initial Cyrillic alphabet, designed in 1892 by Dmitry Gulia together with Konstantin Machavariani and modified in 1909 by Aleksey Chochua, was restored to use.

===Unicode===
The Latin alphabet in Abkhaz is currently not in Unicode. Its inclusion was proposed in 2011. 

== Grammar ==

Typical of Northwest Caucasian languages, Abkhaz is an agglutinative language that relies heavily on affixation. It has an ergative-absolutive typology, such that the subject of an intransitive verb functions identically to the object of a transitive verb. Notably, Abkhaz expresses ergativity entirely through the ordering of subjects and objects within verb constructions rather than through overt case marking as most other ergative languages do.

All Latin transliterations in this section utilize the system explicated in Chirikba (2003) (see Abkhaz alphabet for the details).

=== Verbs ===

Abkhaz morphology features a highly complex verb system that could be called a &quot;sentence in miniature.&quot; Chirikba (2003) describes Abkhaz as a &quot;verbocentric&quot; language wherein verbs occupy the &quot;central part of the morphology.&quot; However, despite its complexity, Abkhaz verbal morphology is highly regular.

Abkhaz, being an ergative language, makes a strong distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, as well as dynamic and stative.

Stative verbs describe states of being, roughly analogous to copular phrases in English, as in –¥—Ö”ô—ã“∑—É–ø (&quot;d-xÀö…ôƒç”ôÃÅ-w…ô-p&quot; - &quot;she is a child&quot;). Dynamic verbs express direct actions, functioning more closely to standard English verbs. Dynamic verbs possess the full range of aspect, mood and tense forms, in contrast to statives, which do not.

Some verbs, called inversives, combine certain features of both stative and dynamic verbs.

Another important verbal distinction in Abkhaz is finite versus non-finite, referring to the duration of the action. Finite verbs usually contain enough information to form a complete sentence, whereas non-finite verbs typically form dependent clauses.

Verb stems can be derived in a number of ways, including compounding, affixation, reduplication or conversion from another part of speech.

Roughly equivalent to the infinitive, or to a so-called &quot;verbal noun,&quot; the Masdar form of the verb resembles the English gerund. It is formed by the addition of a specific suffix to a bare verb stem, -—Ä–∞ (&quot;-ra&quot;) for a dynamic verb and -–∑–∞–∞—Ä–∞ (&quot;-zaara&quot;) for a stative.

Various prefixes can be added to the Masdar to form entire dependent clauses, as in

However, the fully conjugated personal Abkhaz verb forms are &quot;templatic,&quot; with each grammatical distinction occupying a specific &quot;slot&quot; or &quot;position&quot; within the broader verb template. Verbs are thus formed by the addition of various affixes to the verb stem; these affixes express such distinctions as transitivity, person and stative/dynamic quality, occupying rigid positions within the overall verb structure. There is a high degree of agreement between verbs and other parts of speech. Overall, the Abkhaz verb is constructed as follows:
::[First Position]+[Second Position]+[Third Position]+[Indirect Object]+[Reflexive]+[Free Preverb]+[Stem Preverb]+[Agent]+[Negation]+[Causative]+STEM+[Extension]+[Number]+[Aspect]+[Tense]+[Negation]+[Ending Suffixes]

Not all of these elements will necessarily co-occur in every verb. The individual parts of verb morphology are addressed below.

First Position

The first prefixing element of the verb complex expresses either the subject of an intransitive verb in the absolutive construction, or the direct object of a transitive verb in an ergative construction. The following table illustrates the various agreement markers which can occupy the first position. These prefixes can either be in their long forms, containing the letters inside the parenthesis, or in the short forms that do not contain them. The rules for using them are the following:
# If the prefix is followed by a consonant cluster, the long form shall be used.
# If the stress falls on the prefix, the long form shall be used
# If the prefix is not followed by a consonant cluster, the short form shall be used.
# If the stress does not fall on the prefix, the short form shall be used.

It is also possible for the possessive prefix “Ω—ãÃÅ- (&quot;ƒç…ôÃÅ-&quot;) in a reflexive construction or the relative prefix –∏—ãÃÅ- (&quot;j”ôÃÅ-&quot;) in a non-finite construction to occupy this position.

Example of an absolutive construction with the intransitive subject in the first slot highlighted

Example of an ergative construction with the direct object in the first slot highlighted

Example of a reflexive construction with the possessive prefix in the first slot

Second Position

The second position is occupied by the indirect object or by the prefix –∞–∏- (&quot;aj-&quot;) for reciprocal pronouns equivalent to &quot;each other&quot; or &quot;one another&quot; in English.

Third Position

This position accommodates a number of prefixes.

Second Indirect Object

Any indirect object occurring after the one in the second position occupies this position instead; a possessive prefix of stative verbs can also be placed here.

Reflexive

Where a possessive prefix exists in the first position, the reflexive prefix is placed here.

Free Preverb

This position is occupied by preverbal elements which are not an explicit part of the verb stem.

Stem Preverb

Preverbal elements that are explicitly attached to the verb stem take this position.

Agent

The agreement marker corresponding to the agent (the subject of a transitive verb) takes this position.

Negation (Dynamic)

The negation prefix m- occupies this position in a dynamic verb construction.

Causative

The causative prefix r- takes the final position before the verb stem.

Extension

The first of the suffixing elements expresses adverbial information relating to &quot;inside&quot; (-la) or &quot;outside&quot; (-aa).

Number
The suffix -k¬∫√° pluralizes a stative verb.

Aspect

Several aspect markers occupy this position as suffixes.

Tense

Several tense markers occupy this position, dependent upon whether the verb in question is stative or dynamic. Dynamic verbs have a richly developed tense paradigm incorporating tense and aspect distinctions. The table below illustrates these various dynamic tense forms using the verb –∞–≥–∞—Ä–∞ (&quot;agara&quot; ‚Äì &quot;to take&quot;).

Stative verbs, by contrast, lack this rich tense system, as illustrated below using the verb –∞ÃÅ—Ü”ô–∞—Ä–∞ (&quot;√°c¬∫ara&quot; - &quot;to be sleeping&quot;).

Negation (Stative)

The negation prefix m- occupies this position in a stative verb construction.

Ending Suffixes

The final position in the verb complex can accommodate any one of several mixed purpose markers.

The imperative takes a few possible forms, depending upon the type of verb. Dynamic verbs form the imperative by the addition of agreement suffixes to a bare verb stem; intransitives include the subject and indirect object makers, whereas transitives include the direct object and absolutive. Thus

Stative verbs form the imperative simply by adding the durative suffix -z to the verb stem. Thus

Abkhaz lacks diathetic opposition, and as such there is no true passive voice distinction.

=== Nouns ===
Like verbs, Abkhaz nouns are formed by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes to a static noun stem. Noun stems can be derived according to several different processes, including compounding, reduplication, or the addition of a derivational affix.

The affixes mark number, definiteness and possession, as well as some case-like elements. Taken as a whole, the entire morphological structure of the Abkhaz noun is as follows:

::[Definite Article]+[Inflectional Prefix]+[Quantity]+STEM+[Inflectional Suffix]+[Indefinite Article]+[Clitic]

As with verbs, not all of these elements can occur at the same time. The individual parts of noun morphology are addressed below.

Article Affixes

There is a range of definiteness in Abkhaz. Those articles adhering to definite/generic categories appear as prefixes in the broader noun structure, whereas the indefinite is suffixed.

The absence of either article affix implies a zero reference implying universal quantifiers, or to express the total lack of a referent.

Definite and indefinite affixes may appear together in the same noun, implying that the referents are meant as a group or body.

There are some semantic differences in article usage between the different dialects of Abkhaz.

Inflectional Prefixes

These are possessive prefixes which express grammatical person and noun class. They come in two forms, the full and short ones. The full ones contain the vowels inside the parenthesis, whereas the short ones do not.
Quantifying Prefixes

These few prefixes add numeric information to the noun complex. Often, this takes the form of a numeral.

Inflectional Suffixes
These suffixes convey either plural number or case-like adverbial information. Plural markers are addressed further below; the other possible inflectional suffixes are the following:

*The third-person singular non-human possessive marker, attached to a locative or directional postposition
*Locative -“ø—ãÃÅ (&quot;-ƒç‚Äô”ôÃÅ&quot;) or directional -—Ö—å—ãÃÅ (&quot;-x‚Äô”ôÃÅ&quot;) postpositions
*Instrumental suffix -–ª–∞ (&quot;-la&quot;)
*Adverbial suffix -—Å (&quot;-s&quot;), as in: &quot;–∏–∞—à—å–∞—Å&quot; (&quot;ja≈°‚Äô√°s&quot; - &quot;as a brother&quot;)
*Comparative suffix -“µ–∞—Å (&quot;-c‚Äôas&quot;), as in: &quot;“©–Ω“µ–∞ÃÅ—Å&quot; (&quot;j¬∫…ônc‚Äô√°s&quot; - &quot;like a house&quot;)
*Privative suffix -–¥–∞ (&quot;-da&quot;), as in: &quot;“©–Ω—ãÃÅ–¥–∞&quot; (&quot;j¬∫n”ôÃÅda&quot; - &quot;without a house&quot;)
*Various coordinating suffixes

Inflectional suffixes can follow each other sequentially.

Plural Suffixes

Abkhaz distinguishes singular and plural; the singular is unmarked, whereas the plural is indicated by noun class-dependent suffixes. There are several pluralizing suffixes, but the two most commonly used refer generally to the human and non-human noun classes. There are instances where explicitly human nouns take non-human plural markers.

There are also several plural endings that are of much narrower use.

Clitic

The clitic -–≥—å—ã (&quot;-g‚Äô…ô&quot;) functions as an in-built coordinating conjunction.

Noun Class

Nouns in Abkhaz are classified broadly according to a human/non-human paradigm, with the human class itself further subdivided into masculine and feminine gender. Gender is a fairly weak concept in Abkhaz grammar, and gender distinctions undergo a fair degree of neutralization in several contexts, including personal pronouns, verb agreement and possession marking. This class and gender system distinguishes Abkhaz from the other Northwest Caucasian languages.

Vocative Affixes

Although there is no special vocative declension, the prefix —É–∞- (&quot;wa-&quot;), when attached to a noun stem, can express a vocative form.

Similarly, the suffix -a can be added to a proper noun ending in a consonant to communicate respect and endearment.

=== Pronouns ===
Abkhaz is a pro-drop language. Pronouns are not inflected, and verbal agreement is generally sufficient to indicate grammatical person.

It is common in everyday speech to use a short version of the pronoun which omits the suffix -—Ä√° (&quot;-r√°&quot;), although this is done less frequently with third-person pronouns.

In addition to noun-marking, possession can be indicated by adding the suffix -—Ç”ô—ãÃÅ (&quot;-t‚ÄôÀö”ôÃÅ&quot;) to the short version of a personal pronoun. Thus:
::&quot;—Å—Ç”ô—ãÃÅ&quot; (&quot;st‚ÄôÀö”ôÃÅ&quot; - &quot;mine&quot;)
::&quot;–ª—Ç”ô—ãÃÅ&quot; (&quot;lt‚ÄôÀö”ôÃÅ&quot; - &quot;hers&quot;)

Intensive pronouns are derived from short-form personal pronouns combined with the suffix -—Ö–∞“≠√° (&quot;-xat√°&quot;). These have a roughly reflexive meaning.
::—Å–∞—Ä√° (&quot;sar√°&quot; - &quot;I&quot;)
::—Å—Ö–∞“≠√° (&quot;sxat√°&quot; - &quot;I myself&quot;)

=== Adjectives ===
Morphologically, adjectives are very similar to nouns, differing only in their syntactic function. Similarly to nouns, adjective stems can be derived by compounding, reduplication and affixation. When used attributively, adjectives follow the noun that they modify. Predicative adjectives, or those derived by suffixation, precede the noun. Adjectives are formed according to the following paradigm:

::[Definite Article]+[Inflectional Prefix]+STEM+[Inflectional Suffix]+[Indefinite Article]+[Adverbial Suffix]

Inflectional Prefix

The possessive prefix r- is used to show possessive agreement.

Adjective Suffixes

These suffixes are added to the adjective stem to show agreement with the noun being modified.

The comparative form of an adjective is formed using the comparative particle –∞–∏“≥√° (&quot;ajh√°&quot; - &quot;more&quot;), which precedes the adjective. The superlative form is indicated by the intensifier suffix -”°–∞. Thus:

<text>Copts (; ) are a Christian ethnoreligious group native to Northeast Africa who have primarily inhabited the area of modern Egypt and Sudan, and predominantly follow the Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria. They are the largest Christian denomination in Egypt and the Middle East, as well as in Sudan and Libya. Copts account for roughly 5‚Äì15 percent of the population of Egypt; while in Sudan they account for 1 percent of the population, and in Libya they similarly account for 1 percent of the population.

Originally referring to all Egyptians, the term &quot;Copt&quot; became synonymous with native Christians in light of Egypt&#x27;s Islamization and Arabization after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 639‚Äì646 AD. Copts have historically spoken the Coptic language, a direct descendant of the Demotic Egyptian that was spoken in late antiquity.

Following the Muslim conquest, the treatment of the Coptic Christians who refused to convert ranged from relative tolerance to open persecution. Historically, the Copts suffered from &quot;waves of persecution giving way to relative tolerance in cycles that varied according to the local ruler and other political and economic circumstances&quot;. Persecution is significantly involved in the Copts&#x27; ethnic identity due to historic and current conflicts. Most Copts adhere to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S.Dept of State/Egypt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO/Egypt/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller Coptic Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Church, in communion with the Holy See of Rome; others belong to the Evangelical Church of Egypt. The Copts played a central role in the Arab Renaissance as well as the modernization of Egypt and the Arab world as a whole; they also contributed to the &quot;social and political life and key debates such as pan-Arabism, good governance, educational reform, and democracy&quot;, and they have historically flourished in business affairs.

While Coptic Christians speak the same dialects and are culturally similar to other Egyptians, they strongly oppose Arab identity and associate it with Islam and Islamism. In Egypt, Copts have a relatively higher educational attainment, a relatively higher wealth index, and a stronger representation in white-collar job types, but limited representation in military and security agencies. The majority of demographic, socio-economic, and health indicators are similar among Christians and Muslims.

==Etymology==
The English language adopted the word &quot;Copt&quot; in the 17th century from Neo-Latin &quot;Coptus, Cophtus&quot;, which derives from the Arabic collective &quot;the Copts&quot; with nisba adjective , plural ; Also &quot;quftƒ´, qiftƒ´&quot; (where the Arabic reflects the historical Coptic ) an Arabisation of the Coptic word ‚≤Å‚≤ì‚≤Ö‚≤©‚≤°‚≤ß‚≤ì‚≤ü‚≤õ &quot;aiguption&quot; (Bohairic for &quot;Egyptian&quot; or in relation to Egypt) or ‚≤ï‚≤©‚≤°‚≤ß‚≤Å‚≤ì‚≤ü‚≤õ &quot;kuptaion&quot; (Sahidic). The Coptic word in turn represents an adaptation of the Greek term for the indigenous people of Egypt, ().

The Greek term for Egypt, &quot;A√≠gyptos&quot; (), itself derives from the Egyptian language, but dates to a much earlier period, being attested already in Mycenaean Greek as &quot;a3-ku-pi-ti-jo&quot; (lit. &quot;Egyptian&quot;; used here as a man&#x27;s name). This Mycenaean form probably comes from Middle Egyptian (reconstructed pronunciation /ƒßawitÀåku ÄpiÀàtaƒß/ ‚Üí /ƒßaji îÀåku ÄpiÀàtaƒß/ ‚Üí /ƒß…ôjÀåku îp…ôÀàtaƒß/, Egyptological pronunciation &quot;Hut-ka-Ptah&quot;), literally &quot;estate/palace of the kÍú£ (&quot;double&quot; spirit) of Ptah&quot; (compare Akkadian ), the name of the temple complex of the god Ptah at Memphis (and a synecdoche for the city of Memphis and the region around it).

The term &quot;Aig√Ωptios&quot; in Greek came to designate the native Egyptian population in Roman Egypt (as distinct from Greeks, Romans, Jews, etc.). After the Muslim conquest of Egypt (639-646) it became restricted to those Egyptians adhering to the Christian religion.

The Coptic name for Egyptians, &quot;rem…ônkhƒìmi&quot; (), is realized in Fayyumic Coptic as ‚≤ó‚≤â‚≤ô‚≤õÃÄ‚≤ï‚≤è‚≤ô‚≤â &quot;lemenkƒìmi&quot; and as ‚≤£‚≤â‚≤ô‚≤õÃÄ‚≤ï‚≤è‚≤ô‚≤â &quot;rem…ônkƒìme&quot; in the Sahidic dialect; cf. Egyptian , Demotic .

The Arabic word &quot;Copt&quot; has also been connected to the Greek name of the town of K√≥ptos (, now Qif·π≠; Coptic &quot;Kebt&quot; and &quot;Keft&quot;) in Upper Egypt. This association may have contributed to making &quot;Copt&quot; the settled form of the name.

In the 20th century, some Egyptian nationalists and intellectuals in the context of Pharaonism began using the term in the historical sense.

==History==


The Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. Although integrated in the larger Egyptian nation state, the Copts have survived as a distinct religious community forming around 5 to 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;The world factbook/Egypt/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They pride themselves on the apostolicity of the Egyptian Church: its founder was the first in an unbroken chain of patriarchs. The main body has been out of communion with the Roman Catholic Church since the 5th century AD.

===Foundation of the Christian Church in Egypt===
According to ancient tradition, Christianity was introduced to present day Egypt by St. Mark in Alexandria, shortly after the ascension of Christ and during the reign of the Roman emperor Claudius around 42¬†AD. The legacy that St. Mark left in Egypt was a considerable Christian community in Alexandria. Within half a century of St. Mark&#x27;s arrival Christianity had spread throughout Egypt. This is clear from a fragment of the Gospel of John, written in Coptic and found in Upper Egypt that can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century, and the New Testament writings found in Oxyrhynchus, in Middle Egypt, which date around 200¬†AD. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into Coptic (then known as &quot;Egyptian&quot;). By the beginning of the 3rd century¬†AD, Christians constituted the majority of Egypt&#x27;s population, and the Church of Alexandria was recognized as one of Christendom&#x27;s four apostolic sees, second in honor only to the Church in Rome. The Church of Alexandria is therefore the oldest Christian church in Africa.

===Contributions to Christianity===
The Copts in Egypt contributed immensely to Christian tradition. The Catechetical School of Alexandria was the oldest school of its kind in the world. Founded around 190¬†AD by the scholar Pantanaeus, the school became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as Athenagoras, Clement, Didymus, and Origen, the father of theology who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. However, the scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects: science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before Braille, wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.

Another major contribution the Egyptian Copts made to Christianity was the creation and organization of monasticism. Worldwide Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example. The most prominent figures of the monastic movement were Anthony the Great, Paul of Thebes, Macarius the Great, Shenouda the Archimandrite and Pachomius the Cenobite. 

By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. Since then pilgrims have visited the Egyptian Desert Fathers to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives. St Basil the Great Archbishop of Caesarea Mazaca, and the founder and organiser of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around 357¬†AD and his monastic rules are followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Saint Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt while en route to Jerusalem around 400¬†AD, leaving details of his experiences in his letters. St. Benedict founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, although in a stricter form. Coptic Christians practice male circumcision as a rite of passage.

===Coptic Greeks===

The Faiyum mummy portraits reflect the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the Hellenized Middle East.

By the time of Roman emperor Caracalla in the 2nd century AD, ethnic Egyptians could be distinguished from Egyptian Greeks only by their speech.

Egyptian Greek is the variety of Greek spoken in Egypt from antiquity until the Islamic conquest of Egypt in the 7th century. Egyptian Greek adopted many loanwords from Egyptian language; there was a great deal of intracommunity bilingualism in Egypt.

The following is an example of Egyptian Greek language, used in the Coptic Church:
 


The dental morphology of the Roman-period Faiyum mummies was also compared with that of earlier Egyptian populations, and was found to be &quot;much more closely akin&quot; to that of ancient Egyptians than to Greeks or other European populations. Victor J. Katz notes that &quot;research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities&quot;.

Modern day Copts use predominantly Arabic and Coptic, the latter being the direct descendent of the Ancient Egyptian language. For instance, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the Coptic Church is recited in the native Coptic language as follows:

===Ecumenical councils===
The major contributions that the See of Alexandria has contributed to the establishment of early Christian theology and dogma are attested to by fact that the first three ecumenical councils in the history of Christianity were headed by Egyptian patriarchs. The Council of Nicaea (325¬†AD) was presided over by St. Alexander, Patriarch of Alexandria, along with Saint Hosius of C√≥rdoba. In addition, the most prominent figure of the council was the future Patriarch of Alexandria Athanasius, who played the major role in the formulation of the Nicene Creed, recited today in most Christian churches of different denominations. One of the council&#x27;s decisions was to entrust the Patriarch of Alexandria with calculating and annually announcing the exact date of Easter to the rest of the Christian churches. The Council of Constantinople (381¬†AD) was presided over by Patriarch Timothy of Alexandria, while the Council of Ephesus (431¬†AD) was presided over by Cyril of Alexandria.

===Council of Chalcedon===
In 451¬†AD, following the Council of Chalcedon, the Church of Alexandria was divided into two branches. Those who accepted the terms of the Council became known as Chalcedonians or Melkites. Those who did not abide by the council&#x27;s terms were labeled non-Chalcedonians or Monophysites and later Jacobites after Jacob Baradaeus. The non-Chalcedonians, however, rejected the term Monophysites as erroneous and referred to themselves as Miaphysites. The majority of the Egyptians belonged to the Miaphysite branch, which led to their persecution by the Byzantines in Egypt.

===Arab conquest of Egypt===

In 641¬†AD, Egypt was conquered by the Arabs who faced off with the Byzantine army. Local resistance by the Egyptians however began to materialize shortly thereafter and would last until at least the 9th century. Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained mainly Christian, but Coptic Christians lost their majority status after the 14th century, as a result of the intermittent persecution and the destruction of the Christian churches there. From the Muslim conquest of Egypt onwards, the Coptic Christians were persecuted by different Muslim regimes, such as the Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman Empire; the persecution of Coptic Christians included closing and demolishing churches, forced conversion to Islam, and heavy taxes for those who refused to convert.

===Copts in modern Egypt===


During the Ottoman period, Copts were classified alongside other Oriental Orthodox and Nestorian peoples under the Armenian millet.

Under Muslim rule, Christians paid special taxes, had lower access to political power, and were exempt from military service. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century. He abolished the Jizya (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed Egyptians (Copts) to enroll in the army. Pope Cyril IV, who reigned from 1854‚Äì61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha, in power 1863‚Äì79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.

Some Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions. Two significant cultural achievements include the founding of the Coptic Museum in 1910 and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies in 1954. Some prominent Coptic thinkers from this period are Salama Moussa, Louis Awad and Secretary General of the Wafd Party Makram Ebeid.

In 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser led some army officers in a coup d&#x27;√©tat against King Farouk, which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt and established a republic. Nasser&#x27;s mainstream policy was pan-Arab nationalism and socialism. The Copts were severely affected by Nasser&#x27;s nationalization policies, though they represented about 10 to 20 percent of the population. In addition, Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts&#x27; strong attachment to and sense of identity about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed.

====Socioeconomic====
In Egypt, Copts have relatively higher educational attainment, relatively higher wealth index, and a stronger representation in white collar job types than their Muslim counterparts, though they have limited representation in security agencies. The majority of demographic, socioeconomic and health indicators are similar among Copts and Muslims. Historically; many Copts were accountants, and in 1961 Coptic Christians owned 51% of the Egyptian banks. A Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that around 26% of Egyptian Christians obtain a university degree in institutions of higher education.

According to the scholar Andrea Rugh Copts tend to belong to the educated middle and upper-middle class, and according to scholar Lois Farag &quot;The Copts still played the major role in managing Egypt&#x27;s state finances. They held 20% of total state capital, 45% of government employment, and 45% of government salaries&quot;. According to scholar J. D. Pennington 45% of the medical doctors, 60% of the pharmacists of Egypt were Christians.

A number of Coptic business and land-owning families became very wealthy and influential such as the Egyptian Coptic Christian Sawiris family that owns the Orascom conglomerate, spanning telecommunications, construction, tourism, industries and technology. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the family&#x27;s net worth at $36 billion. According to scholars Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein argue that Copts have relatively higher educational attainment and relatively higher wealth index, due to Coptic Christianity emphasis on literacy and that Coptic Christianity encouraged the accumulation of human capital.

====Pharaonism====

Many Coptic intellectuals hold to Pharaonism, which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic Egyptian culture. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Some scholars see Pharaonism as shaped by Orientalism.

==== Church affairs ====
Today, members of the non-Chalcedonian Coptic Orthodox Church constitute the majority of the Egyptian Christian population. Mainly through emigration and partly through European, American, and other missionary work and conversions, the Egyptian Christian community now also includes other Christian denominations such as Protestants (known in Arabic as Evangelicals), Roman Catholics and Eastern Rite Catholics, and other Orthodox congregations. The term &quot;Coptic&quot; remains exclusive however to the Egyptian natives, as opposed to the Christians of non-Egyptian origins. Some Protestant churches for instance are called &quot;Coptic Evangelical Church&quot;, thus helping differentiate their native Egyptian congregations from churches attended by non-Egyptian immigrant communities such as Europeans or Americans.

The previous head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, died 17 March 2012. On 4 November 2012, Bishop Tawadros was chosen as the new pope of Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christians. His name was selected from a glass bowl containing the three shortlisted candidates by a blindfolded boy at a ceremony in Cairo&#x27;s St Mark&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Copts in modern Ethiopia===
In Ethiopia the Orthodox Tewahedo Church was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church until 1959 when it was granted its own patriarch by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa Cyril VI.

===Copts in modern Sudan===


Sudan has a native Coptic minority, although many Copts in Sudan are descended from more recent Egyptian immigrants. Copts in Sudan live mostly in northern cities, including Al Obeid, Atbara, Dongola, Khartoum, Omdurman, Port Sudan, and Wad Medani. Many Sudanese Copts have advanced educations. They have occasionally faced forced conversion to Islam, resulting in their emigration and decrease in number.

Modern immigration of Copts to Sudan peaked in the early 19th century, and they generally received a tolerant welcome there. However, this was interrupted by a decade of persecution under Mahdist rule at the end of the 19th century. As a result of this persecution, many were forced to relinquish their faith, adopt Islam, and intermarry with the native Sudanese population. The Anglo-Egyptian invasion in 1898 allowed Copts greater religious and economic freedom, and they extended their original roles as artisans and merchants into trading, banking, engineering, medicine, and the civil service. Proficiency in business and administration made them a privileged minority. However, the return of militant Islam in the mid-1960s and subsequent demands by radicals for an Islamic constitution prompted Copts to join in public opposition to religious rule.

Gaafar Nimeiry&#x27;s introduction of Islamic Sharia law in 1983 began a new phase of oppressive treatment of Copts, among other non-Muslims. After the overthrow of Nimeiry, Coptic leaders supported a secular candidate in the 1986 elections. However, when the National Islamic Front overthrew the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi with the help of the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest. Hundreds of Copts were dismissed from the civil service and judiciary.

In February 1991, a Coptic pilot working for Sudan Airways was executed for illegal possession of foreign currency. Before his execution, he had been offered amnesty and money if he converted to Islam, but he refused. Thousands attended his funeral, and the execution was taken as a warning by many Copts, who began to flee the country.

Restrictions on the Copts&#x27; rights to Sudanese nationality followed, and it became difficult for them to obtain Sudanese nationality by birth or by naturalization, resulting in problems when attempting to travel abroad. The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab-Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of hijab dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a Koranic verse. In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim Friday prayers, the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervor on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long-established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the south.

As of 2010, the Coptic Church in Sudan was officially registered with the government, and exempt from property tax. In 2005, the Sudanese government of National Unity (GNU) named a Coptic Orthodox priest to a government position, though the ruling Islamist party remained dominant.

After the 2018 Sudanese revolution, one Copt (Raja Nicola Issa Abdul-Masseh) was appointed in 2019 to the 11-member Transitional Sovereignty Council, which was convened as part of plan to transition Sudan to democracy. However, a military coup in 2019, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, dissolved the council and halted the democratic transition; Christians, including Copts, were subjected to intensified persecution during a civil war that began in 2023. Many became refugees or were internally displaced.

In 2023, Fikiru Mehari, an researcher for the Christian charity Open Doors, estimated that about 4% of Sudanese population was Christian; the majority of these were Roman Catholics and members of the Episcopal Church of Sudan with a &quot;smattering&quot; of Coptic Orthodox and Africa Inland Mission adherents. A 2018 report by the Minority Rights Group said Sudanese Copts had previously estimated their numbers at 400,000 to 500,000, about 1% of the Sudanese population, but that emigration and conversion (including forced conversion) to Islam had decreased their number.

==Demographics==
Living in countries with Muslim majorities (Egypt, Sudan, Libya), the size of the population of Copts is a continuously disputed matter, frequently for reasons of religious jealousy and animosity.

The Coptic population in Egypt is difficult to estimate because researchers are forbidden by Egyptian authorities to ask a survey participant&#x27;s religion. As of 2019, &quot;Copts are generally understood to make up approximately 10 percent of Egypt&#x27;s population,&quot; with an estimated population of 9.5 million (figure cited in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, 2017) or 10 million (figure cited in the Associated Press, 2019). Smaller or larger figures have also been cited, in the range of &quot;somewhere between 6% and 18% of the population,&quot; with the Egyptian government estimating lower numbers and the Coptic Orthodox Church estimating much higher numbers. A lack of definite, reliable demographic data renders all estimates uncertain. Despite challenges, Copts are well integrated in Egyptian society. The highest concentrations of Copts are in Upper Egypt, especially around Asyut and Qena.

The Coptic population in Libya is uncertain. A 2013 estimate by the U.S. Department of State placed the entire population of non-Muslim Libyans at 180,000 (roughly 3% of the country&#x27;s population). However, the Coptic Orthodox Church in Libya estimated that its membership alone was 300,000, including those who do not regularly attend church services. In 2011, there were three Coptic churches in the country. From 2011 to 2015, during the Libyan civil war, at least 200,000 Christians fled Libya; during that time, Islamist militants such as the Ansar al-Sharia, Nusra Front, and Islamic State violently persecuted Copts.

===Diaspora===

Outside of the Coptic primary area of residence within parts of present-day Egypt (Copts in Egypt), Sudan (Copts in Sudan), and Libya (Copts in Libya), the largest Coptic diaspora population is located within the United States, Canada, and Australia.

The first Coptic Orthodox church in North America is St. Mark in Toronto; it was built in 1964. The first Coptic Orthodox church in the United States, also called St. Mark, was built in Jersey City, New Jersey shortly afterward. As of 2018, the Coptic American population was estimated to be more than 500,000, with more than 250 Coptic churches in the United States at the time.

In the early 2010s, the Canadian Coptic Association estimates that the population of Canadian Copts was 35,000. By 2017, there were an estimated 50,000 Canadian Copts, with more than 80% living in Ontario, many in the Greater Toronto Area.

The Coptic Australians population has been estimated at 30,000 (ABC News, 2017) to 100,000 (SBS, 2018). The first Coptic Orthodox priest in Australia arrived in 1969; the Coptic Orthodox Church in Australia is organized into two dioceses, the first based in Melbourne (diocese organized in 1999) and the second in Sydney (diocese organized in 2002). There is a single Coptic Catholic church in Australia, consecrated in 2019.

Smaller communities are found in Kuwait, the United Kingdom,
France (45,000), South Africa.

Jordan has a minor community of Copts; the &quot;Jordan Times&quot; reported in 2005 that the Virgin Mary Coptic Orthodox Church in the Abdali district of Amman had 8,000 members, mostly Egyptians. As of 2012, the Lebanon&#x27;s Syriac League estimated that the Coptic population in that country numbered 3,000 to 4,000. As of 2017, Germany was home to between 6,000 and 10,000 Copts. In the 2020s, the Coptic Orthodox population of Austria was estimated to be 10,000, although the 2001 Austrian census (the country&#x27;s last to record religious affiliation) tallied just 1,633 Coptic Orthodox. In Switzerland, the first Copts arrived in the 1960s, mostly students and those fleeing Egypt after the 1952 revolution; the first Coptic church in Switzerland opened in 2004, when there were approximately 1,000 Copts in the country. In Israel, there were approximately 1,000 Copts as of 2014, mostly residing in Jerusalem.

==Persecution and discrimination in Egypt==

Religious freedom in Egypt is hampered to varying degrees by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Coptic Christians, being the largest religious minority in Egypt, are also negatively affected. Copts have faced increasing marginalization after the 1952 coup d&#x27;√©tat led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Until recently, Christians were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was eased in 2005 by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, Copts continue to face many obstacles and restrictions in building new churches. These restrictions do not apply for building mosques. Copts face ethnic and racial discrimination as they are called Adma Zarqa or blue bone and ŸÉŸàŸÅÿ™ From Coptic ‚≤Ö‚≤©‚≤°‚≤ß‚≤ì‚≤ü‚≤• (guptios, ‚ÄúCopt‚Äù). Hence a doublet of ŸÇÿ®ÿ∑Ÿä ( îib·π≠i) and in fact the more native form, but apparently adopted by the Arabs in a mocking manner and is still used today by racists in Egypt.

The Coptic community has been targeted by hate crimes by Islamic extremists. The most significant was the 2000‚Äì01 El Kosheh attacks, in which Muslims and Christians were involved in bloody inter-religious clashes following a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian. &quot;Twenty Christians and one Muslim were killed after violence broke out in the town of el-Kosheh, south of Cairo&quot;. In February 2001 a new Coptic church and 35 houses belonging to Christians were burned.

In 2006, one person attacked three churches in Alexandria, killing one person and injuring 5‚Äì16. The attacker was not linked to any organisation and described as &quot;psychologically disturbed&quot; by the Ministry of Interior. In May 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported increasing waves of mob attacks by Muslims against Copts. Despite frantic calls for help, the police typically arrived after the violence was over. The police also coerced the Copts to accept &quot;reconciliation&quot; with their attackers to avoid prosecuting them, with no Muslims convicted for any of the attacks. In Marsa Matrouh, a Bedouin mob of Muslims tried to attack Copts, with 400 Copts having to barricade themselves in their church while the mob destroyed 18 homes, 23 shops and 16 cars.

Members of U.S. Congress have expressed concern about human trafficking of Coptic women and girls who are victims of abductions, forced conversion to Islam, sexual exploitation and forced marriage to Muslim men.

Boutros Boutros-Ghali was a Copt who served as Egypt&#x27;s foreign minister under President Anwar Sadat. Previously, only two Copts were in Egypt&#x27;s governmental cabinet: Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali and Environment Minister Magued George during former president Mubarak&#x27;s rule. There also used to be one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the Upper Egyptian governorate of Qena, and is the first Coptic governor in decades due to the higher concentration of Copts in Upper Egypt. In addition, Naguib Sawiris, Nassef Sawiris and Samih Sawiris, who are extremely successful businessmen and one of the world&#x27;s 100 wealthiest people, are Copts. In 2002, under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday. However, many Copts continue to complain of being minimally represented in higher positions in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion.

While freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Egyptians are able to convert to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in getting new identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents.&quot; The Coptic community, however, takes pains to prevent conversions from Christianity to Islam due to the ease with which Christians can often become Muslim. Public officials, being conservative themselves, intensify the complexity of the legal procedures required to recognize the religion change as required by law. Security agencies will sometimes claim that such conversions from Islam to Christianity (or occasionally vice versa) may stir social unrest, and thereby justify themselves in wrongfully detaining the subjects, insisting that they are simply taking steps to prevent likely social troubles from happening. In 2007, a Cairo administrative court denied 45 citizens the right to obtain identity papers documenting their reversion to Christianity after converting to Islam. However, in February 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the decision, allowing 12 citizens who had reverted to Christianity to re-list their religion on identity cards, but they will specify that they had adopted Islam for a brief period of time.

In August 2013, following the 3 July 2013 coup and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were widespread attacks on Coptic churches and institutions in Egypt by Sunni Muslims.
 According to at least one Egyptian scholar (Samuel Tadros), the attacks are the worst violence against the Coptic Church since the 14th century.

&quot;USA Today&quot; reported that &quot;forty churches have been looted and torched, while 23 others have been attacked and heavily damaged&quot;. More than 45 churches across Egypt were attacked. The Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party was &quot;rife with false accusations meant to foment hatred against Copts&quot;. The Party&#x27;s page claimed that the Coptic Church had declared &quot;war against Islam and Muslims&quot; and that &quot;The Pope of the Church is involved in the removal of the first elected Islamist president. The Pope of the Church alleges Islamic Sharia is backwards, stubborn, and reactionary.&quot; On August 15, nine Egyptian human rights groups under the umbrella group &quot;Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights&quot;, released a statement saying, &quot;In December ‚Ä¶ Brotherhood leaders began fomenting anti-Christian sectarian incitement. The anti-Coptic incitement and threats continued unabated up to the demonstrations of June 30 and, with the removal of President Morsi ‚Ä¶ morphed into sectarian violence, which was sanctioned by ‚Ä¶ the continued anti-Coptic rhetoric heard from the group&#x27;s leaders on the stage ‚Ä¶ throughout the sit-in.&quot;

Coptic women and girls are abducted, forced to convert to Islam and marry Muslim men. In 2009 the Washington, D.C. based group Christian Solidarity International published a study of the abductions and forced marriages and the anguish felt by the young women because returning to Christianity is against the law. Further allegations of organised abduction of Copts, trafficking and police collusion continue in 2017.
In April 2010, a bipartisan group of 17 members of the U.S. Congress expressed concern to the State Department&#x27;s Trafficking in Persons Office about Coptic women who faced &quot;physical and sexual violence, captivity ... exploitation in forced domestic servitude or commercial sexual exploitation, and financial benefit to the individuals who secure the forced conversion of the victim.&quot;

According to the &quot;Egyptian NGO Association of Victims of Abduction and Forced Disappearance&quot;, between 2011 and March 2014, around 550 Coptic girls have been kidnapped, and forced to convert to Islam. According to the same survey around 40% of the girls were raped prior to their conversion to Islam and married their captors.

==Language==

The Coptic language is the most recent stage of the Egyptian language. Coptic should more correctly be used to refer to the script rather than the language itself. Even though this script was introduced as far back as the 1st century¬†BC, it has been applied to the writing of the Egyptian language from the 1st century¬†AD to the present day. Coptic remained the spoken language of most Egyptians until it was slowly replaced by colloquial Egyptian Arabic in Lower Egypt and Sa&#x27;idi Arabic in Upper Egypt by the end of the 17th century, although it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer.

Today Coptic is extinct but it is still the liturgical language of the native Egyptian Churches (the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church). It is taught worldwide in many prestigious institutions, but its teaching within Egypt remains limited.
Dialects of the Coptic language:
* Sahidic: Theban or Upper Egyptian.
* Bohairic: The dialect of the Nile Delta and of the medieval and modern Coptic Church.
* Akhmimic
* Lycopolitan (also known as Subakhmimic)
* Fayyumic
* Oxyrhynchite

==Calendar==
The Coptic calendar, also called the Alexandrian calendar, is used by the Coptic Orthodox Church and also by Ethiopia as its official calendar (with different names). This calendar is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar. To avoid the calendar creep of the latter, a reform of the ancient Egyptian calendar was introduced at the time of Ptolemy III (Decree of Canopus, in 238¬†BC) which consisted of the intercalation of a sixth epagomenal day every fourth year. However, this reform was opposed by the Egyptian priests, and the idea was not adopted until 25¬†BC, when the Roman Emperor Augustus formally reformed the calendar of Egypt, keeping it forever synchronized with the newly introduced Julian calendar. To distinguish it from the Ancient Egyptian calendar, which remained in use by some astronomers until medieval times, this reformed calendar is known as the Coptic calendar. Its years and months coincide with those of the Ethiopian calendar but have different numbers and names.

===Coptic year===

The Coptic year is the extension of the ancient Egyptian civil year, retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers to keep track of the various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an intercalary month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the year is a leap year or not. The year starts on 29 August in the Julian Calendar or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian Leap Year.

The Feast of Neyrouz marks the first day of the Coptic year. Its celebration falls on the first day of the month of Thout, the first month of the Egyptian year, which for AD 1901 to 2098 usually coincides with 11 September, except before a Gregorian leap year when it&#x27;s September 12. Coptic years are counted from 284¬†AD, the year Diocletian became Roman Emperor, whose reign was marked by tortures and mass executions of Christians, especially in Egypt. Hence, the Coptic year is identified by the abbreviation A.M. (for &quot;Anno Martyrum&quot; or &quot;Year of the Martyrs&quot;). The A.M. abbreviation is also used for the unrelated Jewish year (&quot;Anno Mundi&quot;).

Every fourth Coptic year is a leap year &quot;without exception&quot;, as in the Julian calendar, so the above-mentioned new year dates apply only between AD¬†1900 and 2099 inclusive in the Gregorian Calendar. In the Julian Calendar, the new year is &quot;always&quot; 29 August, except before a Julian leap year when it&#x27;s August 30. Easter is reckoned by the Julian Calendar in the Old Calendarist way.

To obtain the Coptic year number, subtract from the Julian year number either 283 (before the Julian new year) or 284 (after it).

==Genetics==
Copts are the descendants of pre-Islamic Egyptians; when Egyptian Muslims later ceased to call themselves by the demonym, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian minority. Most ethnic Copts are Coptic Oriental Orthodox Christians. According to Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al. (2008), around 45% of Copts in Sudan carry the Haplogroup J. The remainder mainly belong to the E1b1b clade (21%). Both paternal lineages are common among other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations (Beja, Ethiopians, Sudanese Arabs), as well as the Nubians. E1b1b/E3b reaches its highest frequencies among North Africans, Levantine Middle Easterners, and Ethiopid East Africans. The next most common haplogroups borne by Copts in Sudan are the European-linked R1b clade (15%), as well as the archaic African B lineage (15%).

Maternally, Hassan (2009) found that Copts in Sudan exclusively carry various descendants of the macrohaplogroup N. This mtDNA clade is likewise closely associated with local Afroasiatic-speaking populations, including Berbers and Ethiopid peoples. Of the N derivatives borne by Copts, U6 is most frequent (28%), followed by the haplogroup T (17%).

A 2015 study by Dobon et al. identified an ancestral autosomal component of Western Eurasian origin that is common to many modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa. Known as the &quot;Coptic&quot; component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. In their analysis, Sudan&#x27;s Copts formed a separated group in the PCA, a close outlier to other Egyptians, Afro-Asiatic-speaking Northeast Africans and Middle East populations. The scientists suggest that this points to a common origin for the general population of Egypt, or Middle Eastern and North African populations. Copts in general shared the same main ancestral component with North African/Middle Eastern populations. They also associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians.

Hollfelder et al. (2017) analysed various populations in Sudan and observed that Egyptians and Copts showed low levels of genetic differentiation and lower levels of genetic diversity compared to the northeast African groups. Copts and Egyptians displayed similar levels of European or Middle Eastern ancestry (Copts were estimated to be of 69.54% ¬± 2.57 European ancestry, and the Egyptians of 70.65% ¬± 2.47 European ancestry). The authors concluded that the Copts and the Egyptians have a common history linked to smaller population sizes, and that Sudanese Copts have remained relatively isolated since their arrival to Sudan with only low levels of admixture with local northeastern Sudanese groups.

An allele frequency comparative study conducted in 2020 between the two main Egyptian ethnic groups, Muslims and Christians, supported the conclusion that Egyptian Muslims and Egyptian Christians genetically originate from the same ancestors.

They use a &quot;recondite and obscure&quot; Ottoman language within the framework of aestheticism.

<doc id="202373" wikidata="Q4389910" url="?curid=202373" title="The Rani (Doctor Who)">
<text>The Rani is a fictional character in the British BBC science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, portrayed by Kate O&#x27;Mara. She is a renegade Time Lord, and a nemesis of the series&#x27; title character, a Time Lord known as the Doctor. The Rani is an amoral biochemist who experiments on humans and other species, and considers everything secondary to her research. The character appeared in two classic serials, &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; (1985) and &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987), before the original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; went off the air in 1989. The Rani later appeared as the principal villain in &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, a 1993 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; charity television special for BBC Children in Need. The character has since been featured in multiple &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas and novels.

== Description ==
The Rani is a renegade Time Lord and amoral scientist who engages in unscrupulous biological experimentation on humans and other species. She is a nemesis of the series&#x27; title character, the Doctor, another Time Lord who is technically a renegade as well. Time Lords are an ancient race of extraterrestrials from the planet Gallifrey who possess the ability to regenerate into a new form when mortally wounded or killed, and who utilize time travel technology in the form of spacecraft called TARDISes. In the Rani&#x27;s backstory, she is banished from Gallifrey as a result of her radical experiments. She is a contemporary of both the Doctor and his longtime enemy, the Master, the three having attended the Time Lord Academy together in their youth.

&quot;Radio Times&quot; described the Rani as &quot;the renegade Time Lady who is as evil as the Doctor is good&quot; and the Doctor&#x27;s &quot;archest of villains&quot;. Harry Beckett wrote for &quot;Doctor Who TV&quot; that &quot;her Machiavellian personality and sheer doggedness in achieving scientific results made her a formidable foe and a person who you would not want to cross paths with.&quot; Caroline Frost of &quot;HuffPost UK&quot; called the Rani &quot;one of the few characters to match the irrepressible [Doctor] for wit, power and supernatural abilities.&quot; The Rani&#x27;s television portrayer, Kate O&#x27;Mara, described the character as &quot;power-crazed&quot; and &quot;ruthless&quot;, noting that &quot;one assumes that a creature such as the Rani, who is a scientist, is totally amoral and prepared to sacrifice all in the cause of science.&quot; Nur Hussein of &quot;SCIFI.radio&quot; called the Rani &quot;iconic&quot;, writing that &quot;Unlike the power-hungry villain archetype of the Master, the Rani was a ruthless evil scientist who wasn&#x27;t interested in ruling the universe as much as she wanted to understand it, no matter the cost ... her amoral pursuit of science was an interesting foil for the Doctor.&quot; &quot;Doctor Who TV&quot; designated the character &quot;an absolutely wonderful &quot;Doctor Who&quot; villain because her motivation is purely for scientific results.&quot; Mark Donaldson of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; noted, &quot;The Rani didn&#x27;t have the Master&#x27;s obsession with the Doctor. She was never particularly interested in the Doctor and the Master&#x27;s games.&quot; The character has also been described as glamorous, rapacious, cunning and evil, powerful and dynamic, dastardly and possessing fiendish cleverness.

While the Doctor&#x27;s time traveling TARDIS is stuck with the exterior form of a 1963 police telephone call box due to an irreparable &quot;chameleon circuit&quot;, the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS is unbroken and retains its ability to disguise itself. Like the Doctor&#x27;s, the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS is paradoxically &quot;bigger on the inside&quot;, with a similar console.

== Television appearances ==

=== &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; (1985) ===

The Rani, portrayed by Kate O&#x27;Mara, first appears in the 1985 classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, written by Pip and Jane Baker and starring Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor. When cast as the Rani, O&#x27;Mara was known as a prolific theatre actress with extensive credits on film and television. She had previously co-starred with Baker as business adversaries Jane Maxwell and Paul Merroney on the hit drama series &quot;The Brothers&quot; from 1975 to 1976. In 2013, O&#x27;Mara noted that the Rani had been specifically written for her.

In &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS is thrown off course and arrives in a 19th century English mining town during the Industrial Revolution. He and his human companion, Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant), encounter the Rani, a Time Lord and old acquaintance of the Doctor&#x27;s who rules the planet Miasimia Goria. Her biological experimentation on the enslaved populace has heightened their awareness but inadvertently compromised their ability to sleep, turning them violent and plunging the planet into chaos. To restore order, the Rani has been harvesting the neuro-chemical that promotes sleep from human brains, carrying this out in violent periods of Earth&#x27;s history so the resulting aggression and sleeplessness go unnoticed. The Doctor&#x27;s longtime nemesis, the Master (Anthony Ainley), is also present, with his own plan to speed up Earth&#x27;s development and use the planet as a power base. The Doctor eventually foils the Rani and the Master and the villains escape in the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS, but the Doctor has sabotaged the navigational system and velocity regulator. As the ship spins out of control, one of the Rani&#x27;s specimen jars containing a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; embryo falls to the floor and begins to grow rapidly, leaving the Rani and the Master trapped by the creature.

Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the scenes between the Rani, the Doctor and the Master, and called O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s performance &quot;spirited&quot;. &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping noted that &quot;the concept of the Rani mocking the ridiculous Master/Doctor rivalry is wonderful.&quot; O&#x27;Mara called &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; her favorite of the episodes she performed in the series. In her 2003 autobiography &quot;Vamp Until Ready&quot;, she said that while shooting &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, she was treated much differently by crew members who did not recognize her while made up as an old crone, versus when she was transformed by flashy wardrobe, hair and &quot;my most glamorous make-up.&quot; O&#x27;Mara credited &quot;Dynasty&quot; Joan Collins, whose sister O&#x27;Mara played on the series in 1987, for making &quot;being an &#x27;older woman&#x27; acceptable&quot; in television and film.

=== &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; (1987) ===

O&#x27;Mara returned as the Rani in the 1987 classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, again written by Pip and Jane Baker but this time starring Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. The Rani is the only returning &quot;arch-enemy&quot; of the Doctor in the serial, and at the beginning of the story her attack forces the Doctor to regenerate from Colin Baker&#x27;s Sixth Doctor into McCoy&#x27;s seventh incarnation. Time Lord regeneration is a device used by the series since 1966 to accommodate the recasting of prominent characters like the Doctor. The 1987 novelisation of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; explains that after the events of &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, the Rani and the Master escaped the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; because it broke its spine on the ceiling of the Rani&#x27;s TARDIS due to its rapid growth. The end of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; required O&#x27;Mara to be hung upside down like a bat, but after some blood vessels in her eyes burst, the studio nurse forbade filming her in that manner to continue. Shooting continued by turning the camera upside down and employing a wind machine to make O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s hair fly upwards.

In &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, the Rani forces the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS to crash on the planet Lakertya and triggers the Doctor to regenerate. Aided by bat-like alien Tetraps, the Rani has taken control of the planet and its peaceful inhabitants. She has created a giant &quot;time brain&quot;, using intelligence drawn from geniuses across time and space, which she intends to use to make the calculations necessary to turn Lakertya into a Time Manipulator that would allow her to manipulate evolution on a cosmic scale. The Rani injects the Doctor with an amnesia drug, and disguises herself as his companion, Mel Bush (Bonnie Langford). She extracts information from his brain without taking into account his erratic nature, and he and Mel are eventually able to thwart the Rani&#x27;s plans and free the Lakertyans. The Rani escapes in her TARDIS but it has been commandeered by the Tetraps, who take the Rani as their prisoner, having realized that she planned to let them die in the conversion of Lakertya.

Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s &quot;arch delivery was the saving grace of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;.&quot; &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot; also praised the actress: &quot;Another highlight is Kate O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s performance as the Rani which, although undeniably camp and over the top, perfectly suits the mood of the piece and is never less than entertaining. She almost steals the show, in fact, and her impersonation of Bonnie Langford in the amusing sequence where the Rani fools the disorientated and drugged Doctor into believing that she is Mel is wickedly perceptive.&quot;

=== &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993) ===
The original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; went off the air in 1989. The Rani later appeared as the principal villain in &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, a 1993 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; charity television special written by John Nathan-Turner and David Roden, and supporting BBC Children in Need. The two-part special was a crossover between &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the long-running BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, in celebration of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 30th anniversary. Needing a returning villain for the special, Nathan-Turner chose the Rani because she was popular with fans.

In &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, the Rani attempts to trap the first seven incarnations of the Doctor in a time loop in Walford, the fictional setting of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor&#x27;s timeline and cycle through his lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. The Rani has been collecting specimens of every creature in the universe to create a supercomputer, and at one point unleashes her &quot;menagerie&quot;, including a Cyberman, a Sea Devil and an Ogron, to attack the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison). Her plan fails when the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace (Sophie Aldred) overload her computer, sending the Rani, her companion Cyrian (Samuel West) and her TARDIS into the time tunnel.

=== Unproduced serial ===
In late 1984, Nathan-Turner engaged Robert Holmes to write a three-part story, later called &quot;Yellow Fever and How to Cure It&quot;, for season 23 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The serial was to feature the Sixth Doctor, Peri and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) facing off against the newly-introduced Rani, the Master and the Autons, and would be shot in Singapore, where episodes of the BBC drama &quot;Tenko&quot; had been filmed. Once rights to the Rani were secured, all three episodes were commissioned together on 6 February 1985. However on 27 February 1985, BBC One announced that production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would take an extended hiatus, citing a decline in ratings and audiences&#x27; growing concerns over violence on television. While season 22 had consisted of 13 episodes, each with a runtime of 45 minutes, in the intervening months a new season 23 was conceived that would consist of 14 episodes at 25 minutes each. Holmes was asked to continue with the story but as six 25-minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master. He completed a story outline, but ultimately &quot;Yellow Fever and How to Cure It&quot; and other planned serials were set aside in favor of a season-spanning arc called &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. Thanks to fan uproar, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned after just 18 months, with the new season 23 airing in September 1986.

In the planned story for &quot;Yellow Fever and How to Cure It&quot;, the Sixth Doctor and Peri arrive in Singapore to find the Rani allied with the Nestene Consciousness to create Autons with bullets that can shoot around corners and hands that can melt the face of the adversary. The Master is also in Singapore, jealous of the Rani&#x27;s arrangement with the Nestene and intent on interfering with it.

=== Revival ===
The original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was broadcast from 1963 to 1989, and the series was revived in 2005. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fandom has frequently asked for the return of the Rani, considered a popular fan-favorite thanks to O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s standout performance. New casting announcements for female adversaries of the Doctor are typically met with fan speculation that a new incarnation of the Rani has been cast, as was the case with Sarah Lancashire in 2008, Keeley Hawes and Michelle Gomez in 2014, and Barbara Flynn in 2021.

In 2012, then-executive producer and showrunner Steven Moffat said, &quot;People always ask me, &#x27;Do you want to bring back the Rani?&#x27; No one knows who the Rani is. They all know who the Master is, they know Daleks, they probably know who Davros is, but they don&#x27;t know who the Rani is, so there&#x27;s no point in bringing her back.&quot; The following year, Harry Beckett of &quot;Doctor Who TV&quot; voiced his desire for the Rani to return, and noted that despite Moffat&#x27;s comments, the producer had indeed brought back other lesser known old characters to the series. In late 2013, O&#x27;Mara said she would love to reprise the role, and that her age would be &quot;an idea to be exploited.&quot; She explained, ‚ÄúTo have a much older woman as your adversary, there&#x27;s something interesting about that. She&#x27;s learned so much over the centuries‚Äîit would be like in the fairy stories, where it&#x27;s always the old woman who is the most frightening.&quot; O&#x27;Mara died in March 2014.

After being cast as the Fifteenth Doctor in 2022, Ncuti Gatwa voiced his desire to have his &quot;Sex Education&quot; co-star, Gillian Anderson, play a villain opposite him on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. This renewed buzz about the Rani&#x27;s potential return portrayed by Anderson, who had been discussed in association with the role as far back as the 2010 debut of Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor.

As of 2024, the Rani has yet to return to the series. However since Gatwa‚Äôs casting was revealed she has been referenced by name twice. In &quot;Tales of the TARDIS: The Curse of Fenric&quot; (2023) the older Seventh Doctor implies that the Rani was involved in the decision made by Ace (Sophie Aldred) to part company with him. In &quot;Space Babies&quot; (2024) the Fifteenth Doctor includes ‚Äúthe Rani‚Äù among the list of names used by various Time Lords when explaining his own name to Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson).

== Audio dramas ==
The Rani, voiced by O&#x27;Mara, is the lead character of the 2000 BBV Productions audio drama &quot;The Rani Reaps the Whirlwind&quot;, written by Pip and Jane Baker. The story takes place directly following the events of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, with the Rani as the prisoner of the Tetraps. Condemned to death, she plots her escape while being forced to use her scientific knowledge to help her captors replenish their dwindling food supply: blood. The title of the audio drama was originally announced as &quot;Resurrection of the Rani&quot;.

At the time of her death in 2014, O&#x27;Mara was in negotiations with Big Finish Productions to reprise the Rani in a new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama. Producer David Richardson said:
Scottish actress Siobhan Redmond was subsequently cast as a new incarnation of the Rani, first appearing in the 2014 audio drama &quot;The Rani Elite&quot;, written by Justin Richards. In this Sixth Doctor audio adventure, the Rani attempts to reverse engineer chaos theory using the collective minds of the academic elite attending the College of Advanced Galactic Education.

Redmond&#x27;s incarnation of the Rani returns in the 2015 audio drama &quot;Planet of the Rani&quot;, having been imprisoned for 90 years and escaping to seek her revenge against the Doctor. She arrives on the planet Miasimia Goria, a world she once ruled over, where the current leader, Raj Kahnu, regards her as his mother whilst also harbouring deep contempt for her. Kahnu, a genetically engineered humanoid who resides inside the body of a mechanical cockroach, later allows the Rani to leave the planet in a TARDIS survival pod that her previous incarnation had left there.

== Literature ==
A novelisation of &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;, written by Pip and Jane Baker, was published by Target Books in January 1986. The Rani is the villain in &quot;Race Against Time&quot;, a 1986 &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;-style children&#x27;s gamebook, also written by the Bakers, which is part of the &quot;Make Your Own Adventure with Doctor Who&quot; series. In the story, the Sixth Doctor recruits the reader to help him defeat the Rani and her dangerous Time Destabilizer. In December 1987, Target Books published a novelisation of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, written by Pip and Jane Baker.

The Rani appears in the &quot;Virgin Missing Adventures&quot; spin-off novel &quot;State of Change&quot; (1994) by Christopher Bulis, set after &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot;. The Master has escaped the Rani&#x27;s sabotaged TARDIS, but left her adrift in a space-time bubble until she encounters a benign entity that creates a distorted pocket reality where the Egyptians possess 20th-century technology, due to their access to the databanks of a duplicate of the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS console. The Rani tries her hand at political machinations in this reality before the intervention of the Doctor breaks her control over the entity, at which point she escapes in her repaired TARDIS.

The Rani is mentioned in BBC Books&#x27; &quot;Eighth Doctor Adventure&quot; novel &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot; (2000) by Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole. The Eighth Doctor&#x27;s former companion, Fitz Kreiner, claims to have killed the Rani and the Master and now displays their skulls as trophies. The &quot;Past Doctor Adventure&quot; novel &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot; (1999) by Gary Russell features a dream sequence where the Rani is one of a group of promising young Time Lords called &quot;the Deca&quot; which include many future renegades, including the Doctor, the War Chief, the Meddling Monk and the Master. The Rani briefly appears in an artificially created parallel universe in the &quot;Past Doctor Adventures&quot; novel &quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot; (2001). In this reality she, the Master, the Monk and Drax pose as a group of German scientists.

The short story &quot;Rescue&quot;, written by David Roden and published in the &quot;Doctor Who Yearbook 1995&quot;, features the Rani rescuing Cyrian from a Cyberman invasion of his home planet DV Acrol 8, and establishing him as her companion before the events of &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. The Rani returns in the 50th anniversary Sixth Doctor Puffin Books digital short story &quot;Something Borrowed&quot; (2013) by Richelle Mead. In this story, she poses as the fianc√©e of a Koturian nobleman to learn more about the species&#x27; unique form of regeneration, but is foiled by the Doctor and Peri.

== Merchandising ==
The Danbury Mint released a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Chess Set in 1992, featuring a pewter figurine of O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s Rani as the Black Queen. Eaglemoss Collections produced a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Time Lords figurine set featuring the Rani and the Inquisitor in 2018. Multiple collectible trading cards of the Rani have been produced:
* 1994 Cornerstone &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Trading Cards: Series 1 Base Card #98 - The Rani
* 2013 Topps &quot;Doctor Who Alien Attax&quot; Collectible Card Game - The Rani #206
* 2015 Topps &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Trading Cards: Base Card #17 - The Rani

== Reception ==
O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s performance as the Rani has been widely praised, with her portrayal deemed both memorable and definitive. Nur Hussein of &quot;SCIFI.radio&quot; described the performance as &quot;delightfully over-the-top&quot;, and Harry Beckett of &quot;Doctor Who TV&quot; noted, &quot;She looked exactly how an evil Time Lady should appear ... O&#x27;Mara had a prepossessing sense of evil about her, a seductive look that could be both a sneer and a flirtatious smile.&quot; Dan Wilson of &quot;Metro&quot; wrote, &quot;Kate O&#x27;Mara played the part to perfection. Powerful and dynamic, with more than a hint of dominatrix glam, she really made the part her own ... O&#x27;Mara soars above the bad writing ... If the Rani is to return, then the actor who takes the role would do well to take the best of what Kate O&#x27;Mara gave.&quot; The Rani has become a favorite among both fans and critics, who have clamored for her return to the series for decades.

<doc id="202380" wikidata="Q2754997" url="?curid=202380" title="Dirk Gently">
<text>Dirk Gently (born Svlad Cjelli, also known as Dirk Cjelli) is a fictional character created by English writer Douglas Adams and featured in the books &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; and &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;. He is portrayed as a pudgy man who normally wears a heavy old light brown suit, red checked shirt with a green striped tie, long leather coat, red hat and thick metal-rimmed spectacles. &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; is not the character&#x27;s real name. It is noted early on in the first book that it is a pseudonym for &quot;Svlad Cjelli&quot;. Dirk himself states that the name has a &quot;Scottish dagger feel&quot; to it.

== Holistic detective ==
Dirk bills himself as a &quot;holistic detective&quot; who makes use of &quot;the fundamental interconnectedness of all things&quot; to solve the whole crime, and find the whole person. This involves running up large expense accounts and then claiming that every item (such as needing to go to a tropical beach in the Bahamas for three weeks) was, as a consequence of this &quot;fundamental interconnectedness&quot;, actually a vital part of the investigation. Challenged on this point in the first novel, he claims that he cannot be considered to have ripped anybody off, because none of his clients have ever paid him. His office is supposed to be located at 33a Peckender St. N1 London. As an investigator whose cases often take a paranormal twist, he challenges the notion that ‚Äì as presented by Sherlock Holmes ‚Äì &quot;when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;, as sometimes the impossible explanation makes more sense. To prove this, Dirk cites as an example an incident where a young girl is somehow reciting the stock market prices exactly as they change but twenty-four hours earlier. As Dirk describes it, it is &quot;impossible&quot; that the girl is getting those figures out of thin air, but the alternative implausible explanation is that the girl is masterminding a complex scheme with no obvious benefit to herself involving her somehow acquiring and memorising the prices without anyone seeing her. The idea that she just &quot;knows&quot; the prices suggests that something is happening that nobody knows about, but the concept of a complex conspiracy that doesn&#x27;t benefit the girl in any way suggests a scenario contrary to what &quot;is&quot; known about typical human behavior.

Dirk is psychic, though he refuses to believe in such things, insisting that he merely has a &quot;depressingly accurate knack for making wild assumptions&quot;. The &quot;depressing&quot; part is that he is seemingly unable to use this knack to win money gambling on horse racing. As a student at Cambridge University (St. Cedd&#x27;s College) he attempted to acquire money by selling exam papers for the upcoming tests. His fellow undergraduates were convinced that he was psychic and had produced the papers under hypnosis, while he claimed he had simply studied previous papers and determined potential patterns in questions. When his papers turned out to be exactly the same as the real ones, to the very comma, he was expelled from the university and later sent to prison.

Dirk goes on to solve a highly elaborate time travel murder mystery, and accidentally answers the age-old question of exactly who interrupted Samuel Taylor Coleridge while he was writing the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. Along the way Dirk stumbles onto a highly improbable horse in a bathroom, discovers who really composed all of Bach&#x27;s music, and fails to find Schr√∂dinger&#x27;s elusive cat.

Douglas Adams was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, at the time of his death. However Adams said &quot;A lot of the stuff which was originally in &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot; really wasn&#x27;t working,&quot; and that he had planned on &quot;salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn&#x27;t make work in a &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; framework and putting them in a &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; framework... and for old time&#x27;s sake I may call it &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;.&quot; The first ten chapters of this novel, assembled from various drafts following Adams&#x27; death, together with a memo suggesting further plot points, appear in &quot;The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time&quot;.

<text>&quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (also translated as &quot;In the Penal Settlement&quot;) is a short story by Franz Kafka written in German in October 1914, revised in November 1918, and first published in October 1919. As in some of Kafka&#x27;s other writings, the narrator in this story seems detached from, or perhaps numbed by, events that one would normally expect to be registered with horror. Internal clues and the setting on an island suggest Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s &quot;The Torture Garden&quot; as an influence. The story is set in an unnamed penal colony and describes the last use of an elaborate torture and execution device that carves the commandment that the condemned prisoner has transgressed on his skin as he slowly dies over the course of twelve hours. As the plot unfolds, the reader learns more and more about the machine, including its origin and original justification.

==Plot outline==

===Characters===
There are only four characters, each named according to his role in the story. The Condemned is a man scheduled for execution, the Soldier is responsible for guarding him, the Officer is in charge of the machine that will execute the Condemned, and the Traveler is a European dignitary and visitor.

===Synopsis===
The story focuses on the Traveler, who has just arrived in an island penal colony and is encountering its brutal execution machine for the first time. Everything about the functioning of the intricate machine and its purpose and history is told to him by the Officer. The Soldier and the Condemned, who is unaware that he has been sentenced to die for failing to get up and salute his superior&#x27;s door each hour during his night watch, placidly watch from nearby.

Under the judicial process associated with the machine, the accused is always assumed to be guilty and is not given a chance to defend himself. As punishment, the law the man has broken is inscribed progressively deeper on his body over a period of 12 hours as he slowly dies from his wounds. During their final six hours in the machine, the accused supposedly experiences a religious epiphany. The machine was designed by the colony&#x27;s previous Commandant, of whom the Officer is a devoted supporter. He carries its blueprints with him and is the only person who can decipher them, not allowing anyone else to handle them.

Eventually, it becomes clear that the machine has fallen out of favor since the death of the previous Commandant and the appointment of a successor. The Officer is nostalgic regarding the torture device and the values that were initially associated with it, recalling the crowds that used to attend each execution. Now, he is the last outspoken proponent of the machine, but he strongly believes in its form of justice and the infallibility of the previous Commandant.

The Officer begs the Traveler to speak to the current Commandant on behalf of the machine&#x27;s continued use. The Traveler refuses to do so; he says he will not speak against the machine publicly and will instead give his opinion to the Commandant privately and then leave before he can be called to give an official account. Crestfallen that the Traveler has not been persuaded by his explanations and entreaty, the Officer frees the Condemned and sets up the machine for himself, with the words &quot;Be Just&quot; to be written on him. However, the machine malfunctions because of its advanced state of disrepair; instead of its usual elegant operation, it quickly stabs the Officer to death, denying him the mystical experience of the prisoners he had executed.

Accompanied by the Soldier and the Condemned, the Traveler makes his way to a tea house, in which he is shown the grave of the previous Commandant, who was not allowed to be buried in the cemetery. The gravestone, which is set so low that a table can easily be placed over it, bears an inscription stating the belief of his nameless followers that he will rise from the dead someday and retake control of the colony. The Traveler immediately goes to the harbor and finds someone to take him out to the steamer on which he is traveling. He repels the efforts of the Soldier and Condemned to follow him.

== Religious readings ==
If all parallels with the Bible are considered, the reading can be &quot;an unorthodox ... vision of traditional theology&quot;. The old way of running the colony is reminiscent of the views presented in the Old Testament, with the old Commandant ‚Äì creator of the torture machine, as well as the colony itself ‚Äì resembling God. The old Commandant focused on human guilt, which &quot;is never to be doubted&quot;. The comparison between the machine used in the penal colony and the world in general could mean that the purpose of life is to deserve salvation from the guilt by means of suffering. According to Geddes, however, interpreting the usage of the contraption in such a way could result in glossing over the story&#x27;s lesson ‚Äì dangers of viewing events as a form of a theodicy, secular or sacred. More parallels include the new, more liberal rules established in the colony after the death of the original Commandant, which might represent the New Testament. Similarly to the way in which Christianity evolved from &quot;old law of the Hebraic tradition&quot; to the merciful rules of the New Testament, we can see such progression in Kafka&#x27;s story. The officer could represent Christ, but in &quot;Kafka&#x27;s inversion of traditional Christian theology&quot;, he sacrifices himself to showcase his support for the former Commandant, as opposed to the new rules. The inscription on the grave of the old Commandant may also imply that the &quot;second coming&quot; refers to the comeback of old rules. Other critics (Politzer, Thorbly, Neumeyer) recognize the parallels and symbolism, but do not want to associate them with any specific biblical reading. Neumeyer added that the English translation of the short story created by Willa Muir and Edwin Muir contains inaccuracies, including those that support the religious interpretation, giving the reader a &quot;misshapen image&quot; of the story.

== Adaptations ==
*In 1969, the story was adapted as a play by Steven Berkoff, who also played The Officer.
* In 1970, Chilean filmmaker Ra√∫l Ruiz made a film called &quot;The Penal Colony&quot;, based on the story.
* In 1999, Charlie Deaux wrote and directed the short avant-garde film &quot;Zoetrope&quot;, which is loosely based upon the story. The score of the film was written and performed by Lustmord.
* In 2000, composer Philip Glass wrote a chamber opera, &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;, based on the story.
* A 24-minute film adaptation by Turkish-born Canadian filmmaker Sibel Guvenc was released in 2006.
* In 2009, a young Iranian filmmaker, Narges Kalhor, showed her short film adaptation at the Nuremberg Film Festival.
* In July 2011, the ShiberHur Theatre Company of Palestine presented a new version of &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;, adapted by Amir Nizar Zuabi, at London&#x27;s Young Vic.
* In 2012, Egyptian independent theatrical group Warsha performed an Arabic language adaption in Cairo directed by Hassan El Geretly.
*A 40-minute film adaptation created by filmmakers in Las Vegas, Nevada, was completed in 2013 and released on Vimeo in 2014.
*In 2018, a new theatrical adaptation, &quot;Franz Kafka ‚Äì Apparatus,&quot; written and directed by Welsh playwright Ross Dinwiddy, premiered at The Rialto Theatre Brighton as part of the Brighton Fringe. In a departure from the source text, Dinwiddy explores the sexual attraction that develops between The Soldier and The Condemned Man and changes the gender of The Officer from male to female.

==In popular culture==

Frank Zappa, in the liner notes of the Mothers of Invention album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; (1968), recommends reading the short story before listening to the track &quot;The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny.&quot;

Ian Curtis of the band Joy Division was inspired by &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; to write the song &quot;Colony&quot; from the album &quot;Closer&quot; (1980).

The novel &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer&quot; (1980) by Gene Wolfe follows the exploits of a member of a guild of torturers. At one point, when giving a tour of the facilities to a condemned prisoner, the head of the guild describes a device identical to the one presented in this short story.

Ivan Kl√≠ma mentions in his novel Love and Garbage (1986) the first story by Kafka that he had ever read, which was a story of &quot;...a traveler to whom an officer on some island wants to demonstrate, with love and dedication, his own bizarre execution machine.&quot; The narrator is very likely referring to &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;.

In Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot; (2002), the protagonist, a boy who calls himself Kafka, admits that &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; is his favorite of Franz Kafka&#x27;s short stories. He imagines Franz Kafka&#x27;s purely mechanical explanation of the machine as &quot;a substitute for explaining the situation we&#x27;re in.&quot;

The album &quot;Public Strain&quot; (2010) by Canadian rock band Women features the song &quot;Penal Colony&quot;, which references Kafka&#x27;s story.

The 2015 video game &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations 2&quot; contains many references to Kafka&#x27;s works. Along with being set within an island colony, the first episode is named &quot;The Penal Colony&quot; after the story, a file found within the game contains an excerpt from &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;, and one of the locations features a torture device similar to the one described by Kafka.

<text>A spear-thrower, spear-throwing lever, or atlatl ( or ; Nahuatl &quot;ahtlatl&quot; ) is a tool that uses leverage to achieve greater velocity in dart or javelin-throwing, and includes a bearing surface that allows the user to store energy during the throw.

It may consist of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the spear. It&#x27;s usually about as long as the user&#x27;s arm or forearm. The user holds the spear-thrower in one hand, gripping near the end farthest from the cup. The user puts the butt end of the spear, or dart, in the cup, or grabs the spur with the end of the spear. The spear is much longer than the thrower. The user holds the thrower at the grip end, with the spear resting on the thrower and the butt end of the spear resting in the thrower&#x27;s cup. The user can hold the spear, with the index and thumb, with the same hand as the thrower, with the other fingers. The user reaches back with the spear pointed at the target. Then they make an overhand throwing motion with the thrower while letting go of the spear with the fingers.

The dart is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever. The spear-thrower is a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever. This extra length allows the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus imparting more energy and higher speeds.

Common modern ball throwers (such as molded plastic arms used for throwing tennis balls for dogs to fetch) use the same principle.

A spear-thrower is a long-range weapon and can readily impart to a projectile speeds of over .

Spear-throwers appear early in human history in several parts of the world, and have survived in use in traditional societies until the present day, as well as being revived in recent years for sporting purposes. In the United States, the Nahuatl word is often used for revived uses of spear-throwers (or the Mayan word ); in Australia, the Dharug word is used instead.

The ancient Greeks and Romans used a leather thong or loop, known as an &quot;ankule&quot; or &quot;amentum&quot;, as a spear-throwing device. The Swiss arrow is a weapon that works similarly to amentum.

== Design ==

Spear-thrower designs may include improvements such as thong loops to fit the fingers, the use of flexible shafts or stone balance weights. Dart shafts can be made thinner and highly flexible for added power and range, the fletching can be spiralized to add spin to the dart making it more stable and accurate. Darts resemble large arrows or small spears and are typically from in length and 9 to 16¬†mm (3/8&quot; to 5/8&quot;) in diameter.

Another important improvement to the spear-thrower&#x27;s design was the introduction of a small weight (between 60 and 80¬†grams) strapped to its midsection. Some atlatlists maintain that stone weights add mass to the shaft of the device, causing resistance to acceleration when swung and resulting in a more forceful and accurate launch of the dart. Others claim that spear-thrower weights add only stability to a cast, resulting in greater accuracy.

Based on previous work done by William S. Webb, William R. Perkins claims that spear-thrower weights, commonly called &quot;bannerstones&quot;, and characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone, shaped wide and flat with a drilled hole and thus a little like a large wingnut, are an improvement to the design that created a silencing effect when swung. The use of the device would reduce the telltale &quot;zip&quot; of a swung atlatl to a more subtle &quot;woof&quot; sound that did not travel as far and was less likely to alert prey. Robert Berg&#x27;s theory is that the bannerstone was carried by hunters as a spindle weight to produce string from natural fibers gathered while hunting, for the purpose of tying on fletching and hafting stone or bone points.

=== Woomera ===
The woomera or ‚Äòmiru‚Äô, allow hunters to apply more force, speed and distance when launching their spears. A woomera is usually made from Mulga wood, and serves many other purposes such as a: receptacle for mixing ochre for traditional paintings for ceremonies, deflection tool of enemies‚Äô spears in battle, fire making saw, or a utensil for chopping game. This tool is usually long and wide, and comes in a concave, elliptical shape.

=== Artistic designs ===
Several Stone Age spear-throwers (usually now incomplete) are decorated with carvings of animals: the British Museum has one decorated with a mammoth, and there is one decorated with a hyena in France. Many pieces of decorated bone may have belonged to b√¢tons de commandement.
The Aztec atlatl was often decorated with snake designs and feathers, potentially evocative of its association with Ehecatl, the Aztec wind deity.

== History ==
Wooden darts were known at least since the Middle Paleolithic (Sch√∂ningen, Torralba, Clacton-on-Sea and Kalambo Falls). While the spear-thrower is capable of casting a dart well over one hundred meters, it is most accurately used at distances of twenty meters or less. The spearthrower is believed to have been in use by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; since the Upper Paleolithic (around 30,000 years ago). Most stratified European finds come from the Magdalenian (late upper Palaeolithic). In this period, elaborate pieces, often in the form of animals, are common. The earliest reliable data concerning atlatls have come from several caves in France dating to the Upper Paleolithic, about 21,000 to 17,000 years ago. The earliest known example is a 17,500-year-old Solutrean atlatl made of reindeer antler, found at Combe Sauni√®re (Dordogne), France. It is possible that the atlatl was invented earlier than this, as Mungo Man from 42,000 BP displays arthritis in his right elbow, a pathology referred to today as the &quot;Atlatl elbow,&quot; resulting from many years of forceful torsion from using an atlatl. At present, there is no evidence for the use of atlatls in Africa. Peoples such as the Maasai and Khoisan throw spears without any aids, but the use of atlatls in hunting is limited in comparison to spears because the animal must be close and already immobile.

During the Ice Age, the atlatl was used by humans to hunt megafauna. Ice Age megafauna offered a large food supply when other game was limited, and the atlatl gave more power to pierce their thicker skin. In this time period, atlatls were usually made of wood or bone. Improvements made to spears&#x27; edge made it more efficient as well.

In Europe, the spear-thrower was supplemented by the bow and arrow in the Epi-Paleolithic. Along with improved ease of use, the bow offered the advantage that the bulk of elastic energy is stored in the throwing device, rather than the projectile. Arrow shafts can therefore be much smaller and have looser tolerances for spring constant and weight distribution than atlatl darts. This allowed for more forgiving flint knapping: dart heads designed for a particular spear thrower tend to differ in mass by only a few percent. By the Iron Age, the amentum, a strap attached to the shaft, was the standard European mechanism for throwing lighter javelins. The amentum gives not only range, but also spin to the projectile.
The spear-thrower was used by early Americans as well. It may have been introduced to America during the immigration across the Bering Land Bridge, and despite the later introduction of the bow and arrow, atlatl use was widespread at the time of first European contact. Atlatls are represented in the art of multiple pre-Columbian cultures, including the Basketmaker culture in the American Southwest, Maya in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and Moche in the Andes of South America. Atlatls were especially prominent in the iconography of the warriors of the Teotihuacan culture of Central Mexico. A ruler from Teotihuacan named Spearthrower Owl is an important figure described in Mayan stelae. Complete wooden spear-throwers have been found on dry sites in the western United States and in waterlogged environments in Florida and Washington. Several Amazonian tribes also used the atlatl for fishing and hunting. Some even preferred this weapon over the bow and arrow and used it not only in combat but also in sports competitions. Such was the case with the Tarairi√∫, a Tapuya tribe of migratory foragers and raiders inhabiting the forested mountains and highland savannahs of Rio Grande do Norte in mid-17th-century Brazil. Anthropologist Harald Prins offers the following description:The atlatl, as used by these Tarairiu warriors, was unique in shape. About long and wide, this spear thrower was a tapering piece of wood carved of brown hard-wood. Well-polished, it was shaped with a semi-circular outer half and had a deep groove hollowed out to receive the end of the javelin, which could be engaged by a horizontal wooden peg or spur lashed with a cotton thread to the proximal and narrower end of the throwing board, where a few scarlet parrot feathers were tied for decoration. [Their] darts or javelins ... were probably made of a two-meter long wooden cane with a stone or long and serrated hard-wood point, sometimes tipped with poison. Equipped with their uniquely grooved atlatl, they could hurl their long darts from a great distance with accuracy, speed, and such deadly force that these easily pierced through the protective armor of the Portuguese or any other enemy.The spear-thrower was an important part of life, hunting, and religion in the ancient Andes. The earliest known spear-thrower of the South Americas had a proximal handle piece and is commonly referred to as an &quot;est√≥lica&quot; in Spanish references to indigenous Andean culture . &quot;Est√≥lica&quot; and atlatl are therefore synonymous terms. The &quot;est√≥lica&quot; is best known archaeologically from Nazca culture and the Inca civilization, but the earliest examples are known from associations with Chinchorro mummies. The &quot;est√≥lica&quot; is also known from Moche culture, including detailed representations on painted pottery, and in representations on textiles of the Wari culture.

The Andean &quot;est√≥lica&quot; had a wooden body with a hook that was made of stone or metal. These hooks have been found at multiple highland sites including Cerro Ba√∫l, a site of the Wari culture. In the Andes, the tips of darts were often capped with metal. Arrow points commonly had the same appearance as these Andean tips. The length of a common &quot;est√≤lica&quot; was about 50¬†cm. &quot;Est√≥lica&quot; handles were commonly carved and modeled to represent real world accounts like animals and deities.

Examples of &quot;est√≤licas&quot; with no handle pieces have been interpreted as children&#x27;s toys. Archaeologists found decorated examples in the Moche culture burial of the Lady of Cao at El Brujo in the Chicama valley. At her feet was a group of twenty-three atlatls with handle pieces that depicted birds. These ‚Äútheatrical‚Äù &quot;est√≤licas&quot; are different from normal weapons. They are much longer (80‚Äì100¬†cm) than the regular examples (50‚Äì60¬†cm). Archeologists John Whittaker and Kathryn Kamp, both faculty from Grinnell College, speculate that they might have been part of a ceremony before the burial or symbolic references to indicate that the royal woman in the burial had been a warrior.

&quot;Est√≥licas&quot; are depicted along with maces, clubs, and shields on Moche vessels that illustrate warfare. The atlatl appears in the artwork of Chav√≠n de Huantar, such as on the Black and White Portal.

Among the Tlingit of Southeast Alaska, approximately one dozen old elaborately carved specimens they call &quot;shee √°an&quot; (sitting on a branch) remain in museum collections and private collections, one having sold at auction for more than $100,000.

In September 1997, an atlatl dart fragment, carbon dated to 4360 ¬± 50 14C yr BP (TO 6870), was found in an ice patch on mountain Thandl√§t, the first of the southern Yukon Ice Patches to be studied.

The people of New Guinea and Aboriginal people in Australia also use spear-throwers. In the mid Holocene, Aboriginal people in Australia developed spear-throwers, known as &quot;woomeras&quot;.

As well as its practical use as a hunting weapon, it may also have had social effects. John Whittaker suggests the device was a social equalizer in that it requires skill rather than muscle power alone. Thus, women and children would have been able to participate in hunting.

Whittaker said the stone-tipped projectiles from the Aztec atlatl were not powerful enough to penetrate Spanish steel plate armor, but they were strong enough to penetrate the mail, leather and cotton armor that most Spanish soldiers wore. Whittaker said the Aztecs started their battles with atlatl darts followed with melee combat using the macuahuitl.
Another type of Stone Age artefact that is sometimes excavated is the . These are shorter, normally less than one foot long, and made of antler, with a hole drilled through them. When first found in the nineteenth century, they were interpreted by French archaeologists to be symbols of authority, like a modern field marshal&#x27;s baton, and so named (&quot;batons of command&quot;). Though debate over their function continues, tests with replicas have found them effective aids to spear or dart throwing when used with a cord. Another theory is that they were &quot;arrow-straighteners&quot;.

== Bian Jian (&quot;Spear sling&quot;) ==
Bian Jian (, lit. &#x27;Whip arrow&#x27;) is a unique spear-thrower that was used during Song period. It can be described as a long staff sling that throws a spear-sized dart instead of a rock-like projectile. It requires two operators unlike other spear-throwers. It should not be confused with another Bian Jian ().

== Modern times ==

In modern times, some people have resurrected the dart thrower for sports, often using the term atlatl, throwing either for distance and/or for accuracy. The World Atlatl Association was formed in 1987 to promote the atlatl. Throws of almost have been recorded. Colleges reported to field teams in this event include Grinnell College in Iowa, Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire, Alfred University in New York, and the University of Vermont.

Atlatls are sometimes used in modern times for hunting. In the U.S., the Pennsylvania Game Commission has given preliminary approval for legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals. The animals that would be allowed to atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but particular consideration has been given to deer. Currently, Alabama allows the atlatl for deer hunting, while a handful of other states list the device as legal for rough fish (those not sought for sport or food), some game birds and non-game mammals. Starting in 2007, Missouri allowed use of the atlatl for hunting wildlife (excluding deer and turkey), and starting in 2010, also allowed deer hunting during the firearms portion of the deer season (except the muzzleloader portion). Starting in 2012, Missouri allowed the use of atlatls during the fall archery deer and turkey hunting seasons and, starting in 2014, allowed the use of atlatls during the spring turkey hunting season as well. Missouri also allows use of the atlatl for fishing, with some restrictions (similar to the restrictions for spearfishing and bowfishing). The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission allows the use of atlatls for the taking of deer .

The woomera is still used today by some Aboriginal people for hunting in Australia. Yup&#x27;ik Eskimo hunters still use the atlatl, known locally as &quot;nuqaq&quot; (nook-ak), in villages near the mouth of the Yukon River for seal hunting.

=== Competitions ===
There are numerous atlatl competitions held every year, with spears and spear-throwers built using both ancient and modern materials. Events are often held at parks, such as Letchworth State Park in New York, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Illinois, or Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. Atlatl associations around the world host a number of local atlatl competitions. Chimney Point State Historic Site in Addison, Vermont hosts the annual Northeast Open Atlatl Championship. In 2009, the Fourteenth Annual Open Atlatl Championship was held on Saturday and Sunday, September 19 and 20. On the Friday before the Championship, a workshop was held to teach modern and traditional techniques of atlatl and dart construction, flint knapping, hafting stone points, and cordage making. Competitions may be held in conjunction with other events, such as the Ohio Pawpaw Festival, or at the Bois D&#x27;Arc Primitive Skills Gathering and Knap-in, held every September in southern Missouri.

Atlatl events commonly include the International Standard Accuracy Competition (ISAC), in which contestants throw ten times at a bull&#x27;s-eye target. Other contests involving different distances or terrain may also be included, usually testing the atlatlist&#x27;s accuracy rather than distance throwing.

=== Popular culture ===
In the sixth episode of the fourth season of the television competition &quot;Top Shot&quot;, the elimination round consisted of two contestants using the atlatl at ranges of 30, 45 and 60 feet.

An atlatl was the weapon of choice of a serial killer in the 2020 action-thriller &quot;The Silencing&quot;, where it is erroneously described as an illegal weapon.

Lydia Demarek, a character in the popular fantasy novel series &quot;Brotherband&quot;, owns and often uses an atlatl.

In the light novel series &quot;Evangelion ANIMA&quot;, an enemy known as a Victor uses a form of atlatl as a weapon.

<doc id="202389" wikidata="Q1005412" url="?curid=202389" title="Giant Robo (TV series)">
<text>, also known as Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot in the United States, is a manga and tokusatsu series created by Mitsuteru Yokoyama. It is similar to Yokoyama&#x27;s &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; (known as &quot;Gigantor&quot; in the U.S.), but &quot;Giant Robo&quot; has more elements of fantasy. The original 26-episode tokusatsu TV series, produced by Toei Company, aired on NET (later renamed TV Asahi) from October 11, 1967 to April 1, 1968.

==Plot==
Earth is invaded by an interstellar terrorist group, Big Fire (the Gargoyle Gang in the American version), led by Emperor Guillotine. Guillotine spends most of his time in a multicolored space ship hidden at the bottom of Earth&#x27;s ocean, from which he issues his orders. The group has been capturing scientists to create an army of monsters to help them conquer Earth. A boy named Daisaku Kusama (Johnny Sokko in the American version) and a young Unicorn peacekeeping agent named J≈´r≈ç Minami (Jerry Mano in the American version) are shipwrecked on an island after their ship is attacked by the sea monster Dakolar and subsequently captured by Big Fire. They flee onto an elevator leading to a complex where a Pharaoh-like giant robot is being built by captive scientist Lucius Guardian, who gives Daisaku and J≈´r≈ç its control device. Guardian helps them escape before he is shot to death; before he dies, he triggers an atomic bomb which destroys the base. The radiation activates the robot, which now obeys only Daisaku. The boy is invited by J≈´r≈ç and his chief, Azuma, to join Unicorn and fight Big Fire with Giant Robo.

The members of the gang all have explosive devices implanted in their bodies that are to be detonated instantly if they are captured.

===Monsters===
In each episode, the Gargoyle Gang sends a monster to attack its enemies (the Japanese version&#x27;s names are listed first, followed by the American version&#x27;s names):

*&quot;Drakulon&quot;: Appears in Episode 25; powers include vampirism, size-alteration, a shield and a rapier.

===Emperor Guillotine===
Guillotine is a blue-skinned alien who has tentacles extending from the bottom of his head. He wears a long robe, carries a staff with a white orb at one end and can grow to a great height, which he does only in the final episode of the series.

Guillotine leaves day-to-day matters in the hands of various commanders (again, the Japanese version&#x27;s names are listed first, followed by the American version&#x27;s names):
*&quot;Spider&quot;, a human who is killed by a spray of acid from Ikageras&#x27; (Scalion&#x27;s) mouth
*&quot;Doctor Over&quot; (&quot;Doctor Botanus&quot;), a silver-skinned alien capable of teleportation
*&quot;Red Cobra&quot; (&quot;Fangar&quot;, &quot;Dangor the Executioner&quot;), a bizarre mutant with protruding teeth, a peg leg and a gigantic forehead

*&quot;Mr. Gold&quot; (&quot;Goldenaut&quot;), a golden-armored robot knight
*&quot;Doctor Germa&quot; (&quot;Doctor Eingali&quot;), an evil yokai responsible for the creation of a Daisaku Kusuma android that briefly controls Giant Robo before its destruction

==Arsenal==
Giant Robo has a number of weapons, including finger missiles, a back missile, a bazooka cannon, radion eye beams, a flying-V missile, a flamethrower and electric wires.

==Alternate versions==
The English-dubbed American version of the series directed by Reuben Guberman, was produced by American International Television. It was first broadcast in the United States in 1969 by AIP-TV and was in syndication through the early 1980s. It also aired during the early 1970s through the 1990s in Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and various Southeast Asian and Latin American countries.

In 1970, stock footage from episodes 1, 2, 10, 17 and 26 were edited together and released by AIP-TV as a 100-minute made-for-TV film called &quot;Voyage Into Space&quot;.

===Home media releases ===
A hastily edited seven-minute highlight reel of &quot;Voyage Into Space&quot; was created for the Super 8 home movie market during the early 1970s by Ken Films.

Toei Video released 22 episodes of the series on Betamax and VHS for the Japanese market in 1981 and 1982 and later released the entire series on LaserDisc in Japan during the 1990s. It is also available on DVD in Japan.

In 1996, the &quot;Johnny Sokko&quot; version of the series was re-released through distribution by Orion Home Video and Streamline Pictures containing eight episodes in production order on four volumes (two episodes on each videocassette). Plans for further volumes were cancelled due to the parent company Orion Pictures being purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1997.

On March 26, 2013, Shout! Factory released the 26-episode, four-disc box set &quot;Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In February 2021, a remastered version of &quot;Voyage Into Space&quot; was released on Blu-ray by RoninFlix and Scorpion Releasing.

==Violence concerns==
Although the series was violent by 1960s American standards for children&#x27;s programming, in Japan it was no more violent than other tokusatsu TV series airing at the time. Gunfights are a staple of each episode and the show&#x27;s two child leads (Johnny Sokko and Mari Hanson) were frequently seen shooting with the other Unicorn agents. In one episode, Johnny and Mari are captured and tied to trees by Gargoyle and are within seconds of being executed by a firing squad when they are rescued by Unicorn agents. Nearly every Japanese anime exported to the United States during that period was edited for violence, but in &quot;Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot&quot;, only a minimum of violence was removed. (At least one US TV station, WXON in Detroit, ran disclaimers before each show saying, &quot;Remember, kids, Johnny Sokko is make-believe and the actors are just pretending.&quot;) In addition to dubbing American voice actors for the American version, many of the show&#x27;s sound effects were remixed or re-recorded.

==List of episodes==
The following episode titles were transcribed from the on-screen title cards of the American version. They are in their original Japanese and American broadcast order, verified by previews for the next episode at the end of each one:

==Related series==
 is an animated TV series written by Chiaki Konaka (&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, &quot;The Big O&quot;) and directed by Masahiko Murata (&quot;,&quot; &quot;Mazinkaiser&quot;). At the dawn of the 21st century, Earth is overrun by giant robots. Daisaku Kusama encounters the titular Robo in a ruin in Okinawa. Beckoned by forces he cannot understand, Daisaku is made to bond, body and spirit, with the ancient weapon and defend his homeland from the incoming evil.

<doc id="202392" wikidata="Q318452" url="?curid=202392" title="Air (French band)">
<text>Air is a French music duo from Versailles, consisting of Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel. Their critically acclaimed debut album, &quot;Moon Safari&quot;, including the track &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;, was an international success in 1998. Its follow-up, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, was the score to Sofia Coppola&#x27;s first film &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. The band has since released the albums &quot;10 000¬†Hz Legend&quot;, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot;, &quot;Pocket Symphony&quot;, &quot;Love 2&quot;, &quot;Le voyage dans la lune&quot; and &quot;Music for Museum&quot;. The band is influenced by a wide variety of musical styles and artists.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Nicolas Godin studied architecture at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d&#x27;architecture de Versailles, and Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel studied mathematics, before forming a band in 1995. Before founding Air, Dunckel and Godin played together in the band Orange with others such as Alex Gopher, Xavier Jamaux and Jean de Reydellet. The former two subsequently contributed to remixes of tracks recorded by Air.

Initially Godin worked alone, recording a demo with members of Funkadelic as his backing band before releasing his first entirely solo effort, &quot;Modular Mix&quot;, which featured production by √âtienne de Cr√©cy.

=== Recording career ===
After making several remixes for other acts in the early 1990s, Air recorded its first EP, &quot;Premiers Sympt√¥mes&quot;, in 1995. The band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Moon Safari&quot;, was released in 1998. The first single off the album, &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;, received heavy airplay on alternative radio stations, and &quot;Moon Safari&quot; became an international success. In 1999, Air composed the original score for Sofia Coppola&#x27;s debut film &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. In 2012, Air completed its second score, to accompany Georges M√©li√®s&#x27; early silent film &quot;Le Voyage Dans La Lune&quot;. Dunckel and Godin also released four other studio albums in the 2000s, including &quot;10 000¬†Hz Legend&quot; (2001), &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; (2004), &quot;Pocket Symphony&quot; (2007), and &quot;Love 2&quot; (2009).

=== Other work ===
Air has often collaborated with film director Sofia Coppola. Air drummer and former Redd Kross member Brian Reitzell put together the soundtrack to 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, including one original contribution by Air titled &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot;. The soundtrack for Coppola&#x27;s October 2006 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; featured a track by Air (&quot;Il Secondo Giorno&quot;). Air wrote and played the music of the album &quot;5:55&quot; by Anglo-French actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, which was released in August 2006. Air has recorded a DJ mix album, &quot;Late Night Tales: Air&quot;, for Azuli Records&#x27; &quot;Late Night Tales&quot; series. The release was initially scheduled for October 2005, but was delayed several times. It finally was released, complete with a new sleeve design, in September 2006. &quot;Darkel&quot;, a solo album by Dunckel, was released that same year.

&quot;City Reading (Tre Storie Western)&quot; (2003) started as an idea for a collaboration with contemporary Italian writer Alessandro Baricco, known for his unusual characterizations and lyrical, poetic style. Baricco contacted Air in summer 2002 with the idea to marry narration of texts from his book &quot;City&quot; with live original musical accompaniment. The performance premiered live in November 2002 at Rome&#x27;s Teatro Valle and was deemed such a success that both parties resolved to make a full studio recording.

== Influences and musical style ==
Air is associated with a variety of musical styles: electronica, space pop, dream pop, progressive rock, downtempo, chillout, trip hop, ambient, electronic pop and space rock. Dunckel grew up listening to both classical and electronic music, especially Kraftwerk, and also the 1960s and 1970s music of Serge Gainsbourg. He later took an interest in what he called the &quot;English dark rock&quot; of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, while being a fan of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Brian Eno and Cluster were two of the electronic acts who inspired him the most. He cites among his favorite artists: Maurice Ravel for classical music, Fran√ßois de Roubaix for music soundtracks and Siouxsie and the Banshees for pop music. Dunckel shared with Godin a special liking for the music of Michel Legrand, Philip Glass and Grace Jones. During his childhood, Godin was fascinated by the Beatles before later discovering the soul of Sly and the Family Stone, and film soundtracks like &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; by Ennio Morricone. The duo were influenced by progressive rock pioneers Pink Floyd.

Air uses many of its studio instruments (including Moog synthesizers, the Korg MS-20, Wurlitzers and vocoders) on stage. The band performs tracks from their albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often collaborates (both in the studio and live) with artists like Beth Hirsch (&quot;Moon Safari&quot;), Fran√ßoise Hardy (&quot;Jeanne&quot;), Jean-Jacques Perrey (&quot;Cosmic Bird&quot;), Gordon Tracks (&quot;Playground Love&quot; and &quot;Easy Going Woman&quot; ‚Äì Gordon Tracks is a pseudonym of the French singer Thomas Mars from Phoenix), Beck (&quot;10 000¬†Hz Legend&quot;) and Jean-Michel Jarre (&quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; from Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot;). They also invited Dave Palmer on their 2004 tour and drummer Earl Harvin, Vincent Taurelle and Steve Jones on their 2007 tour.

== AIR as an acronym ==
The band has given conflicting information about whether Air is an acronym. In a clip aired in 2022, Godin told the BBC, &quot;AIR is an acronym. I don&#x27;t know if you have the same word in English, but it&#x27;s, uh, ‚Ä≥&quot;amour&quot;, &quot;imagination&quot;, and &quot;r√™ve&quot;‚Ä≥.&quot; Dunckel apparently said the same thing, as the interview cuts to a separately filmed portion where Dunckel says &quot;...which means &#x27;love, imagination, and dreaming&#x27;.&quot;

However, in a 1998 interview for Australian magazine &quot;Rave&quot;, Godin reportedly denied the claim, saying &quot;No. Someone made that up, but it was a really nice thing to do. I wish I could have that idea.&quot;

== Documentaries about Air ==

=== Air: Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing (1999) ===

In 1999, American film and music video director, writer, and graphic designer Mike Mills released a 75-minute black-and-white documentary titled &quot;Air: Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing&quot;. The film, shot during Air&#x27;s 1998 tour, captures band members Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno√Æt Dunckel during stops in New York, London, and Paris. As suggested by the title, the documentary&#x27;s tone and form focus on the drudgery and banality of real-life touring for music artists.

Mills had previously collaborated with Air on their music videos.

The documentary was distributed by &quot;Source - une division de Virgin disques&quot; as a Stereo DVD.

<doc id="202398" wikidata="Q288560" url="?curid=202398" title="George Thorogood">
<text>George Lawrence Thorogood (born February 24, 1950) is an American musician, singer and songwriter. His &quot;high-energy boogie-blues&quot; sound became a staple of 1980s US rock radio, with hits like his original songs &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; and &quot;I Drink Alone&quot;. He has also helped to popularize older songs by American icons, such as &quot;Move It on Over&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, and &quot;House Rent Blues/One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;.

With his band, &quot;The Delaware Destroyers&quot; (often known simply as &quot;The Destroyers&quot;), Thorogood has released over 20 albums, two of which have been certified Platinum and six have been certified Gold. He has sold 15 million records worldwide. Thorogood and his band continue to tour extensively, and in 2024, the band celebrated their 50th anniversary of performing.

==Music career==
Thorogood began his career as a solo acoustic performer in the style of Robert Johnson and Elmore James after being inspired in 1970 by a John P. Hammond concert. In 1973, he formed a band, &quot;the Delaware Destroyers&quot;, with high school friend and drummer Jeff Simon. With additional players, the Delaware Destroyers developed its sound, a mixture of Chicago blues and rock and roll. The band&#x27;s first shows were in the Rathskeller bar at the University of Delaware and at Deer Park Tavern, both in Newark, Delaware. Eventually, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to just &quot;the Destroyers&quot;. During this time, Thorogood supplemented his income by working as a roadie for Hound Dog Taylor.

Thorogood recorded a 20-song demo in 1974; 10 of those songs were eventually released as &quot;Better Than The Rest&quot; by MCA Records. In 1975, John Forward helped the band secure a recording contract with Rounder Records. The band&#x27;s major recording debut came with the album &quot;George Thorogood and the Destroyers,&quot; which was released on August 16, 1977. In 1978, Thorogood released his next album with the Destroyers titled &quot;Move It on Over&quot;, which included a remake of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Move It on Over&quot;, and a reworking of the Bo Diddley song &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;, both released as singles in 1978 and 1979 respectively. In 1980, rhythm guitarist Ron &quot;Roadblock&quot; Smith left the band, and was replaced by saxophonist Hank &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, who first played with the band on their fourth studio album, &quot;More George Thorogood and the Destroyers.&quot; The band&#x27;s early success contributed to the rise of folk label Rounder Records.

During the late 1970s, Thorogood and his band were based in Boston. He was friends with Jimmy Thackery of the Washington, D.C.‚Äìbased blues band, The Nighthawks. While touring in the 1970s, the Destroyers and the Nighthawks were playing shows in Georgetown at venues across the street from each other. The Destroyers were engaged at the Cellar Door and the Nighthawks at Desperados. At midnight, while both bands played Elmore James&#x27;s &quot;Madison Blues&quot; in the same key, Thorogood and Thackery left their clubs, met in the middle of M Street, exchanged guitar cords and went on to play with the opposite band in the other club. The connection with the Nighthawks was extended further when Nighthawks bass player Jan Zukowski supported Thorogood&#x27;s set with Bo Diddley and Albert Collins at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1985.

Thorogood gained his first mainstream exposure as a support act for the Rolling Stones during their 1981 U.S. tour. During this time, Thorogood and the Destroyers became known for their rigorous touring schedule, including the &quot;50/50&quot; tour in 1981, on which the band toured all 50 US states in 50 days. After two shows in Boulder, Colorado, Thorogood and his band flew to Hawaii for one show and then performed a show in Alaska the following night. The next day, Thorogood and his band met his roadies in Washington and continued the one-show-per-state tour. In addition, he played Washington, D.C., on the same day that he performed a show in Maryland, thereby playing 51 shows in 50 days.

With his contract with Rounder Records expiring, Thorogood signed with EMI America Records and in 1982, released &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;, which went gold. The album&#x27;s title track eventually became the band&#x27;s most well-known song through appearances on MTV and use in films, television and commercials. Later that year he was the featured musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (Season 8, Episode 2) on the October 2, 1982, broadcast. The next year, Thorogood released his only Christmas song, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Christmas&quot;. It was written by Thorogood as a holiday special for MTV, with John Lee Hooker appearing in the music video. The band&#x27;s next two studio albums were also certified gold. His sixth studio album was &quot;Maverick&quot;, released in January 1985. The album featured Thorogood&#x27;s only song to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, a remake of Johnny Otis&#x27;s &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive&quot;, which peaked at number 63, and his concert staple &quot;I Drink Alone&quot;. During this time Thorogood became heavily interested in country music. He intended to record a country album, but never did. EMI America released Thorogood&#x27;s first live album, titled &quot;Live&quot;, in August 1986. The album was one of Thorogood&#x27;s most successful, eventually being certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1988, rhythm guitarist Steve Chrismar joined the band, and was featured on their next album, &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot;, also released in 1988.

Thorogood&#x27;s popularity began to decline in the 1990s. His eighth studio album, &quot;Boogie People&quot;, only sold around 300,000 copies, but it did contain the song &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Start Drinkin&#x27; (I&#x27;m Gonna Leave)&quot;, which eventually became a concert staple. In 1992, &quot;The Baddest of George Thorogood&quot; was released, it was the band&#x27;s second and final album to be certified platinum by the RIAA. His next album, &quot;Haircut&quot;, contained the song &quot;Get a Haircut&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks, and was the No. 1 most played song on Canadian FM radio. The Destroyers didn&#x27;t release another studio album until 1997&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; My Life Away&quot;. It was their first studio album to miss the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since their debut in 1977, although it was their first to chart on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Blues Album chart.

In 1998 EMI America dropped the Destroyers, so they signed with CMC International. The next year, they released &quot;Half a Boy/Half a Man&quot;. The album failed to chart in any capacity, and it&#x27;s single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Trust Nobody&quot;, was their final single to chart, peaking at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. CMC International also released their third live album, &quot;Live in &#x27;99&quot;. Their next albums all charted high on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Blues Album chart.

George Thorogood signed a three-album deal with Eagle Records in 2002, and released &quot;Ride &#x27;Til I Die&quot; the next year. &quot;Ride &#x27;Til I Die&quot; was the final Destroyers album to feature Hank &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, he was replaced by Buddy Leach. In 2004, &quot;Greatest Hits: 30 Years of Rock&quot; was released, it was the band&#x27;s final album to be certified gold by the RIAA. Eagle released their fourth live album, &quot;30th Anniversary Tour: Live&quot;, also in 2004, and &quot;The Hard Stuff&quot; in 2006.

The Destroyers returned to EMI/Capitol in 2009 to release their next studio album, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. It was their first studio album since &quot;Haircut&quot; to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 169. In 2011 they released their most recent studio album, &quot;2120 South Michigan Ave.&quot;, which was a tribute to Chess Record artists. In 2012, Thorogood was named one of the &quot;50 Most Influential Delawareans of the Past 50 Years&quot;. He released his first proper solo album in 2017, titled &quot;Party of One,&quot; it was his best selling album in a long time.

On March 14, 2020, Thorogood was inducted into the Mississippi Music Project Hall of Fame in Biloxi, Mississippi, and was awarded the MMP Music Award for his lifelong commitment to the music industry, by Joseph W. Clark.

Hank Carter, who served as the saxophonist for Thorogood&#x27;s band from 1980 to 2003, died on September 14, 2021, at the age of 71.

On April 11, 2023, Thorogood&#x27;s social media pages announced that he was seriously ill, although the nature of his illness was not disclosed. Tour dates from April 27 to May 21 were all cancelled.

In February 2025, just before Thorogood&#x27;s 75th birthday, the band launched their Baddest Show on Earth Tour, which would take them across several states and then to Australia. 

==Personal life==
George Thorogood married Marla Raderman on July 16, 1985. She died from ovarian cancer in 2019. They have one daughter, Rio Thorogood. 

Thorogood has been a baseball fan for most of his life, playing semi-pro ball as a second baseman during the 1970s (drummer Jeff Simon played center field on the same team). He took his daughter to Chicago for her first major league game (Cubs vs. Rockies), during which he sang &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. In a 2011 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, he stated &quot;I&#x27;m a Mets fan. There aren&#x27;t many of us but you know, that&#x27;s me.&quot;

In April 2023, Thorogood had to cancel the first leg of his 50th anniversary tour due to a serious medical condition.

<doc id="202402" wikidata="Q543935" url="?curid=202402" title="Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt">
<text>Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt (, tr, ; 31 March 1757 ‚Äì 19 August 1814) was a Finnish-Swedish-Russian count, baron, courtier, general, and diplomat. In Finland, he is considered one of the greatest Finnish statesmen. His advice to Russia&#x27;s Tsar Alexander I was of utmost importance for securing the autonomy of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

== Career in the Kingdom of Sweden ==
Born in Tarvasjoki, Finland, he was the great grandson of Charles XII of Sweden&#x27;s general, Carl Gustaf Armfeldt.

In 1774, Armfelt became an ensign in the guards, but his frivolous behavior involving a duel provoked the displeasure of Gustav III of Sweden. As a result, he thought it prudent to go abroad 1778. Subsequently, however, in 1780, Armfelt met the king again at Spa in the Austrian Netherlands and completely won over the previously disgruntled monarch with his natural amiability, intelligence and social gifts. Henceforth, his fortune was made. At first, he was given the position of &quot;ma√Ætre des plaisirs&quot; in the Swedish court, but it wasn&#x27;t long before more serious affairs were entrusted to him. He took part in negotiations with Catherine II of Russia in 1783, and, during the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790), he was one of the king&#x27;s most trusted and active counsellors.

He displayed great valour in the field during this time. In 1788, when the Danes unexpectedly invaded Sweden and threatened Gothenburg, Armfelt organized the Dalecarlian levies under the king&#x27;s direction and led them to victory. He remained absolutely faithful to King Gustav when nearly the whole of the Swedish nobility fell away from him. Armfelt distinguished himself in the later phases of the Russo-Swedish War, eventually becoming the Swedish plenipotentiary who negotiated the war&#x27;s demise with the Treaty of V√§r√§l√§ in August 1790. Armfelt had been seriously wounded in the battle of Savitaipale in June 1790. During the reign of Gustav III, his influence was paramount in Sweden, though Armfelt protested against his master&#x27;s headstrong championship of the Bourbons.

== Diplomacy ==

On his deathbed in 1792, King Gustav III committed the care of his son to Armfelt and appointed him to the Privy Council, which was to advise the new regent, the king&#x27;s younger brother, Charles. Armfelt was also appointed as the Governor of Stockholm, but the new regent was staunchly anti-Gustavian and sent Armfelt to serve as the Swedish ambassador to Naples in order to get rid of him.

From Naples, Armfelt began secret communications with Empress of Russia Catherine the Great, arguing that she should bring about by means of a military intervention a change in the Swedish government in favour of the Gustavians. The Armfelt Conspiracy, though, was discovered by spies for the regent, who immediately sent a Swedish man-of-war to Naples to seize him. With the assistance of the exiled British Queen Caroline, he was just barely able to escape. He fled to Russia, where he was interned at Kaluga 1794‚Äì1797. At home, he was condemned to death as a traitor and his property confiscated. His mistress, Magdalena Rudensch√∂ld, was judged for complicity and pilloried on the Riddarhus Square before being imprisoned for two years in Stockholm.

== Against Napoleon&#x27;s France ==

When Gustav IV of Sweden attained his majority, Armfelt was completely rehabilitated and sent as Swedish ambassador to Vienna in 1802, but was obliged to quit the post two years later for sharply attacking the Austrian government&#x27;s attitude towards Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1805 to 1807, he was the commander-in-chief of the Swedish forces in Pomerania, where he displayed great ability and stopped the conquest of the duchy for as long as possible; the Great Sortie of Stralsund was particularly successful. He was promoted to General of the Infantry in 1807. Armfelt was invited to join to as a member of the Royal Military Academy. On his return home, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Norwegian frontier, where he was stifled in his duties by the constant flow of &quot;ordres, contre-ordres et d√©sordres&quot; from his master.

Armfelt supported the military alliance between Sweden and the United Kingdom against Napoleon&#x27;s interests in Europe. The main plan was to conquer Norway from Denmark and to resist Russian advances. The military alliance laid the groundwork for the upcoming Finnish War in 1808. Napoleon demanded that Alexander I, who was in alliance with France, declare war against Sweden and conquer Finland. Russians in Saint Petersburg were concerned about the potential presence of the Royal Navy in the Baltic Sea. The Royal Navy had the opportunity to use the Finnish coastline as a base for bombarding the capital of the empire.

Before the French Revolution in 1789, Sweden was a close ally of France and King Louis XVI. Sweden even supported France during the American Revolutionary War. King of Sweden Gustav IV Adolf and Armfelt despised the French revolutionaries and Napoleon Bonaparte. Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s foreign policy was unwaveringly against France. Sweden did not want to join the Continental System, which angered France.

The Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809 commenced in March 1808. Sweden found itself in a two-front war against Denmark-Norway and Russia. Armfelt served as the commander-in-chief of the Norwegian frontier and successfully led his forces. The Royal Navy established a naval blockade against Norway and also contained Napoleon&#x27;s forces in Denmark, while Sweden&#x27;s alliance with the United Kingdom proved effective on the western front.

== Imperial Russia and the Grand Duchy of Finland ==

Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s foreign policy led to the Finnish War in 1808. Napoleon pressured Russia to attack Finland. Sweden&#x27;s grand army was stationed near the border of Norway. Russia launched its attack on Finland in February during the winter. Due to the frozen Baltic Sea, it was impossible to transfer the grand army to Finland. As a result, Finland was unable to defend itself effectively, and Russia conquered large parts of the country within a few months. Sweden&#x27;s poor performance in the war sparked political unrest in Stockholm, leading to plans by usurpers to overthrow Gustav IV Adolf.

Armfelt was firmly opposed to the revolutionaries who overthrew Gustav IV and exiled his family in the Coup of 1809. He was the most courageous of the deposed king&#x27;s supporters and resolved afterwards to retire to Finland, which had been ceded to Russia.

However, Armfelt was appointed to high offices in the Swedish government. King of Sweden Charles XIII invited him to join the Privy Council, and he also appointed Armfelt as the President of the War College.

Sweden elected Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte as the new Crown Prince. Armfelt decided to visit his estate in Halikko, Finland, in summer 1810, which he had owned since 1801. During the trip, he also visited Saint Petersburg and met with Emperor Alexander I, receiving the favour of the Emperor. During the meeting, Armfelt presented a memo to the Emperor regarding the conditions of Finland. Additionally, he outlined a plan for the Committee for Finnish Affairs, which was later finalised by Armfelt and Count Mikhail Speransky.

Armfelt resigned from the Swedish military in October 1810. There were unfounded reports about Armfelt by the Swedish people. On March 29, 1811, King Charles XIII expelled Armfelt from Sweden. Napoleon supported the expulsion, as he had a strong dislike for Armfelt. The following day, Armfelt met with the Russian Ambassador, General Count Jan Peter van Suchtelen. Armfelt pledged his allegiance to the Emperor of Russia and then traveled to Finland.

Armfelt&#x27;s position greatly improved in Russia. After deposing Speransky he exercised almost as much influence over Emperor Alexander I as Adam Czartoryski. He contributed more than anyone else to Finnish independence with his plan to turn the Grand Duchy of Finland into an autonomous state within the Russian Empire.

In 1811, he relocated to Saint Petersburg and was appointed as the Chairman of the Committee for Finnish Affairs. Additionally, he became a Member of the State Council in Russia. Armfelt could not serve as Chairman during the Napoleonic Wars. Johan Fredrik Aminoff temporarily acted as Chairman.

Armfelt&#x27;s influence was crucial when Old Finland was combined with Finland. Emperor Alexander supported Armfelt&#x27;s proposal in 1811.

Armfelt, who had been Chancellor of the Royal Academy of Turku from 1791 to 1792, was made Chancellor of the new Imperial Academy of Turku in 1812. He held the position for two years. In 1812, the grateful Emperor raised him to the rank of Count. 

French Emperor Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. Armfelt was promoted to the rank of General of the Infantry and became Emperor Alexander I&#x27;s Adjutant General. He participated in the Napoleonic Wars.

In 1812, Emperor Alexander I and the Crown Prince of Sweden, Charles XIV John, met in Turku, Finland. Armfelt had a significant influence on Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy. As a result of the meeting, Sweden abandoned its plan to reclaim Finland from Russia. Armfelt proposed an alternative strategy to Sweden, suggesting that they conquer Norway from Denmark instead.

Armfelt disliked Turku because its citizens supported revolutionary ideas and even Napoleon. Helsinki, as the new capital of Finland, was closer to Saint Petersburg and far away from political unrest. Armfelt persuaded Alexander to move the capital in 1812.

He served as the Minister State Secretary of Finland, the Grand Duchy&#x27;s highest representative, in St Petersburg 1812‚Äì14. He was also briefly Governor-General of Finland in 1813. He never got along with the first Governor-General of Finland, Count Georg Magnus Sprengtporten, who was another strong supporter of the Grand Duchy of Finland in its early stage. 

He died at Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg on 19 August 1814. A grand funeral procession took place at Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Armfelt was accompanied by Finnish and Russian regiments. He was buried family grave in Halikko Church, located in Halikko, Finland.

== Legacy ==
Together with Count Georg Magnus Sprengtporten, Armfelt is regarded as one of the fathers of Finnish independence. Because of his unpopularity among the anti-Gustavian Swedish nobility and the fact that he &quot;turned Russian&quot;, Armfelt has been a somewhat mysterious and generally unknown character in Swedish history.

Ignorance of Armfelt and his accomplishments persisted for well over a century in Sweden and only recently has a more nuanced, positive approach to Armfelt emerged there. In Finland, he has always been highly regarded as a great patriot and statesman.

Ambassador Ilkka Pastinen, who translated Stig Ramel&#x27;s book about Armfelt from Swedish to Finnish, describes Armfelt&#x27;s estate, Joensuu Mansion, as significant for the Finns, comparable to how Mount Vernon, the private home of President George Washington, is significant for Americans. Armfelt supported the American Revolutionary War.

Because Armfelt chose to remain loyal to Finland and its people, rather than its former ruler, he was labeled as a traitor in Sweden and sentenced to death for treason. The Swedish people could not accept at the time the loss of Finland, which had been part of the realm for over 600 years. Their anguish was exacerbated by the fact that the province had been lost to Sweden&#x27;s archenemy, Russia. Armfelt&#x27;s death sentence, however, had no actual meaning outside of Sweden as there was never a realistic Swedish attempt launched to recapture Finland. Politicians threatened action mainly to gain favour among the nobles and populace. Already, in 1812, Sweden allied with Russia, and the sentence was annulled.

==Family==
In 1785, Armfelt married Countess Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie (1761‚Äì1832), daughter of Count Carl Julius De la Gardie and Countess Magdalena Christina Stenbock.

They had the following eight children:
# Maria Magdalena Catharina Augusta Armfelt, (1786‚Äì1845), countess
# Gustaf Fredrik Armfelt, (1788‚Äì1789).
# Carl Armfelt, born and died 1788.
# Magnus Armfelt, born and died 1788.
# Gustaf Magnus Armfelt, (1792‚Äì1856), major-general, count
# Alexander Armfelt, (1794‚Äì1876), captain, Finnish minister secretary of state, privy councillor, count
# Constantin Armfelt, (1796‚Äì1797).
# Carl Magnus Wilhelm Armfelt, (1797‚Äì1878).

From the affair with the actress Mademoiselle L&#x27;Eclair in Paris, Armfelt had an illegitimate son, Maurice L&#x27;Eclair (1780‚Äì1841). From the affair with Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan, Armfelt had an illegitimate daughter, Adelaide Gustava Aspasie (Vava) Armfelt (1801‚Äì1881). Maurice was knighted in 1816 in Sweden as Mauritz Clairfelt and became a general; Vava was adopted in 1812 into the Armfelt family.

<doc id="202403" wikidata="Q691551" url="?curid=202403" title="Excavata">
<text>Excavata is an extensive and diverse but paraphyletic group of unicellular Eukaryota. The group was first suggested by Simpson and Patterson in 1999 and the name latinized and assigned a rank by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2002. It contains a variety of free-living and symbiotic protists, and includes some important parasites of humans such as &quot;Giardia&quot; and &quot;Trichomonas&quot;. Excavates were formerly considered to be included in the now obsolete Protista kingdom. They were distinguished from other lineages based on electron-microscopic information about how the cells are arranged (they have a distinctive ultrastructural identity). They are considered to be a basal flagellate lineage. 

On the basis of phylogenomic analyses, the group was shown to contain three widely separated eukaryote groups, the discobids, metamonads, and malawimonads. A current view of the composition of the excavates is given below, indicating that the group is paraphyletic. Except for some Euglenozoa, all are non-photosynthetic.

==Characteristics==

Most excavates are unicellular, heterotrophic flagellates. Only some Euglenozoa are photosynthetic. In some (particularly anaerobic intestinal parasites), the mitochondria have been greatly reduced. Some excavates lack &quot;classical&quot; mitochondria, and are called &quot;amitochondriate&quot;, although most retain a mitochondrial organelle in greatly modified form (e.g. a hydrogenosome or mitosome). Among those with mitochondria, the mitochondrial cristae may be tubular, , or in some cases, laminar. Most excavates have two, four, or more flagella. Many have a conspicuous ventral feeding groove with a characteristic ultrastructure, supported by microtubules‚Äîthe &quot;excavated&quot; appearance of this groove giving the organisms their name. However, various groups that lack these traits are considered to be derived excavates based on genetic evidence (primarily phylogenetic trees of molecular sequences).

The Acrasidae slime molds are the only excavates to exhibit limited multicellularity. Like other cellular slime molds, they live most of their life as single cells, but will sometimes assemble into larger clusters.

== Proposed group ==


Excavate relationships were always uncertain, suggesting that they are not a monophyletic group. Phylogenetic analyses often do not place malawimonads on the same branch as the other Excavata.

Excavates were thought to include multiple groups: 

===Discoba or JEH clade===

Euglenozoa and Heterolobosea (Percolozoa) or Eozoa (as named by Cavalier-Smith) appear to be particularly close relatives, and are united by the presence of discoid cristae within the mitochondria (Superphylum Discicristata). A close relationship has been shown between Discicristata and Jakobida, the latter having tubular cristae like most other protists, and hence were united under the taxon name Discoba, which was proposed for this supposedly monophyletic group. Alternatively, the clade has been termed the jakobid, euglenazoan and heterolobosean group JEH.

===Metamonads===

Metamonads are unusual in not having classical mitochondria‚Äîinstead they have hydrogenosomes, mitosomes or uncharacterised organelles. The oxymonad &quot;Monocercomonoides&quot; is reported to have completely lost homologous organelles. There are competing explanations.

===Malawimonads===

The malawimonads have been proposed to be members of Excavata owing to their typical excavate morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to other excavate groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, their position among eukaryotes remains elusive.

===Ancyromonads===

Ancyromonads are small free-living cells with a narrow longitudinal groove down one side of the cell. The ancyromonad groove is not used for &quot;suspension feeding&quot;, unlike in &quot;typical excavates&quot; (e.g. malawimonads, jakobids, &quot;Trimastix&quot;, &quot;Carpediemonas&quot;, &quot;Kiperferlia&quot;, etc). Ancyromonads instead capture prokaryotes attached to surfaces. The phylogenetic placement of ancyromonads is poorly understood (in 2020), however some phylogenetic analyses place them as close relatives of malawimonads.

== Evolution ==

=== Origin of the Eukaryotes ===
The conventional explanation for the origin of the Eukaryotes is that a heimdallarchaeian or another Archaea acquired an alphaproteobacterium as an endosymbiont, and that this became the mitochondrion, the organelle providing oxidative respiration to the eukaryotic cell.

Caesar al Jewari and Sandra Baldauf argue instead that the Eukaryotes possibly started with an endosymbiosis event of a Deltaproteobacterium or Gammaproteobacterium, accounting for the otherwise unexplained presence of anaerobic bacterial enzymes in Metamonada. The sister of the Preaxostyla within Metamonada represents the rest of the Eukaryotes which acquired an Alphaproteobacterium. In their scenario, the hydrogenosome and mitosome, both conventionally considered &quot;mitochondrion-derived organelles&quot;, would predate the mitochondrion, and instead be derived from the earlier symbiotic bacterium.

=== Phylogeny ===

In 2023, using molecular phylogenetic analysis of 186 taxa, Al Jewari and Baldauf proposed a phylogenetic tree with the metamonad Parabasalia as basal Eukaryotes. Discoba and the rest of the Eukaryota appear to have emerged as sister taxon to the Preaxostyla, incorporating a single alphaproteobacterium as mitochondria by endosymbiosis. Thus the Fornicata are more closely related to e.g. animals than to Parabasalia. The rest of the Eukaryotes emerged within the Excavata as sister of the Discoba; as they are within the same clade but are not cladistically considered part of the Excavata yet, the Excavata are in this analysis highly paraphyletic.

The Anaeramoeba are associated with Parabasalia, but could turn out to be more basal as the root of a tree is often difficult to pinpoint.

<text>Petah Tikva (, ), also spelt Petah Tiqwa and known informally as Em HaMoshavot (), is a city in the Central District of Israel, east of Tel Aviv. It was founded in 1878, mainly by Haredi Jews of the Old Yishuv, and became a permanent settlement in 1883 with the financial help of Baron Edmond de Rothschild.

In , the city had a population of , thus being the fifth-largest city in Israel. Its population density is approximately . Its jurisdiction covers 35,868 dunams (~35.9¬†km2 or 15 sq¬†mi). Petah Tikva is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
Petah Tikva takes its name (meaning &quot;Door of Hope&quot;) from the biblical allusion in Hosea 2:15: &quot;... and make the valley of Achor a door of hope.&quot; The Achor Valley, near Jericho, was the original proposed location for the town.

==History==

Tel Mulabbis, an archaeological mound in modern Petah Tikva, is an important archaeological site from the Yarkon River basin, with habitation remains from the Roman, Byzantine, Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Late Ottoman periods. The place was inhabited sporadically, and was known in Arabic as Mulabbis, and was the site of a Egyptian village of the same name, inhabited by the Abu Hamed al-Masri clan.
Petah Tikva was founded in 1878 by Jewish settlers from Europe, among them Yehoshua Stampfer, Moshe Shmuel Raab, Yoel Moshe Salomon, Zerach Barnett, and David Gutmann, as well as Lithuanian Rabbi Aryeh Leib Frumkin who built the first house. It was the first modern Jewish agricultural settlement in Ottoman Southern Syria (hence its nickname as &quot;Mother of the Moshavot&quot;). 
Originally intending to establish a new settlement in the Achor Valley, near Jericho, the settlers purchased land in that area. However, Abd√ºlhamid II cancelled the purchase and forbade them from settling there, but they retained the name Petah Tikva as a symbol of their aspirations.

In 1878, the founders of Petah Tikva learned of the availability of land northeast of Jaffa near the village of Mulabes (or Umlabes). The land was owned by two Christian businessmen from Jaffa, Antoine Bishara Tayan and Selim Qassar, and was worked by some thirty tenant farmers. Tayan&#x27;s property was the larger, some 8,500 dunams, but much of it was in the malarial swamp of the Yarkon Valley. Qassar&#x27;s property, approximately 3,500 dunams, lay a few kilometers to the south of the Yarkon, away from the swampland. It was Qassar&#x27;s that was purchased on July 30, 1878. Tayan&#x27;s holdings were purchased when a second group of settlers, known as the Yarkonim, arrived in Petah Tikva the following year. Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II allowed the purchase because of the poor quality of the land.

In a microhistorical anecdote of Petah Tikva, Yehuda Raab, one of the Hungarian settlers, recalls in his memoirs meeting a Baghdadi Jew, Daud abu Yusuf, who despite appearing as a Bedouin, announced ‚Äúana Isra æili,‚Äù &quot;I am Jewish&quot;, and recited the shema by way of proof. Yusuf, along with a Moroccan Jew from Jaffo, Ya øqub bin Maymun Zirmati, was hired as a guard for colony; it was customary for European Jewish colonies to hire local Arab guards or in some cases Yemenite Jews. Both were Ottoman imperial subjects and were important cultural and linguistic go-betweens, for example in the horse and camel trade, from the world of the Ashkenazi Jewish colonists and that of the Eastern or Maghribi Jews, today called Mizrahi Jews.

A malaria epidemic broke out in 1880, forcing the abandonment of the settlements on both holdings by 1881 or 1882. Those who remained in the area moved south to Yehud. After Petah Tikva was reoccupied by Bilu immigrants in 1883, some of the original families returned. With funding for swamp drainage provided by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the colony became more stable.

In March 1886, Arab peasants from Yahudiya attacked the Jewish colony, injuring 5, with one dying later, possibly due to aggravation of her preexisting condition. This was called the first violent clash in the Yishuv by Moshe Smilansky.

Upon learning that the Austrian post office in Jaffa wanted to open a branch in Petah Tikva, Yitzchak Goldenhirsch, an early resident, offered his assistance on condition that the Austrian consulate issued a Hebrew stamp and a special postmark for Petah Tikva. The stamp was designed by an unknown artist featuring a plow, green fields and a blossoming orange tree. The price was 14 paras (a Turkish coin) and displayed the name &#x27;Petah Tikva&#x27; in Hebrew letters.

David Ben Gurion lived in Petah Tikva for a few months on his arrival in Palestine in 1906. It had a population of around 1000, half of them farmers. He found occasional work in the orange groves. But, he soon caught malaria and his doctor recommended he return to Europe. The following year, after moving to Jaffa, he set up a Jewish workers organisation in Petah Tikva.

During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, Petah Tikva served as a refugee town for residents of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, following their exile by the Ottoman authorities. The town suffered heavily as it lay between the Ottoman and British fronts during the war.

===British Mandate ===
In the early 1920s, industry began to develop in the Petah Tikva region. In 1921, Petah Tikva was granted local council status by the British authorities. In May 1921, Petah Tikva was the target of an Arab attack, which left four of its Jewish inhabitants dead‚Äìan extension of the Jaffa riots of 1921. In 1927, Petah Tikva concluded a local peace treaty with the Arabs living nearby; subsequently, Petah Tikva was untouched by the 1929 Palestine riots.

According to the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Petah Tikva had a total population of 3,032: 3,008 Jews, 22 Muslims and 2 Orthodox Christians. 

By the time the 1931 census was taken, the population had increased to 6,880 inhabitants in 1,688 houses. In 1937, it was recognized as a city. Its first mayor, Shlomo Stampfer, was the son of one of its founders, Yehoshua Stampfer.

Petah Tikva, a center of citrus farming, was considered by both the British government and the Jaffa Electric Company as a potentially important consumer of electricity for irrigation. The Auja Concession, which was granted to the Jaffa Electric Company on 1921, specifically referred to the relatively large Jewish settlement of Petah-Tikva. But, it was only in late 1929 that the company submitted an irrigation scheme for Petah-Tikva, and it was yet to be approved by the government in 1930.

In 1931, Ben Gurion wrote that Petah Tikva had 5000 inhabitants and employed 3000 Arab labourers.

In the 1930s, the pioneering founders of Kibbutz Yavneh from the Religious Zionist movement immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine, settling near Petah Tikva on land purchased by a Jewish-owned German company. Refining the agricultural skills they learned in Germany, these pioneers began in 1941 to build their kibbutz in its intended location in the south of Israel, operating from Petah Tikva as a base.

===State of Israel ===

After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Petah Tikva annexed all of the lands of the newly depopulated Palestinian village of Fajja. The city has suffered a series of terror attacks as a result of the ongoing regional conflict, including the bombing of a vegetable market in 1977, and three attacks during the Second Intifada: On May 27, 2002, a suicide bomber blew himself up at a small cafe outside a shopping mall, leaving two dead, including a baby; on December 25, 2003, a suicide bomber blew himself up at a bus stop near the Geha bridge, killing 4 civilians, and on February 5, 2006, a Palestinian got into a shuttle taxi, pulled out a knife, and began stabbing passengers killing two of them, but a worker from a nearby factory hit him with a log, subduing him.
After the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, several adjoining villages‚ÄìAmishav and Ein Ganim to the east (named after the biblical village (Joshua 15:34)), Kiryat Matalon to the west, towards Bnei Brak, Kfar Ganim and Mahaneh Yehuda to the south and Kfar Avraham on the north‚Äìwere merged into the municipal boundaries of Petah Tikva, boosting its population to 22,000.

As of 2018, with a population of over 240,000 inhabitants, Petah Tikva is the third most populous city in the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area (&quot;Gush Dan&quot;).
Petah Tikva is divided into 33 neighborhoods for municipal purposes.

==Economy==

Petah Tikva is the second-largest industrial sector in Israel after the northern city of Haifa. The industry is divided into three zones‚ÄîKiryat Aryeh (named after Arie Shenkar, founder and first president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel and a pioneer in the Israeli textile industry), Kiryat Matalon (named after Moshe Yitzhak Matalon), and Segula, and includes textiles, metalwork, carpentry, plastics, processed foods, tires and other rubber products, and soap.
Numerous high-tech companies and start-ups have moved into the industrial zones of Petah Tikva, which now house the Israeli headquarters for the Oracle Corporation, IBM, Intel, Alcatel-Lucent, ECI Telecom, and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals. The largest data center in Israel, operated by the company TripleC, is also located in Petah Tikva. Furthermore, the Israeli Teva company, the world&#x27;s largest generic drug manufacturer, is headquartered in Petah Tikva. One of Israel&#x27;s leading food processing corporations, Osem opened in Petah Tikva in 1976 and has since been joined by the company&#x27;s administrative offices, distribution center and sauce factory. Strauss is also based in Petach Tikva.

Over time, the extensive citrus groves that once ringed Petah Tikva have disappeared as real-estate developers acquired the land for construction projects. Many new neighborhoods are going up in and around Petah Tikva. A quarry for building stone is located east of Petah Tikva.
As well as general hi-tech firms, Petah Tikva has developed a position as a base for many communications firms. As such, the headquarters of the Bezeq International international phone company is located in the Kiryat Matalon industrial zone as are those of the 012 Smile Internet Service Provider. The headquarters of Tadiran Telecom are in the Ramat Siv industrial zone. Arutz Sheva, the right wing Religious Zionist Israeli media network, operates an internet radio studio in Petah Tikva, where Arutz Sheva internet TV is located as well as the printing press for its &quot;B&#x27;Sheva&quot; newspaper. The Israeli secret service, Shin Bet, has an interrogation facility in Petah Tikva.

==Transportation==
===Bus===
Petah Tikva is served by a large number of buses. A large number of intercity Egged buses stop there, and the city has a network of local buses operated by the Kavim company. The Dan bus company operates lines to Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Tel Aviv. Petah Tikva&#x27;s largest bus terminal is the Petah Tikva Central Bus Station (Tahana Merkazit), while other major stations are located near Beilinson Hospital and Beit Rivka.

===Mainline rail===
Israel Railways maintains two suburban railroad stations in Segula and Kiryat Aryeh, in the northern part of the city. A central train station near the main bus station is envisioned as part of Israel Railways&#x27;s long-term expansion plan.

===Road transport===
There are eight taxi fleets based in Petah Tikva, and the city is bordered by three of the major vehicle arteries in Israel: Geha Highway (Highway 4) on the west, the Trans-Samaria Highway (Highway 5) on the north, and the Trans-Israel Highway (Highway 6) on the east.

===Santiago Calatrava designed bridge===

Santiago Calatrava&#x27;s bridge, a long span Y-shaped cable-stayed pedestrian three-way bridge connecting Rabin Hospital to a shopping mall, a residential development and a public park. The structure is supported from a high inclined steel pylon, which is situated where the three spans intersect. Light in construction, the bridge is built principally of steel with a glass-paved deck.

=== Light rail===
The Red Line of the Greater Tel Aviv rapid transit/light rail system connects Petah Tikva to Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv and Bat Yam. The Red Line of the Tel Aviv Light Rail system is split into 2 branches upon entrance to Petah Tikva. One branch travels to an underground terminal at the Kiryat Aryeh railway station, while the other continues east to the Petach Tikva Central Bus Station. The Light Rail&#x27;s train depot is also located at Kiryat Aryeh. It was opened to service on August 18, 2023.

==Local government==

Petah Tikva&#x27;s history of government goes back to 1880, when the pioneers elected a council of seven members to run the new colony. From 1880 to 1921, members of the council were David Meir Guttman, Yehoshua Stampfer, Ze&#x27;ev Wolf Branda, Abraham Ze&#x27;ev Lipkis, Yitzhak Goldenhirsch, Chaim Cohen-Rice, Moshe Gissin, Shlomo Zalman Gissin and Akiva Librecht. This governing body was declared a local council in 1921, and Petah Tikva became a city in 1937. Kadima, the political party founded by former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, had its headquarters in Petah Tikva.

Yeshivat Hesder Petah Tikva, a Modern Orthodox Hesder Yeshiva affiliated with the Religious Zionist movement, directed by Rabbi Yuval Cherlow, is also located in Petah Tikva. Additionally, Rav Michael Laitman, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah (see Bnei Baruch), daily leads 200-300 students and hundreds of thousands virtually (some estimates of up to 2 million) in the method of Kabbalah learned from his teacher Rav Baruch Ashlag, known as the RABASH.

Petah Tikva has two cemeteries: Segula Cemetery, east of the city, and Yarkon Cemetery, to the northeast.

==Health care==

Six hospitals are located in the city. The Rabin Medical Center Beilinson complex includes the Beilinson Medical Center, the Davidoff Oncologic Center, the Geha Psychiatric Hospital, the Schneider Pediatric Hospital and Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Faculty of Medical Research. Other medical facilities in Petah Tikva are HaSharon Hospital, the Beit Rivka Geriatric Center, the Kupat Holim Medical Research Center and a private hospital, Ramat Marpeh, affiliated with Assuta Hospital. The Schneider Pediatric Center is one of the largest and most modern children&#x27;s hospitals in the Middle East. In addition, there are many family health clinics in Petah Tikva as well as Kupat Holim clinics operated by Israel&#x27;s health maintenance organizations. The city is also served by Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center, a Haredi hospital in nearby Bnei Brak.

==Landmarks and cultural institutions==

Petah Tikva&#x27;s Independence Park includes a zoo at its northeastern edge, the Museum of Man and Nature, a memorial to the victims of the 1921 Arab riots, an archaeological display, Yad Labanim soldiers&#x27; memorial, a local history museum, a Holocaust museum and the Petah Tikva Museum of Art.

==In popular culture==
Petah Tikva is referenced in the Tony Award‚Äìwinning 2016 musical &quot;The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot; as the main plot derives from a mix-up between the city and the fictional town of &quot;Bet Hatikva&quot; in the Negev Desert of southern Israel.

Petah Tikva is known for being a part of a satirical conspiracy theory which claims that it does not exist, much like the German Bielefeld conspiracy. &quot;Free Petah Tikvah&quot; became a meme during 2023.

<text>The Atlantic puffin (), also known as the common puffin, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is the only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted puffin and the horned puffin being found in the northeastern Pacific. The Atlantic puffin breeds in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, Britain, Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and the Faroe Islands, and as far south as Maine in the west and France in the east. It is most commonly found in the Westman Islands, Iceland. Although it has a large population and a wide range, the species has declined rapidly, at least in parts of its range, resulting in it being rated as vulnerable by the IUCN. On land, it has the typical upright stance of an auk. At sea, it swims on the surface and feeds on zooplankton, small fish, and crabs, which it catches by diving underwater, using its wings for propulsion.

This puffin has a black crown and back, light grey cheek patches, and a white body and underparts. Its broad, boldly marked red-and-black beak and orange legs contrast with its plumage. It moults while at sea in the winter, and some of the brightly coloured facial characteristics are lost, with colour returning during the spring. The external appearances of the adult male and female are identical, though the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage, but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is narrower and is dark grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than in the south and these populations are generally considered a different subspecies.

Spending the autumn and winter in the open ocean of the cold northern seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas at the start of the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. Chicks mostly feed on whole fish and grow rapidly. After about 6 weeks, they are fully fledged and make their way at night to the sea. They swim away from the shore and do not return to land for several years.

Colonies are mostly on islands with no terrestrial predators, but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes, a bird such as an Arctic skua or blackback gull can cause a puffin arriving with a beak full of fish to drop all the fish the puffin was holding in its mouth. The puffin&#x27;s striking appearance, large, colourful bill, waddling gait, and behaviour have given rise to nicknames such as &quot;clown of the sea&quot; or &quot;sea parrot&quot;. It is the official bird of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Atlantic puffin is a species of seabird in the order Charadriiformes. It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which includes the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins, and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (&quot;Cerorhinca monocerata&quot;) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The Atlantic puffin is the only species in the genus &quot;Fratercula&quot; to occur in the Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted puffin (&quot;Fratercula cirrhata&quot;) and the horned puffin (&quot;Fratercula corniculata&quot;), the latter being the closest relative of the Atlantic puffin.

The generic name &quot;Fratercula&quot; comes from the Medieval Latin &quot;fratercula&quot;, friar, a reference to their black and white plumage, which resembles monastic robes. The specific name &quot;arctica&quot; refers to the northerly distribution of the bird, being derived from the Greek ·ºÑœÅŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ (&quot;arktos&quot;), the bear, referring to the northerly constellation, the Ursa Major (Great Bear). The vernacular name &quot;puffin&quot; ‚Äì puffed in the sense of swollen ‚Äì was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), which in 1652 was known as the &quot;Manks puffin&quot;. It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English &quot;pophyn&quot; or &quot;poffin&quot;) used for the cured carcasses. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits, and it was formally applied to &quot;Fratercula arctica&quot; by Pennant in 1768. While the species is also known as the common puffin, &quot;Atlantic puffin&quot; is the English name recommended by the International Ornithological Congress.

The three subspecies generally recognized are:
* &quot;F. a. arctica&quot;
* &quot;F. a. grabae&quot;
* &quot;F. a. naumanni&quot;
The only morphological difference between the three is their size. Body length, wing length, and size of beak all increase at higher latitudes. For example, a puffin from northern Iceland (subspecies &quot;F. a. naumanii&quot;) weighs about and has a wing length of , while one from the Faroes (subspecies &quot;F. a. grabae&quot;) weighs and has a wing length of . Individuals from southern Iceland (subspecies &quot;F. a. arctica&quot;) are intermediate between the other two in size. Ernst Mayr has argued that the differences in size are clinal and are typical of variations found in the peripheral population and that no subspecies should be recognised.

==Description==
The Atlantic puffin is sturdily built with a thick-set neck and short wings and tail. It is in length from the tip of its stout bill to its blunt-ended tail. Its wingspan is and on land it stands about high. The male is generally slightly larger than the female, but they are coloured alike. The forehead, crown, and nape are glossy black, as are the back, wings, and tail. A broad, black collar extends around the neck and throat. On each side of the head is a large, lozenge-shaped area of very pale grey. These face patches taper to a point and nearly meet at the back of the neck. The shape of the head creates a crease extending from the eye to the hindmost point of each patch, giving the appearance of a grey streak. The eyes look almost triangular because of a small, peaked area of horny blue-grey skin above them and a rectangular patch below. The irises are brown or very dark blue, and each has a red orbital ring. The underparts of the bird, the breast, belly, and under tail coverts, are white. By the end of the breeding season, the black plumage may have lost its shine or even taken on a slightly brown tinge. The legs are short and set well back on the body, giving the bird its upright stance when on land. Both legs and large webbed feet are bright orange, contrasting with the sharp, black claws.

The beak is very distinctive. From the side, the beak is broad and triangular, but viewed from above, it is narrow. The half near the tip is orange-red and the half near the head is slate grey. A yellow, chevron-shaped ridge separates the two parts, with a yellow, fleshy strip at the base of the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length, but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves, and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.

The characteristic bright orange bill plates and other facial characteristics develop in the spring. At the close of the breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright, and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers of the head and neck are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage, but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it makes its way to the water and heads out to sea, and does not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year, it will have a broader bill, paler face patches, and brighter legs and beaks.

The Atlantic puffin has a direct flight, typically above the sea surface and higher over the water than most other auks. It mostly moves by paddling along efficiently with its webbed feet and seldom takes to the air. It is typically silent at sea, except for the soft purring sounds it sometimes makes in flight. At the breeding colony, it is quiet above ground, but in its burrow makes a growling sound somewhat resembling a chainsaw being revved up.

==Distribution==
The Atlantic puffin is a bird of the colder waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. It breeds on the coasts of northwest Europe, the Arctic fringes, and eastern North America. More than 90% of the global population is found in Europe (4,770,000‚Äì5,780,000 pairs, equalling 9,550,000‚Äì11,600,000 adults) and colonies in Iceland alone are home to 60% of the world&#x27;s Atlantic puffins. The largest colony in the western Atlantic (estimated at more than 260,000 pairs) can be found at the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Other major breeding locations include the north and west coasts of Norway, the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Orkney, the west coast of Greenland, and the coasts of Newfoundland. Smaller-sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Maine. Islands seem particularly attractive to the birds for breeding as compared to mainland sites, likely to avoid predators.

While at sea, the bird ranges widely across the North Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea, and may enter the Arctic Circle. In the summer, its southern limit stretches from northern France to Maine; in the winter, the bird may range as far south as the Mediterranean Sea and North Carolina. These oceanic waters have such a vast extent of that each bird has more than 1¬†km2 of range at its disposal, so is seldom seen out at sea. In Maine, light-level geolocators have been attached to the legs of puffins, which store information on their whereabouts. The birds need to be recaptured to access the information, a difficult task. One bird was found to have covered of the ocean in 8 months, traveling northwards to the northern Labrador Sea then southeastward to the mid-Atlantic before returning to land.

In a long-living bird with a small clutch size, such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults is an important factor influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though a tendency exists for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea, but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.

==Behaviour==
Like many seabirds, the Atlantic puffin spends most of the year far from land in the open ocean and only visits coastal areas to breed. It is a sociable bird and it usually breeds in large colonies.

===At sea===
Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when out at sea, and this part of their lives has been little studied, as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, they bob about like a cork, propelling themselves through the water with powerful thrusts of their feet and keeping turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. They spend much time each day preening to keep their plumage in order and spread oil from their preen glands. Their downy under plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, their upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to locate the birds against the dark, watery background, and underwater attackers fail to notice them as they blend in with the bright sky above the waves.

When it takes off, the Atlantic puffin patters across the surface of the water while vigorously flapping its wings, before launching itself into the air. The size of the wing has adapted to its dual use, both above and below the water, and its surface area is small relative to the bird&#x27;s weight. To maintain flight, the wings must beat very rapidly at a rate of several times each second. The bird&#x27;s flight is direct and low over the surface of the water, and it can travel at . Landing is awkward; it either crashes into a wave crest or in calmer water, does a belly flop. While at sea, the Atlantic puffin has its annual moult. Land birds mostly lose their primaries one pair at a time to enable them still to be able to fly, but the puffin sheds all its primaries at one time and dispenses with flight entirely for a month or two. The moult usually takes place between January and March, but young birds may lose their feathers a little later in the year.

===Food and feeding===
The Atlantic puffin diet consists almost entirely of fish, though examination of its stomach contents shows that it occasionally eats shrimp, other crustaceans, molluscs, and polychaete worms, especially in more coastal waters. When fishing, it swims underwater using its semi-extended wings as paddles to &quot;fly&quot; through the water and its feet as a rudder. It swims fast and can reach considerable depths and stay submerged for up to a minute. It can eat shallow-bodied fish as long as , but its prey is commonly smaller fish, around long. An adult bird needs to eat an estimated 40 of these per day ‚Äì sand eels, herring, capelin, and sprats being the most often consumed.

It fishes by sight and can swallow small fish while submerged, but larger specimens are brought to the surface. It can catch several small fish in one dive, holding the first ones in place in its beak with its muscular, grooved tongue while it catches others. The two mandibles are hinged in such a way that they can be held parallel to hold a row of fish in place and these are also retained by inward-facing serrations on the edges of the beak. It copes with the excess salt that it swallows partly through its kidneys and partly by excretion through specialised salt glands in its nostrils.

===On land===
In the spring, mature birds return to land, usually to the colony where they were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and released elsewhere were found to show fidelity to their point of liberation. They congregate for a few days on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff-top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is divided into subcolonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the cliff edge where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but this is the result of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to their mates, and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken, so are pushed towards the periphery, where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore a month or more after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They do not breed until the following year, although if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these subadults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.

Atlantic puffins are cautious when approaching the colony, and no bird likes to land in a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground, they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland, and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and a cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking, and gaping. Submissive birds lower their heads and hold their bodies horizontally and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their bodies before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves into the air and wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf, or strolling around. Then, the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early-morning provisioning.

The puffins are energetic burrow engineers and repairers, so the grassy slopes may be undermined by a network of tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die, and dry soil to be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when so little soil was left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird only nests where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of 90 years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011, over 120 pairs were nested on the small islet. On the Isle of May on the other side of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958, while 20 years later, 10,000 pairs were present.

===Reproduction===
Having spent the winter alone on the ocean, whether the Atlantic puffin meets its previous partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year is unclear. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials, but others do not bother. Sometimes, a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approaches each other, each wagging their heads from side to side, and then rattling their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to the bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.

Atlantic puffins are sexually mature at 4‚Äì5 years old. They are colonial nesters, excavating burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and on occasion may nest in crevices and among rocks and scree, in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. They can excavate their own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit, and have been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin&#x27;s living quarters, resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest, while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.

Egg-laying starts in April in more southerly colonies but seldom occurs before June in Greenland. The female lays a single white egg each year, but if this is lost early in the breeding season, another might be produced. Synchronous laying of eggs is found in Atlantic puffins in adjacent burrows. The egg is large compared to the size of the bird, averaging long by wide and weighing about . The white shell is usually devoid of markings, but soon becomes covered with mud. The incubation responsibilities are shared by both parents. They each have two feather-free brood patches on their undersides, where an enhanced blood supply provides heat for the egg. The parent on incubation duty in the dark nest chamber spends much of its time asleep with its head tucked under its wing, occasionally emerging from the tunnel to flap dust out of its feathers or take a short flight down to the sea.

The total incubation time is around 39‚Äì45 days. From above ground level, the first evidence that hatching has taken place is the arrival of an adult with a beak-load of fish. For the first few days, the chick may be fed with this beak-to-beak, but later the fish are simply dropped on the floor of the nest beside the chick, which swallows them whole. The chick is covered in fluffy black down, its eyes are open, and it can stand as soon as it is hatched. Initially weighing about , it grows at the rate of per day. Initially, one or the other parent broods it, but as its appetite increases, it is left alone for longer periods. Observations of a nest chamber have been made from an underground hide with a peephole. The chick sleeps much of the time between its parents&#x27; visits and also involves itself in bouts of exercise. It rearranges its nesting material, picks up and drops small stones, flaps its immature wings, pulls at protruding root ends, and pushes and strains against the unyielding wall of the burrow. It makes its way towards the entrance or along a side tunnel to defecate. The growing chick seems to anticipate the arrival of an adult, advancing along the burrow just before it arrives, but not emerging into the open air. It retreats to the nest chamber as the adult bird brings in its load of fish.

Hunting areas are often located or more offshore from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. Adults bringing fish to their chicks tend to arrive in groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the Arctic skua, which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the great skua (&quot;Catharacta skua&quot;) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.

In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (&quot;Ammodytes marinus&quot;) normally form at least 90% of the food fed to chicks. In years when the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway, the herring (&quot;Clupea harengus&quot;) is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador, the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus&quot;) declined in availability, they were able to adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.

The chicks take from 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period depending on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period, but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate, but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces over the last few days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour, and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs, and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet, so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water, it paddles out to sea, and maybe away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and does not return to land for 2‚Äì3 years.

==Predators and parasites==
Atlantic puffins are probably safer when out at sea, where the dangers are more often from below the water rather than above; puffins can sometimes be seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals have been known to kill puffins, and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence, as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats, weasels, cats, and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.

Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin include the great black-backed gull (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;), the great skua (&quot;Stercorarius skua&quot;), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On detecting danger, puffins take off and fly down to the safety of the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught, they defend themselves vigorously with beaks and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling around beside the cliffs, a predator concentrating on a single bird becomes very difficult, while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species such as the herring gull (&quot;L. argentatus&quot;) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far toward the daylight. They also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes, it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne, forcing them to drop their catch, which it then snatches up.

Both the guillemot tick &quot;Ixodes uriae&quot; and the flea &quot;Ornithopsylla laetitiae&quot; (probably originally a rabbit flea) have been recorded from the nests of puffins. Other fleas found on the birds include &quot;Ceratophyllus borealis&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllus garei&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllus vagabunda&quot;, and the common rabbit flea &quot;Spilopsyllus cuniculi&quot;.

==Relationship with humans==

===Status and conservation===
The Atlantic puffin has an extensive range that covers over and Europe, which holds more than 90% of the global population, is home to 4,770,000‚Äì5,780,000 pairs (equalling 9,550,000‚Äì11,600,000 adults). In 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded its status from &quot;least concern&quot; to &quot;vulnerable&quot;. This was caused by a review that revealed a rapid and ongoing population decline in its European range. Trends elsewhere are unknown, although, in 2018, the total global population was estimated at 12‚Äì14¬†million adult individuals. Some of the causes of population decline may be increased predation by gulls and skuas, the introduction of rats, cats, dogs, and foxes onto some islands used for nesting, contamination by toxic residues, drowning in fishing nets, declining food supplies, and climate change. On the island of Lundy, the number of puffins decreased from 3,500 pairs in 1939 to 10 pairs in 2000. This was mainly due to the rats that had proliferated on the island and were eating eggs and young chicks. Following the elimination of the rats, populations were expected to recover, and in 2005, a juvenile was seen, believed to be the first chick raised on the island for 30 years. In 2018, BirdLife International reported that the Atlantic puffin was threatened with extinction.

Puffin numbers increased considerably in the late 20th century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands, where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, a slight increase on the 2008 census and on the previous year&#x27;s poor season, when some of the burrows flooded. This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic puffin being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland&#x27;s puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a 30-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin&#x27;s lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969‚Äì2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, the European population will decline an estimated 50‚Äì79% between 2000 and 2065.
SOS Puffin is a conservation project at the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers on the island of Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (&quot;Lavatera arborea&quot;). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and progress has been made in cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off, as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.

Project Puffin is an effort initiated in 1973 by Stephen W. Kress of the National Audubon Society to restore Atlantic puffins to nesting islands in the Gulf of Maine. Eastern Egg Rock Island in Muscongus Bay, about from Pemaquid Point, had been occupied by nesting puffins until 1885, when the birds disappeared because of overhunting. Counting on the fact young puffins usually return to breed on the same island where they fledged, a team of biologists and volunteers translocated 10‚Äì to 14-day-old nestlings from Great Island in Newfoundland to Eastern Egg Rock. The young were placed into artificial sod burrows and fed with vitamin-fortified fish daily for about one month. Such yearly translocations took place until 1986, with 954 young puffins being moved in total. Each year before fledging, the young were individually tagged. The first adults returned to the island by 1977. Puffin decoys had been installed on the island to fool the puffins into thinking they were part of an established colony. This did not catch on at first, but in 1981, four pairs nested on the island. In 2014, 148 nesting pairs were counted on the island. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of re-establishing a seabird colony, the project showed the usefulness of using decoys and eventually call recordings and mirrors, to facilitate such re-establishment.

===Pollution===
Since the Atlantic puffin spends its winters on the open ocean, it is susceptible to human actions and catastrophes such as oil spills. Oiled plumage has a reduced ability to insulate and makes the bird more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and less buoyant in the water. Many birds die, and others, while attempting to remove the oil by preening, ingest and inhale toxins. This leads to inflammation of the airways and gut and in the longer term, damage to the liver and kidneys. This trauma can contribute to a loss of reproductive success and harm to developing embryos. An oil spill occurring in winter, when the puffins are far out at sea, may affect them less than inshore birds as the crude oil slicks soon get broken up and dispersed by the churning of the waves. When oiled birds get washed up on beaches around Atlantic coasts, only about 1.5% of the dead auks are puffins, but many others may have died far from land and sunk. After the oil tanker shipwreck and oil spill in 1967, few dead puffins were recovered, but the number of puffins breeding in France the following year was reduced to 16% of its previous level.

The Atlantic puffin and other pelagic birds are excellent bioindicators of the environment, as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain, and as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, the potential is great for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers, or internal organs, and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances, as well as metals. In fact, these surveys can be used to provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.

===Climate change===
Climate change may well affect populations of seabirds in the northern Atlantic. The most important demographic may be an increase in the sea surface temperature, which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway, the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance, and this, in turn, influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.

In Maine, on the other side of the Atlantic, shifting fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed for the lack of availability of the herring, which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (&quot;Peprilus triacanthus&quot;), but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird&#x27;s breeding range, and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.

===Tourism===

Breeding colonies of Atlantic puffins provide an interesting spectacle for bird watchers and tourists. For example, 4000 puffins nest each year on islands off the coast of Maine, and visitors can view them from tour boats that operate during the summers. The Project Puffin Visitor Center in Rockland provides information on the birds and their lives, and on the other conservation projects being undertaken by the National Audubon Society, which runs the center. Views of the colony on Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge can be viewed via live cams during the breeding season.
Similar tours operate in Iceland, the Hebrides, and Newfoundland.

===Hunting===

Historically, Atlantic puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine, or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, but not to the same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent overexploitation. Although calls have been made for an outright ban on hunting puffins in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks, they are still caught and eaten there and on the Faroe Islands.

Traditional means of capture varied across the birds&#x27; range, and nets and rods were used in various ingenious ways. In the Faroe Islands, the method of choice was &quot;fleyg&quot;, with the use of a &quot;fleygingarstong&quot;, a 3.6-m-long pole with a small net at the end suspended between two rods, somewhat like a very long lacrosse stick. A few dead puffins were strewn around to entice incoming birds to land, and the net was flicked upwards to scoop a bird from the air as it slowed before alighting. Hunters often positioned themselves on cliff tops in stone seats built in small depressions to conceal themselves from puffins flying overhead. Most of the birds caught were subadults, and a skilled hunter could gather 200‚Äì300 in a day. Another method of capture, used in St Kilda, involved the use of a flexible pole with a noose on the end. This was pushed along the ground towards the intended target, which advanced to inspect the noose as its curiosity overcame its caution. A flick of the wrist would flip the noose over the victim&#x27;s head and it was promptly killed before its struggles could alarm other birds nearby.

===In culture===

The Atlantic puffin is the official bird symbol of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. In August 2007, the Atlantic puffin was unsuccessfully proposed as the official symbol of the Liberal Party of Canada by its deputy leader Michael Ignatieff, after he observed a colony of these birds and became fascinated by their behaviour. V√¶r√∏y Municipality in Norway has an Atlantic puffin as its coat of arms. Puffins have been given several informal names including &quot;clowns of the sea&quot; and &quot;sea parrots&quot;, and juvenile puffins may be called &quot;pufflings&quot;.

Several islands have been named after the bird. The island of Lundy in the United Kingdom is reputed to derive its name from the Norse &quot;lund-ey&quot; or &quot;puffin island&quot;. An alternative explanation has been suggested connected with another meaning of the word &quot;lund&quot; referring to a copse or wooded area. The Vikings might have found the island a useful refuge and restocking point after their depredations on the mainland. The island issued its own coins, and in 1929, its own stamps with denominations in &quot;puffins&quot;. Other countries and dependencies that have depicted Atlantic puffins on their stamps include Alderney, Canada, the Faroe Islands, France, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, St Pierre et Miquelon, and the United Kingdom.

The publisher of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced a range of books for children under the Puffin Books brand in 1939. At first, these were nonfiction titles, but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand was so great that Puffin Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children&#x27;s magazine called &quot;Puffin Post&quot; was established.

A tradition exists on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan&#x27;s photo-illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;Nights of the Pufflings&quot; (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to make their way to the sea, but sometimes get confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.

Due to being a protected species on Skellig Michael, the production team for the Star Wars sequel trilogy resorted to digitally dressing the puffins (and practically and digitally recreating them for other scenes), resulting in the creation of porgs.

<text>Andrew Sterett (January 27, 1778 ‚Äì January 9, 1807)[8] was an officer in the United States Navy during the nation&#x27;s early days. He saw combat during the Quasi-War with France and in the Barbary Wars, commanding the schooner USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in both conflicts.

==Early life==
Sterett was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Andrew Sterett was the son of John Sterett, a former Revolutionary War captain and a successful shipping merchant. The fourth of ten children, he nevertheless inherited a sizable amount of money. Despite this, he resolved to join the Navy, and was commissioned as a lieutenant on March 25, 1798. His family was of English descent.

==The Quasi-War==
Sterett&#x27;s first assignment was as Third Lieutenant of the USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, under Captain Thomas Truxtun, which was sent to do battle with French vessels during the Quasi-War. He was commanding a gun battery when &quot;Constellation&quot; defeated and captured the French frigate &quot;Insurgente&quot; on February 9, 1799. &quot;Insurgente&quot; lost 29 dead and 41 wounded; the only American loss was a seaman run through by Sterett&#x27;s saber in a summary execution, the seaman, Neal Harvey, having abandoned his post in a panic. Upon &quot;Constellation&#x27;&quot;s arrival back in Baltimore, the anti-federalist press, who opposed the military in general and the Quasi-War in particular, seized upon this incident as an example of the Navy&#x27;s &quot;arrogance and cold-bloodedness&quot;. The objections intensified when Sterett was heard to say, &quot;We put men to death for even looking pale on this ship.&quot; The Navy, however, soon promoted Sterett to the rank of first lieutenant.

A year later, Sterett was involved in a battle to a draw with the 54-gun French frigate &quot;Vengeance&quot;. Soon afterward, he took command of the schooner USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; where he remained through the end of the Quasi-War, capturing the privateer &quot;Amour de la Patrie&quot; on 24 December 1800.

==The Barbary Wars==
After resupplying in Baltimore, Sterett sailed &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the Barbary Coast in June 1801 as part of a force under Commodore Richard Dale in the first stages of the Barbary Wars.

On August 1, 1801, &quot;Enterprise&quot; under Sterett&#x27;s command defeated the 14-gun &quot;Tripoli&quot;, a Tripolitan corsair. After twice faking surrender, &quot;Tripoli&quot; suffered 30 dead and 30 wounded, including the Captain, Rais Mahomet Rous, and the first officer. &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered no casualties. Since there was no formal declaration of war, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was under orders not to take prizes. After her crew was ordered to dump its guns overboard, &quot;Tripoli&quot; was allowed to sail home, where her captain was humiliated and punished.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was sent back to Baltimore with dispatches after this engagement. While there, on the recommendation of Congress, Sterett was presented by President Thomas Jefferson with a sword in gratitude of the victory over the &quot;Tripoli&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s crew was also rewarded with an extra month&#x27;s pay. The ship returned to the Mediterranean in November 1802.

Sterett turned over command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to Stephen Decatur in April 1803. He was then promoted to Master Commandant and offered the command of a brig which was under construction.

==Resignation==
Sterett had been senior in rank to Decatur, but due to their comparative length of service, in 1803, Decatur was selected to be promoted above Sterett. Sterett therefore resigned from the Navy, on June 29, 1805, to join the merchant marine.

==Final voyage==
In August 1806, Sterett was hired by Baltimore ship owner Lemuel Taylor to captain Taylor&#x27;s sloop &quot;Warren&quot; on a trading voyage to the North West coast of America and China (though there were rumors that the ship was actually headed to the West Indies or South America with a cargo of contraband). Taylor selected Procopio Pollock, son of Revolutionary War financier Oliver Pollock, as the &quot;Warren&#x27;s&quot; supercargo (cargo master). Both men were given sealed orders that were not to be opened until a certain point in the voyage.

On September 12, the &quot;Warren&quot; sailed out of Baltimore with a complement of about 112 men, including four officers (all previously known to Sterett). In early December, off the coast of Brazil, Sterett and Pollock opened their instructions. To his horror Sterett discovered that Taylor&#x27;s orders to Pollock gave Pollock control over not only the cargo but operational control of the vessel as well; they stated that the ship was to proceed to the west coast of South America, where Pollock was to engage in trade as he saw fit. These orders, different from those given to Sterett and in violation of the articles of employment signed by the crew, caused a violent argument between Sterett and Pollock. Sterett seems to have been driven into a frenzy bordering on madness; he was heard by members of the crew to say that before he would follow such orders he would kill either Pollock or himself. About a week later, after apparently trying unsuccessfully to shoot Pollock, Captain Sterett retired to his cabin alone and shot himself in the head. He lingered in agonizing pain for two weeks before dying on 9 January 1807, a few weeks shy of his 29th birthday and shortly before the ship rounded Cape Horn. Neither the records of the &quot;Warren&quot; or a lawsuit later filed against Taylor by the crew make any mention of Sterett&#x27;s body, so it is presumed that he was buried at sea.

==Legacy==
Four ships of the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Sterett&quot; in his honor.

<text>Richard Steele (born January 26, 1944) is an American retired boxing referee who was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

A former member of the United States Marine Corps, Steele was a teammate of future world Heavyweight champion Ken Norton in the Marines. He began his career as an amateur boxer while with the Marines, compiling a record of 12 wins and 3 losses before launching a professional career. Steele was All Marines in 1963-64 and participated in the 1964 Olympic Trials, and was inducted into the U.S. Marine Corps Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017. He had 16 wins and 4 defeats as a professional fighter. He was also a contestant on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; on April 9, 1991, as the central character.

Steele began refereeing fights in the 1970s up until 2007, and he went on to referee in 147 world title fights around the world. His first major fight was the 1977 slugfest between unbeaten Mexican champions Carlos Zarate and Alfonso Zamora. Among his other notable fights were Aaron Pryor&#x27;s knock out of Alexis Arg√ºello in ten rounds of their rematch and Mike Tyson&#x27;s defeat of Donovan Ruddock in 1991, Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns&#x27; 1985 middleweight championship bout, Hagler&#x27;s 1987 loss to Sugar Ray Leonard, and the first of two fights between Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez and Meldrick Taylor, which he stopped with 2 seconds remaining of the final round.

==Controversial fights==

Steele was sometimes involved in controversial decisions. In the fight between Tyson and Ruddock he officiated, Steele elected to stop the fight in the seventh round as Ruddock appeared to be hurt by several stiff shots by Tyson. This, however, was in contrast to how the fight had gone up until that point with both fighters going back and forth and Tyson being hurt by several of Ruddock&#x27;s shots. Steele&#x27;s decision caused a near riot in the crowd, who were all infuriated by the call, and he had to be escorted from the ring for his own protection.

However, what is regarded as Steele&#x27;s biggest controversy in his long career is the first fight between Julio Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor. Taylor had been winning the fight entering the twelfth and final round and was ahead by enough of a margin on all three judges&#x27; scorecards that it would have been impossible for Chavez to win except by knockout. Despite his large lead Taylor had been taking a great deal of punishment from Chavez the entire fight, however, and the undefeated Mexican champion knocked Taylor down with seventeen seconds left in the fight. After Taylor got to his feet after a count of five, Steele asked him twice if he was okay to continue. After Taylor failed to respond, instead looking at his corner, Steele stopped the fight with two seconds remaining and Chavez was declared the victor by technical knockout. Although many fans criticized his decision, considering how little time was remaining in the fight, Steele defended the decision by saying that he was only protecting Taylor from further injury and that &quot;there&#x27;s no fight worth a man&#x27;s life&quot;. After the fight, Taylor was examined by ringside doctor Flip Homansky and found to have suffered a facial fracture and kidney damage so severe he was urinating pure blood. The decision was upheld after an appeal by Taylor&#x27;s handlers.

==Outside of boxing==
Outside the boxing ring, Steele has made a name for himself as a community conscious person, opening a gym, the &quot;Richard Steele Boxing Club&quot; in Las Vegas, and helping out with Salvation Army charities. In 1999, he was given an award by South African president Nelson Mandela for refusing to referee fights in South Africa while the Apartheid laws were still in use there. Steele also worked as a Pit Supervisor at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas in the late 80s-90s.

<text>The Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) is a self-contained individual United States military ration used by the United States Armed Forces and Department of Defense. It is intended for use by American service members in combat or field conditions where other food is not available. MREs have also been distributed to civilians as humanitarian daily rations during natural disasters and wars.

The MRE replaced the canned Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) in 1981. Its garrison ration and group ration equivalent is the Unitized Group Ration (UGR), its in-combat and mobile equivalent is the First Strike Ration (FSR), and its long-range and cold weather equivalents are the Long Range Patrol (LRP) and Meal, Cold Weather (MCW) respectively.

== History ==

===Predecessors===

The first American military ration established by a Congressional Resolution, during the Revolutionary War, consisted of enough food to feed a man for one day, mostly beef, peas, and rice. During the Civil War, the U.S. military moved toward canned goods. Later, self-contained kits were issued as a whole ration and contained canned meat, bread, coffee, sugar and salt. During World War I, canned meats were replaced with lightweight preserved meats (salted or dried) to save weight and allow more rations to be carried by soldiers on foot. At the beginning of World War II, a number of new field rations were introduced, including the Mountain ration and the Jungle ration. Cost-cutting measures by Quartermaster Command officials during the latter part of World War II and the Korean War again saw the predominance of heavy canned C-rations issued to troops, regardless of operating environment or mission. During World War II, over 100¬†million cans of Spam were sent to the Pacific. The use of canned wet rations continued through the Vietnam War, with the improved MCI.

During the Vietnam War, problems with the canned MCI rations become apparent. MCI cans were heavy and bulky; they could not fit easily in a uniform pocket and could even cause injury. The cans could also corrode in the tropical environment and cause the food to spoil. After the food was consumed, the empty cans were difficult to dispose of; the littered cans were sometimes fashioned into booby traps by the enemy. Finally, the MCI rations had an estimated shelf life of 24¬†months at , which was found to be inadequate as supply was often interrupted by weather and enemy activity.

=== Introduction ===

After repeated experiences with providing prepared rations to soldiers dating from before World War II, Pentagon officials ultimately realized that simply providing a nutritionally balanced meal in the field was not adequate. Service members in various geographic regions and combat situations often required different subsets of ingredients for food to be considered palatable over long periods. Catering to individual tastes and preferences would encourage service members to actually consume the whole ration and its nutrition. Most importantly, the use of specialized forces in extreme environments and the necessity of carrying increasingly heavy field loads while on foot during long missions required significantly lighter alternatives to standard canned wet rations.

In 1963, the DoD began developing the &quot;Meal, Ready to Eat&quot;, a ration that would rely on modern food preparation and packaging technology to create a lighter replacement for the canned MCI. In 1966, this led to the Long Range Patrol, or LRP ration, a dehydrated meal stored in a waterproof canvas pouch. As with the Jungle ration, its expense compared to canned wet rations, as well as the costs of stocking and storing a specialized field ration, led to its limited usage and repeated attempts at discontinuance by Quartermaster Command officials.

Early MRE prototypes that involved freeze-dried and dehydrated foods were developed under Abdul Rahman, who later received the Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his work. Further work was needed to develop a ration that did not require re-hydration (thus not requiring additional preparation time and water). Further effort, led by Dr. Rauno A. Lampi, Chief of Food Systems Equipment Division at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, concentrated on the refinement of the retort pouch to contain a wet ration with a three-to-ten year shelf life that could be easily shipped, carried in the field, opened and consumed straight out of the package if necessary with no further heat or water. The resulting MRE went into special issue starting in 1981 and standard issue in 1986, using a limited menu of twelve entr√©es.

=== Ongoing development ===

The MRE has been in continuous development since its introduction.

After the introduction of the MRE, service members often heated the food by boiling them in a canteen cup over a lit fuel source. This was slow, especially in cold weather. It also produced a visible flame that was undesirable at night. Service members strongly desired a more convenient way to heat the food. Between 1988-1989, development and testing was conducted for a new flameless ration heater. In 1990, the Flameless Ration Heater (FRH) was introduced. Service members activate a chemical reaction with a few ounces of water, which produces an exothermic reaction. An FRH was included with each meal beginning with the MRE XIII in 1993. 

In an array of field tests and surveys, service members requested more entr√©e options and larger serving sizes. By 1994, commercial-like graphics were added to make the packets more user-friendly and appealing, while biodegradable materials were introduced for inedible components, such as spoons and napkins. The number of main dishes expanded to 16 by 1996 (including vegetarian options), 20 by 1997 and 24 by 1998. As of 2023, the system includes 24 entr√©es, and more than 150 additional items. The variety allowed service members to trade them in order to find something palatable for various cultures and geographical regions.

The ration originally came in a dark brown outer bag from 1981 to 1995 because it was designed for service in the temperate forests and plains of central Europe. It was replaced in 1996 with a tan outer bag that was better suited for service in the deserts of the Middle East. By 2000, a bean burrito main dish was introduced. In 2006, &quot;Beverage Bags&quot; were introduced to the MRE, as service members have begun to depend more on hydration packs than on canteens, thus denying them the use of the metal canteen cups (shaped to fit in a canteen pouch with the canteen) for mixing powdered beverages. In addition to having measuring marks to indicate levels of liquid for precise measurement, they can be sealed and placed inside the flameless heater.

Most recently, MREs have been developed using the Dietary Reference Intake, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM indicated service members (who were classified as highly active men between the ages of 18 and 30) typically burn about 4,200¬†Calories (kcal) a day, but tended to only consume about 2,400¬†Calories a day during combat, entering a negative energy balance. This imbalance occurs when service members fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of macronutrients to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, more studies are showing many service members still do not meet today&#x27;s standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of service members, making constant changes that encourage service members to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value. A small randomized controlled trial from 2017 confirms the nutritional balance of MRE eaten-in-whole using blood tests.

The military has experimented with new assault ration prototypes, such as the First Strike Ration and the HOOAH! Bar, designed with elite or specialized forces in mind. Lighter than the typical MRE, they require no preparation and allow service members to eat them while traveling. In July 2009, 6,300 dairy shake packets of varying flavors were recalled due to evidence of &quot;Salmonella&quot; contamination.

== Requirements ==

Each meal provides about . They are intended to be eaten for a maximum of 21 days (the assumption is that logistics units can provide fresh food rations by then), and have a minimum shelf life of three years (depending on storage conditions).

Packaging requirements are strict. MREs must be able to withstand parachute drops from , and non-parachute drops of . The packaging is required to maintain a minimum shelf life of three and a half years at , nine months at , and short durations from to must be sustainable. New forms of packaging are being considered to better meet these requirements including the use of zein to replace the foil, which can be easily punctured, conducts heat, and is reflective (which may give away a servicemember&#x27;s position).

Each MRE weighs , depending on the menu. Since MREs contain water in the food, they weigh more than freeze-dried meals providing equivalent calories.

=== Resale status ===
As a result of earlier unauthorized sales to civilians, the Department of Defense requires that &quot;U.S. Government Property, Commercial Resale is Unlawful&quot; be printed on each case of MREs. The warning is only intended for service members as there are no laws that forbid the resale of MREs by civilians. Although the government has attempted to discourage sellers from selling MREs, auction sites such as eBay have continued to allow auctions of the MREs because the Department of Defense has been unable to provide any regulations or laws specifically outlawing the practice. According to a spokesman for eBay, &quot;until a law is passed saying you can&#x27;t sell these things, we&#x27;re not going to stop them from being sold on the site.&quot; Therefore, while MREs are not &quot;prima facie&quot; contraband, the procurement and sale of MREs by military personnel for personal profit is illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 108. As a result, MREs found for sale outside reputable vendors often fall into a grey market where the question of how it entered civilian hands (through theft/legitimate means) and/or its quality may be unknown.

An investigation conducted in 2006 on behalf of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined multiple instances where sellers on eBay may have improperly obtained MREs and sold them to the public for private gain. As military MREs are procured at taxpayers&#x27; expense, they are intended to be consumed by individuals from authorized organizations and activities. Consequently, &quot;if military MREs are sold to the general public on eBay, then they are clearly not reaching their intended recipients and represent a waste of taxpayer dollars and possible criminal activity.&quot; Further, MREs found on eBay are typically older and closer to their expiration date, having been sourced in &quot;neighborhood yard sales&quot; and &quot;Marine base dumpsters&quot;.

The growth of MREs listed on eBay in 2005 resulted in a government investigation of whether they were intended for Hurricane Katrina victims, and the news media nickname &quot;Meals Ready for eBay.&quot; Some cases were being sold from Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and other Gulf states affected by Katrina. The internal cost of a 12 pack case of MREs is $86.98 (approx. $7.25 a meal) to the government, much higher than what is paid to vendors. MREs can be purchased by civilians directly from the contractors who supply MREs to the U.S. government. These MREs usually omit the flameless ration heater and have other minor differences (i.e., design of case and bag or type of spoon), but otherwise are often very similar to genuine U.S. government MREs.

In the Philippines, the government stopped MREs from being sold in local markets in 2013.

== Contents ==

The general contents of an MRE typically include:
* Main course (often referred to as &quot;the main&quot;)
* Side dish
* Dessert or snack (often commercial candy, fortified pastry, First Strike Bar, or Soldier Fuel)
* Crackers or bread
* Spread of cheese, peanut butter, or jelly
* Powdered beverage mix (commonly a fruit-flavored drink, cocoa, instant coffee or tea, sport drink, or dairy shake)
* Utensils (commonly just a plastic spoon, though rarely a fork and knife may also be given)
* Flameless ration heater
* Beverage mixing bag
* Accessory pack:
**Xylitol chewing gum
**Water-resistant matchbook
**Napkin / toilet paper
**Moist towelette
**Seasonings, including salt, pepper, sugar, creamer, and/or Tabasco sauce
**Freeze-dried coffee powder

Many items are fortified with nutrients. In addition, DoD policy requires units to augment MREs with fresh food whenever feasible, especially in training environments.

===Changes in menus===
To make MREs more palatable to service members and match ever-changing trends in popular tastes, the military is constantly seeking feedback to adjust MRE menus and ingredients. In the following list, only main entrees are listed. Vegetarian menus are marked and footnoted on their first appearance.






== Date codes ==
The cases of MREs and their variants usually are marked with the production date in the American fashion: 2-digit Month / 2-digit Day / 4-digit Year (e.g., November 24, 1996 would be rendered as 11/24/1996). This is followed by the &quot;Lot Number&quot;, a four-digit Julian date code that is also repeated on the individual components in the MREs. The first digit is the last digit of the Year (e.g., 0 could be equal to 2010 or 2020, 1 could be equal to 2001 or 2011, and 9 could be equal to 2009 or 2019). The next 3 digits are equal to the day of the year (i.e., 001 to 366). &quot;1068&quot; could be equal to the 68th day of 2001 or 2011, for example March 9, 2001. &quot;2068&quot; could mean March 8, 2012 or March 9, 2022 (the 68th day of 2012 is March 8 due to the presence of a leap day).

The cases are also stamped with the &quot;Inspection / Test Date&quot;, which is in the same format as the Packing Date (e.g., October 1994 would be rendered as &quot;10/94&quot;). Rations optimally must be kept in a cool, dry place during storage. If the rations are stored at 80¬∞ for 3 consecutive years, they would reach the end of their shelf life. They are often inspected by the U.S. Army veterinary food personnel and their shelf life may extend beyond the inspection test date. Rations are discarded after five years.

==Civilian use==
MREs have also been distributed to civilians during natural disasters. The National Guard has provided MREs to the public during natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Maria and Sandy; and the 2011 Super Outbreak. The large number of civilians exposed to MREs prompted several jokes during the recent Mardi Gras in New Orleans, with revellers donning clothing made of MRE packets with phrases such as &quot;MRE Antoinette&quot; (referring to Marie Antoinette; the wife of King Louis XVI) and &quot;Man Ready to Eat.&quot;

The use of rations for noncombat environments has been questioned. While the nutritional requirements are suitable for a combat environment where servicemembers will burn many calories and lose much sodium through sweat, it has been provided as emergency food or even as a standard meal. The high-fat (averaging about 52¬†grams of fat, 5¬†grams trans fats) and high-salt content (averaging about 2¬†grams) are less than ideal for sedentary situations. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a 77-year-old civilian man with prior congestive heart failure ended up with volume overload from the high sodium content of MREs. The HDR and TOTM account for this nutritional need.

Civilian taste-testing of MREs is popular. For example, the YouTuber known as Steve1989MREInfo reviews MREs and other rations from the U.S. or other countries (such as the Individual Meal Pack), as well as vintage rations like the K-ration for content on YouTube. He gives comprehensive reviews and information about each ration he has.

== Criticism==
Some of the early MRE main courses were not very palatable, earning them the nicknames &quot;Meals Rejected by Everyone&quot;, &quot;Meals Rejected by Ethiopians&quot; (during the 1983‚Äì1985 famine in Ethiopia), or &quot;Meals Rarely Edible&quot;. Some individual portions had their own nicknames. For example, the frankfurters, which came sealed in pouches of four, were referred to as &quot;the four fingers of death&quot;. Although quality has improved over the years, many of the nicknames have stuck. MREs were sometimes called &quot;Three Lies for the Price of One ... it&#x27;s not a Meal, it&#x27;s not Ready, and you can&#x27;t Eat it.&quot; As late as the 2010 deployment to Afghanistan, one veteran in November 2019 characterized MREs (the traditional Thanksgiving meal had been destroyed in an attack, and the standard MRE shipment partially destroyed) as &quot;accursed things&quot;.

Their low dietary fiber content could cause constipation in some, so they were also known as &quot;Meals Requiring Enemas&quot;, &quot;Meals Refusing to Exit&quot;, &quot;Meals Refusing to Excrete&quot;, or &quot;Massive Rectal Expulsions&quot;. While the laxative effect of xylitol sweetener (if excessively consumed) may contribute to a myth that the gum found in MREs contains a laxative, the crackers in the ration pack do contain a higher-than-normal vegetable content to facilitate digestion. In December 2006, comedian Al Franken (on his eighth United Service Organizations tour at the time) joked to troops in Iraq that he had his fifth MRE so far and &quot;none of them had an exit strategy.&quot; By 2015, the average fiber content per pack of MRE has improved to an adequate 12 grams.

A superstition exists among troops about the Charms candies that come with some menus: they are considered bad luck, especially if actually eaten.

In March 2007, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; invited three gourmet chefs to taste-test 18 MRE meals. None of the meals rated higher than a 5.7 average on a scale of 1-to-10, and the chicken fajita meal in particular was singled out for disdain, rating an average score of 1.3. In 2010, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that a (such as cassoulet with accompaniments of deer p√¢t√© and nougat) could be traded for around five MREs, though by 2014 it was claimed that MRE menus had improved to the point that their worth had reversed.

The vegetable cheese omelet MRE, Recipe No. 4, introduced in 2005, is generally considered the worst ever. Soldiers serving in Iraq dubbed it the &quot;Vomelet&quot; (a pun with vomit), both for its appearance and taste. It was discontinued in 2009.

==Variants and similar rations==
The MRE has led to the creation of several similar field rations. &quot;Aircrew Build to Order Meal Module&quot; (ABOMM) are a special variant consisting of repacking existing MRE food elements into a form that provides military flight crews and tank operators with a meal designed to be eaten on the go or while operating their aircraft or ground vehicle without the use of utensils, and packaged for use in confined spaces.

===Meal, Religious, Kosher/Halal===

For service members with strict religious dietary requirements, the military offers the specialized &quot;Meal, Religious, Kosher/Halal&quot;. These are tailored to provide the same nutritional content, but will not contain offending ingredients. The entrees come in distinct stylized packaging with a color picture of the prepared entree on it (like civilian pre-made meals) and the food accessories come in commercial packaging. Kosher entrees are marked &quot;Glatt Kosher&quot; in Hebrew and English, while halal entrees are marked &quot;Dhabiha Halal&quot; in Arabic and English. The meals come in cases of 12 that weigh and have a volume of 1.4 cubic feet (40L). To keep with dietary laws, the entree and accessory packets are packed in two separate inner boxes in an outer case and come in kosher or halal only (the two special ration types are never mixed in a shipping case).

The original meals were kosher only and came in 4 Beef, 4 Chicken, 2 Salmon, and 2 Gefilte Fish menus. The meals now come in Beef, Lamb, Chicken, Vegetarian, and Pasta dishes. The entrees are a mixture of traditional Middle-Eastern and South Asian dishes (like &quot;Lamb &amp; Vegetable Jalfrezi&quot; or &quot;Curried Chicken with Basmati Rice, Lentils, and Vegetables&quot;) and Western dishes (like &quot;Vegetable Ratatouille&quot;, &quot;Florentine-style Vegetable Lasagna&quot;, or &quot;New Orleans Gumbo with Chicken&quot;). Each menu contains an average of 1200kilocalories and has a shelf life of 3 to 10 months.

There is also a special kosher meal certified for Passover requirements. The &quot;Passover Ration&quot; (officially called the &quot;Meal, Religious, Kosher for Passover&quot;) contains packages of Matzoh crackers and has beef, chicken (served on the bone), or salmon entrees. Each meal is in its own packet and come 12 packets to a case.

For less strictly-observing servicemembers, non-certified &quot;pork-free&quot; menus of the regular MRE are available. The DLA offers &quot;Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), Pork-Free, Individual&quot;, which consist of 12 menus selected from the regular roster of 24.

===Vegetarian HDR and MARC===
The &quot;Humanitarian Daily Ration&quot; (HDR) is a self-contained Halal meal designed to be given to refugees and other displaced people. It is designed to feed a person for a full day, and the menus are intended to be palatable to many religious and cultural tastes. To meet this goal, no animal products or by-products, no alcohol or alcohol-based products, and minimal dairy products are used in their production. It is otherwise created and packaged much like MREs; feedback from the Afghanistan campaign led to the interior packing being reinforced to withstand being air-dropped, as the packets sometimes ruptured on impact. The outer bag is tinted a high-visibility red or yellow and has an American flag and a picture of a person eating out of the bag with a spoon. There are usually instructions printed on it in English and one or more local languages as well.

The &quot;Meal, Alternative Regionally Customized&quot; (MARC) is a self-contained, shelf-stable meal developed by U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM)/Natick, Individual Combat Ration Team (ICRT), Combat Feeding Directorate (CFD). MARCs were developed specifically for detainees at Guantanamo Bay, and have since found wider spread use, notably Iraq and Afghanistan. MARC meals are entirely vegetarian as an easy way to prevent conflicts with culturally &quot;prohibited products&quot; (Islam and Judaism forbidding pork, Hindus avoiding beef, etc). They are neither Kosher nor Halal certified. Many of the menus available have a Southeast Asian or Indian style to them (Saag Chole, curried vegetables), but others are simply the equivalent of vegetarian MREs (Cheese Tortellini, Minestrone).

=== Higher-calorie variants ===
In extreme cold temperatures, the packaged wet food in MREs can freeze solid, rendering the food inedible and the heating packet insufficient. The &quot;Meal, Cold Weather&quot; (MCW) provides a ration similar to the MRE designed for lower temperatures than the MRE can withstand. Clad in white packaging, it offers a freeze-dried entree designed to be eaten with heated water, the same side ingredients as the standard MRE, and additional drink mixes to encourage additional hydration. The caloric and fat content of the meals is also increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCW/LRP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The MCW replaced the &quot;Ration, Cold Weather&quot; (RCW).

The &quot;Meal, Long Range Patrol&quot; (LRP) is essentially the same as the MCW, but with different accessory packs. The MLRP is designed for troops who may receive limited or no supply, and weight of the ration is critical. The similar First Strike Ration is along the same lines, but requires no preparation and may be eaten on the go.

===Special requirement food===
The &quot;Modular Operational Rations Enhancement&quot; (MORE) is issued as a supplement to meals for troops in extreme, demanding operational environments such as high-intensity training events.

The &quot;Tailored Operational Training Meal&quot; (TOTM) first entered service in May 2001. It provides a lower calorie count (an average of 997 kilocalories) for less intensive training environments, such as classroom instruction. It replaces the earlier mess-hall bagged lunches, catered meals or field kitchens for field instruction. The TOTM allows troops to become familiar with the MRE and its contents without providing an excessive amount of calories to troops who will not necessarily burn them. It uses a transparent outer plastic bag with commercial markings rather than the MRE&#x27;s tan plastic bag with standard markings. There are currently 3 different lists of twelve menus, making a total of 36 different meals. Each TOTM ration case is packed with a full menu of 12 assorted meals, weighs about 20¬†lbs (9¬†kg), and is 0.95 cubic feet (27 L). The TOTM has a more limited shelf-life than the MRE, with a duration of only 12 to 18 months.

The &quot;Unitized Group Ration (UGR)&quot; is a ration much like the MRE, but expanded to feed large groups. It is the successor to the older A-ration, B-ration, and T-ration It comes packed in sealed metal trays that are heated and then opened.

The &quot;Food Packet, Survival, General Purpose, Improved&quot; (FPSGPI) is given to pilots and other servicemembers that may require a small, extremely portable food ration for emergencies. It contains food bars and a drink mix. Similarly, the &quot;Food Packet, Survival, Abandon Ship&quot; (FPSAS) and &quot;Food Packet, Survival, Aircraft, Life Raft&quot; (FPSALR) are fitted into the storage areas on lifeboats.

The &quot;Jimmy Dean,&quot; a pre-packaged shelf-stable ration containing, among other items, a pre-made Jimmy Dean brand deli-style sandwich, is often issued in the field to U.S. servicemen as an alternative to MREs.

==Ratfucking==
The term &quot;ratfucking&quot; (&quot;rat&quot; in this case is shorthand for &quot;ration&quot;) is a slang term used by U.S. military personnel to describe the targeted pillaging of MREs, which the military officially calls &quot;field stripping&quot;. It refers to the process of opening a case of MREs (which are packed 12 in a box), opening up individual MRE packages, removing the desired items, and leaving the unenticing remainder.

<text>(; ) is an Arabic word meaning Muslim identity, nation, religious community, or the concept of a Commonwealth of the Muslim Believers ( &#x27;). It is a synonym for&#x27; (, &#x27;the Islamic nation&#x27;); it is commonly used to mean the collective community of Muslim people. In the Quran, the &quot;ummah&quot; typically refers to a single group that shares a common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation. The word &quot;ummah&quot; (pl. &quot;umam&quot; ) means nation in Arabic. For example, the Arabic term for the United Nations is , and the term is used to refer to &quot;the Arab Nation&quot;.

Ummah is distinguished from &#x27; ( , &quot;people&quot;), which means a nation with common ancestry or geography. The word &quot;ummah&quot; differs from the concept of a country or people. In its greater context it is used to describe a larger group of people. For example, in Arabic the word ÿ¥ÿπÿ®&#x27; (&quot;people&quot;) would be used to describe the citizens of Syria. However, the term &quot;ummah&quot; is used to describe the Arab people as a whole, which includes Syrians as well as the people of the Arab world. Ummah can be a supra-national polity with a common history and identity based on religion. Pan-Islamism advocates for the unity of Muslims in one nation as Islamic country or Islamic state.

==Islamic usage and origin==

The phrase &#x27; in the Quran (, &quot;One Nation&quot;) refers to all the Islamic world as it existed at the time. The Quran says: &quot;You [Muslims] are the best nation brought out for Mankind, commanding what is righteous ( &#x27;, lit. &quot;recognized [as good]&quot;) and forbidding what is wrong ( &#x27;, lit. &quot;recognized [as evil]&quot;)&quot; [3:110]. The usage is further clarified by the Constitution of Medina, an early document said to have been negotiated by Muhammad in CE 622 with the leading clans of Medina, which explicitly refers to Jews, Christians and pagan citizens of Medina as members of the &#x27;.

==Emergence==

At the time of Muhammad, before the conception of the ummah, Arab communities were typically governed by kinship. In other words, the political ideology of the Arabs centred on tribal affiliations and blood-relations. In the midst of a tribal society, the religion of Islam emerged and along with it the concept of the ummah. The ummah emerged according to the idea that a messenger or prophet has been sent to a nation. Unlike earlier messengers, who had been sent to various nations in the past (as can be found among the Prophets in the Old Testament), Muhammad sought to develop an ummah that was universal and not only for Arabs. Muhammad saw his purpose as the transmission of a divine message and the leadership of the Islamic nation. Islam sees Muhammad as the messenger to the ummah, transmitting a divine message, and implying that God is directing the life affairs of the ummah. Accordingly, the purpose of the ummah was to be based on religion by following the commands of God, rather than kinship.

Immediately after Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, Caliphates were established and the Shia emerged. Caliphates were Islamic states under the leadership of a political successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. These polities developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.

==Qur&#x27;an==
There are 62 instances in which the term &quot;ummah&quot; is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an, and they almost always refer to ethical, linguistic, or religious bodies of people who are subject to the divine plan of salvation. The meaning of the term appears to transform throughout the chronology of the Qur&#x27;an. When it is first used in the Qur&#x27;an, it is hardly distinguishable from the term &quot;qawm&quot;, which can be translated to &#x27;people&#x27;. The Qur&#x27;an recognizes that each &quot;ummah&quot; has a messenger that has been sent to relay a divine message to the nation and that all &quot;ummah&quot;s await God&#x27;s ultimate judgment. Although the meaning of the &quot;ummah&quot; begins simply with a general application of the word, it gradually develops to reference a general religious community and then evolves to specifically refer to the Muslim nation.

Before it referred exclusively to Muslims, the &quot;ummah&quot; encompassed Jewish and Christian communities as one with the Muslims and referred to them as the People of the Book. That is supplemented by the Constitution of Medina which declares all members of the &quot;ummah&quot;, regardless of religion, to be of &quot;one &quot;ummah&quot;&quot;. In those passages of the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;ummah&quot; may be referring to a unity of mankind through the shared beliefs of the monotheistic religions. Frederick Mathewson Denny argues that the most recent &quot;ummah&quot; that receives a messenger from God is the Arab &quot;ummah&quot;. As the Muslims became stronger during their residence in Medina, the Arab &quot;ummah&quot; narrowed into an &quot;ummah&quot; exclusively for Muslims. That is evidenced by the resacralisation of the Kaaba and Muhammad&#x27;s command to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, along with the redirection of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca.

The period in which the term is used most often is within the Third Meccan Period, followed by the Medinian Period. The extensive use of the term during both time periods indicates that Muhammad had begun to arrive at the concept of the &quot;ummah&quot; to specify the genuine Muslim nation. Furthermore, the early Meccan passages generally equate &quot;ummah&quot; as religion, but in the Medinan passages refer more specifically to the relations of &quot;ummah&quot; and religion. The final passage that refers to &quot;ummah&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an refers to the Muslims as the &quot;best nation&quot; and accordingly led to it being as an exclusive reference to Islam. A verse in the Qur&#x27;an also mentions the &quot;ummah&quot; in the context of all of the messengers, and that their &quot;ummah&quot; (nation) of theirs is one, and God is their Lord entirely:

==Mecca==
Initially, it did not appear that the new Muslim nation would oppose the tribes that already existed in Mecca. The first Muslims did not need to make a break with traditional Quraysh customs since the vision for the new nation included moral norms that were not unfamiliar to the tribal society of Mecca. However, what distinguished this community from the tribes was its focus of the place of those morals within a person&#x27;s life.

==Medina==
After Muhammad and the first converts to Islam were forced to leave Mecca, the community was welcomed in Medina by the Ansar, a group of Pagans who had converted to Islam. Despite Medina already being occupied by numerous Jews and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of Muhammad and his followers provoked no opposition from Medina&#x27;s residents. Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad established the Constitution of Medina with the various tribal leaders in order to form the Meccan immigrants and the Medinan residents into a single nation, the &quot;ummah&quot;. Rather than limiting members of the &quot;ummah&quot; to a single tribe or religious affiliation as had been the case when the &quot;ummah&quot; first developed in Mecca, the Constitution of Medina ensured that the &quot;ummah&quot; was composed of a variety of people and beliefs essentially making it to be supra-tribal. Islamic historian, Tabari, suggested that Muhammad&#x27;s initial intentions upon arriving in Medina was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely. Tabari also claimed that Muhammad observed the first Friday prayer in Medina. It occurred on Friday because Friday served as a market day in Medina to enable Jews to observe the sabbath. Membership to the &quot;ummah&quot; was not restricted to adhering to the Muslim faith but rather encompassed all of the tribes as long as they vowed to recognize Muhammad as the nation and political figure of authority.

The Constitution of Medina declared that the Jewish tribes and the Muslims from Medina formed &#x27;one &quot;ummah&quot;.&#x27; It is possible that the Medinan &quot;ummah&quot; was purely secular (compared to the later transformation of the &quot;ummah&quot; in Mecca) due to its variety of beliefs and practices of its members. The purpose of the Constitution of Medina was to uphold political obligations and social relations between the various tribes. The community members in Medina, although not derived from the same faith, were committed to each other through a desire to defend the common good of the nation. In other words, the nation was united according to preserve its shared interests. The people of other religious beliefs, particularly those that are considered to be &quot;People of the Book&quot; were granted the special protection of God through the dhimmah contract. These other religious groups were guaranteed security by God and Muhammad because of their common religious history as being the &quot;People of the Book&quot;. The dhimmah served as a sort of alliance between Muslims and non-Muslims. In the earlier treaties of the dhimmah, both groups were viewed as equal in status and both were obligated to help the other. However, in later treaties, after Islam had gained more power throughout Arabia, the dhimmah was perceived as the fulfilment of the religious duties of Muslims along with the payment of zakat. With the new contract of dhimmah, non-Muslims&#x27; protection by God and Muhammad became dependent on their payment.

===Constitution of Medina===
The Constitution of Medina is a document created by Muhammad to regulate social and political life in Medina. It deals with various tribal issues such as the organization and leadership of the participating tribal groups, warfare, blood money, ransom of captives, and war expenditures. It is at the beginning of the document that the Muslims from the Quraysh (those from Mecca) and the Muslims from Yathrib (those from Medina) are declared to be an &quot;ummah&quot; or one nation. The word &quot;ummah&quot; appears again when the document refers to the treaty of the Jews and states that the Yah≈´d Banƒ´ &#x27; Awf, or Jews, are an &quot;ummah&quot; that exists alongside the &quot;ummah&quot; of the Muslims or may be included in the same &quot;ummah&quot; as the Muslims.

The document states that the Jews who join the Muslims will receive aid and equal rights. In addition, the Jews will be guaranteed security from the Muslims, and are granted to maintain their own religion just as the Muslims will maintain theirs. This implies that the &quot;ummah&quot; is not strictly a religious nation in Medina. The Constitution of Medina lists the various Medinan tribes derived from the Aws and Khazraj as well as the several Jewish tribes that are granted to keep their tribal organization and leadership. The document also reveals that each group, the Muslims and the Jews, is responsible for its own finances except during time of war, when the two are able to share expenses.

==Back to Mecca==
After the Muslim takeover of Mecca, membership in the &quot;ummah&quot; required a commitment to Islam. This happened as a result of Islam beginning to distinguish itself not just from Paganism but also Judaism and Christianity by emphasizing a model of nation based on Abraham. The membership of the &quot;ummah&quot; was now based on two main principles; the first is to worship God alone and secondly, in order to worship God properly one must be in a guided nation. The essentials of the new society were the new relations between human beings and God and between human beings and one another. The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden. Muhammad&#x27;s nation was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.

<doc id="202447" wikidata="Q209253" url="?curid=202447" title="Satay">
<text>Satay ( , in the US also ), or sate in Indonesia, is a Javanese dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. Satay originated in Java, but has spread throughout Indonesia, into Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and beyond.

Indonesian satay is often served with peanut sauce and kecap manis ‚Äì a sweet soy sauce, and is often accompanied with ketupat or lontong, a type of rice cake, though the diversity of the country has produced a wide variety of satay recipes. It is also popular in many other Southeast Asian countries including Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It also recognized and popular in Suriname and the Netherlands.
 In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.

Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu; bamboo skewers are often used, while rustic style of preparations employ skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond. The meat is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, then served with various spicy seasonings. Satay can be served in various sauces; however, most often they are served in a combination of soy and peanut sauce, causing the sauce alone to often be referred to as &quot;satay&quot;. 

The national dish of Indonesia, satay is popular as street food, found in restaurants, and at traditional celebration feasts. Close analogues are yakitori from Japan, k«éor√≤u chu√†n from China, seekh kebab from India, shish kebab from Turkey and the Middle East, shashlik from the Caucasus, and sosatie from South Africa. It is listed at number 14 on &quot;World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods&quot; readers&#x27; poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011.

==History==
Satay may have been developed by Javanese street vendors as an adaptation of kebabs from the Indian Subcontinent. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as and based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century. The Indonesian publication &quot;Koran Jakarta&quot; claimed that &quot;sate&quot;, and ultimately satay, originated from Javanese term &quot;sak beteng&quot; which means one stick, and that the dish had existed as early as the 15th century.

From Java, satay spread through the Indonesian Archipelago and, as a consequence, numerous variations of the dish have been developed. By the late-19th century, satay had crossed the Strait of Malacca into neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. In the 19th century, the term migrated, presumably with Malay immigrants from the Dutch East Indies, to South Africa, where it is known as . The Indo Dutch people took this dish, as well as many other Indonesian specialties, to the Netherlands, thereby influencing Dutch cuisine.

===Name===
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the English word &quot;satay&quot; is derived from the Malay word , also or in Indonesian, ultimately originating from Tamil (, a regional variant of meaning &#x27;flesh&#x27;. The term is mentioned as &quot;sat√©&quot; in Dutch with one of earliest photographs of satay seller appeared circa 1870 in Java, Dutch East Indies. The usage in English was first attested in 1917 with reference to a &quot;&quot; seller in Singapore, later a mention of in Denpasar, Bali appeared in 1937, with a description of Malays cooking &quot;satay&quot; appearing in 1955.

==Preparation==

Chicken is the most common meat used in satay, with other common choices including lamb, goat, mutton, beef, venison, and rabbit; seafood such as fish, shrimp, and squid; offal such as liver, intestine, and tripe, is also used. Most satay is made by cutting the meat into small thumb-size cubes, however, such recipes as Ponorogo use a single finger-like chicken fillet. 

The skewers used for chicken satay are traditionally made from &quot;lidi&quot;, a midrib of coconut fronds. Bamboo skewers might be used instead. For firmer meats, such as lamb, goat, and beef, a thicker bamboo skewer is used. The skewers are usually soaked in water before using to avoid burning during grilling. Each skewer usually holds three or four pieces of meat. A goat meat satay might insert a cube of fat between meat cubes. Turmeric gives the dish its characteristic yellow colour. Another popular marinade is &quot;kecap manis&quot; (sweet soy sauce) mixed with coconut oil or palm margarine. The skewered meat is seasoned, marinated, and then grilled on charcoal embers.

Satay may be served with a spicy peanut sauce dip, or peanut gravy, served with slices of &quot;lontong&quot; or &quot;ketupat&quot; (rice cakes), garnished with a sprinkle of &quot;bawang goreng&quot; (crisp fried shallot), and accompanied by &quot;acar&quot; (pickles) consisting of slivers of onions, carrots, and cucumbers in vinegar, salt, and sugar solution. Mutton satay is usually served with kecap manis instead of peanut sauce. Pork satay can be served in a pineapple-based satay sauce or cucumber relish.

==Availability in Indonesia==
Satay can be prepared home-made or acquired from satay sellers; either from fancy restaurants, modest tarp-tent &quot;warung&quot; eateries stationed on busy street side, to travelling food vendors frequenting residential areas. Indeed, satay is possibly one of the most popular street food in Southeast Asia; common in Indonesia to Malaysia and Thailand.
In Indonesia, traditionally there are several methods on selling satay. They are:
*Pikulan: In Indonesian, &quot;pikulan&quot; means carrying items by balancing a rod on one&#x27;s shoulder. The most traditional way of selling satay was depicted in early photographs of Java in the late 19th century, showing the travelling satay vendor using this &quot;pikulan&quot; which resembles two small wooden cabinets carried with a rod made of either bamboo, wood, or rattan.
*Sunggi: In Javanese, &quot;sunggi&quot; means carrying things upon one&#x27;s head using some kind of tray or platter. This practice is quite common in today&#x27;s Bali and rural Java. The &quot;sunggi&quot; satay vendors‚Äîusually women‚Äîcarry raw satays, lontongs, peanut sauce upon the wooden or wicker bamboo tray on their head, while carrying basket containing grill, charcoal, bamboo fan, sweet soy sauce bottle, and wooden small short chair called &quot;dingklik&quot;. The satay seller ladies may walk through residential areas or position their wares in busy areas (e.g. marketplace or tourism area), and grill the satay to their customer&#x27;s order.
*Gerobak: In Indonesian, &quot;gerobak&quot; means wheeled cart. It is one of the common method of selling satay by travelling vendors. The Madura satay vendor cart usually has unique boat-like shape &quot;gerobak&quot; food cart.
*Warung: In Indonesian, &quot;warung&quot; means modest shop, selling foods or other things. The most common satay &quot;warung&quot; usually are &quot;warung tenda&quot;, modest tarp-tent shop stationed in busy street side to await customers.
*Online satay: In recent years with the advent of digital multi-service method that includes food delivery such as GoFood and GrabFood, satay is available by ordering online, and the food immediately delivered by motorcycle taxi called &quot;ojek&quot;.

In Indonesia, there are some restaurants that specialise in serving various kinds of satay and presenting them as their specialties, such as Sate Ponorogo Restaurant, Sate Blora Restaurant, and also chains of Sate Khas Senayan restaurants, previously known as Satay House Senayan.

===Malaysia===
Known as &quot;sate&quot; in Malay (and pronounced similarly to the English &quot;satay&quot;), it can be found throughout all the states of Malaysia in restaurants and on the street, with hawkers selling satay in food courts and Pasar malam. While the popular kinds of satay are usually beef and chicken satays, different regions of Malaysia have developed their own unique variations. Sate is often associated with Muslim Malays, but pork sate is also available at non-halal Chinese eating establishments.

There are a number of well-known satay outlets in Kajang, a city in Selangor closely associated with satays. &quot;Sate Kajang&quot; is a generic name for a style of sate where the meat chunks are bigger than normal, and the sweet peanut sauce served along with a portion of fried chilli paste. Given its popularity, sate Kajang is now found throughout Malaysia. Stalls and restaurants around Kajang offer not only the more traditional chicken or beef satay, but also more exotic meats such as venison, rabbit or fish, as well as gizzard, liver, and a number of other variations.

Another type of meat satay is the &quot;sate lok-lok&quot; from Penang and &quot;sate celup&quot; (dip satay) from Malacca. Both are Malaysian Chinese fusions of the hotpot and the Malay satay. Pieces of raw meat, tofu, century eggs, quail eggs, fish cake, offal or vegetables are skewered on bamboo sticks. These are cooked by being dipped in boiling water or stock. The satay is then eaten with a sweet, dark sauce, sometimes with chilli sauce as an accompaniment. If the satay is eaten with satay sauce, it is called sate lok-lok. If the satay is cooked with boiling satay peanut sauce, it is called sate celup. Both dishes are available from street vendors or in certain restaurants, and the majority are not halal. Customers use a common container containing boiling stock to personally cook their satay. Sauces are either served in common containers or individually. There are usually no tables near street vendors, and customers thus tend to gather around the food cart.

Satay gula apong is a chicken or buffalo meat satay. It is a satay made with rare nipah palm sugar called sarawak gula apong. This rare satay can only be found in Linggi, Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. It is served with sliced fresh cucumber and peanut sauce.

===Netherlands===

Known as &quot;sat√©&quot; or &quot;sateh&quot;, it is fully adapted in Dutch everyday cuisine. Owed to their shared colonial history, satay is an Indonesian food that has become an integral part of Dutch cuisine. Pork and chicken satays are almost solely served with spicy peanut sauce and called &quot;een sateetje&quot;, and are readily available in snackbars and supermarkets. Versions with goat-meat (&quot;sateh kambing&quot;) and sweet soy sauce are available in Indonesian restaurants and take-aways. Pork or chicken satay in peanut sauce, with salad and French-fries, is popular in pubs or &quot;eetcaf√©s&quot;. With Indonesian take-away meals like &quot;nasi goreng speciaal&quot;, the special part is often a couple of sate-sticks. Another favourite in Dutch snackbars is the &quot;sat√©kroket&quot;, a croquette made with a peanut sauce and shredded meat ragout. In addition, &#x27;sat√©&#x27; sauce or peanut sauce has become one of the standard options as a condiment to accompany a portion of fries bought in a snackbar (besides mayonnaise, ketchup, curry-ketchup, &#x27;joppiesaus&#x27; or a combination). Fries with satay sauce is commonly known as &quot;patatje pinda&quot; (&#x27;fries peanut&#x27;) and fries with satay sauce, mayonaise and chopped unions is called &quot;patatje oorlog&quot; (&#x27;fries war&#x27;).

===Philippines===

Satay proper is known as &quot;satti&quot; in the Southern Philippines (Mindanao). It is common in the regions of Zamboanga, Sulu Archipelago and Tawi-Tawi, which acquired satay from its proximity to Malaysia. &quot;Satti&quot; usually only has three small strips of roasted meat on a stick. &quot;Satti&quot; is usually made from chicken or beef among Muslim Filipinos, but it can also be made with pork or liver. It is particularly popular in Tausug cuisine and is commonly eaten as breakfast in restaurants which specialise in &quot;satti&quot;. It is typically served with &quot;ta&#x27;mu&quot; (&quot;pus√¥&quot; in other Philippine languages) and a bowlful of warm peanut-based sauce.

In the majority of the Philippines, a similar (but native) dish to satay usually made with pork or chicken is referred to as inihaw or inasal, or by the generic English name &quot;barbecue&quot; (usually shortened to &quot;BBQ&quot;). It is usually served glazed in a sweet-soy sauce marinade reminiscent of yakitori. Despite the native origins of inasal and inihaw, the English association of &quot;barbecue&quot; is the source of names for other popular street foods that are also served skewered, such as banana cue (&quot;banana&quot; + &quot;barbecue&quot;) and camote cue (&quot;&quot;camote&quot; (sweet potato) + barbecue&quot;).

Offal-based versions of inihaw are also commonly sold in the Philippines as street food. The most popular are made from chicken or pork intestines known as &quot;isaw&quot;. Other variants use liver, tripe, lungs, chicken heads and feet, cubes of coagulated pork blood, and pork ears, among others.

Annatto seeds and banana ketchup-based sauces are also widely used which gives the meat a vibrant orange or red color.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, satay is sold by Chinese, Malay and Indian Muslim vendors. It is thought to have originated in Java and brought to Singapore by Muslim traders. Satay is one of the earliest foods that became ubiquitous in Singapore since the 1940s, and was considered a celebratory food. Previously sold on makeshift roadside stalls and pushcarts, concerns over public health and the rapid development of the city led to a major consolidation of satay stalls at Beach Road in the 1950s, which came to be collectively called the &quot;Satay Club&quot;. They were moved to the Esplanade Park in the 1960s, where they grew to the point of being constantly listed in tourism guides.

Open only after dark with an open air or &quot;al fresco&quot; dining concept, the Satay Club defined how satay is served in Singapore since then, although they are also found across the island in most hawker stalls, modern food courts, and upscale restaurants at any time of the day. Moved several times around Esplanade Park due to development and land reclamation, the outlets finally left the area permanently to Clarke Quay in the late 1990s to make way for the building of the Esplanade ‚Äì Theatres on the Bay.

Several competing satay hotspots have since emerged. While the name has been transferred to the Clarke Quay site, several stalls from the original Satay club have moved to Sembawang in the north of the city. The satay stalls at the Lau Pa Sat area are notable for its popularity. &quot;Satay Street&quot; in Boon Tat Street, introduced in 1996, centers around 10 hawkers who sell satay. Served only at night after 7pm when the street is closed to vehicular traffic and the stalls and tables occupy the street, it mimics the open-air dining style of previous establishments. It is said to evoke the nostalgic feeling of Singaporean street food culture from the 1950s and 1960s, and is considered to be the last Satay Club in Singapore. Other notable outlets include Satay by the Bay at the Gardens by the Bay tourist attraction. It is styled after the old Satay Club.

Peanut sauce is used in Singaporean satays, Malay satay is quite similar to Indonesian satay by using &quot;kecap manis&quot; (sweet soy sauce), while Chinese Hainan satay uses pineapple pur√©e sauce and marinated in five-spice powder. The common types of satay sold in Singapore include &quot;Satay Ayam&quot; (chicken satay), &quot;Satay Lembu&quot; (beef satay), &quot;Satay Kambing&quot; (mutton satay), &quot;Satay Perut&quot; (beef intestine), and &quot;Satay Babat&quot; (beef tripe).

Singapore&#x27;s national carrier, Singapore Airlines, also serves satay to its First and Business Class (previously known as Raffles Class) passengers as an appetiser.

===Sri Lanka===
&quot;Sathe&quot; as it is known in Sri Lanka is a Sri Lankan Malay dish that has become a staple of the country&#x27;s diet. &quot;Sathe&quot; is served with peanut and chili sauce. It is sometimes called &quot;sate daging&quot; by the country&#x27;s Malay community.

===Thailand===

Satay (, , ) is a popular dish in Thailand; a key feature of Thai satay is the inclusion of pork as a meat option. Usually served with peanut sauce and &quot;achat&quot;, Thai satay have various recipes, beyond the popular versions of chicken, beef, and pork: a version made with mussels is called &quot;hoi malaeng phu&quot;, while vegetarian variants employ soy protein strips or tofu.

Satay can easily be found in virtually any Thai restaurant worldwide. Because Thai cuisine is heavily marketed internationally and attracted world culinary attention earlier than other Southeast Asian cuisines, there is a widespread misconception abroad that satay originated from Thailand. As a result, it is most frequently associated with Thai food in the Western world. For example, in the United States, satay is said to be one of America&#x27;s favourite Thai dishes.

The first satay restaurant in Thailand was in front of Chaloem Buri Theater near the Chaloem Buri Intersection in the Yaowarat neighborhood. Now it is on Rama IV Road near Lumphini MRT station and has been for more than 50 years.

===Fusion satay===

Traditionally, satay referred to any grilled skewered meats with various sauces; it is not necessarily served solely with peanut sauce. However, since the most popular variant of satay is chicken satay in peanut sauce (&quot;Sate Madura&quot; in Indonesia), in modern fusion cuisine the term &quot;satay&quot; has shifted to satay style peanut sauce instead.

For example, the fusion &quot;satay burger&quot; refers to beef hamburger served with so-called &quot;satay sauce&quot;, which is mainly a kind of sweet and spicy peanut sauce or often replaced with gloppy peanut butter. The Singapore satay bee hoon is actually rice vermicelli served in peanut sauce. The American-Thai fusion fish fillet in satay sauce also demonstrates the same trend. The fusion French cuisine &quot;Cuisses de Grenouilles Poelees au Satay, Chou-fleur Croquant&quot; is actually frog legs in peanut sauce. The Indomie instant noodle is also available in satay flavour, which is only the addition of peanut sauce in its packet. In Hong Kong, satay sauce is usually served with instant noodles and stir-fried beef. This dish is most often eaten for breakfast.

== In culture ==
Satay belongs to the informal ethnocultural symbols of Indonesia. Its appears on Indonesian postage stamps, in tourist brochures, information and advertising materials dedicated to this country, and is often played up by Indonesian participants in various cultural and entertainment events held abroad to create a national flavor. For example, the Indonesian model Aurra Kharisma performed in 2021 at the Miss Grand International beauty pageant in a suit with satay images and a headdress decorated with several bundles of satay meat skewers.

In some parts of Indonesia, certain types of satay are attributed with different symbolic meanings. Especially Bali stands out: the popular on this island satay lilit‚Äîminced sausages stuck on lemongrass stalks‚Äîis considered there a symbol of several virtues and benefits at once: male prowess, unity and prosperity. The Balinese attribute the embodiment of the weapons of various Hindu deities and mythological heroes to other local types of satay.

In Bandung, the West Java Governor&#x27;s office is popularly called Gedung Sate () to refer the satay-like pinnacle on its roof.

<text>Stavanger Airport (; ), commonly known simply as [[Sola, Norway|Sola]], is an international airport located in Rogaland county, Norway. The airport is located southwest of the centre of the city of Stavanger inside the neighboring municipality of Sola and serves the Stavanger, Sola, Sandnes area as well as serves as a regional hub for southwestern Norway. It is Norway&#x27;s third-busiest airport, with both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter traffic for the offshore North Sea oil installations. In addition, the Royal Norwegian Air Force operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters from Sola Air Station.

Five airlines offered domestic flights to nine destinations while ten airlines offered international flights to 37 destinations. Two helicopter companies operate out of Sola. The busiest route is Sola‚ÄìOslo Gardermoen, which has about 28 daily flights. In the vicinity of the airport there is an aeronautical museum, Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola.

== History ==

===Facilities===
Stavanger Airport, Sola is Norway&#x27;s oldest airport, opened by King Haakon VII on 29 May 1937. The airport was the second to have a concrete runway in Europe.

Originally, the idea was to locate the Stavanger airport at Forus in Stavanger Municipality, but after the war the Royal Norwegian Air Force decided to use Sola temporarily until the new airport was built, and nothing ever became of Forus.

Stavanger Airport has two passenger terminals, one for airplanes and one for helicopters. The old terminal was demolished and made way for taxiway H. The airport has two crossing runways: the main runway, north‚Äìsouth (18/36) and the main runway for helicopters, which is oriented northwest‚Äìsoutheast (10/28).

Expansion of the airplane terminal took place in 2009. The new gates were built without jetbridges. The airport&#x27;s two largest airlines, SAS and Norwegian, showed little interest in such amenity and desired quicker turnaround times. SAS though later said that they did want jetbridges for their larger jet aircraft, and only wanted gates without jetbridges for their smaller turboprop aircraft. The lack of jetbridges angered the societies representing the disabled and multiple sclerosis-afflicted, prompting several Rogaland politicians to put pressure on Avinor to reconsider the building. In April 2009, Avinor decided not to build jetbridges.

Offshore helicopter flights out of Stavanger commenced in 1966. Instead of operating out of Sola, the operator Helikopter Service decided to operate their services out of Stavanger Airport, Forus, a closed-down airport built during the Second World War. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s this became an increasingly problematic solution, not least due to increased development of the area. It eventually became inevitable to relocate the base to Sola. To allow for the transfer, the airport authority built a new, separate helicopter terminal at Sola, costing 56 million Norwegian kroner. It opened on 7 March 1989, at the same time as operations ceased out of Forus. At the same time Helikopter Service built an operations center at the airport, including a hangar and maintenance center. In total the relocation from Forus cost about 120 million kroner.
===Civilian airlines===
Det Norske Luftfartsselskap (DNL, later Scandinavian Airlines System or SAS) started flying to Sola after the war, as did Braathens SAFE in 1946 on its routes to Europe and the Far East with the Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In 1952, Braathens SAFE received concession to fly the routes Oslo‚ÄìStavanger, Oslo‚ÄìKristiansand‚ÄìStavanger and the coastal route Stavanger‚ÄìBergen‚Äì√Ölesund‚ÄìTrondheim‚ÄìBod√∏‚ÄìTroms√∏. Wider√∏e established itself at Sola in the late 1980s after they bought Sandefjord Airport, Torp-based Norsk Air. For a time, SAS operated intercontinental nonstop flights between Stavanger and Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) located in Texas in the U.S., with this service being operated by PrivatAir with Boeing 737-700 jetliners configured with 44 business class seats.

===Foreign airlines===
British Airways predecessors had started operating at Sola after World War II, in 1980 they started regular flights with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jet aircraft to London Heathrow Airport. Later, the route was operated with Boeing 737-200/-300/-400s. For a period the Boeing 737-400 morning flight continued to Paris‚ÄìCharles de Gaulle after London Heathrow as an extension of the flight. British Airways later started operating Boeing 757-200s with Boeing 737-200s flying new services twice daily to London‚ÄìGatwick. SAS Scandinavian Airlines operates 2 daily rotations to London Heathrow Airport, Norwegian operates a daily rotation to London, Gatwick. Dan-Air flew the route London‚ÄìGatwick ‚Äì Newcastle ‚Äì Stavanger, until they were taken over by British Airways in 1992. Norwegian Air Shuttle has flown to Newcastle as well. Eastern Airways operating Embraer ERJ-145 and ERJ-135 regional jets and Wider√∏e using Bombardier Dash-8-402Q (Q400) propjets both fly to Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

The oil industry has also required scheduled routes between Stavanger and Scotland, primarily to British oil center in Aberdeen. In addition to SAS, Air Anglia (later AirUK, KLMuk) flew the route. Today, this route is flown by Scandinavian Airlines, Wider√∏e and Eastern Airways. In the 1970s, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started flights to Stavanger from Amsterdam. They have used the Douglas DC-9-10, Boeing 737, Fokker 100, Fokker F27 and Fokker 50 aircraft, and this route was the first operated by KLM with Fokker 70s (their first Fokker 70 is named &quot;City of Stavanger&quot;). The route was operated by Braathens between 1997 and 2002.

Air France also operated to Stavanger, initially routing Paris‚ÄìCharles de Gaulle - Stavanger - Gothenburg using Boeing 737s. The route later became a twice-daily direct Paris - Stavanger connection using Embraer ERJ-170 jet aircraft, until it was discontinued in October 2015.

The Norwegian authorities have denied, among others, Northwest Airlines (since merged into Delta Air Lines) the right to start flying intercontinental flights from the United States. Lufthansa started in 2003 to fly twice daily to its hub in Frankfurt in Germany with the Canadair RJ-700 aircraft, but ceased flying the route in October 2015.

In 2005, work to upgrade the terminal building started. A new domestic arrival hall was opened in the summer of 2005, followed by the refurbishing of the international arrival hall. 

On 15 February 2010, Scandinavian Airlines announced that Wider√∏e would take over their regional routes connecting airports in Western Norway, including the route from Stavanger to Kristiansand. SAS will retire their five Fokker 50 aircraft by November 2010, and Wider√∏e will take over the operations and 75 employees, and serve the routes using Q300 and Q400 aircraft.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Stavanger Airport:

==Traffic and statistics==
==Sola Air Station==

The armed forces have a number of functions located at the airport. The 330 Squadron operated Sea King search and rescue helicopters are the only squadron left at the airport, but still a number of military aircraft can be seen at the airport. NATO&#x27;s AWACS aircraft, VIP transports, airlift command and fighter and attack aircraft are regular visitors. Technicians and equipment at the Sola AFB facilitate turnover and housing of fighters, predominately the RNoAF F-16A Fighting Falcons, as well as F-16s and other aircraft from NATO allies. Facilitating the Marines and Airforces training base, NATO FORSACS and NATO Joint Warfare Centre amongst others.

The Sola AFB is a NATO 24-hour readiness base for deployment of aircraft and military personnel in the event of a military escalated tension or conflict.

==Technical facilities==
Sola has a number of technical facilities, and has the largest aviation technical environment in Norway, including the largest helicopter maintenance facilities in Northern Europe, Braathens had its technical main base at Sola, as does Norwegian Air Shuttle, CHC Helikopter Service, Heli-One Norway, Bristow Norway, Norsk Helikopterservice, Norcopter, Pratt &amp; Whitney Norway Engine Centre and the air force&#x27;s helicopter main technical base. Heli-One (when part of Helikopter Service) had final assembly of most of the Bell 412 helicopters when introduced to the RNoAF. Both Bristow and Heli-One have their heavy duty maintenance facilities for their Sikorsky S-92A at the airport. Heli-One also specialises in the maintenance of the Turbomecca engines and the gearbox of the Super Puma. The airport also has the only Norwegian education school for aircraft mechanics, they are certified by Eurocopter qualifying them to make conversions of Eurocopter helicopters, they perform heavy duty maintenance tasks for many operators and air forces of foreign nations.

On 31 March 2012, the board of Pratt &amp; Whitney also decided to close the Pratt &amp; Whitney Norway Engine Center. The last engine left the shop on 20 June 2012. All 195 jobs were lost. Later Gulf Aero Services opened a new engine center in the same building complex under the company name Aero Gulf, delivering basically the same services as the former Pratt &amp; Whitney Norway Engine Center. As per June 2017 maintaining and servicing CFM56-3/7b/5b jet engines under the company name Aero Norway AS Quality Engines for a growing number of both domestic and international airlines.

==Runways==
The airport has two asphalt paved runways: the main runway 18/36 measures (Mark up, original 80 m wide, and runway 10/28 is although initially built 65 m wide. The two airstrips cross each other, but since they have a different orientation, they could never operate as individual runways for planes, but 10/28 is most commonly used as the activate helicopter runway, whilst 18/36 for planes, although the helicopters utilise the CATII on runway 18/36. 10/28 is used when the situation demands for it to serve as the main runway, typically when heavy winds from The Atlantic Ocean occurs, and landing in heavy gusts of crosswind makes it demanding to operate to and from 18/36. Although the orientation isn&#x27;t ideal for operating planes from both runways, they are both most commonly active at the same time, 18/36 for planes and 10/28 for helicopters operating from it, having to keep well within the bounds of their intersection allowing for helicopters to operate from 28 to taxiway H, and departure from 11 from taxiway H, utilising both directions for helicopters, hotel and to the outer edge. Runway 18‚Äì36 has a CAT II landing system, enabling landing in very poor visibility. 10/28 has no traditional instrument approaches such as ILS, and is less frequently used, among other considerations to reduce noise emissions and flying over built areas, catering for population living in central parts of Sola municipality. The runway does however have low RNP approaches to both runway 10 and 28.

==Accidents==
&quot;See 1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash.&quot;

On 9 August 1961 Vickers VC.1 Viking 3B (registration: G-AHPM), operated by Cunard Eagle Airways (later British Eagle) crashed into a mountain near Holta on approach to Stavanger Airport, Sola from London Heathrow airport with the deaths of all 39 on board: 3 crew, 34 schoolboys from The Archbishop Lanfranc School in Thornton Heath, London, plus two members of staff from the school. The Norwegian report on the incident concluded that the pilot was off-course for unknown reasons. The aircraft crashed into a hill approximately 500¬†m (1,600¬†ft) high, approximately north of the airport at about 16:23. The 50th anniversary was marked by a book published in summer 2011, &quot;The Lanfranc Boys&quot; by Rosalind Jones, sister of Quentin Green, one of the victims.

On 7 January 2020 a major fire broke out in the main parking garage, later found to have started from a vehicle with faulty wiring (2005 Opel Zafira) as the driver attempted to start the vehicle and it subsequently caught fire then quickly spread to nearby cars. The fire burned for nearly 7 hours, causing a partial collapse of the parking garage and destroying an estimated two to three hundred vehicles. An important factor that influenced the spread of the fire was a lack of a sprinkler system. No injuries or fatalities were reported.
