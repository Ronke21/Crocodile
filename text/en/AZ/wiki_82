<text>In Greek mythology, Perseus (, ; Greek: Περσεύς, translit. Perseús) is the legendary founder of the Perseid dynasty. He was, alongside Cadmus and Bellerophon, the greatest Greek hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Heracles. He beheaded the Gorgon Medusa for Polydectes and saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. He was the son of Zeus and the mortal Danaë, as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles (as they were both children of Zeus, and Heracles&#x27;s mother was descended from Perseus).

==Etymology==
Because of the obscurity of the name &quot;Perseus&quot; and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus&#x27;s native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. In that regard Graves proposed the only Greek derivation available: &quot;Perseus&quot; might be from the Greek verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;pérthein&quot;, &quot;to waste, ravage, sack, destroy&quot;) some form of which is familiar in Homeric epithets. According to Buck, the &quot;-eus&quot; suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, &quot;pers-&quot;. &quot;Pers-eus&quot; therefore is a &quot;sacker [of cities]&quot;; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.

The further origin of &quot;perth-&quot; is more obscure. Hofmann lists the possible root as &quot;*bher-&quot;, from which Latin &quot;ferio&quot;, &quot;strike&quot;. This corresponds to Pokorny&#x27;s &quot;*bher-&quot;(3), &quot;scrape, cut&quot;. Ordinarily &quot;*bh-&quot; descends to Greek as &quot;ph-&quot;. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the &quot;-th-&quot; in &quot;pérthein&quot;, which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative &quot;*phérthein&quot;. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the &quot;Perse-&quot; in Persephone, goddess of death. Ventris &amp; Chadwick speculate about a Mycenaean goddess &quot;pe-re-*82&quot; (Linear B: ), attested on and tentatively reconstructed as &quot;*Preswa&quot;.

A Greek folk etymology connected &quot;Perseus&quot; to the name of the Persian people, whom they called the &quot;Pérsai&quot; (from Old Persian &quot;Pārsa&quot; &quot;Persia, a Persian&quot;). However, the native name of the Persians – &quot;Pārsa&quot; in Persian – has always been pronounced with an &quot;-a-&quot;. Herodotus recounts this story, devising a foreign son of Andromeda and Perseus, Perses, from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently the Persians also knew that story, as Xerxes tried to use it to suborn the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.

== Mythology ==

===The Birth of Perseus===

King Acrisius of Argos had only one child, a daughter named Danaë. Disappointed by not having a male heir, Acrisius consulted the Oracle at Delphi, who warned him that he would one day be killed by his own grandson. To keep Danaë childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a room atop a bronze tower in the courtyard of his palace: This mytheme is also connected to Ares, Oenopion, Eurystheus, and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and fathered her child. Soon after, their child, a son, was born; Perseus-&quot;Perseus Eurymedon, for his mother gave him this name as well&quot;.

Fearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods and the Erinyes by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest. Danaë&#x27;s fearful prayer, made while afloat in the darkness, has been expressed by the poet Simonides of Ceos. Mother and child washed ashore on the island of Seriphos, where they were taken in by the fisherman Dictys (&quot;fishing net&quot;), who raised the boy to manhood. The brother of Dictys was Polydectes (&quot;he who receives/welcomes many&quot;), the king of the island.

===A Horrifying Wedding Gift===

When Perseus was growing up on the island of Seriphus, Polydectes came to lust for the beautiful Danaë. Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honorable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift. Polydectes requested that the guests bring horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of Hippodamia, daughter of Oinomaos. Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it. Polydectes held Perseus to his rash promise and demanded the snake-haired Medusa&#x27;s head.

===Overcoming Medusa===

Medusa and her two immortal older sisters, Stheno and Euryale, were Gorgons, monsters with snakes for hair, sharp fangs and claws, wings of gold, and gazes that turned people to stone.

Before setting out on his quest, Perseus prayed to the gods and Zeus answered by sending two of his other children – Hermes and Athena – to bless their half-brother with the weapons needed to defeat Medusa. Hermes gave Perseus his own pair of winged sandals to fly with and lent him his harpe sword to slay Medusa with, and Hades&#x27;s helm of darkness to become invisible with. Athena lent Perseus her polished shield for him to view Medusa&#x27;s reflection without becoming petrified, and gave him a &quot;kibisis&quot;, a knapsack to safely contain the Gorgon&#x27;s head which the goddess warned could still petrify even in death. Lastly, Athena instructed Perseus to seek out the Graeae, the Gorgons&#x27; sisters, for the snake-haired women&#x27;s whereabouts (in other versions, it was the Hesperides nymphs who gave Perseus the weapons after he sought out the Graeae).

Following Athena&#x27;s guidance, Perseus found the Graeae, who were three old swan-shaped witches sharing a single eye and a single tooth. As the witches passed their eye from one to another, Perseus snatched it from them, holding it for ransom in return for the Gorgons&#x27; location. The Graeae informed Perseus that the Gorgons lived on the Island of Sarpedon. Perseus then gave the Graeae their eye back and proceeded to the island.

On the Island of Sarpedon, Perseus came across a cave where Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa lay sleeping. Using Athena&#x27;s reflective shield, Perseus overcame the looking taboo by looking at her reflection on the shield to guide himself.He then walked into the cave backwards, safely observing and approaching the sleeping Gorgons. With Athena guiding the sword, Perseus beheaded Medusa. From Medusa&#x27;s neck sprang her two children with Poseidon: the winged horse Pegasus (&quot;he who sprang&quot;) and the giant Chrysaor (&quot;sword of gold&quot;). To avenge their sister&#x27;s death, Stheno and Euryale flew after Perseus, but he escaped them by wearing Hades&#x27;s invisibility helm. From here he proceeded to visit King Atlas who had refused him hospitality; in revenge Perseus petrified him with Medusa&#x27;s head and King Atlas became the Atlas mountains.

===Marriage to Andromeda===

On the way back to Seriphos, Perseus stopped in the kingdom of Aethiopia. This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, drew the vengeance of Poseidon, who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, Cetus, which destroyed man and beast. The oracle of Ammon announced that no relief would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore. Wearing the winged sandals given to him by Hermes, Perseus reached Andromeda and used the harpe to behead the monster (in other versions, Perseus used Medusa&#x27;s head to petrify Cetus). By rescuing Andromeda, Perseus claimed her in marriage.

Perseus married Andromeda in spite of Phineus, to whom she had been previously engaged. At the wedding, a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was petrified by the sight of Medusa&#x27;s head. Andromeda (&quot;queen of men&quot;) followed her husband to Tiryns in Argos, and became the ancestress of the family of the Perseidae who ruled at Tiryns through her son with Perseus, Perses. After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia. Sophocles and Euripides (and in more modern times Pierre Corneille) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.

As Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of Libya, according to Apollonius of Rhodes, the falling drops of Medusa&#x27;s blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut Mopsus. Upon returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa&#x27;s head, and made Dictys the new king of Seriphos.

===Prophecy fulfilled===
Perseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa&#x27;s head as a votive gift to Athena, who set it on her aegis (which Zeus gave her) as the &quot;Gorgoneion&quot;. The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In Pausanias he did not return to Argos, but went instead to Larissa, where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the quoit and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius&#x27;s actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.

In the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson&#x27;s approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in Pelasgiotis (Thessaly). There Teutamides, king of Larissa, was holding funeral games for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus&#x27;s throw veered-and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition, Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother Proetus. Perseus petrified the brother with Medusa&#x27;s head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon&#x27;s head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

Having killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to Megapenthes (&quot;great mourning&quot;), son of Proetus, and took over Megapenthes&#x27;s kingdom of Tiryns. The story is related in Pausanias, who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.

===King of Mycenae===
The two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus—for the Greeks considered him an authentic historical figure—are Pausanias and the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. Pausanias asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae as his capital. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called &quot;Persea&quot;. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel&#x27;s underground cistern. He states also that Atreus stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why Heinrich Schliemann named the largest tholos tomb the Treasury of Atreus.

Apart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named &quot;myces&quot;) at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of Inachus, mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the &quot;Megalai Ehoiai&quot;. For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus &quot;fortified&quot; Mycenae according to Apollodorus along with Midea, an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.

===&quot;Suda&quot;===
According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Perseus, after he married Andromeda, founded a city and called it Amandra (Ἄμανδραν). In the city there was a stele depicting the Gorgon. The city later changed the name to Ikonion because it had the depiction (ἀπεικόνισμα) of the Gorgon. Then he fought the Isaurians and the Cilicians and founded the city of Tarsus because an oracle told him to found a city in the place where after the victory, the flat (ταρσός) of his foot will touch the earth while he is dismounting from his horse. Then he conquered the Medes and changed the name of the country to Persia. At Persia, he taught the magi about the Gorgon and, when a fireball fell from the sky, he took the fire and gave it to the people to guard and revere it.
Later, during a war, he tried to use Medusa&#x27;s head again, but because he was old and could not see well, the head did not work. Because he thought that it was useless, he turned it toward himself and he died. Later his son Merros (Μέρρος) burned the head.


==Descendants==
Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon, and Cynurus, and two daughters, Gorgophone and Autochthe. Perses was left in Aethiopia and was believed to have been an ancestor of the Persians. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from Electryon to Eurystheus, after whom Atreus got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, Heracles, stepson of Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.

A statement by the Athenian orator Isocrates helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, Electryon, Alcmena, and Heracles, who was a contemporary of Eurystheus. Atreus was one generation later, a total of five generations.

==On Pegasus==
The replacement of Bellerophon as the tamer and rider of Pegasus by the more familiar culture hero Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the Renaissance. The transition was a development of Classical times which became the standard image during the Middle Ages and has been adopted by the European poets of the Renaissance and later: Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Genealogia deorum gentilium libri&quot; (10.27) identifies Pegasus as the steed of Perseus, and Pierre Corneille places Perseus upon Pegasus in &quot;Andromède&quot;. Various modern representations of Pegasus depict the winged horse with Perseus, including the fantasy film &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; and its 2010 remake.

==Argive genealogy in Greek mythology==
== Perseus constellation ==
Perseus has a constellation named after him. The legend says that because he was so brave fighting Cetus for someone else he was given a place in the stars forever. It is located in the east in the winter at about the Latitude 10-N. It is not far from the stars Betelgeuse and Sirius; his wife&#x27;s constellation Andromeda is also nearby. It is southward from Cassiopeia, and to the left of Taurus. His constellation contains the most famous variable star Algol and some deep sky objects such as Messier 34, the Double Cluster, the California Nebula, and the Little Dumbbell Nebula (Messier 76). There are eight named stars in the constellation Algol, Atik, Berehinya, Menkib, Miram, Mirfak, Misam, and Muspelheim. It was cataloged in the 2nd century by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy and is known for the famous Perseid Meteor Shower. There is in fact a whole family of constellations based on the myth of Perseus, which includes Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cetus. There is also a molecular cloud in the constellation that is 600 light years from our solar system. There is also a cluster of galaxies called the Perseus cluster. There is one galaxy in the cluster named Caldwell 24 which is a powerful source for radio and X-ray waves. It has a visual magnitude of 12.6 and is 237 million light years away from the Milky Way galaxy.

<text>Open Firmware is a standard defining the interfaces of a computer firmware system, formerly endorsed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It originated at Sun Microsystems where it was known as OpenBoot, and has been used by multiple vendors including Sun, Apple, IBM and ARM.

Open Firmware allows a system to load platform-independent drivers directly from a PCI device, improving compatibility.

Open Firmware may be accessed through its command line interface, which uses the Forth programming language.

== History ==

Open Firmware was described by IEEE standard as &quot;IEEE 1275-1994&quot;. This standard was not reaffirmed by the Open Firmware Working Group (OFWG) since 1998, and was therefore officially withdrawn by IEEE in May 2005.

== Features ==

Open Firmware defines a standard way to describe the hardware configuration of a system, called the &quot;device tree&quot;. This helps the operating system to better understand the configuration of the host computer, relying less on user configuration and hardware polling. For example, Open Firmware is essential for reliably identifying slave I2C devices like temperature sensors for hardware monitoring, whereas the alternative solution of performing a blind probe of the I2C bus, as has to be done by software like lm_sensors on generic hardware, is known to result in serious hardware issues under certain circumstances.

Open Firmware Forth Code may be compiled into FCode, a bytecode which is independent of instruction set architecture. A PCI card may include a program, compiled to FCode, which runs on any Open Firmware system. In this way, it can provide boot-time diagnostics, configuration code, and device drivers. FCode is also very compact, so that a disk driver may require only one or two kilobytes. Therefore, many of the same I/O cards can be used on Sun systems and Macintoshes that used Open Firmware. FCode implements ANS Forth and a subset of the Open Firmware library.

Being based upon an interactive programming language, Open Firmware can be used to efficiently test and bring up new hardware. It allows drivers to be written and tested interactively. Operational video and mouse drivers are the only prerequisite for a graphical interface suitable for end-user diagnostics. Apple shipped such a diagnostic &quot;operating system&quot; in many Power Macintoshes. Sun also shipped an FCode-based diagnostic tool suite called OpenBoot Diagnostics (OBDiag) used by customer service support and hardware manufacturing teams

== Implementations and licensing ==

Several commercial implementations of Open Firmware have been released to the Open Source community since 2006, including Sun OpenBoot, Firmworks OpenFirmware and Codegen SmartFirmware. The source code is available from the OpenBIOS project. Sun&#x27;s implementation is available under a BSD license.

<doc id="209455" wikidata="Q337889" url="?curid=209455" title="Thylakoid">
<text>Thylakoids are membrane-bound compartments inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. They are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Thylakoids consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana (singular: &quot;granum&quot;). Grana are connected by intergranal or stromal thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.

In thylakoid membranes, chlorophyll pigments are found in packets called quantasomes. Each quantasome contains 230 to 250 chlorophyll molecules.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Thylakoid&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;thylakos&quot; or &quot;θύλακος&quot;, meaning &quot;sac&quot; or &quot;pouch&quot;. Thus, &quot;thylakoid&quot; means &quot;sac-like&quot; or &quot;pouch-like&quot;.

==Structure==


Thylakoids are membrane-bound structures embedded in the chloroplast stroma. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum and resembles a stack of coins.

===Membrane===
The thylakoid membrane is the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis with the photosynthetic pigments embedded directly in the membrane. It is an alternating pattern of dark and light bands measuring each 1 nanometre. The thylakoid lipid bilayer shares characteristic features with prokaryotic membranes and the inner chloroplast membrane. For example, acidic lipids can be found in thylakoid membranes, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria and are involved in the functional integrity of the photosystems. The thylakoid membranes of higher plants are composed primarily of phospholipids and galactolipids that are asymmetrically arranged along and across the membranes. Thylakoid membranes are richer in galactolipids rather than phospholipids; also they predominantly consist of hexagonal phase II forming monogalacotosyl diglyceride lipid. Despite this unique composition, plant thylakoid membranes have been shown to assume largely lipid-bilayer dynamic organization. Lipids forming the thylakoid membranes, richest in high-fluidity linolenic acid are synthesized in a complex pathway involving exchange of lipid precursors between the endoplasmic reticulum and inner membrane of the plastid envelope and transported from the inner membrane to the thylakoids via vesicles.

===Lumen===
The thylakoid lumen is a continuous aqueous phase enclosed by the thylakoid membrane. It plays an important role for photophosphorylation during photosynthesis. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.

===Granum and stroma lamellae===
In higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A granum (plural grana) is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or lamellae. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts&#x27; large surface area to volume ratio. A recent electron tomography study of the thylakoid membranes has shown that the stroma lamellae are organized in wide sheets perpendicular to the grana stack axis and form multiple right-handed helical surfaces at the granal interface. Left-handed helical surfaces consolidate between the right-handed helices and sheets. This complex network of alternating helical membrane surfaces of different radii and pitch was shown to minimize the surface and bending energies of the membranes. This new model, the most extensive one generated to date, revealed that features from two, seemingly contradictory, older models coexist in the structure. Notably, similar arrangements of helical elements of alternating handedness, often referred to as &quot;parking garage&quot; structures, were proposed to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum and in ultradense nuclear matter. This structural organization may constitute a fundamental geometry for connecting between densely packed layers or sheets.

==Formation==
Chloroplasts develop from proplastids when seedlings emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into etioplasts that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo etiolation. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting to the death of the plant.

Thylakoid formation requires the action of &quot;vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1&quot; (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane. It is conserved in all organisms containing thylakoids, including cyanobacteria, green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, and higher plants, such as &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;.

==Isolation and fractionation==
Thylakoids can be purified from plant cells using a combination of differential and gradient centrifugation. Disruption of isolated thylakoids, for example by mechanical shearing, releases the lumenal fraction. Peripheral and integral membrane fractions can be extracted from the remaining membrane fraction. Treatment with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) detaches peripheral membrane proteins, whereas treatment with detergents and organic solvents solubilizes integral membrane proteins.

==Proteins==

Thylakoids contain many integral and peripheral membrane proteins, as well as lumenal proteins. Recent proteomics studies of thylakoid fractions have provided further details on the protein composition of the thylakoids. These data have been summarized in several plastid protein databases that are available online.

According to these studies, the thylakoid proteome consists of at least 335 different proteins. Out of these, 89 are in the lumen, 116 are integral membrane proteins, 62 are peripheral proteins on the stroma side, and 68 peripheral proteins on the lumenal side. Additional low-abundance lumenal proteins can be predicted through computational methods. Of the thylakoid proteins with known functions, 42% are involved in photosynthesis.

===Integral membrane proteins===
Thylakoid membranes contain integral membrane proteins which play an important role in light-harvesting and the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:
*Photosystems I and II
*Cytochrome b6f complex
*ATP synthase

Photosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.

Together, these proteins make use of light energy to drive electron transport chains that generate a chemiosmotic potential across the thylakoid membrane and NADPH, a product of the terminal redox reaction. The ATP synthase uses the chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation.

====Photosystems====

These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an antenna complex that uses chlorophylls and accessory photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules at the reaction center absorb energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. Photosystem I contains a pair of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules, designated P700, at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700 nm light. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll that absorbs 680 nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the visible spectrum). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center. This is the green pigment present in plants that is not visible to unaided eyes.

====Cytochrome b6f complex====

The cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.

====ATP synthase====

The thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into the stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.

===Lumen proteins===
The electron transport protein plastocyanin is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.

The lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the oxygen evolving complex associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.

Lumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the Tat signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.

===Protein expression===
Chloroplasts have their own genome, which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial endosymbiotic ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the cell nucleus took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper stoichiometry and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, transcription of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by light. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by phosphorylation via redox-sensitive kinases in the thylakoid membranes. The translation rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis). This mechanism involves negative feedback through binding of excess protein to the 5&#x27; untranslated region of the chloroplast mRNA. Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain. The redox state of the electron carrier plastoquinone in the thylakoid membrane directly affects the transcription of chloroplast genes encoding proteins of the reaction centers of the photosystems, thus counteracting imbalances in the electron transfer chain.

===Protein targeting to the thylakoids===

Thylakoid proteins are targeted to their destination via signal peptides and prokaryotic-type secretory pathways inside the chloroplast. Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant&#x27;s nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of the outer and inner membrane (Toc and Tic) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the Tat-dependent pathway (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in the figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as an energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin arginine motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.

==Function==

The thylakoids are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These include light-driven water oxidation and oxygen evolution, the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.

===Water photolysis===

The first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O2 that is vital for cellular respiration. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.

===Electron transport chains===

Two different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:
*Noncyclic electron transport or non-cyclic photophosphorylation produces NADPH + H+ and ATP.
*Cyclic electron transport or cyclic photophosphorylation produces only ATP.

The noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.

*Photosystem I uses light energy to reduce NADP+ to NADPH + H+, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.
*Photosystem II uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e−), protons (H+), and molecular oxygen (O2), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H2O (O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e−) and exiting with NADP+ when it is finally reduced to NADPH.

===Chemiosmosis===

A major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron&#x27;s energy to actively transport protons from the stroma to the lumen. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes acidic, as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma. This represents a 10,000 fold concentration gradient for protons across the thylakoid membrane.

====Source of proton gradient====
The protons in the lumen come from three primary sources.
*Photolysis by photosystem II oxidises water to oxygen, protons and electrons in the lumen.
*The transfer of electrons from photosystem II to plastoquinone during non-cyclic electron transport consumes two protons from the stroma. These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.
*The reduction of plastoquinone by ferredoxin during cyclic electron transport also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.
The proton gradient is also caused by the consumption of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.

====ATP generation====
The molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the proton motive force (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the chemical potential of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane electrical potential (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.

==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==

Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems. Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of photosynthesis and respiration reside. The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among bacteria. Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system. The outer membrane, plasma membrane, and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell. Understanding the organization, functionality, protein composition, and dynamics of the membrane systems remains a great challenge in cyanobacterial cell biology.

In contrast to the thylakoid network of higher plants, which is differentiated into grana and stroma lamellae, the thylakoids in cyanobacteria are organized into multiple concentric shells that split and fuse to parallel layers forming a highly connected network. This results in a continuous network that encloses a single lumen (as in higher‐plant chloroplasts) and allows water‐soluble and lipid‐soluble molecules to diffuse through the entire membrane network. Moreover, perforations are often observed within the parallel thylakoid sheets. These gaps in the membrane allow for the traffic of particles of different sizes throughout the cell, including ribosomes, glycogen granules, and lipid bodies. The relatively large distance between the thylakoids provides space for the external light-harvesting antennae, the phycobilisomes. This macrostructure, as in the case of higher plants, shows some flexibility during changes in the physicochemical environment. Thylakoid mambranes in cyanobacteria have a variety of different spatial distributions which are characteristic of different species, and these distributions have in the past been used to infer taxonomic relationships between species, but DNA evidence suggests that the type of spatial distribution does not reliably reflect taxonomic relationships between species.

<text>Honington is a village and civil parish located in Bardwell Ward and Pakenham and Troston Wards of West Suffolk District Council, Suffolk in eastern England It is near to the border with Norfolk. It lies on the River Black Bourn, about 8 miles (13 km) from Bury St Edmunds and 6 miles (10 km) from Thetford, Norfolk. Much of the farmland belongs to the estate of the Duke of Grafton. The village is known for its RAF station, RAF Honington. It is also near two joint RAF/USAF airfields: RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. Honington was the birthplace of the poet Robert Bloomfield. In 2011 the parish had a population of 1472.

==Position==
Honington is bordered to the north-east by Sapiston, to the north-west by Fakenham Magna, to the north by Euston, to the east by Bardwell, to the south-west by Troston, and to the south by Ixworth Thorpe.

==History==
The existence of the village is recorded in the Domesday Book. Before the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII in the late 1530s, the land in the village was held by the abbot of the great monastery at Bury St Edmunds.

The local lords of the manor were the dukes of Grafton in neighbouring Euston. The first Duke of Grafton, previously Earl of Euston, was Henry Fitzroy, the natural son of King Charles II by Countess of Castlemain. The third Duke of Grafton was briefly prime minister. The current Duke of Grafton is the 12th.

The village&#x27;s past residents include the pastoral poet Robert Bloomfield, born in Honington in 1766. His first and best known poem is &quot;The Farmers Boy&quot;. A biography of Bloomfield co-written by William Wickett, the headmaster of the village school at the time, was published in 1969. Bloomfield is buried at Shefford in Bedfordshire, where he spent the latter part of his life.

RAF Honington opened on 3 May 1937, as one of six operational airfields within No 3 Group Bomber Command. &quot;From Barren Rocks to Living Stones&quot; records that Honington was able to play a part in accommodating British evacuees from the terrorism in Aden in 1967. This was a major British operation at the time. In 1994 flying operations stopped and the Honington Air Traffic Control Zone ceased to exist in preparation for Honington becoming the depot of the RAF Regiment. The station now sees only very occasional air traffic. On one occasion in recent years the runway and ground facilities were borrowed by the USAF for a short period while work was carried out on the runway at the nearby RAF Lakenheath.

==Amenities==
The parishes of Sapiston and Honington were combined in 1972. Although the Grade I listed St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Sapiston, has been declared redundant, occasional services are still held there. All Saints&#x27; Church at Honington is one of eleven congregations in the Ixworth Deanery of the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich that make up the Blackbourne Team. The church itself is a Grade I listed building. A Church of England primary school founded in the 19th century operates in the village.

Honington has a public house, the &quot;Fox Inn&quot;.

==&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;==
This rural part of Suffolk proved to be an ideal location for the 1970s British TV show &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. In common with much of the surrounding area, Sapiston and Honington were used for part of the series, in particular the episode &quot;Things That Go Bump in the Night&quot;. The outside of the village school appeared as the church hall used for the Home Guard drill hall in a number of episodes.

The TV director, producer and writer David Croft, co-writer of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;, etc., lived at Honington Hall until his death at his Portuguese holiday home on 27 September 2011.

==Notable residents==
*Robert Bloomfield (1766-1823), labouring-class poet
*William Henry Bliss (1835-1909), scholar and clergyman
*F. P. Raynham (1893-1954), pilot from the early days of aviation

<doc id="209459" wikidata="Q21114084" url="?curid=209459" title="Alternative splicing">
<text>Alternative splicing, alternative RNA splicing, or differential splicing, is an alternative splicing process during gene expression that allows a single gene to produce different splice variants. For example, some exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from the final RNA product of the gene. This means the exons are joined in different combinations, leading to different splice variants. In the case of protein-coding genes, the proteins translated from these splice variants may contain differences in their amino acid sequence and in their biological functions (see Figure).

Biologically relevant alternative splicing occurs as a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes, where it increases the number of proteins that can be encoded by the genome. In humans, it is widely believed that ~95% of multi-exonic genes are alternatively spliced to produce functional alternative products from the same gene but many scientists believe that most of the observed splice variants are due to splicing errors and the actual number of biologically relevant alternatively spliced genes is much lower.

==Discovery==
Alternative splicing was first observed in 1977. The adenovirus produces five primary transcripts early in its infectious cycle, prior to viral DNA replication, and an additional one later, after DNA replication begins. The early primary transcripts continue to be produced after DNA replication begins. The additional primary transcript produced late in infection is large and comes from 5/6 of the 32kb adenovirus genome. This is much larger than any of the individual adenovirus mRNAs present in infected cells. Researchers found that the primary RNA transcript produced by adenovirus type 2 in the late phase was spliced in many different ways, resulting in mRNAs encoding different viral proteins. In addition, the primary transcript contained multiple polyadenylation sites, giving different 3&#x27; ends for the processed mRNAs.

In 1981, the first example of alternative splicing in a transcript from a normal, endogenous gene was characterized. The gene encoding the thyroid hormone calcitonin was found to be alternatively spliced in mammalian cells. The primary transcript from this gene contains 6 exons; the calcitonin mRNA contains exons 1–4, and terminates after a polyadenylation site in exon 4. Another mRNA is produced from this pre-mRNA by skipping exon 4, and includes exons 1–3, 5, and 6. It encodes a protein known as CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide). Examples of alternative splicing in immunoglobin gene transcripts in mammals were also observed in the early 1980s.

Since then, many other examples of biologically relevant alternative splicing have been found in eukaryotes. The &quot;record-holder&quot; for alternative splicing is a &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; gene called Dscam, which could potentially have 38,016 splice variants.

In 2021, it was discovered that the genome of adenovirus type 2, the adenovirus in which alternative splicing was first identified, was able to produce a much greater variety of splice variants than previously thought. By using next generation sequencing technology, researchers were able to update the human adenovirus type 2 transcriptome and document the presence of 904 splice variants produced by the virus through a complex pattern of alternative splicing. Very few of these splice variants have been shown to be functional, a point that the authors raise in their paper.
::&quot;An outstanding question is what roles the menagerie of novel RNAs play or whether they are spurious molecules generated by an overloaded splicing machinery.&quot;

==Modes==

Five basic modes of alternative splicing are generally recognized.
* Exon skipping or cassette exon: in this case, an exon may be spliced out of the primary transcript or retained. This is the most common mode in mammalian pre-mRNAs.
* Mutually exclusive exons: One of two exons is retained in mRNAs after splicing, but not both.
* Alternative donor site: An alternative 5&#x27; splice junction (donor site) is used, changing the 3&#x27; boundary of the upstream exon.
* Alternative acceptor site: An alternative 3&#x27; splice junction (acceptor site) is used, changing the 5&#x27; boundary of the downstream exon.
* Intron retention: A sequence may be spliced out as an intron or simply retained. This is distinguished from exon skipping because the retained sequence is not flanked by introns. If the retained intron is in the coding region, the intron must encode amino acids in frame with the neighboring exons, or a stop codon or a shift in the reading frame will cause the protein to be non-functional. This is the rarest mode in mammals but the most common in plants.

In addition to these primary modes of alternative splicing, there are two other main mechanisms by which different mRNAs may be generated from the same gene; multiple promoters and multiple polyadenylation sites. Use of multiple promoters is properly described as a transcriptional regulation mechanism rather than alternative splicing; by starting transcription at different points, transcripts with different 5&#x27;-most exons can be generated. At the other end, multiple polyadenylation sites provide different 3&#x27; end points for the transcript. Both of these mechanisms are found in combination with alternative splicing and provide additional variety in mRNAs derived from a gene. 

&lt;br&gt;These modes describe basic splicing mechanisms, but may be inadequate to describe complex splicing events. For instance, the figure to the right shows 3 spliceforms from the mouse hyaluronidase 3 gene. Comparing the exonic structure shown in the first line (green) with the one in the second line (yellow) shows intron retention, whereas the comparison between the second and the third spliceform (yellow vs. blue) exhibits exon skipping. A model nomenclature to uniquely designate all possible splicing patterns has recently been proposed.

==Mechanisms==

===General splicing mechanism===
When the pre-mRNA has been transcribed from the DNA, it includes several introns and exons. (In nematodes, the mean is 4–5 exons and introns; in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila&quot; there can be more than 100 introns and exons in one transcribed pre-mRNA.) The exons to be retained in the mRNA are determined during the splicing process. The regulation and selection of splice sites are done by trans-acting splicing activator and splicing repressor proteins as well as cis-acting elements within the pre-mRNA itself such as exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers.

The typical eukaryotic nuclear intron has consensus sequences defining important regions. Each intron has the sequence GU at its 5&#x27; end. Near the 3&#x27; end there is a branch site. The nucleotide at the branchpoint is always an A; the consensus around this sequence varies somewhat. In humans the branch site consensus sequence is yUnAy. The branch site is followed by a series of pyrimidines – the polypyrimidine tract – then by AG at the 3&#x27; end.

Splicing of mRNA is performed by an RNA and protein complex known as the spliceosome, containing snRNPs designated U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 (U3 is not involved in mRNA splicing). U1 binds to the 5&#x27; GU and U2, with the assistance of the U2AF protein factors, binds to the branchpoint A within the branch site. The complex at this stage is known as the spliceosome A complex. Formation of the A complex is usually the key step in determining the ends of the intron to be spliced out, and defining the ends of the exon to be retained. (The U nomenclature derives from their high uridine content).

The U4,U5,U6 complex binds, and U6 replaces the U1 position. U1 and U4 leave. The remaining complex then performs two transesterification reactions. In the first transesterification, 5&#x27; end of the intron is cleaved from the upstream exon and joined to the branch site A by a 2&#x27;,5&#x27;-phosphodiester linkage. In the second transesterification, the 3&#x27; end of the intron is cleaved from the downstream exon, and the two exons are joined by a phosphodiester bond. The intron is then released in lariat form and degraded.

===Regulatory elements and proteins===
Splicing is regulated by trans-acting proteins (repressors and activators) and corresponding cis-acting regulatory sites (silencers and enhancers) on the pre-mRNA. However, as part of the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of a splicing factor are frequently position-dependent. That is, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element in the context of an exon, and vice versa. The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor. Together, these elements form a &quot;splicing code&quot; that governs how splicing will occur under different cellular conditions.

There are two major types of cis-acting RNA sequence elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Splicing &quot;silencers&quot; are sites to which splicing repressor proteins bind, reducing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic splicing silencers, ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic splicing silencers, ESS). They vary in sequence, as well as in the types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of splicing repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Splicing &quot;enhancers&quot; are sites to which splicing activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic splicing enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic splicing enhancers, ESE). Most of the activator proteins that bind to ISEs and ESEs are members of the SR protein family. Such proteins contain RNA recognition motifs and arginine and serine-rich (RS) domains.

In general, the determinants of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on context, so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated form a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase the probability that a nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on context. The context within which regulatory elements act includes cis-acting context that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and trans-acting context that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish context. As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing silencers and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new silencers or disrupt existing enhancers.

===Examples===

====Exon skipping: &quot;Drosophila&quot; &quot;dsx&quot;====

Pre-mRNAs from the &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; gene &quot;dsx&quot; contain 6 exons. In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are joined to form the mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein required for male development. In females, exons 1,2,3, and 4 are joined, and a polyadenylation signal in exon 4 causes cleavage of the mRNA at that point. The resulting mRNA is a transcriptional regulatory protein required for female development.

This is an example of exon skipping. The intron upstream from exon 4 has a polypyrimidine tract that doesn&#x27;t match the consensus sequence well, so that U2AF proteins bind poorly to it without assistance from splicing activators. This 3&#x27; splice acceptor site is therefore not used in males. Females, however, produce the splicing activator Transformer (Tra) (see below). The SR protein Tra2 is produced in both sexes and binds to an ESE in exon 4; if Tra is present, it binds to Tra2 and, along with another SR protein, forms a complex that assists U2AF proteins in binding to the weak polypyrimidine tract. U2 is recruited to the associated branchpoint, and this leads to inclusion of exon 4 in the mRNA.

====Alternative acceptor sites: &quot;Drosophila&quot; &quot;&quot;====

Pre-mRNAs of the &quot;Transformer&quot; (Tra) gene of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; undergo alternative splicing via the alternative acceptor site mode. The gene Tra encodes a protein that is expressed only in females. The primary transcript of this gene contains an intron with two possible acceptor sites. In males, the upstream acceptor site is used. This causes a longer version of exon 2 to be included in the processed transcript, including an early stop codon. The resulting mRNA encodes a truncated protein product that is inactive. Females produce the master sex determination protein Sex lethal (Sxl). The Sxl protein is a splicing repressor that binds to an ISS in the RNA of the Tra transcript near the upstream acceptor site, preventing U2AF protein from binding to the polypyrimidine tract. This prevents the use of this junction, shifting the spliceosome binding to the downstream acceptor site. Splicing at this point bypasses the stop codon, which is excised as part of the intron. The resulting mRNA encodes an active Tra protein, which itself is a regulator of alternative splicing of other sex-related genes (see &quot;dsx&quot; above).

====Exon definition: Fas receptor====

Multiple isoforms of the Fas receptor protein are produced by alternative splicing. Two normally occurring isoforms in humans are produced by an exon-skipping mechanism. An mRNA including exon 6 encodes the membrane-bound form of the Fas receptor, which promotes apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Increased expression of Fas receptor in skin cells chronically exposed to the sun, and absence of expression in skin cancer cells, suggests that this mechanism may be important in elimination of pre-cancerous cells in humans. If exon 6 is skipped, the resulting mRNA encodes a soluble Fas protein that does not promote apoptosis. The inclusion or skipping of the exon depends on two antagonistic proteins, TIA-1 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB).
* The 5&#x27; donor site in the intron downstream from exon 6 in the pre-mRNA has a weak agreement with the consensus sequence, and is not bound usually by the U1 snRNP. If U1 does not bind, the exon is skipped (see &quot;a&quot; in accompanying figure).
* Binding of TIA-1 protein to an intronic splicing enhancer site stabilizes binding of the U1 snRNP. The resulting 5&#x27; donor site complex assists in binding of the splicing factor U2AF to the 3&#x27; splice site upstream of the exon, through a mechanism that is not yet known (see b).
* Exon 6 contains a pyrimidine-rich exonic splicing silencer, &quot;ure6&quot;, where PTB can bind. If PTB binds, it inhibits the effect of the 5&#x27; donor complex on the binding of U2AF to the acceptor site, resulting in exon skipping (see c).

This mechanism is an example of exon definition in splicing. A spliceosome assembles on an intron, and the snRNP subunits fold the RNA so that the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends of the intron are joined. However, recently studied examples such as this one show that there are also interactions between the ends of the exon. In this particular case, these exon definition interactions are necessary to allow the binding of core splicing factors prior to assembly of the spliceosomes on the two flanking introns.

====Repressor-activator competition: HIV-1 &quot;tat&quot; exon 2====
HIV, the retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different products that are required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the &quot;tat&quot; gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5&#x27; donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5&#x27; donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.

==Adaptive significance==

Genuine alternative splicing occurs in both protein-coding genes and non-coding genes to produce multiple products (proteins or non-coding RNAs). External information is needed in order to decide which product is made, given a DNA sequence and the initial transcript. Since the methods of regulation are inherited, this provides novel ways for mutations to affect gene expression.

Alternative splicing may provide evolutionary flexibility. A single point mutation may cause a given exon to be occasionally excluded or included from a transcript during splicing, allowing production of a new protein isoform without loss of the original protein. Studies have identified intrinsically disordered regions (see Intrinsically unstructured proteins) as enriched in the non-constitutive exons suggesting that protein isoforms may display functional diversity due to the alteration of functional modules within these regions. Such functional diversity achieved by isoforms is reflected by their expression patterns and can be predicted by machine learning approaches. Comparative studies indicate that alternative splicing preceded multicellularity in evolution, and suggest that this mechanism might have been co-opted to assist in the development of multicellular organisms.

Research based on the Human Genome Project and other genome sequencing has shown that humans have only about 30% more genes than the roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, and only about twice as many as the fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. This finding led to speculation that the perceived greater complexity of humans, or vertebrates generally, might be due to higher rates of alternative splicing in humans than are found in invertebrates. However, a study on samples of 100,000 expressed sequence tags (EST) each from human, mouse, rat, cow, fly (&quot;D. melanogaster&quot;), worm (&quot;C. elegans&quot;), and the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; found no large differences in frequency of alternatively spliced genes among humans and any of the other animals tested. Another study, however, proposed that these results were an artifact of the different numbers of ESTs available for the various organisms. When they compared alternative splicing frequencies in random subsets of genes from each organism, the authors concluded that vertebrates do have higher rates of alternative splicing than invertebrates.

==Disease==
Changes in the RNA processing machinery may lead to mis-splicing of multiple transcripts, while single-nucleotide alterations in splice sites or cis-acting splicing regulatory sites may lead to differences in splicing of a single gene, and thus in the mRNA produced from a mutant gene&#x27;s transcripts. A study in 2005 involving probabilistic analyses indicated that greater than 60% of human disease-causing mutations affect splicing rather than directly affecting coding sequences. A more recent study indicates that one-third of all hereditary diseases are likely to have a splicing component. Regardless of exact percentage, a number of splicing-related diseases do exist. As described below, a prominent example of splicing-related diseases is cancer.

Abnormally spliced mRNAs are also found in a high proportion of cancerous cells. Combined RNA-Seq and proteomics analyses have revealed striking differential expression
of splice isoforms of key proteins in important cancer pathways. It is not always clear whether such aberrant patterns of splicing contribute to the cancerous growth, or are merely consequence of cellular abnormalities associated with cancer. For certain types of cancer, like in colorectal and prostate, the number of splicing errors per cancer has been shown to vary greatly between individual cancers, a phenomenon referred to as transcriptome instability. Transcriptome instability has further been shown to correlate grealty with reduced expression level of splicing factor genes. Mutation of &quot;DNMT3A&quot; has been demonstrated to contribute to hematologic malignancies, and that &quot;DNMT3A&quot;-mutated cell lines exhibit transcriptome instability as compared to their isogenic wildtype counterparts.

In fact, there is actually a reduction of alternative splicing in cancerous cells compared to normal ones, and the types of splicing differ; for instance, cancerous cells show higher levels of intron retention than normal cells, but lower levels of exon skipping. Some of the differences in splicing in cancerous cells may be due to the high frequency of somatic mutations in splicing factor genes, and some may result from changes in phosphorylation of trans-acting splicing factors. Others may be produced by changes in the relative amounts of splicing factors produced; for instance, breast cancer cells have been shown to have increased levels of the splicing factor SF2/ASF. One study found that a relatively small percentage (383 out of over 26000) of alternative splicing variants were significantly higher in frequency in tumor cells than normal cells, suggesting that there is a limited set of genes which, when mis-spliced, contribute to tumor development. It is believed however that the deleterious effects of mis-spliced transcripts are usually safeguarded and eliminated by a cellular posttranscriptional quality control mechanism termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [NMD].

One example of a specific splicing variant associated with cancers is in one of the human DNMT genes. Three DNMT genes encode enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA, a modification that often has regulatory effects. Several abnormally spliced DNMT3B mRNAs are found in tumors and cancer cell lines. In two separate studies, expression of two of these abnormally spliced mRNAs in mammalian cells caused changes in the DNA methylation patterns in those cells. Cells with one of the abnormal mRNAs also grew twice as fast as control cells, indicating a direct contribution to tumor development by this product.

Another example is the &quot;Ron&quot; (&quot;MST1R&quot;) proto-oncogene. An important property of cancerous cells is their ability to move and invade normal tissue. Production of an abnormally spliced transcript of &quot;Ron&quot; has been found to be associated with increased levels of the SF2/ASF in breast cancer cells. The abnormal isoform of the Ron protein encoded by this mRNA leads to cell motility.

Overexpression of a truncated splice variant of the FOSB gene – ΔFosB – in a specific population of neurons in the nucleus accumbens has been identified as the causal mechanism involved in the induction and maintenance of an addiction to drugs and natural rewards.

Recent provocative studies point to a key function of chromatin structure and histone modifications in alternative splicing regulation. These insights suggest that epigenetic regulation determines not only what parts of the genome are expressed but also how they are spliced.

==Genome-scale (transcriptome-wide) analysis==
Transcriptome-wide analysis of alternative splicing is typically performed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. Most commonly, by short-read sequencing, such as by Illumina instrumentation. But even more informative, by long-read sequencing, such as by Nanopore or PacBio instrumentation. Transcriptome-wide analyses can for example be used to measure the amount of deviating alternative splicing, such as in a cancer cohort.

Deep sequencing technologies have been used to conduct genome-wide analyses of both unprocessed and processed mRNAs; thus providing insights into alternative splicing. For example, results from use of deep sequencing indicate that, in humans, an estimated 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, with a number of pre-mRNA transcripts spliced in a tissue-specific manner. Functional genomics and computational approaches based on multiple instance learning have also been developed to integrate RNA-seq data to predict functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. Deep sequencing has also aided in the &quot;in vivo&quot; detection of the transient lariats that are released during splicing, the determination of branch site sequences, and the large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts.

More historically, alternatively spliced transcripts have been found by comparing EST sequences, but this requires sequencing of very large numbers of ESTs. Most EST libraries come from a very limited number of tissues, so tissue-specific splice variants are likely to be missed in any case. High-throughput approaches to investigate splicing have, however, been developed, such as: DNA microarray-based analyses, RNA-binding assays, and deep sequencing. These methods can be used to screen for polymorphisms or mutations in or around splicing elements that affect protein binding. When combined with splicing assays, including &quot;in vivo&quot; reporter gene assays, the functional effects of polymorphisms or mutations on the splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts can then be analyzed.

In microarray analysis, arrays of DNA fragments representing individual exons (&quot;e.g.&quot; Affymetrix exon microarray) or exon/exon boundaries (&quot;e.g.&quot; arrays from ExonHit or Jivan) have been used. The array is then probed with labeled cDNA from tissues of interest. The probe cDNAs bind to DNA from the exons that are included in mRNAs in their tissue of origin, or to DNA from the boundary where two exons have been joined. This can reveal the presence of particular alternatively spliced mRNAs.

CLIP (Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) uses UV radiation to link proteins to RNA molecules in a tissue during splicing. A trans-acting splicing regulatory protein of interest is then precipitated using specific antibodies. When the RNA attached to that protein is isolated and cloned, it reveals the target sequences for that protein. Another method for identifying RNA-binding proteins and mapping their binding to pre-mRNA transcripts is &quot;Microarray Evaluation of Genomic Aptamers by shift (MEGAshift)&quot;.net This method involves an adaptation of the &quot;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX)&quot; method together with a microarray-based readout. Use of the MEGAshift method has provided insights into the regulation of alternative splicing by allowing for the identification of sequences in pre-mRNA transcripts surrounding alternatively spliced exons that mediate binding to different splicing factors, such as ASF/SF2 and PTB. This approach has also been used to aid in determining the relationship between RNA secondary structure and the binding of splicing factors.

Use of reporter assays makes it possible to find the splicing proteins involved in a specific alternative splicing event by constructing reporter genes that will express one of two different fluorescent proteins depending on the splicing reaction that occurs. This method has been used to isolate mutants affecting splicing and thus to identify novel splicing regulatory proteins inactivated in those mutants.

Recent advancements in protein structure prediction have facilitated the development of new tools for genome annotation and alternative splicing analysis. For instance, isoform.io, a platform guided by protein structure predictions, has evaluated hundreds of thousands of isoforms of human protein-coding genes assembled from numerous RNA sequencing experiments across a variety of human tissues. This comprehensive analysis has led to the identification of numerous isoforms with more confidently predicted structure and potentially superior function compared to canonical isoforms in the latest human gene database. By integrating structural predictions with expression and evolutionary evidence, this approach has demonstrated the potential of protein structure prediction as a tool for refining the annotation of the human genome.

<text>Su Buqing, also spelled Su Buchin (; September 23, 1902 – March 17, 2003), was a Chinese mathematician, educator and poet. He was the founder of differential geometry in China, and served as president of Fudan University and honorary chairman of the Chinese Mathematical Society.

==Early life==
Su was born in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province in 1902, with ancestry from Quanzhou.

Su&#x27;s academic journey began in 1911 when he transferred to the First Primary School in Pingyang County and was subsequently admitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Tenth Middle School in 1914. In 1919, Su was offered a scholarship by the principal of his middle school to study in Japan. Su successfully passed the entrance examination for Tokyo Higher Technical College in February 1920 and enrolled in the Department of Electrical Engineering where he graduated from in March 1924. After that, he was admitted to the Department of Mathematics of Tohoku Imperial University in Japan and graduated in 1927. Under the supervision of Tadahiko Kubota, Su received his Ph.D. from the university in 1931 for dissertation entitled &quot;The relation between affine and projective differential geometry&quot;.

During his time in Tohoku Imperial University, Su met and married Yonako Matsumoto in 1928.

== Career ==
After returning to China, he first served as a professor and dean at Zhejiang University (he established the Chen-Su School with Chen Jiangong). When universities across China underwent reorganization in 1952, Su and his students from Zhejiang University&#x27;s Department of Mathematics relocated to Fudan University where he initially served as the Provost and later became the honorary President of Fudan University in 1978.

He was honorary chairman of the Chinese Mathematical Society (CMS) and elected to Academia Sinica and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1948 and 1955 respectively.

In 1985, the Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee appointed Su as the honorary President of Wenzhou University. Additionally, he provided guidance and supervision in the establishment of the Shanghai Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 1989 and the China Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CSIAM) in 1990, serving as a consultant for the latter.

Some other positions Su held included member of the sixth (1983–88) and later vice chairman of the seventh and eighth (1988–98) National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), honorary chairman of the China Democratic League Central Committee (1997), and Conference and deputy to the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC).

== Research ==
Praised commonly in mathematical field as the &quot;first geometer in the orient&quot;, Su was engaged in research, teaching and education in differential geometry and computational geometry. In his early years, he made excellent contributions to affine differential geometry and projective differential geometry. He obtained extraordinary achievements in general space differential geometry, conjugating net theory in higher-dimensional space and computer aided geometry design.

Su&#x27;s research on general surfaces led to the discovery of quartic algebraic surfaces of the third order. In recognition of his achievements, a geometric shape known as the &quot;Su-cone&quot; was named after him. In the 1940s, he made notable contributions to the theory of K-spreads, involving families of K-dimensional manifolds in space.

Throughout his career, Su authored over 160 mathematical papers published in both domestic and international journals. He also wrote more than 20 monographs and textbooks on topics such as projective curves, projective surfaces, and affine differential geometry. Su&#x27;s main papers are included in &quot;Selected Works of Buqing Su&quot; (1991). Notable among his works are &quot;&quot;The General Projective Theory of Curves&quot;,&quot; (English translation 1958) &quot;&quot;Affine Differential Geometry,&quot; (English translation 1983) and &quot;Computational Geometry, Curve and Surface Modeling&quot;,&quot; (Chinese 1980; English edition 1989) co-authored with Dingyuan Liu.

== Honors and awards ==
Su won the second prize of the first National Natural Science Award in 1956 for his work on &quot;&quot;Geometry of K-spread Space and General Metric Space, Projective Curve Theory.&quot;

In 1978, his work, &quot;A Program of Hull Lofting&quot;, won the National Science Conference Award.

Su won the second prize of the first National Science and Technology Progress Award in 1985 for his collaborative effort on &quot;A Production Process of the Hull Form by the Curved-Surface Method&quot;.&quot;

In 2001, the book, &quot;Geometry and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations&quot;, which presents the proceedings of a conference on geometry and nonlinear partial differential equations, dedicated to Su in honor of his one-hundredth birthday.

In August 2003, the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) established the &quot;ICIAM Su Buqing Award&quot; in recognition to contributions to the application of mathematics in economic growth and human development. Furthermore, the Chinese Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CSIAM) established the &quot;CSIAM Su Buqing Applied Mathematics Award&quot; in 2004.

Asteroid 297161 Subuchin, discovered by astronomers of the PMO NEO Survey Program in 2008, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 ().

<doc id="209463" wikidata="Q2320369" url="?curid=209463" title="Norton, Suffolk">
<text>Norton is a village and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district of the English county of Suffolk. The name Norton means northern town or farm. Located close to the A14, its nearest railway station is at Elmswell, just over away. The closest towns are Stowmarket away and Bury St Edmunds, around away.

==History==
The village once formed part of Blackbourn Hundred, which appears in the Domesday Book. Its agricultural past is reflected in the number of listed buildings in the village today that are former barns, stables and cartlodges. An 1870s gazetteer of Britain describes the parish as comprising 2,449 acres and having a population of 948. It also mentions it as a meet for the Suffolk fox hounds.

==The village today==
Today the village has a population of around 800. Community facilities include a Greene King pub called &quot;The Norton Dog&quot; and a village shop located in the Total service station on Woolpit Road. A mobile Post Office is located next to the village hall every weekday afternoon.

Norton has a pre-school next to the village hall and a Church of England voluntary primary school, with children generally moving on to middle school in the nearby communities of Ixworth and Beyton. Secondary education is provided at Thurston Community College.

The community is served by three churches, with a Baptist church and Salvation Army citadel on Woolpit Road. The Medieval Church of St Andrew at Norton, located some way from the centre of the village, contains a collection of eight 14th-century misericords and is believed to stand on the site of a Saxon church.

Norton is served with a bus service to Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket which operates on a daily basis.

==Little Haugh Hall==
Near the village is Little Haugh Hall, a Grade II* listed building. In the 18th century it was the home of the antiquarian Cox Macro.

<doc id="209471" wikidata="Q498627" url="?curid=209471" title="McMurdo Station">
<text>McMurdo Station is an American Antarctic research station on the southern tip of Ross Island. It is operated by the United States through the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), a branch of the National Science Foundation. The station is the largest community in Antarctica, capable of supporting up to 1,500 residents, though the population fluctuates seasonally; during the antarctic night, there are less than two hundred people. It serves as one of three year-round United States Antarctic science facilities. Personnel and cargo going to or coming from Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station usually first pass through McMurdo, either by flight or by the McMurdo to South Pole Traverse; it is a hub for activities and science projects in Antarctica. McMurdo, Amundsen-Scott, and Palmer are the three non-seasonal United States stations on the continent, though by the Antarctic Treaty System the bases are not a legal claim (though the right is not forfeited); they are dedicated to scientific research. New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base is nearby on Hut Point Peninsula, as is Arrival Heights Laboratory. On the base is a heliport, and across the channel is a helicopter refueling station at Marble Point, but the main airfields in the 2020s are Phoenix Airfield and Williams Field which are to the south and built on ice. Winter Quarters Bay is the base seaport, though access can be limited by weather conditions when the sea ice forms. Weather can make it too hard to land aircraft, and an icebreaker may be needed to reach the port facility. However, the sea ice also makes it possible to make ice traverses and travel directly across the bay, and historically an Ice Runway was crafted. The base is powered by a mixture of generators and wind power, though it had a nuclear reactor in the 1960s.

The base was first established in the mid-1950s as part of an international program to study and explore Antarctica for peaceful purposes. Daylight is seasonal at McMurdo, corresponding to the south polar daytime, and the polar night, which is also winter, lasts from about April to September. As it warms, the sea ice melts, and the port is opened, but by about February, much of the activity drops with plunging temperatures and increasing darkness, and there are usually no flights in or out until July or August.

The base has many buildings and staff which support the local population and its many field stations and research projects. The base is the starting point for the South Pole Traverse snow and ice road, which must be cleared each year, as do the snow and ice runways. The base is quite distant from New Zealand, about the same distance as between New York and Los Angeles, or as between LA and Hawaii. Some of the projects and/or field stations McMurdo Station has supported include the Lower Erebus Hut, for the study of Mount Erebus (an active volcano to the north of the base), WAIS Divide Camp (an ice coring project), ANSMET (meteorite collection), and the Long Duration Balloon site. Telecommunication sites include Ross Island Earth Station and Black Island Earth Station.

==History==
McMurdo started in 1957 as a Naval Air Station in support of the International Geophysical Year, then as a science and logistics base in line with the international Antarctic treaty. Each year there are changes at the base, but the overall rhythm of the base has remained. Supplies and people flow in by ship and air for the austral summer, and for a few months there is a frenzy of activities, research, and resources flow out to many field stations and bases in Antarctica. In a few months people depart as the temperature plunges and worsening weather conditions, and much smaller staff over-winter at the base. Originally a Naval base, the role of the NSF and contractors increased and by 1993 the USN had departed.
===Name===

The station takes its name from its geographic location on McMurdo Sound, named after Lieutenant Archibald McMurdo of British ship . The &quot;Terror&quot;, commanded by Irish explorer Francis Crozier, along with expedition flagship &quot;Erebus&quot; under command of English Explorer James Clark Ross, first charted the area in 1841. The British explorer Robert Falcon Scott established a base camp close to this spot in 1902 and built a cabin there that was named Discovery Hut. It still stands as a historic monument near the water&#x27;s edge on Hut Point at McMurdo Station. The volcanic rock of the site is the southernmost bare ground accessible by ship in the world. The United States officially opened its first station at McMurdo on February 16, 1956, as part of Operation Deep Freeze. The base, built by the U.S. Navy Seabees, was initially designated &quot;Naval Air Facility McMurdo&quot;. On November 28, 1957, Admiral George J. Dufek visited McMurdo with a U.S. congressional delegation for a change-of-command ceremony.

In 1961, it was renamed from Naval Air Facility McMurdo, to just McMurdo. The Navy would be involved until 1993, when it left McMurdo in the hands of the NSF. The NSF had been involved over the decades and took on greater responsibilities over the years.

===International Geophysical Year===
McMurdo Station was the center of United States logistical operations during the International Geophysical Year, an international scientific effort that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958. After the IGY, it became the center for US scientific as well as logistical activities in Antarctica. The IGY was international project in the late 1950s by 67 countries and involved over 4000 research stations Globally.

The Antarctic Treaty, subsequently signed by over forty-five governments, regulates intergovernmental relations with respect to Antarctica and governs the conduct of daily life at McMurdo for United States Antarctic Program (USAP) participants. The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively called the &quot;Antarctic Treaty System&quot; (ATS), opened for signature on December 1, 1959, and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961.

McMurdo was one of seven bases that the United States built for the IGY, which also included Hallett, Wilkes, Admundsen-Scott, Ellsworth, Byrd, and Little America. Of these only McMurdo and Admundsen-Scott are still operated in the early 21st century.

As part of this endeavour, New Zealand also build a base on Ross Island, Scott Base, which has gone on to conduct many scientific projects. Scott Base is still in operation, but a second year-round New Zealand base, Vanda Station, built later on the Antarctic mainland, has since closed;it still has a weather station and is visited seasonally. Also, Hallet Station was a joint base of New Zealand and the USA, which was operated until 1973.

===1960s and 70s===

The first scientific diving protocols were established before 1960 and the first diving operations were documented in November 1961.

From 1961 to 1972, the base relied on a small PM-3A nuclear reactor for power, in the age of nuclear optimism. The reactor proved expensive to operate, and was turned off over concerns of stress corrosion.

Between 1962 and 1963, 28 Arcas sounding rockets(which name stands for &quot; All-Purpose Rocket for Collecting Atmospheric Soundings&quot;) were launched from McMurdo Station. These meteorological sounding rockets collected the first measurements above radiosonde levels of altitude in Antarctica. One discovery was that the wind direction reversed high above (about 35km) the station in September and October, coinciding with a rapid warming. After this there was light easterly winds and the station was left with warmer temperatures.

In 1974, Dr. Mary Alice McWhinnie and Mary Odile Cahoon became the first women to over-winter at McMurdo Station, staying from April through October of the year. In 1962 McWhinnie became the first female in the Antarctic Research Program. Her research was on crustaceans, in particular Krill which inhabit arctic waters .

===1998 Protocol on Environmental Protection===

McMurdo Station has attempted to improve environmental management and waste removal in order to adhere to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, signed on October 4, 1991, which entered into force on January 14, 1998. This agreement prevents development and provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific ones. A new waste-treatment facility was built at McMurdo in 2003.

McMurdo Station stands about two miles (3 km) from Scott Base, the New Zealand science station, and all of Ross Island lies within a sector claimed by New Zealand. Criticism has been leveled at the base regarding its construction projects, particularly the McMurdo-(Amundsen-Scott) South Pole highway.
=== Scientific diving operations ===

Scientific diving operations continue with 10,859 dives having been conducted under the ice from 1989 to 2006. A hyperbaric chamber is available for support of polar diving operations.

===21st century===
On 24 November 2003, McMurdo Station had a total solar eclipse, which the inhabitants were able to observe.

, McMurdo Station was Antarctica&#x27;s largest community and a functional, modern-day science station, including a harbor, three airfields (two seasonal), a heliport and more than 100 buildings, including the Albert P. Crary Science and Engineering Center. The station is also home to the continent&#x27;s two ATMs, both provided by Wells Fargo Bank. The work done at McMurdo Station primarily focuses on science, but most of the residents (approximately 1,000 in the summer and around 250 in the winter) are not scientists, but station personnel who provide support for operations, logistics, information technology, construction, and maintenance.

McMurdo Station briefly gained global notice when an anti-war protest took place on February 15, 2003. During the rally, about 50 scientists and station personnel gathered to protest against the coming invasion of Iraq by the United States. McMurdo Station was the only Antarctic location to hold such a rally.

A snow and road traverse from McMurdo to the South Pole was constructed between 2002 and end of 2005, when it opened for the first time; it has gained several names and has been called the southernmost road in the world. Although the South Pole base is about a three-hour flight by LC-130 from McMurdo, the overland traverse allows massive amounts of cargo including of fuel and of cargo each year to be transported out of McMurdo. These are carried by land trains (aka convoys) of tracked haulers and sleds. The road also supports polar plateau research camps as well as record breaking attempts. However, the ice road passes through two glacial shear zones, which are prone to dangerous crevasses; this results in ongoing maintenance with ground-penetrating radar to check for new crevasses and fill them. The opening of the traverse freed up aircraft at McMurdo airports because less flights were needed.

In 2008, NASA tested and inflatable lunar habitat at McMurdo station.

Scientists and other personnel at McMurdo are participants in the USAP, which coordinates research and operational support in the region. Werner Herzog&#x27;s 2007 documentary &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot; reports on the life and culture of McMurdo Station from the point-of-view of residents. Anthony Powell&#x27;s 2013 documentary &quot;&quot; provides time-lapse photography of Antarctica intertwined with personal accounts from residents of McMurdo Station and of the adjacent Scott Base over the course of a year.

An annual sealift by cargo ships as part of Operation Deep Freeze delivers 8 million U.S. gallons (6.6 million imperial gallons/42 million liters) of fuel and 11 million pounds (5 million kg) of supplies and equipment for McMurdo residents. The ships, operated by the U.S. Military Sealift Command, are crewed by civilian mariners. Cargo may range from mail, construction materials, trucks, tractors, dry and frozen food, to scientific instruments. U.S. Coast Guard icebreakers break a ship channel through ice-clogged McMurdo Sound in order for supply ships to reach Winter Quarters Bay at McMurdo. Additional supplies and personnel are flown into nearby Williams Field from Christchurch in New Zealand.

====2010s====

In 2016, scientist Dr Gordon Hamilton died, when his snowmobile plunged into a crevasse about 25 miles (40 km) south of McMurdo in the shear zone (SZ). The ice is nearly 650 feet thick in this region, but crevasses can open as the ice moves, and the ice shelf was what Dr. Hamilton was studying at the time. Hamilton was an experienced glaciologist, but there is many hazards to working in those conditions especially the crevasses.

In the late 2010s, there was a transition from Pegasus Airfield to Phoenix Airfield. Phoenix Airfield underwent operational testing and received its first wheeled landings during the 2016-17 austral summer season. Then, Pegasus Airfield closed after the last flight on 8 December 2016. Phoenix Airfield was opened in early 2017. Also a new compressed snow &quot;Alpha&quot; runway was built at Williams field.

In 2017, the McMurdo Oceanographic Observatory (MOO) was installed underwater and removed in 2019; it provided underwater data and video from under the ice.

In 2018, two people died while doing maintenance on fire suppression system in a generator building.

====2020s====
In 2020, one large dormitory was demolished as part of a grand plan, however, the new dorm was never constructed and so in the 2020s McMurdo has had a self-made housing crisis leading to bottleneck that has led to cancelled research projects. At the start of 2020, Dorm 203 was torn down, but then development was halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic and several years later a new dorm was not built. In the 2023–4 season, 67 of 137 projects were cut or scaled back due to housing issues. In 2023, the NIH sent investigators to McMurdo in response to reports of sexual harassment and/or assault by men and women at the station. One result of this was to ban the selling of alcohol at bars, though it’s not a blanket ban on alcohol at the station. 

The first confirmed case of Covid at McMurdo was detected in August 2022. By November, 10% of the population of the station was confirmed to be infected. As of February 2023, a total of 175 positive cases have been detected. Covid also reached Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and WAIS Divide field camp. (see also COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica )

In 2022 the Ross Island Earth Station (RIES) satellite telecommunications center was completed near McMurdo Station, which supports satellite communications for the base.

In 2024, the United States thanked the New Zealand Air Force for conducting a difficult evacuation of a sick person from McMurdo during winter. This difficult flight took place in total darkness, sub-freezing temperatures, and required a &quot;hot&quot; refueling on the runway. The patient was successfully evacuated and achieved a stable condition. The roundtrip to New Zealand was a 7,500 kilometer (4,660 miles) flight.

On December 22nd 2024, the Long Duration Balloon camp, which is a few miles/km from McMurdo on the ice sheet, launched its first scientific balloon of the season. The Salter Test Flight Universal took flight successfully and returned safely by January 2nd 2025, carrying five investigations. This was a part of the annual Antarctic Long-Duration Balloon Campaign done by NASA for its Scientific Balloon Program.

For Operation Deep Freeze 2025, the ship &quot;Ocean Giant&quot; brought supplies to McMurdo Station for the 24&#x27;-25&#x27; season, arriving in late January 2025. For this year the Marine Causeway System, rather than an ice pier was used. The Marine Causeway consists of floating modular sections that when assembled allow the cargo to be offloaded. &quot;Ocean Gian&quot;t was then loaded with trash and material for recycling, and departed, then the cargo ship &quot;Ocean Gladiator&quot; came with more supplies for the base.

==Day and night cycles==
Unlike the south Pole, where the Sun is continuously visible for about six months; then it is then continuously dark for the next six months, with a twilight, namely the equinoxes in between, McMurdo has times of the year where it has sunsets and sunrises. McMurdo is farther north, but still south of the Antarctic Circle; its at 77.85° South latitude. So in observational terms, McMurdo has times of the year that are one extremely long &quot;day&quot; and one equally long &quot;night&quot;. While the South Pole has one six-month &quot;day&quot;, where the angle of elevation of the Sun above the horizon varies incrementally The Sun reaches a rising position throughout the September equinox, and then it is apparent highest at the December solstice which is summer solstice for the south, setting on the March equinox, McMurdo has a part of year with sunsets and sunrises, but also 24 hour light or darkness. In late August there is the first sunrise, and then for the next few months until October there is a day and night cycle; then there is the last sunset of year followed by 24 hour sunlight. In February, there is the first sunset of the year and finally, around April, there is the final sunrise and there is a twilight and 24 hour darkness until the next August. 

So while the South Pole sees the Sun rise and set only once a year, McMurdo has periods of a day-night cycle, but also a period of 24 hour light of darkness. Light is also effected by atmospheric refraction, which effects the September equinox and the March equinox, respectively. The station uses New Zealand time (UTC+12 during standard time and UTC+13 during daylight saving time) since all flights to McMurdo station depart from Christchurch and, therefore, all official travel from the pole goes through New Zealand.

==Climate==
With all months having an average temperature below freezing, McMurdo features a polar ice cap climate (Köppen &quot;EF&quot;). However, in the warmest months (December and January) the monthly average high temperature may occasionally rise above freezing. The place is protected from cold waves from the interior of Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains, so temperatures below −40° are rare, compared to more exposed places like Neumayer Station, which usually gets those temperatures a few times every year, often as early as May, and sometimes even as early as April, and very rarely above 0 °C. The highest temperature ever recorded at McMurdo was 10.8 °C on December 21, 1987. There is enough snowmelt in summer that a few species of moss and lichen can grow.

The average yearly temperature is freezing, but it can get as high as 8°C (46°F) in the austral summer and as low as -50°C (-58°F) in the austral winter. McMurdo Station is a windy place with an average wind speed of about 10 knots (11 mph, 19 kph), but with gusts ten times that possible.

The station gets about one and half yards/meters of snow each year, but will be snow-free late in summer. Antarctica in general is actually quite dry, and would be considered a desert, but the coastal areas get more precipitation.

==Communications==
Starting in 1963, McMurdo played host to one of the only two shortwave broadcast stations in Antarctica. From sign-on to 1971, the callsign was KMSA, from then on it was changed to WASA (W Antarctic Support Activities), later changing to AFAN in 1975. As KMSA, the station broadcast in the same building as the bowling alley, the barber shop and the retail store. A part of the vinyl collection reportedly came from Vietnam, believing to have been played by Adrian Cronauer&#x27;s show in Saigon. In a 1997 interview to &quot;The Antarctic Sun&quot;, Cronauer denied these claims and the vinyl collection was apparently destroyed. The station—AFAN McMurdo—initially operated on AM 600 and had a power of 50 W, but by 1974, it transmitted with a power of 1 kilowatt on the shortwave frequency of 6,012 kHz and became a target for shortwave radio listening to hobbyists around the world because of its rarity. The station was picked up by DX for the first time in New Zealand in July 1974, and within a few months had its signal received as far as the US east coast. AFAN had changed frequencies several times in subsequent years. The station continued broadcasting on shortwave into the 1980s when it dropped shortwave while continuing FM transmission.

For a time, McMurdo had Antarctica&#x27;s only television station, AFAN-TV, running vintage programs provided by the military. Broadcasts started on November 9, 1973, with a mix of US programs and interviews with visitors and scientists, as well as a daily news and weather service. The station&#x27;s equipment was susceptible to &quot;electronic burping&quot; from the diesel generators that provide electricity in the outpost. The station was profiled in a 1975 article in &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine, where the station broadcast in the summer months, known by staff as &quot;the season&quot; (November to February), the only season where Antarctica was (at the time) open to aircraft. In the mid-90s, a cable network was installed. By 1998, shortly after the launch of new AFN television services the year before, the traditional AFN network was broadcast over cable channel 2 (the channel that would soon become AFN Prime), NewSports (the current AFN News and AFN Sports) was on channel 11 and Spectrum (current AFN Spectrum) was on channel 13. The cable network as of 2004 had six channels, with channel 13 generating occasional local content.

McMurdo Station receives both Internet and voice communications by satellite communications via the Optus D1 satellite and relayed to Sydney, Australia. A satellite dish at Black Island provides 20 Mbit/s Internet connectivity and voice communications. Voice communications are tied into the United States Antarctic Program headquarters in Centennial, Colorado, providing inbound and outbound calls to McMurdo from the US. Voice communications within the station are conducted via VHF radio.

Testing of the Starlink service began in September 2022, with a second terminal providing connectivity for the Allan Hills field camp brought in November 2022.

Starlink allowed a large increase in bandwidth for residents of McMurdo, include 24x7 availability during the winter season, and for the 2023-2024 season also for morale use. The AIR project also planned to expand Starlink coverage to dorms and other spaces. The greatly expanded internet access has allowed those stationed at McMurdo to stay in touch with the rest of the world more easily and indulge in high-bandwidth leisure activities like watch sporting events.

==Power and water systems==
The base ran off generators and supplies at the start, and a nuclear power plant operated from 1962-1973, which was also used to make water. After that a generator plant produced power, heat, and water. A water treatment plant was added in 2002, and in the 2010s wind power, shared with Scott Base, supplemented the diesel generators.

Almost all water and sewer lines are above ground that are insulated and heated. Excavating frozen ground for repairs is difficult, so having them above ground makes maintenance easier.
===Nuclear power (1962–1972)===
On March 3, 1962, the U.S. Navy activated the PM-3A nuclear power plant at the station. The unit was prefabricated in modules to facilitate transport and assembly. Engineers designed the components to weigh no more than each and to measure no more than by by . A single core no larger than an oil drum served as the heart of the nuclear reactor. These size and weight restrictions aimed to allow delivery of the reactor in an LC-130 Hercules aircraft, but the components were delivered by ship.

The reactor generated 1.8 MW of electrical power and reportedly replaced the need for of oil daily. Engineers applied the reactor&#x27;s power, for instance, in producing steam for the salt-water distillation plant. As a result of continuing safety issues (hairline cracks in the reactor and water leaks), the U.S. Army Nuclear Power Program decommissioned the plant in 1972.
=== Diesel generators ===

Conventional diesel generators replaced the nuclear power station, with several diesel generators in a central powerhouse providing electric power. A conventionally fueled water-desalination plant provided fresh water.

The base has six generators that can produce 900 kilowatts each, but it depends on the number of people at the base. With 800 people at the base around 1800 kilowatts are produced; the facility is not run at maximum capacity all the time. Heat from the engines, which have to be cooled regardless, is used to heat buildings at McMurdo by a heat exchanger. This design was completed in 1982.

In 2011 a new generator system came online that had 3 in one building and two in another, the water plant building to provide redundancy. There are 4 engines rated at 1500 kW and one at 1300 kW Base power is also supplemented by the Wind power station on Hut Point Peninsula shared by McMurdo and Scott bases.

The generators power the desalination plant, which makes freshwater for the base by taking sea water and putting it through a reverse osmosis filter.

=== Wind power ===

The southernmost wind farm on Earth is located on Ross Island, supplementing power and reducing fuel consumption at McMurdo and Scott. The three-tower facility on Crater Hill has an average wind speed of nearly 30 kph, at 40 m height of the initial turbines.

In January 2010, three new wind turbines had their opening ceremony by McMurdo and Scott officials, bringing significant wind power to Ross island; three turbines rated at 330 kw each for a total of nearly 990 kw shared between the two bases, was estimated to save 240 thousand gallons of fuel per year.

Three Enercon E-33 (330 kW each) wind turbines were deployed in 2009 to power McMurdo and New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base, reducing diesel consumption by 11% or 463,000 liters per year. The subsequent failure of a proprietary, non-replaceable part critical to battery storage reduced the power generation of the turbines by 66% by 2019. Three new wind turbines were planned for the 2023–4 season, with great capacity: one new one will be greater than previous three combined. The strong winds make wind power a practical alternative, and the new wind system should supply 90% of the power at Scott Base.

==Transport==


Three types of transport at McMurdo include land (ground), sea, and air. In each case the transport must contend with extreme cold, snow and ice. Access by sea might need an icebreaker, and ground transport may utilize snow tires, tracks, and sleds. Aircraft with skis may land on snow, such as the LC-130, while more prepared ice or compacted snow runways may tolerate conventional landing gear though extremely cold temperatures can complicate operating aircraft. Weather conditions also effect the harbor, which ices over in winter and the whole McMurdo sound is covered by sea ice, and there is many types of vehicles to traverse different types of snow, ice, ground conditions. One of the most dangerous areas to traverse is the Glacial ice, where snow can hide deep crevasses.

McMurdo Station has a heliport, which helps reach locations in the area, and there is refueling station across McMurdo sound to the west, on Marble Point.

===Ground===

A multitude of on- and off-road vehicles transport people and cargo around the station area, including &quot;Ivan the Terra Bus&quot; (a pun on Ivan the Terrible). Ivan the Terra is a snow coach that weighs 67,000 pounds empty and has been in service several decades. The word Terra is the name of the snow bus made by the company Foremost, and this type of vehicle is also used in the Canadian arctic. It is an extreme-duty tri-axle bus with very large tires, and Ivan is powered by a 300 hp Cat engine, and it can normally transport 56 people at 25 mph. Despite its size, its very soft on the ground delivering only 15 psi of ground pressure.

Ford E-Series Vans, modified for the conditions including a 20-speed transmission and snow tired, powered by a 7.3 Liter Turbodiesel V-8 is also used in both 4x4 and 6x6 versions. One called the Ice Challenger set a land speed record to the pole in 70 hours. Also Ford E-250 and 350 superduty trucks are used, and, again have to be modified and change is to put heaters on most components, and snow tired or track wheels. McMurdo operates about 60 superduty trucks in the 21st century. There are hundreds of vehicles at McMurdo, but also many different types: these fall into several categories based on where they are normally used. This include rock and/or ice road, local ice, traverse, ice edge, remote site, and inland station. This includes vehicles like pickup trucks, M274 Mule utility truck, Foremost Delta 2, Tucker Sno-Cat (1700 series), Thiokol Sprytes, M51 Dump Truck, and Caterpillar bulldozers and loaders such as the D8, as well as other types such snowmobiles like the Bombardier Elan. Sleds (aka Sledges) of various types and sizes have also been used, such as those pulled by a ski-do.

One of the newer vehicles for the 21st century, is the custom built people hauler, especially for going to and from the airfields and ice shelf is the Kress vehicle.

There is a road from McMurdo to the New Zealand Scott Base, and open since 2005, an ice road and glacial traverse to the South Pole called the South Pole Traverse or McMurdo-South Pole highway.

The McMurdo-South Pole traverse, is a seasonal, over 1000 mile (1600 km) snow and ice road that crosses the frozen Ross Sea, glaciers, and the Antarctic ice cap to reach the South Pole. It was first opened at the end of 2005, though it must be maintained each year to check for new crevasses and clear new snow. It has reduced the number of flights to the South Pole, by enabling the bulk transport and fuel and cargo across the surface, and has also been used for adventuring records.

There can be a seasonal trail between McMurdo to Scott Base called the Cape Armitage Loop Trail, over the sea ice.

===Sea===

McMurdo has the world&#x27;s most southerly harbor, this is important for bringing supplies to McMurdo and in support of projects in the Antarctic, but weather conditions necessitate an icebreaker. An example of a resupply ship is the MV American Tern, which was chartered from 2001-2010.

McMurdo harbor has been opened by U.S. CGC Polar Star which comes every year to McMurdo. Access to ships in the harbor is can be done via an ice pier, though a modular causeway was in development A modular floating Marine Causeway system was used in January 2025. Once the pass is open other types of ships can arrive include sealift, research, auxiliary vessels, and others bringing supplies and supporting research operations in Antarctica.

Dive huts are taken out on the frozen sea ice to facilitate doing dives.

===Air===

McMurdo station is serviced seasonally from Christchurch Airport about away by air,&lt;ref name=&quot;christchurchairport/antarctica&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with C-17 Globemaster and Lockheed LC-130, by two airports:
* Phoenix Airfield (ICAO: NZFX), a compacted snow runway which replaced Pegasus Field (ICAO: NZPG) in 2017
* Williams Field (ICAO: NZWD), a permanent snow runway for ski-equipped aircraft.
Historically, a seasonal Ice Runway (NZIR) was used until December though this has fallen out favor of the compacted snow runway of Phoenix airfield since 2017. The ice runway was built out over frozen sea ice in the late months of the year, after the polar dawn started but before the sea ice broke up.

Aircraft are important part of the supply chain to McMurdo, for example, a U.S. Air Force Globemaster III brought in 100 personnel and nearly 50 thousand pounds of food by air on the first winter fly-in mission of 2021-2022.

McMurdo Station has a helicopter pad, and the helicopters support operations in the area, such as trips to the McMurdo Dry Valleys.Also, there is a helicopter refueling station across the channel at Marble Point. 

==Science research==

McMurdo is not just a gateway and logistical foundation for projects throughout the region and Antarctica, but also a place for research. Much has been learned about Ross Island and waters. The McMurdo sound is home to one of the oldest known living things on earth, a giant ancient sea sponge. It is also habitat for seals and birds (such as penguins), and the climate, glacial and sea ice, and geology are also studied. The study of Antarctic ice is important globally, because if the ice cap were to melt, many coastal regions would flood. 

The Weddel seal is studied at McMurdo, a mammal that can survive in some of the coldest conditions on Earth. One mystery was how Weddel pups do not freeze, and one of the answers was that they have special fuzzy fur called lanugo fur. (not to be confused with the Weddel &quot;sea&quot;) 

Two type of penguins found at McMurdo include Emperor penguins and Adélie penguins. One result from research is that the amount of sea ice and icebergs, if there is more, can make it harder for Emperor and Adelie penguins to raise chicks. A few colonies of Emperor penguins are near the base, and high resolution photos from helicopters and space have been used to track the penguin population.

The giant volcano sea sponge (&quot;Anoxycalyx joubini)&quot; is estimated to live between 6 thousand to up to 40 thousand years, and grow up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in diameter and 1.95 meters (6.5 feet) high. They survive by filtering sea water, and with a tube shape, the largest are big enough a person can swim inside. The hexactinellid sponges that live in the Antarctic including the Ross sea are some of the oldest living things on Earth.

Example of marine life in McMurdo sound includes soft corals, finger sponges, sea anemones, Antarctic scallops, Notothenioidei fishes, and other life able to survive the cold. In the late 2010s there was the MOO project, which placed a undersea webcam in the McMurdo sound to observe these and other marine life such as Weddel seals. The vocalizations of the seals was recorded by that project.

McMurdo is also a place of study of Mount Erebus, an active volcano with an exposed lava lake, and formations created by it such as ice caves made by volcanic gases. One of the unique rocks from the volcano are Erebus crystals, which are ejected by the volcano and prized for research.

McMurdo Dry Valleys, a unique nearly snowless area of Antarctica that lies to the west of the station, has also been studied. Meteorological data and other aspects of the dry valleys have been studied.

Areas of scientific research at McMurdo Station include:

* astronomy
* atmospheric sciences
* biology
* Earth science
* environmental science 
* geology 
* glaciology
* marine biology
* oceanography
* climatology
* geophysics

==Historic sites==

The Richard E. Byrd Historic Monument was erected at McMurdo in 1965. It includes a bronze bust on black marble, square, on a wooden platform, bearing inscriptions describing the polar exploration achievements of Richard E. Byrd. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 54), following a proposal by the United States to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

There is a memorial to Capt. Robert Falcon Scott and four others that died on their way back from the South Pole in 1912, that was erected in 1913 after they were found. The Antarctic biologist and explorer Edward Wilson also died on that expedition.

There is also a memorial to a construction worker, the U.S. Navy SeaBee Richard T. William, who died in 1956, when his bulldozer went through the ice: the memorial is statue of woman and called &quot;Our Lady of the Snows.&quot;

The bronze Nuclear Power Plant Plaque is about in size, and is secured to a large vertical rock halfway up the west side of Observation Hill, at the former site of the PM-3A nuclear power reactor at McMurdo Station. The inscription details the achievements of Antarctica&#x27;s first nuclear power plant. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 85), following a proposal by the United States to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

==Life==

Life in McMurdo is influenced by the seasonal daylight; a period called &quot;the season&quot; kicks off usually with the first sunrise around August of each year. This marks the start of the polar dawn, and the first flights start. As the weeks pass, there is more and more daylight, an ice pier is constructed, and icebreakers make a pass in the melting sea ice to the McMurdo harbor. By October there is the last sunset of the year, and a period of 24-hour daylight begins. More staff and researchers arrive, and the population of the station increases. Staff and resources flow through McMurdo to research projects in Antarctica, including the opening of the ice road to the South Pole and ski cargo planes bringing supplies to that base. Around February, the last flights fly out as the season draws to a close, and there are lowering temperatures in the polar twilight and finally the last sunset; McMurdo Sound ices over. In the polar night, historically, no one has gone in or out, and there is much less staff at McMurdo. In the 2010s there was some success increasing focus on doing staff changes and resupply in June and July, though this means landing in darkness in very cold temperatures.
Once a year, around New Year&#x27;s Day, the most southern music festival, Icestock, is organized, with performers being from the station and Scott Base.

There is an interfaith church called the &quot;Chapel of the Snows&quot; that hosts Protestant and Catholic services, as well as secular community organizations such as sobriety groups. One of the main buildings for life in McMurdo is number 155: this has a long indoor corridor called the &quot;highway&quot;, with offices, dorms, barbershop, computer lab, station store, and the main cafeteria (&quot;the galley&quot;) – the hub of life at the research station. McMurdo&#x27;s cafeteria is nicknamed the &quot;galley&quot;, like on a ship, due to the influence of Navy in McMurdo&#x27;s history. 
From 1961 to 2009, there was a bowling alley with a manual pin-setting machine; the building was demolished due to a structural failure and has not been replaced. The 2-lane alley was housed in a hut, and originally used penguins pins.

The historic pin-setting machine was brought out for the &quot;McMurdo Museum&quot; in 2022, a historical event remembering the history of the station. The event also displayed 1960s wetsuits (replaced in the 1970s with drysuits), and the old Caterpillar D4 tractor called &quot;Marcia&quot;.

McMurdo had the largest greenhouse in Antarctica from 1989 to 2011. It started out as 50 m2 and expanded to 66 m2 in 1994. The plants were grown indoors hydroponically (that is to say, using water rather than soil). The greenhouse could produce about 100 kg (220 lb) a month at peak production, including lettuce greens, spinach, arugula, chard, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and herbs. It was enough to give the over-winter staff a salad once a week but was more limited for the summer population at McMurdo. The greenhouse originally had glass panes, but switched to being indoors because it was more energy efficient in winter. Although it offered a limited supply, people liked to be around the plants and would sometimes come with a bottle of wine and their dinner to hangout there.

In 2016, it was discovered that McMurdo had an enormous 20 thousand vinyl record collection, dating back to the 1960s when it had its own radio station.

There is a beerless bar at McMurdo, which is a noted social center of the station, and a gym. Although beer is no longer sold at the bar in the 2020s, a ration of alcohol is available to buy at the stationary store, and the bar locations are now BYOB. For the 2023-4 season, an alcohol-free recreation zone was to be created, and several other recreation and morale spaces are planned. One major change for that year is expanding Internet access for leisure purposes and expanding Internet access to more locations at McMurdo.

McMurdo had some of the southernmost bars on the planet, one called &quot;Gallagher’s Pub&quot; and another was &quot;Southern Exposure&quot;. Another social place is the &#x27;Coffee House,&#x27; which is a popular place to play board games and play guitar in the warm season. Starting in late 2023, alcohol sales were stopped though BYOB was allowed, except at the &quot;Coffee House&quot; which switched to alcohol free.

The culture has been described as a cross between a mining town and a NIH campus with a bohemian twist, or a summer camp with a lot of work: working six ten-hour days a week is not uncommon. When downtime does come, and with Internet access difficult, leisure time activities are popular, such as ping-pong, art, and hiking, for example.

==Medical facility==
There is a small hospital at McMurdo Station, focusing on minor issues; more serious require a medivac out. Nevertheless, it does focus on some unique issues such as cold weather conditions and scuba accidents, and in a worst case scenario, for a mass casualty event with limited staff.

Building 142 next to the &#x27;central hub&#x27; 155 is McMurdo General Hospital. The facility has a small staff and focuses on smaller health issues, or on stabilizing a situation enough for evacuation. In addition, the facility tries to prepare for a mass casualty event such as plane crash, with limited staff. This means training volunteers and techniques such as a &quot;walking blood bank&quot;, in the case there is more patients than capabilities. There is a focus on aerospace medicine for pilots, and much of the issues are things like colds, sprains, dental, and minor health issues. Some cold related dangers at the Station include hypothermia, frostbite, snow blindness, sunburn, windburn, tent eye, carbon monoxide poisoning, and trench foot.The facility has four beds that can sustain critical care for several days, but advanced surgery is not available, though the exact mix of beds and level of care has varied over time and also seasonally. At one point it had three emergency beds and three in-patient beds. Usually a doctor is on staff supported by a few residents and/or nurses during the time when the base population can grow to over one thousand people. The facility can take X-rays, do EKG monitoring, basic lab work, basic dental work, but has no blood bank;for serious conditions the focus is on doing a medical evacuation. The facility also has a decompression chamber, supporting medical care for scuba divers. 

An example of a medical evacuation occurred in 2024, a patient was flown to New Zealand where they recovered. Medical evacuations in winter are very rare, but has happened in 2001, when the doctor had to be evacuated, 2003, and as mentioned in 2024. McMurdo is also place people are evacuated &quot;too&quot;, and an example of this is when someone was rescued from the WAIS Divide field camp in 2006. Because much of Antarctica is at high altitude, it is also needed to treat those experiencing issues with high altitude such as altitude sickness or high altitude pulmonary or cerebral edema (HAPE and HACE). Some of the treatments for this include a gamow bag (portable hyperbaric bag) or medications.

== Nearby bases ==
By road, McMurdo is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from New Zealand&#x27;s smaller Scott Base, which was built around the same time in the mid-1950s and the development of this area involved a collaboration between the United States and New Zealand; both were projects for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). McMurdo and Scott base are technically in the New Zealand–claimed Ross Dependency on the shore of McMurdo Sound Antarctica, though by article IV of the 1961 Antarctic Treaty System the claim is in abeyance. The two bases were established to be close on purpose during &quot;Operation Deep Freeze&quot; in 1955+, which because of the IGY was part of a multinational project to establish bases in the antarctic, for which the sites were chosen. Christchurch International Airport in New Zealand, to the north helps provide logistical support for flying in supplies for the bases. McMurdo has the southernmost harbor in the world, but for access by ships icebreakers can be needed to establish passage.

In addition to McMurdo and Scott, New Zealand and the USA also established Hallet Station, a joint base operated until 1973.

Normally separated by a great distance, McMurdo is place where the USA and New Zealand are neighbors. Scott base has &quot;American Night&quot; where residents can get 50 cent beers and is known for being crowded. 

Other stations near McMurdo, besides Scott Base, include the Italian seasonal base Zucchelli Station which is on the coast of the Ross Sea (Terra Nova Bay), the German seasonal base Gondwana Station at Gerlache Inlet also in Terra Nova Bay, and the South Korean Jang Bogo Station of South Korea also in Terra Nova Bay.

There is many other field stations and huts in the area, included historic or seasonal ones.

<text>The Albert P. Crary Science and Engineering Center (CSEC), located at McMurdo Station, was dedicated in November 1991 by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The laboratory is named in honor of geophysicist and glaciologist Albert P. Crary. There are five pods making for 4,320 square meters of working area that includes a two-story core, a biology pod, earth sciences and atmospheric sciences pods, and an aquarium. CSEC was built to replace older, outdated science buildings that were built as early as 1959.

==Facilities==
The second floor of CSEC has a computer room, a library, and classrooms.

==Activities==
The CSEC conducts research on aeronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and geophysics, glaciology and glacial geology, and ocean and climate systems.

<text>Comayagua () is a city, municipality and old capital of Honduras, located northwest of Tegucigalpa on the highway to San Pedro Sula and above sea level. 

The accelerated growth experienced by the city of Comayagua led the municipal authorities to structure a territorial reorganization plan. Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2023 the estimated population of the city was 120,500. It is the capital of the Comayagua department of Honduras and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture. The cathedral, at the central square, has the oldest clock in the Americas.

==Etymology==
Comayagua is known today as &quot;&quot; () by Hondurans. They call it that because in addition to being one of the oldest cities in Honduras, it still maintains a large part of its buildings with architectural value from the colonial era. Its historic center &quot;is the most restored and preserved nationwide.&quot;

The Spaniards named the place &quot;Valladolid&quot; or &quot;&quot; (), but the city formally kept the original, indigenous name of the place. Some differ over its etymology, but most agree that it is composed of &quot;koma&quot; (which in Lenca means &#x27;huge amount of land&#x27;) and &quot;jawa&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;, its true meaning being &#x27;abundant land of water&#x27;.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era===

During the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by Lenca people, a Mesomaerican native culture that still survives in Honduras. Archaeological remains such as Yarumela show that these natives have populated the valley since approximately 1,000 B.C.

The flat topography and subtropical climate helped these natives to prosper and built its own societies and towns, most of its economic activities were the control of trade routes that connected the Caribbean sea to the Pacific Ocean. During the colonization of the American continent the Spaniard conquistadors found a rich valley with different Lencan towns, most of them well organized with a high social stratification. these natives were the ones that gave a well-done resistance during the conquest of Honduras.

===Foundation===
Comayagua was founded in 1537 by the Spaniard Captain Alonso de Cáceres in compliance with instructions &quot;to find an apparent situation to form a city in the middle of the two oceans&quot; by order of the advance Francisco de Montejo, first governor of &quot;Hibueras&quot; (modern day Honduras) as it was first known to Honduras. The city was originally called &quot;&quot;Santa María de la Concepción de Comayagua&quot;.&quot;

On 20 November 1542, King Philip II of Spain ordered that the &quot;Real Audiencia de los Confines reside in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala&quot;, but the Council of the Indies ordered on 13 September 1543 to install its headquarters in the town of the Concepción de Comayagua. In the same provision it is given the name of &quot;Villa de la Nueva Valladolid de Comayagua&quot; in honor of Valladolid of Spain, where at the time of signing the founding letter of the hearing, the Court resided.

Finally, the assignment as the seat of the audience was not effective and it was transferred to the town of Gracias Lempira, on 16 May 1544. On 20 December 1557, King Philip II granted it the title of city, during At that time, the city already had a Mercedarian convent founded by Fray Jerónimo Clemente in 1553 and a stone church built in 1551 at a cost of 15,000 gold pesos. In 1558 the first capitulars were elected. In 1561, the episcopal chair that resided in Trujillo was transferred to it, due to its more favorable conditions, its location in the center of the country and its proximity to the gold and silver mining regions. In 1585 the first cathedral was built; and the one that now exists (Immaculate Conception) began in 1634, and was completed in 1715.

===Spanish colonial period===
Comayagua remained the capital of Honduras throughout all the colonial period. By the time the Spanish authorities gifted the city with different architectural works, such as churches, colleges, convents, houses, and Fountains. Comayagua&#x27;s system of cisterns and fountains dates from colonial times making it the first city in Honduras with a system of aqueducts. However Tegucigalpa began to dispute that position in the mid-17th century, as it developed as a mining center. In recognition of its growing importance it received the title of town in 1768.

However, the development of Tegucigalpa was ignored when in 1788: &quot;Comayagua became an Intendancy and politically absorbed Tegucigalpa which became a sub-delegation&quot; ... &quot;Even so, the appointment was made from Comayagua, which caused a revolt in Tegucigalpa, fueling the existing rivalry between the two most important cities of the Province. Some resentful Tegucigalpans a few years later, complained that these decisions had resulted in the economic decline of the area, &quot;claiming that the new mayors were not interested in the development of mining and that they established a local tax on agricultural products such as indigo, sugar, and cattle, which only benefited Comayagua. 

As a result of the complaints presented by the residents of Tegucigalpa and on the recommendation of José Cecilio del Valle, advisor to the president of the Guatemalan hearing, the Mayor&#x27;s Office was re-created in 1812. The establishment of the intendancy in Comayagua not only delayed the growth of Tegucigalpa, but could not contain the continued decline of Comayagua. It became from the capital of the province, to a sleepy town that, by the early nineteenth century, had only a few Spaniards, near 30 European families, all reduced to living off charity. Furthermore, the city had earned a reputation for being unhealthy because of its economic decline.

&quot;The reason given for the decline of the city was the decline in agriculture and commerce, which was often attributed to the laziness of the natives. In 1802 the two parishes of the city had a combined population of 5,369.&quot; For all these reasons it was proposed that the capital be moved to Tegucigalpa. Despite these proposals, the capital remained in Comayagua throughout the colonial period.

===Independence===

During the period close to independence, there were several pro-independence movements throughout Central America. In Honduras these movements took place in Tegucigalpa. Names like Miguel Bustamante, Matías Zuniga, Simón Gutiérrez, Pablo Borjas, Andrés Lozano, Diego Vijil, Dionisio de Herrera, and Francisco Morazán etc. appear on the list of people related to the pro-independence movement. &quot;Those patriots Tegucigalpenses were considered by the Comayagua authority as conspirators,&quot; trying to &quot;promote from Tegucigalpa the ideas contrary to the colonial regime.&quot;

The Comayagua authorities wanted to quell the pro-independence revolts, but the colonial regime had already died. On September 21, 1821, Central America proclaimed its independence from Spain. Comayagua received the documents in the early hours of the morning of September 28 and the government with the members of the council learned of the decision, accepting independence.

On November 28, 1821, a note from General Agustín de Iturbide reached Guatemala suggesting that Central America, and the Viceroyalty of Mexico, form a great empire under the Plan of Iguala and the Treaties of Córdoba. The issue of annexation to Mexico caused divisions within each of the provinces since some cities were in favor of it and others against it.

In Honduras, Comayagua – through its governor José Tinoco de Contreras – spoke out in favor of annexation; but Tegucigalpa, the second largest city in the province, opposed the idea of it. In the end, Iturbide&#x27;s annexationist proposal triumphed and on August 22, 1822, Central America joined Mexico. Agustín de Iturbide&#x27;s annexation to the Mexican Empire did not last long, because it abdicated on March 19, 1823, and on July 1 of that same year, Central America proclaimed its definitive independence. Comayagua and Honduras became part of the United Provinces of Central America.

===Burning of the city===

After Honduras became part of the United Provinces of Central America, Comayagua continued to be its capital. In 1824, Honduras elected Don Dionisio de Herrera as its first Head of State. Soon the reaction arose against him, led by the Vicar, Canon José Nicolás Irías Midence, with the support of the President of the Republic, General Manuel José Arce, who, having already entered the path of arbitrariness, he saw Herrera as a serious obstacle to the development of his plans.

&quot;Irías, promoted anarchy as much as he could and finally caused the invasion of Honduras. President Arce, under the pretext of guarding the cigars belonging to the Federation, stored in the Villa de Santa Rosa, sent his federal forces under the command of Colonel Justo Milla, with the purpose of overthrowing Dionisio de Herrera. Without further ado, Milla&#x27;s troops reached Comayagua and laid siege to it. This happened on April 4, 1827. 
Comayagua was burned and looted to a large extent, and although the forces with which it was defending were inferior in number to those of the invader, they would have triumphed if their Commander, Colonel Antonio Fernández, a Spaniard, had not betrayed Mr. Herrera, putting him in prison and understanding with Colonel Milla, with whom he settled a capitulation on May 9, by virtue of which he delivered the square and the person of the Chief.
&quot;Mr. Herrera was taken to Guatemala, where he should have been submitted to the Assembly to declare whether or not his conduct gave rise to the formation of a cause. But since he was not accused of arbitrariness, and President Arce, in making war on him I did not have my sights other than to separate him from the Government of Honduras to organize it according to his interests, which he had already achieved, the President of the Republic did not worry about that, and kept the prisoner in his own house. Justo Milla temporarily took command of the province of Honduras; because on November 11, 1827, it was defeated by the forces of General Francisco Morazán in the battle of La Trinidad. Later, Morazán marched to Comayagua where he took command of the state of Honduras from the hands of Miguel Eusebio Bustamante. In June 1828, Morazán handed over command to Diego Vigil.

===Transfer of the capital===

«That rivalry between the radical Comayagua and the liberal Tegucigalpa became more and more accentuated every day and was notorious at the time of independence and in the consolidation of the State from 1825, when the first Constitution was issued. The ideas of alternating the capital on an annual basis began then as a political approach that arose in the Cedros mineral, an intention that only remained in that. »15

In June 1849, while Dr. Juan Lindo of the Constituent Assembly chaired by Don Felipe Jáuregui was president of Honduras, he issued a decree transferring the capital to Tegucigalpa, but it was not executed due to legal inconsistencies and Comayagua continued to be the seat of state powers.

Through the eighteenth century, Tegucigalpa was taking advantage of Comayagua; Several buildings of important institutions were erected there such as &quot;the Literary Academy, the genesis of the current National Autonomous University of Honduras.&quot; 15 Finally, on 30 October 1880, President Marco Aurelio Soto made the &quot;decision to transfer the capital of Honduras from Comayagua to Tegucigalpa Dr. Marco Aurelio Soto Martínez, for economic or social reasons, picked up luggage and moved to his hometown thus ending that antagonism &quot;between the two cities.

After the transfer of the capital to Tegucigalpa, the population, commerce, and importance of Comayagua was notably reduced. At the beginning of the 19th century, its narrow and irregular streets were poorly paved. Also, public buildings were in poor condition. However, this city continued to be the seat of the diocese of Honduras.

== Geography ==
A mountainous system surrounds the valley in which the city of Comayagua is located; where the main mountains are: Mountains of Montecillos, are to the west of La Paz.

On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, 

the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building.

Also, many catholic saints are represented in the carpets like Saint Jude the Apostle. These traditions had their roots in southern Spain and were mostly practiced in Guatemala and Hondurans during the colony. The Honduran &quot;Semana santa&quot; have been compared to the one celebrated in Andalusia Spain in cities like Seville due to its incredible similarity to the old Spanish catholic tradition taught to the indigenous people.

Other famous traditions of Comayagua are the mixes of indigenous and Spanish elements, like &quot;el baile de los diablito&quot;s (littles devils dance), where dancers wore colorful clothes and masks that represent something like an animal, a person, or a mythological creature.

<text>Albert Paddock Crary (July 25, 1911 – October 29, 1987), was an American pioneer polar geophysicist and glaciologist. He was the first person to have set foot on both the North and South Poles, having made it to the North Pole on May 3, 1952 (with Joseph O. Fletcher and William P. Benedict) and then to the South Pole on February 12, 1961, as the leader of a team of eight. The South Pole expedition set out from McMurdo Station on December 10, 1960, using three Snowcats with trailers. Crary was the seventh expedition leader to arrive at the South Pole by surface transportation (the six others before him were—in sequence—Amundsen, Scott, Hillary, Fuchs, a Russian expedition in 1959–60 from Vostok base, and Antero Havola). He was widely admired for his intellect, wit, skills and as a great administrator for polar research expeditions.

==Biography==
Crary was born in 1911 into a farming family in northern New York State. He was the second oldest in a family of 7 children. He was a physics major and geology student at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. He graduated in 1931 Phi Beta Kappa from St. Lawrence University and then enrolled at Lehigh University to obtain a master&#x27;s degree in physics. After spending years completing and facilitating research at both poles, Crary eventually settled in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife and son.

His awards included the Cullum Geographical Medal (1959), the Patron&#x27;s Medal (1963), and the Vega Medal (1972).

He died on October 29, 1987, at the George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C.

==Legacy==
In 1991, the National Science Foundation (NSF), which manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP), honoured his memory by dedicating a state-of-the-art laboratory complex in his name, the Albert P. Crary Science and Engineering Center (CSEC) located in McMurdo Station. He was also honored by having the Crary Mountains (76 degrees 48&#x27; S, 117 degrees 40&#x27; W) and the Crary Ice Rise in Antarctica named for him as well.

==Contributions==
Dr. Crary contributed in a variety of important ways to his field including:
* Chief Scientist for Arctic T3, Fletcher&#x27;s Ice Island, 1952–1955
* Established the United States Geological Headquarters for the International Geophysical Year, 1955
* Deputy Leader of United States science during the International Geophysical Year, 1957
* Leader of the U.S. seismic traverse of Ross Ice Shelf, 1957–1958
* Leader, geophysical traverse W from Little America V, up Skelton Glacier to the Victoria Land plateau and W along the 78 parallel to c. 13130E, 1958–1959
* Leader, geophysical traverse from McMurdo Station via Skelton Glacier to the South Pole, 1960–1961
* Chief Scientist, United States Antarctic Research Program, 1960–1968
* Deputy then Director, Division of Environmental Sciences, National Science Foundation, 1969–1978
* Member of ACAN, 1961–76 (Chairman, 1974–1976)

He worked with many notable scientists and famous institutions:
* Dr. Maurice Ewing of Columbia University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
* Assisted Dr. James Peoples at MOGUL (Project Mogul) as the Field Operations Director using meteorological balloons to experiment with different types of equipment to collect and transmit sound waves in the upper atmosphere (Roswell incident- see Project Mogul)

<text>Lao art involves the myriad of forms creative, cultural expression originating from Laos. This includes both ancient artifacts and recent productions. Laotian Art often features Buddhist themes and includes such material forms as textiles, wood-carving and basket-weaving. Lao art is well known for its wealth of ornamentation

==Ceramics==

Lao ceramics were first uncovered in 1970 at a construction site at kilometer 3, Thadeua Road in the Vientiane area, Mekong Valley, Laos. Construction was halted only temporarily, and the kiln was hastily and unprofessionally excavated over a one-month period. At least four more kilns have been identified since then, and surface evidence and topography indicate at least one hundred more in the Ban Tao Hai Village of the Jar Kilns vicinity Archaeologists have labeled the area Sisattanak Kiln Site

===Further research===
* The work was carried out by a team of Laotian archaeologists and Australian archaeologists.
* A large number of ceramics (sherds, debris, and intact pieces) have been found there, some decorative objects, and molded pipes.
* The scientific tests done at the geographical location of the oven outside the first compound of Vientiane suggest that this site would date from the fifteenth century.
* The uncovered objects were grouped into four kinds: raw sandstone, glazed sandstone (bowls, dishes, jars, oil lamps, vases, weights for fishing net, chess pieces), molded pipes, and Qcendi pottery (utensils, stoves, and cooking pots). 
* Sisattanak&#x27;s pottery remains what archaeologists consider to be &quot;simple&quot;, utilitarian, showing a lack of creativity on the part of the potters which would be the result of weak influences, or external competition.

== Textiles==

The production of woven and embroidered textiles is the most prolific of all traditional crafts in Laos. Almost all regions of the country are suitable for the farming of cotton and mulberry trees, which are often planted on cooperative land with a view to providing raw materials for the wider community. Textiles are made of perishable materials and only survive the millennia when preserved under exceptional circumstances. Archaeological finds point to a high level of skill and sophistication at an astoundingly early date. The first prestigious garments were probably the skins of dangerous animals worn by daring hunters. In tropical regions, the alternative to leather was the inner bark of certain trees, which was beaten until it became soft. Succeeding generations developed more flexible fibres, with the invention of spinning which was used in different parts of the world to make yarn from wool, linen, cotton, or silk. Colour is very essential to textiles. In Laos, many villages, however, produce organic dyes from plants, roots, insect, resin, and soil. Raw dye materials are crushed or sliced and then boiled to extract the colour. The sediment is removed and the remaining liquid is suitable as a dye. Dyes are absorbed into the very fibres of textiles, ensuring a much longer lifetime than paints. Of the exceptional wealth of ornamentation, four groups of motifs have been distinguished: 
# Mythical Animals under the Water: Naga, a serpent; Louang, a serpent with legs and feet like a dragon; Eua, a serpent with no crest; Nark, a crested serpent.
# Mythical Animals on Earth: Crab; Khon Khob, the frogman; Khon Thani, the gibbon person; Siho, the lion-elephant; Mom, the magical horse; Hong, the magical swan; Houng, the mythical eagle; Hadsadiling, the bird-elephant.
# Plant Designs: tree, flower, vine, seed, fruit, leaf, and geometrical shapes like zigzag line, diamond, hook, and/or star.
# Religious Motifs: Buddha head, Stupa, a temple shaped like a pyramid, and/or ancestors riding on mythological animals.

==Buddhist sculpture==

Lao artisans have, throughout the past, used a variety of media in their sculptural creations. Of the metals, bronze is probably the most common, but gold and silver images also exist. Typically, the precious metals are used only for smaller objects, but some large images have been cast in gold, most notably the Phra Say of the sixteenth century, which the Siamese carried home as booty in the late eighteenth century. It is in enshrined at Wat Po Chai in Nongkhai, Thailand, just across the Mekong River from Vientiane. The Phra Say&#x27;s two companion images, the Phra Seum and Phra Souk, are also in Thailand. One is in Bangkok and the other is in Lopburi. Perhaps the most famous sculpture in Laos, the Phra Bang, is also cast in gold, but the craftsmanship is held to be of Sinhalese, rather than Lao, origin. Tradition maintains that relics of the Buddha are contained in the image.

<text>Lao ceramics refers to ceramic art and pottery designed or produced as a form of Lao art. The tradition of Lao ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Laos and its neighbours.

== History ==
Ceramics were first uncovered in 1970 at a construction site at kilometer 3, Thadeua Road in the Vientiane area of the Mekong Valley. Construction was halted only temporarily, and the kiln was hastily and unprofessionally excavated over a one-month period. At least four more kilns have been identified since then, and surface evidence and topography indicate at least one hundred more in the Ban Tao Hai (Village of the Jar Kilns) vicinity. Archaeologists have labeled the area Sisattanak Kiln Site. 

According to Honda and Shimozu (The Beauty of Fired Clay: Ceramics from Burma, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, 1997), the Lao kilns are similar to the Siamese types found at Suphanburi and Si Satchanalai. But Hein, Barbetti and Sayavongkhamdy (An Excavation at the Sisattanak Kiln Site, Vientiane, Lao P.D.R., 1989, 1992) say that the Lao kilns, which are of a cross-draft clay-slab type, differ substantially not only from the Siamese types but all other types in Southeast Asia. 

Because only one kiln, VS8, has been excavated, almost no questions regarding Lao ceramic tradition have been answered. The VS8 kiln though showed no evidence of brick construction. It had square chimney foundations, a narrow firebox, and was built partly above ground. 

The Sisattanak Kiln Site lies just outside Vientiane&#x27;s first city walls, which are dated to the 15th century. Radiocarbon dating of the kiln gives a 15th-17th century timeframe, with an earlier period of that range most likely. This is supported by the evidence of surface finds, which suggest that area kilns at higher elevations show a greater ratio of glazed to unglazed wares. The theory is that the kilns were moved up over time and that more glazed wares were fired over time. This is supported by the ceramics uncovered at VS8, a lower-elevation site, which were all of a utilitarian and domestic nature. They included pipes, domestic wares and architectural fittings. 

The VS8 excavation uncovered both unglazed and glazed wares. Most of the glazed wares were pipes; 1,500 pipe fragments and complete pieces were collected. Their quality indicates a well-developed tradition, and their motifs suggest the possibility that they were export wares. 

From the examples collected to date, it can be said that Lao ceramics used one kind of clay, with 5% quartz added as a temper. Both the clay and the quartz were finely crushed. The glazed wares were a light, translucent green (like celadon) or various shades of brown. There have also been shards showing an olive-colored glaze, not unlike the type found in Thailand. 

Many of the glazed wares have ribbed or fluted exteriors, similar to that of the silver bowls ubiquitous in Laos, both the regular silver bowls (&quot;oh tum&quot;) and the silver stem bowls (&quot;khan&quot;). Glazed ceramic stem bowls have been collected as surface finds at the Sisattanak Kiln Site. Decorations to glazed wares show a great measure of restraint, with simple incisions, stamps and fluting. Unglazed wares are similarly austere. They are generally not decorated with incisions or stamps, which are common in other Southeast Asian wares. 

The VS8 excavation in 1989 added to an ever-increasing body of evidence that Lao ceramic tradition is significant. Future excavations are expected to prove that Lao ceramic production was comparable to that of other countries in the region.

<doc id="209493" wikidata="Q846544" url="?curid=209493" title="Disaster film">
<text>A disaster film or disaster movie is a film genre that has an impending or ongoing disaster as its subject and primary plot device. Such disasters may include natural disasters, accidents, military/terrorist attacks or global catastrophes such as a pandemic. A subgenre of action films, these films usually feature some degree of build-up, the disaster itself, and sometimes the aftermath, usually from the point of view of specific individual characters or their families or portraying the survival tactics of different people.

These films often feature large casts of actors and multiple plot lines, focusing on the characters&#x27; attempts to avert, escape or cope with the disaster and its aftermath. The genre came to particular prominence during the 1970s with the release of high-profile films such as &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), followed in quick succession by &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).

The casts are generally made up of familiar character actors. Once the disaster begins in the film, the characters are usually confronted with human weaknesses, perhaps falling in love or finding a villain to blame. The films usually feature a persevering hero or heroine (Charlton Heston, Steve McQueen, etc.) called upon to lead the struggle against the threat; in many cases, the &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;selfish&quot; individuals are the first to succumb to the disaster. The genre experienced a renewal in the 1990s boosted by computer-generated imagery and larger studio budgets which allowed for greater spectacle, culminating in the cinematic phenomenon that was James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997.

==Origins==
Disaster films were made before the phrase was coined in the early 1970s. The genre is almost as old as the film medium itself. One of the earliest was &quot;Fire!&quot; (1901) made by James Williamson of England. The silent film portrayed a burning house and the firemen who arrive to quench the flames and rescue the inhabitants. Origins of the genre can also be found in &quot;In Nacht und Eis&quot; (1912), about the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;; &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1913), also about the &quot;Titanic&quot;; the Danish &quot;The End of the World&quot; (1916), (about a comet); &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1928), the Biblical story from Genesis about the great flood; &quot;Deluge&quot; (1933), about tidal waves devastating New York City; &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), with a gigantic gorilla rampaging through New York City; and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1935), dealing with the Mount Vesuvius volcanic eruption in 79 AD.

John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937) concluded with the striking sequence of a tropical cyclone ripping through a fictional South Pacific island. The drama &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936) depicted the historic 1906 San Francisco earthquake, while &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; (1937) recreated The Great Chicago Fire which burned through the city in 1871. Carol Reed&#x27;s 1939 film, &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot;, examines a catastrophe at a coal mine in North-East England.

Inspired by the end of World War II and the beginning of the Atomic Age, science fiction films of the 1950s, including &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1951), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953) and &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956), routinely used world disasters as plot elements. This trend would continue with &quot;The Deadly Mantis&quot; (1957), &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot; (1961) and &quot;Crack in the World&quot; (1965). Volcanic disasters would also feature in films such as &quot;The Devil at 4 O&#x27;Clock&quot; (1961) starring Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra, and the 1969 epic &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot; starring Maximilian Schell.

As in the silent film era, the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; would continue to be a popular disaster with filmmakers and audiences alike. Werner Klingler and Herbert Selpin released the epic film &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1943. The film was soon banned in Germany and its director, Selpin, was allegedly executed. The film was a staple for all Titanic films, and scenes became stock footage for the British version. Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck starred in the 1953 20th Century Fox production &quot;Titanic&quot;, followed by the highly regarded British film &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; in 1958. The British action-adventure film &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1960), while not about the Titanic disaster but a predecessor to &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, starred Robert Stack as a man desperately attempting to save his wife (Dorothy Malone) and child trapped in a sinking ocean liner. The film, concluding with the dramatic sinking of the ship, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

Additional precursors to the popular disaster films of the 1970s include &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), starring John Wayne and Robert Stack as pilots of a crippled airplane attempting to cross the ocean; &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; (1957), written by Arthur Hailey (who also penned the 1968 novel &quot;Airport&quot;) about an airplane crew that succumbs to food poisoning; &quot;Jet Storm&quot; and &quot;Jet Over the Atlantic&quot;, two 1959 films both featuring attempts to blow up an airplane in mid-flight; &quot;The Crowded Sky&quot; (1960) which depicts a mid-air collision; and &quot;The Doomsday Flight&quot; (1966), written by Rod Serling and starring Edmond O&#x27;Brien as a disgruntled aerospace engineer who plants a barometric pressure bomb on an airliner built by his former employer set to explode when the airliner descends for landing.

==1970s peak==
The golden age of the disaster film began in 1970 with the release of &quot;Airport&quot;. A huge financial success, earning more than $100 million ($713 million in 2022-adjusted dollars) at the box office, the film was directed by George Seaton and starred Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, George Kennedy, Jacqueline Bisset and Helen Hayes. While strictly not even a disaster—an airplane crippled by the explosion of a bomb—the film established the classic blueprint of the genre: a headline emergency story and multiple plotlines acted out by an all-star cast. &quot;Airport&quot; was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Supporting Actress for Hayes.

The 1972 release of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; was another huge financial success, notching an impressive $84 million in US/Canada gross rental theatrical rentals ($592 Million in 2022-adjusted dollars); the disaster film officially became a movie-going craze. Directed by Ronald Neame and starring Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters and Red Buttons, the film detailed survivors&#x27; attempts at escaping a sinking ocean liner overturned by a giant wave triggered by an earthquake. &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Shelley Winters, and winning for Original Song and receiving a Special Achievement Award for visual effects.

The trend reached its zenith in 1974 with the release of &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, &quot;Earthquake,&quot; and &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (the first &quot;Airport&quot; sequel). The competing films enjoyed staggering success at the box office, with &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; earning $116 million ($697 million in 2022-adjusted dollars), &quot;Earthquake&quot; earning $79 million ($475 million in 2022-adjusted dollars), and &quot;Airport 1975&quot; earning $47 million ($282 million in 2022-adjusted dollars) in theatrical rentals.

Arguably the greatest of the 1970s disaster films, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; was a joint venture of 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. and was produced by Irwin Allen (eventually known as &quot;The Master of Disaster&quot;, as he had previously helmed &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and later produced &quot;The Swarm&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; and &quot;When Time Ran Out...&quot;). Directed by John Guillermin and starring Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden and Faye Dunaway, the film depicts a huge fire engulfing the tallest building in the world and firefighters&#x27; attempts at rescuing occupants trapped on the top floor. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Original Song.

&quot;Earthquake&quot; was also honored with four Academy Award nominations for its impressive special effects of a massive earthquake leveling the city of Los Angeles, winning for Best Sound and receiving a Special Achievement Award for visual effects. The film was directed by Mark Robson and starred Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, Geneviève Bujold, George Kennedy and Lorne Greene. It was noted as the first film to utilize Sensurround, where massive subwoofer speakers were installed in theaters to recreate the vibrating sensation of an earthquake. Several made-for-TV movies also capitalized on the craze, including &quot;Heatwave!&quot; (1974), &quot;The Day the Earth Moved&quot; (1974), &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1974), &quot;Flood!&quot; (1976) and &quot;Fire!&quot; (1977).

The trend continued on a larger scale with &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975), starring George C. Scott; &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot; (1976), starring Burt Lancaster; &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot; (1976), starring Charlton Heston; &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977), starring Robert Shaw; &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; in Sensurround (1977), starring George Segal; &quot;Damnation Alley&quot; (1977), starring Jan-Michael Vincent; &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1978), starring Rock Hudson; &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot; (1978), also starring Charlton Heston; &quot;Hurricane&quot; (a 1979 remake of John Ford&#x27;s 1937 film; a different movie than the made-for-TV production of same title listed above), starring Jason Robards; and &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1979), starring Barry Newman. The &quot;Airport&quot; series continued with &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Concorde ... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979), with George Kennedy portraying the character Joe Patroni in each sequel, and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; was followed by &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; in 1979.

The genre began to burn out by the late-1970s when the big-budget films &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978), &quot;Meteor&quot; (1979), &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1979), &quot;The Concorde ... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979), &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1979) and &quot;When Time Ran Out...&quot; (1980) performed poorly at the box office, signaling declining interest in the disaster film product.

Although &quot;The Big Bus&quot; (1976), an earlier disaster film spoof, had failed to be a hit, the end of the trend was marked by the 1980 comedy &quot;Airplane!&quot;, which fondly spoofed the clichés of the genre to surprising box-office success, producing a sequel of its own, &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;, in 1982.

==1990s revival==

The resurgence of big-budget productions of the genre—aided by advancements in CGI technology during the 1990s—include such films as &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot;, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;, &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;Hard Rain&quot;, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;. In 1997, James Cameron co-produced, wrote and directed a version of the epic story of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The film combined romance with intricate special effects and was a massive success, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time for twelve years with over $2.2 billion worldwide, and won 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.

<text>William Sherman Pène du Bois (May 9, 1916 – February 5, 1993) was an American writer and illustrator of books for young readers. He is best known for &quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot;, published in April 1947 by Viking Press, for which he won the 1948 Newbery Medal. He was twice a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal for illustrating books written by others, and the two Caldecott Honor picture books, which he also wrote.

From 1953 to 1960, Pène du Bois was art editor of &quot;The Paris Review,&quot; working alongside founder and editor George Plimpton.

== Early life ==

William Pène du Bois was born in Nutley, New Jersey in May 1916. His mother was Florence Sherman Pène du Bois who worked as a children&#x27;s fashion designer until &quot;Billy&quot; was about seven years old. His father Guy Pène du Bois was a noted art critic and a painter known for landscapes and portraits. His older sister Yvonne (born 1913, later Yvonne Pène du Bois McKenney) would become a painter and their cousin Raoul Pene Du Bois would become a noted costume and scenic designer. Their Du Bois ancestors had moved from France to New Orleans in 1738.

When William was eight the family moved to France, where he was educated at the Lycée Hoche in Versailles and the Lycée de Nice in Nice. They returned to Nutley when he was 14. After high school he was accepted by the Carnegie Technical School of Architecture, and offered a scholarship, but he sold a book that he had written and illustrated to pass the time during a vacation and pursued the creation of books rather than college. Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons accepted &quot;Elisabeth, the Cow Ghost&quot; in 1935, when he was nineteen, and published it in 1936.

== Writing career ==

By the time he entered the army in March 1941 at age 24, he had written and illustrated five more books. He spent his years in the army (1941–1945) with an artillery unit stationed in Bermuda. He worked as a correspondent for &quot;Yank&quot; magazine. He also edited the camp newspaper and illustrated strategic maps.

In addition to writing and illustrating his own books, Pène du Bois illustrated books written by Jules Verne, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Rumer Godden, Claire Huchet Bishop and John Steinbeck, as well as magazine articles and advertisements. 
In 1960 he developed an interest in vintage cars, going to great pains and expense to refurbish a 1931 Brewster Croydon Coupe Rolls-Royce P11.

He was one of the founding editors of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; along with Thomas Guinzburg, Harold L. Humes, Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton, and John P. C. Train, and designed the publication&#x27;s logo. He illustrated &quot;The Rabbit&#x27;s Umbrella&quot; by George Plimpton, published in 1955.

The highlight of his career was winning the Newbery Medal in 1948 for &quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot;. As an illustrator he was a runner-up for the companion Caldecott Medal in 1952 for &quot;Bear Party&quot; and in 1957 for &quot;Lion&quot;. He was the illustrator for Claire Huchet Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Twenty and Ten&quot;, which won the Child Study Association of America&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Award (now Josette Frank) in 1952.

Some of his books including &quot;Bear Party&quot; and &quot;Lion&quot; are children&#x27;s picture books with a minimum of text. &quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot;, however – and others including &quot;The Three Policemen&quot;, &quot;The Great Geppy&quot;, &quot;Squirrel Hotel&quot;, &quot;Peter Graves&quot; and &quot;The Giant&quot; – appeal to all ages. These books exhibit whimsical ingenuity in story and illustrations. Though not usually so classified, these books seem to qualify as science fiction. Their interest lies more in their imaginative elaboration of ideas than in their characters. Some of his fictional ideas are fantastic but many are plausible, and some such as the Balloon Merry-Go-Round in &quot;The Twenty-one Balloons&quot; may be feasible. Many show the influence of Jules Verne.

Many of his papers are in the collection of the New York Public Library, Humanities and Social Sciences Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division.

==Personal life==

Pène du Bois married Jane Michele Bouche of Manhattan, daughter of artist Louis Bouche, in 1943. They later divorced and in 1955 he married theatrical costume designer Willa Kim.

Children&#x27;s book illustrator Margot Tomes was a cousin, as was theatrical costume and set designer Raoul Pene Du Bois.

He died on February 5, 1993, in Nice, France, from a stroke.

==Books==

* &quot;The Great Geppy&quot; (1940) – his fifth book published, featured on one page of a &quot;Life&quot; magazine story about his family
A striped horse (NOT a zebra) is hired to solve a robbery at a circus. To investigate the crime, Geppy poses as a variety of circus entertainers, including a freak, a tightrope walker, and a lion tamer. In the end he discovers that there has not been any theft; rather, the culprit has been breaking into the company safe to contribute money to the financially struggling circus. For his success, Geppy is honored as a hero and is even appointed the circus&#x27;s newest star: he gives an extraordinary performance when shot from a cannon.

*&quot;The Flying Locomotive&quot; (1941)
*&quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot; (1947)
A schoolteacher who decides to spend a year in a balloon but, because of an accident, crashes on Krakatoa. It turns out that the island is populated by twenty families who share the wealth of a secret diamond mine. They have used their wealth to build elaborate houses which also serve as restaurants. They have a calendar with a 20-day month. On A day, everyone eats in Mr. and Mrs. A&#x27;s American restaurant; on B day, in Mrs. and Mrs. B&#x27;s British chop house; on C day, in Mr. and Mrs. C&#x27;s Chinese restaurant; on D day, in Mr. and Mrs. D&#x27;s Dutch restaurant, and so forth. When Krakatoa explodes, the families and the protagonist escape on a flying platform lofted by twenty balloons.

*&quot;Peter Graves: An Extraordinary Adventure&quot; (1950)
A well-meaning but mischievous boy who encounters a gentlemanly and not-very-mad scientist named Houghton Furlong. Furlong is the inventor of an antigravity material named Furloy, and a Furloy-based invention called &quot;the ball that bounces higher than the height from which you drop it.&quot; In an unfortunate accident with the latter invention, Peter destroys Houghton&#x27;s house. Little of value is left in the wreckage except six balls of Furloy, each about the size of a golf ball, with an antigravity pull of 25 pounds-force (110 newtons) each. Peter commits himself to spending the summer with Houghton in an attempt to earn the $45,000 necessary to rebuild his house. The implied puzzle is: how can Peter and Houghton make use of the six Furloy balls to earn $45,000?

*&quot;Bear Party&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Squirrel Hotel&quot; (1952) – a bittersweet story about a man who builds an elaborate hotel for squirrels
With illustrations of the dollhouse-like structure full of squirrels sniffing, playing, sliding down spiral slides, and generating electricity for the lighting by running around a squirrel cage. The man disappears and the narrator tries to find him by tracing his purchases (48 miniature four-poster beds; 1 gross flashlight bulbs; 2 electric motors, Meccano; 6 American flags; etc.).

*&quot;The Giant&quot; (1954)
An eight-year-old boy is seven stories tall because he has &quot;a perfect digestive system&quot;: if the boy eats one pound of food, he gains one pound of body mass. Illustrations show the various arrangements made by family and friends to take care of him. He is sweet and well-mannered, but great effort is taken to conceal him because of the fear and hostility giants arouse. The narrator befriends him and comes up with a plan to introduce him to the public in such a way that they will accept him, so he will not need to spend his life in concealment.

*&quot;Lion&quot; (1956)
An angel tries to design the animal known to us as a lion. This angel is new to the skill of designing animals, and his first few attempts are reviewed by his fellow artists as lacking for one reason or another. The angel perseveres and eventually Lion is perfected. It is a story about art, artists, creativity, and finding one&#x27;s place in the world – for both the angel (amidst his fellow angels) and the lion.

*&quot;Castles and Dragons&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Otto in Texas&quot; (1959) – Otto the giant dog visits Texas, where he discovers a dinosaur skeleton and a tunnel used by oil rustlers

* &quot;Lazy Tommy Pumpkinhead&quot; (1966)
A boy lives in an electric house that automatically tips him out of bed into the bath, dresses him and feeds him breakfast every morning without requiring him to move a muscle. After each morning routine he yawningly climbs up a staircase that takes him until bedtime to reach the top of, at which point he tiredly goes to bed and sleeps until next morning&#x27;s automatic wakeup. However, a power failure incapacitates the entire house and causes Tommy to sleep for seven days. When the power resumes, his bed tips him into seven-day-cold water. Shivering and struggling to get out of the tub, he lands upside-down in his clothes, is showered with a seven-day backup of breakfast food, and ends up sitting in a big mess on the floor. This serves as a moral to children not to be lazy, but to arise promptly every morning, take their own bath, and dress and feed themselves.

* &quot;The Horse in the Camel Suit&quot; (1967)
The town policeman, in a huff, locks up a show troupe and a young detective contrives to set them free without hurting the policeman&#x27;s feelings. He discovers, however, that they actually are criminals, and he must get them behind bars again.

<text>Knettishall Heath is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Knettishall in Suffolk, England. A larger area of 176 hectares is the Knettishall Heath Nature Reserve, which is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust.

Despite its name, Knettishall Heath is in fact a diverse mosaic of habitats with woodland and riverside meadows, as well as large areas of heath.

==Ecology==
The site is heath and grassland, mainly on acidic soils, with areas of secondary woodland and wet hollows. There are heathland plants such as sheep&#x27;s sorrel, tormentil, harebell, ling and heath bedstraw, while wet areas have fen vegetation including water mint and yellow iris.

===Rare species===
Of the more than 12,500 species living in the Brecks, 30% are nationally rare. The heath is home to the rare grey carpet moth which is only found in Breckland, and the lunar yellow underwing moth. Seven bat species are found at Knettishall, including the nationally scarce barbastelle bat. 

===Exmoor ponies===

In 2013, a five-year funded project to restore lowland heath at the nature reserve began. As part of this project, 19 wild Exmoor ponies have roamed and grazed the land, helping other species to thrive. The &#x27;Vision for the Future&#x27; project was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and WREN - a not-for-profit organisation that offers grants for heritage and biodiversity schemes.

The shrinkage of heathland has been caused partially by a decline in rabbits grazing; rabbit populations have been decimated by myxomatosis and more recently rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The addition of ponies grazing the heathland looks to reverse this shrinkage.

==Archaeology==
An 18th century rabbit warren and a Bronze Age burial mound at Hut Hill are evidence of thousands of years of human occupation in the area. 

At the western end of the heath, ‘patterned ground’ shows evidence of the last ice age. Repeated freezing and thawing of ground created a unique mix of the sandy soil and the underlying chalk. Unusual vegetation stripes reflect the two soil types, and the different plants that grow in each.

==Footpaths==
It is the site where four long-distance footpaths meet: Angles Way, Icknield Way, Iceni Way and Peddars Way (part of the Norfolk Coast Path, a National Trail). The Icknield Way joins with the Peddars Way at the end of its journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire. The Icknield Way trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also joins with the Peddars Way riders route.

The Hereward Way ends nearby in East Harling, and it linked to Knettishall Heath by path. 

==Access==
There are several access points to the heathland, most found off the road between Knettishall and Rushford villages. The main car park for the area can be found on an unnamed road (informally known as Heath Road) off Spalding&#x27;s Chair Hill. 

The A1066 passes within a mile or two of the heathland, where it runs from Thetford to Garboldisham.

<text>A database engine (or storage engine) is the underlying software component that a database management system (DBMS) uses to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data from a database. Most database management systems include their own application programming interface (API) that allows the user to interact with their underlying engine without going through the user interface of the DBMS.

The term &quot;database engine&quot; is frequently used interchangeably with &quot;database server&quot; or &quot;database management system&quot;. A &quot;database instance&quot; refers to the processes and memory structures of the running database engine.

==Storage engines==

Many of the modern DBMS support multiple storage engines within the same database. For example, MySQL supports InnoDB as well as MyISAM.

Some storage engines are transactional.

Additional engine types include:
* Embedded database engines
* In-memory database engines

==Design considerations==
Information in a database is stored in the form of bits, laid out into data structures on storage hardware. These data structures are designed for efficient reads and writes to and from the storage hardware. Typically the storage hardware itself is designed to meet the requirements of various systems, including databases, that extensively utilize storage. An operating DBMS always utilizes several storage types simultaneously. These different storage types, such as flash memory and external disk storage, each require different data layout methods.

In principle, database storage can be viewed as a linear address space where every bit of data has a unique address. In practice, only a very small percentage of addresses are kept as initial reference points, which also require storage. Most data is accessed instead by indirection using displacement calculations (distance in bits from the reference points) and data structures which define access paths (using pointers) to all needed data in an effective manner, optimized for the needed data access operations.

===Database storage hierarchy===
A database, while in operation, resides simultaneously in several types of storage, forming a storage hierarchy. Inside of a contemporary computer hosting a DBMS, most of the &quot;database&quot; part resides, partially replicated, in volatile storage. Data that are actively being processed and manipulated reside inside the processor, possibly in processor&#x27;s caches. These data are read from and written to memory, typically through a computer bus, which is usually a volatile storage component. Computer memory communicates data to and from external storage, typically through standard storage interfaces or networks (e.g., fibre channel, iSCSI). 

A storage array, a common external storage unit, typically has storage hierarchy of its own. A fast cache, typically consisting of volatile and fast DRAM, is connected (via standard interfaces) to drives. These drives may have different speeds, like flash drives and non-volatile magnetic disk drives. Speed and price are generally correlated. The drives may be connected to magnetic tapes, on which the least active parts of a large database may reside. This may also be where backups are located.

===Data structures===

A data structure is an abstract construct that embeds data in a well defined manner. An efficient data structure allows manipulation of the data in efficient ways. The data manipulation may include data insertion, deletion, updating and retrieval in various modes. A certain data structure type may be very effective in certain operations, and very ineffective in others. A data structure type is selected upon DBMS development to best meet the operations needed for the types of data it contains. Type of data structure selected for a certain task typically also takes into consideration the type of storage it resides in (e.g., speed of access, minimal size of storage chunk accessed, etc.). In some DBMSs database administrators have the flexibility to select among options of data structures to contain user data for performance reasons. Sometimes the data structures have selectable parameters to tune the database performance.

Databases may store data in many data structure types. Common examples are the following:
*ordered/unordered flat files
*hash tables
*B+ trees
*ISAM
*heaps

===Data orientation and clustering===
In contrast to conventional row-orientation, relational databases can also be column-oriented or correlational in the way they store data in any particular structure.

In general, substantial performance improvement is gained if different types of database objects that are usually utilized together are laid in storage in proximity, being &quot;clustered&quot;. This usually allows to retrieve needed related objects from storage in minimum number of input operations (each sometimes substantially time-consuming). Even for in-memory databases clustering provides performance advantage due to common utilization of large caches for input-output operations in memory, with similar resulting behavior.

For example, it may be beneficial to cluster a record of an &quot;item&quot; in stock with all its respective &quot;order&quot; records. The decision of whether to cluster certain objects or not depends on the objects&#x27; utilization statistics, object sizes, caches sizes, storage types, etc.

===Database indexing===

Indexing is a technique some storage engines use for improving database performance. The many types of indexes share the common property that they reduce the need to examine every entry when running a query. In large databases, this can reduce query time/cost by orders of magnitude. The simplest form of index is a sorted list of values that can be searched using a binary search with an adjacent reference to the location of the entry, analogous to the index in the back of a book. The same data can have multiple indexes (an employee database could be indexed by last name and hire date).

Indexes affect performance, but not results. Database designers can add or remove indexes without changing application logic, reducing maintenance costs as the database grows and database usage evolves. Indexes can speed up data access, but they consume space in the database, and must be updated each time the data is altered. Indexes therefore can speed data access but slow data maintenance. These two properties determine whether a given index is worth the cost.

<text>Souligna Vongsa (ສຸຣິຍະວົງສາທັມມິກຣາດ ) was the king of Lan Xang whose reign is considered the golden age of Laos. He ascended to the throne in 1637.

==King of Lan Xang==
In 1637, Souligna Vongsa ascended the throne after the nobles elected him over his two older brothers. King Souligna Vongsa reigned for 57 years during which Laos experienced &quot;The Golden Age&quot; with regard to territory, prestige and power.

He assured stability by immediately banishing any possible rivals, sending one of his brothers to Vietnam and the other one into a solitary priesthood, and sending his cousins west, towards Siam. He was a strict and austere monarch, and ran the country according to firm laws. He was greatly respected as a ruler, and within five years of his ascension, his reputation reached the Dutch representatives of the Dutch East India Company who were in Phnom Penh. The Jesuit Giovanni Maria Leria arrived in Vientiane at the same time as the Dutch merchants 1641 and received the first European envoys into Laos.

Much of what we know about seventeenth-century Laos comes from the descriptions of these visitors. Despite the disruptions that spanned the period from Setthathirath&#x27;s death to Souligna Vongsa&#x27;s ascension, Lan Xang, as Laos was called, apparently recovered very quickly. Both Van Wuystoff, the Dutchman, and Leria, who spent six years in Laos, were impressed with the nation&#x27;s prosperity. Van Wuystoff noted the great number of monasteries and the monks, &quot;more numerous than the soldiers of the King of Prussia.&quot; John Philip de Marini, who recorded and published Leria&#x27;s visit, noted that monks went from Siam to Laos &quot;as to University.&quot; The support of a large idle population, the monkhood, which harmed Laos&#x27; national economic development, nevertheless impressed both visitors. The first chapter of Marini&#x27;s account is subtitled, The Greatness, Riches and Power of Laos. Both described the free market and flourishing trade, which supplied Europe with gum benzoin, lac, musk (&quot;the first musk that has appeared in Europe from this part of the world.&quot; - de Marini) and other products. The palace of the king, de Marini would describe,

:&quot;the structure and symmetry of which are remarkable can be seen from afar. It is truly vast and is so extensive that one would take it for a city... The King&#x27;s quarters... have a very beautiful and magnificent façade... embellished inside and out with splendid bas relief gilded so finely that they appear to be covered with gold laminations... I would have to fill an entire book... to describe all the other parts of the palace in detail, their richness, their apartments, their gardens...&quot;

The king claimed to recognize no other as his equal, though he concluded friendly treaties with neighboring countries. With King Narai of Ayutthaya, he built the Phra That Si Song Rak (Stupa of the Affectionate Two) at Dan Sai (now in Loei province of Thailand) to commemorate their friendship and set the boundary of their kingdoms.

In contrast to his friend Narai, however, who received ambassadors with great pomp, wore splendid and elaborate vestments and enjoyed the use of the finest foreign luxuries—velvets and rich Persian carpets, Souligna Vongsa wore no crowns, and preferred sitting on reed mats. Though the mats of Lan Xang, were evidently more beautiful than they are today; de Marini writes of them, for example, that &quot;the weaving is so delicate and the ornamentation with patterns and various leaf-works so well done that, in my opinion, there is nothing more beautiful and more pleasing to the eye;&quot; it is apparent from the accounts of the foreign visitors that the great king lived a far from decadent life. Rather, they noted that he distributed his wealth in the service of religion.

In the golden age of Lan Xang, wealth was primarily spent on religion, rather than on equipping the army with European weapons. It was one of the crucial reasons why the kingdom declined following his rule.

==Death==
In 1694, Souligna died and was heirless. He had two sons, the eldest one having been executed for adultery and the other son having fled to Ayutthaya with his mother, step-mother and 600 followers in February 1686, after his father ordered their execution because he was found to be co-habiting with his half-sister with their full knowledge. This was a chaotic time in Laotian history wherein the empire completely collapsed with the kingdom splitting into three new kingdoms: Vientiane, Luang Phrabang and Kingdom of Champasak.

<doc id="209506" wikidata="Q6487760" url="?curid=209506" title="Lao Buddhist sculpture">
<text>Lao Buddhist sculptures were created by the Lao people of Southeast Asia. They are typically made of bronze, although gold and silver images can also be found. The Vat Manorom is believed to be the oldest colossal Lao Buddhist sculpture. Today, the sculpture gardens of Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat provide a modern twist to the ancient tradition.

==Media for the sculptures==
Lao artisans have, throughout the past, used a variety of media in their sculptural creations. Of the metals, bronze is probably the most common, but gold and silver images also exist. Typically, the precious metals are used only for smaller objects, but some large images have been cast in gold, most notably the Phra Sai of the sixteenth century, which the Siamese carried home as loot in the late eighteenth century. It is enshrined at Wat Po Chai in Nongkhai, Thailand, just across the Mekong River from Vientiane. The Phra Sai&#x27;s two companion images, the Phra Serm and Phra Souk, are also in Thailand. One is in Bangkok and the other is in Lopburi. Perhaps the most famous sculpture in Laos, the Phra Bang, is also cast in gold, but the craftsmanship is held to be of Sinhalese, rather than Lao, origin. Tradition maintains that relics of the Buddha are contained in the image.
Bronze is an alloy of copper, containing about two percent tin. Other materials are often added, however, and the balance of ingredients determines the characteristics of the bronze. In Laos, like Cambodia and Thailand, the bronze, which is called &quot;samrit&quot;, includes precious metals, and often has a relatively high percentage of tin, which gives the newly-cast images a lustrous dark gray color. Other images, such as the Buddha of Vat Chantabouri in Vientiane, have a higher copper and, probably, gold content that give them a muted gold color.

===Notable sculptures===
A number of colossal images in bronze exist. Most notable of these are the Phra Ong Teu (16th century) of Vientiane, the Phra Ong Teu of Sam Neua, the image at Vat Chantabouri (16th century) in Vientiane and the image at Vat Manorom (14th century) in Luang Phrabang, which seems to be the oldest of the colossal sculptures. The Manorom Buddha, of which only the head and torso remain, shows that colossal bronzes were cast in parts and assembled in place.

Brick-and-mortar also seems to be a favorite medium for colossal images. Perhaps the most famous of these is the image of Phya Vat (16th century) in Vientiane, though apparently an unfortunate renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha.

Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha.

The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The Emerald Buddha) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen (Chiang Saen) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late eighteenth century. It now serves as the palladium of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat was also taken to Bangkok, today it resides at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall. Before the Siamese seized it in the early nineteenth century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of Champassack.

Many mostly wooden Lao Buddhist sculptures have been assembled inside the Pak Ou caves.

==Modern developments==

The religious art tradition of the region has received an original contemporary twist in the monumental fantastic sculpture gardens of Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat: Buddha Park near Vientiane, and Sala Keoku near Nong Khai, Thailand.

<doc id="209518" wikidata="Q944039" url="?curid=209518" title="Rapper's Delight">
<text>&quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; is a 1979 hip hop track that serves as the debut single of American hip-hop trio the Sugarhill Gang, produced by Sylvia Robinson. Although it was shortly preceded by the Fatback Band&#x27;s &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot;, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; is credited for introducing hip hop music to a wide audience, reaching the top 40 in the United States, as well as the top three in the United Kingdom and number one in Canada. It was a prototype for various types of rap music. The track interpolates Chic&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot;, resulting in Chic&#x27;s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards threatening to sue Sugar Hill Records for copyright infringement; a settlement was reached that gave the two songwriting credits. It also interpolates Love De-Luxe&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes That Sound Again&quot;. The track was recorded in a single take. There are five mixes of the song.

&quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; was ranked at number 251 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2010, and number 2 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs&quot;. It is also included on NPR&#x27;s list of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century. It was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2011 for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2014, the record was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
In late 1978, Debbie Harry suggested that Chic&#x27;s Nile Rodgers join her and Chris Stein at a hip-hop event, which at the time was a communal space taken over by teenagers with boombox stereos playing various pieces of music that performers would break dance to. Rodgers experienced this event the first time himself at a high school in the Bronx. On September 20 and 21, 1979, Blondie and Chic were playing concerts with the Clash in New York at the Palladium. When Chic started playing &quot;Good Times&quot;, rapper Fab Five Freddy and the members of the Sugarhill Gang (&quot;Big Bank Hank&quot; Jackson, &quot;Wonder Mike&quot; Wright, and &quot;Master Gee&quot; O&#x27;Brien), jumped up on stage and started freestyling with the band. A few weeks later, Rodgers was on the dance floor of New York club Leviticus and heard the DJ play a song which opened with Bernard Edwards&#x27; bass line from Chic&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot;. Rodgers approached the DJ who said he was playing a record he had just bought that day in Harlem. The song turned out to be an early version of &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, which also included a scratched version of the song&#x27;s string section. Rodgers and Edwards immediately threatened legal action over copyright, which resulted in a settlement and their being credited as co-writers. Rodgers admitted that he was originally upset with the song, but later declared it to be &quot;one of his favorite songs of all time&quot; and his favorite of all the tracks that sampled (or in this instance interpolated) Chic. He also stated: &quot;As innovative and important as &#x27;Good Times&#x27; was, &#x27;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&#x27; was just as much, if not more so.&quot;

A substantial portion of the early stanzas of the song&#x27;s lyrics was borrowed by Jackson from Grandmaster Caz (Curtis Brown) who had loaned his &#x27;book&#x27; to him—these include a namecheck for &quot;Casanova Fly&quot;, which was Caz&#x27;s full stage name. According to Wonder Mike, he had heard the phrase &quot;hip-hop&quot; from a cousin, leading to the opening line of &quot;Hip-hop, hippie to the hippie, to the hip-hip-hop and you don&#x27;t stop&quot;, while he described &quot;To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat&quot; as &quot;basically a spoken drum roll. I liked the percussive sound of the letter B&quot;. The line &quot;Now what you hear is not a test, I&#x27;m rappin&#x27; to the beat&quot;, was inspired by the introduction to &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (&quot;There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture&quot;).

Before the &quot;Good Times&quot; background starts, the intro to the recording is an interpolation of &quot;Here Comes That Sound Again&quot; by British studio group Love De-Luxe, a disco hit in 1979.

According to Oliver Wang, author of the 2003 &quot;Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide&quot;, recording artist (&quot;Pillow Talk&quot;) and studio owner Sylvia Robinson had trouble finding anyone willing to record a rap song. Most of the rappers who performed in clubs did not want to record, as many practitioners believed the style was for live performances only. It is said that Robinson and her son overheard Big Bank Hank in a pizza parlour. According to Master Gee, Hank auditioned for Robinson in front of the pizza parlor where he worked, while Gee himself auditioned in Robinson&#x27;s car. A live band was used to record most of the backing track, including members of the group &quot;Positive Force&quot;: Albert Pittman, Bernard Roland, Moncy Smith, and Bryan Horton.
Chip Shearin claimed during a 2010 interview that he was the bass player on the track. At the age of 17, he had visited a friend in New Jersey. The friend knew Robinson, who needed some musicians for various recordings, including &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;. Shearin&#x27;s job on the song was to play the bass for 15 minutes straight, with no mistakes. He was paid $70 but later went on to perform with Sugarhill Gang in concert. Shearin described the session this way:
The drummer and I were sweating bullets because that&#x27;s a long time. And this was in the days before samplers and drum machines, when real humans had to play things. ... Sylvia said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got these kids who are going to talk real fast over it; that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.&#x27;

Wang said:
There&#x27;s this idea that hip-hop has to have street credibility, yet the first big hip-hop song was an inauthentic fabrication. It&#x27;s not like the guys involved were the &#x27;real&#x27; hip-hop icons of the era, like Grandmaster Flash or Lovebug Starski. So it&#x27;s a pretty impressive fabrication, lightning in a bottle.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; peaked at number 36 in January 1980 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart in December 1979. The song was much more successful internationally, reaching number one on the Canadian Top Singles chart in January 1980, number one on the Dutch Top 40, and number three on the UK Singles Chart. In 1980, the song was the anchor of the group&#x27;s first album &quot;The Sugarhill Gang&quot;.

It was the first top 40 song to be available only as a 12-inch extended version in the US. Early pressings (very few) were released with a red label, with black print, on Sugar Hill Records, along with a 7&quot; 45rpm single (which is very rare). Later pressings had the more common blue label, in orange colored &quot;roulette style&quot; sleeves, fashioned after the label for Roulette Records; Roulette&#x27;s Morris Levy and reputed mobster Tony Riviera had invested in Sugar Hill. Even later pressings were issued in the more common blue sleeves with the Sugarhill Records logo. In Europe, however, it was released on the classic 7-inch single format on French pop label Vogue, with a shorter version of the song. It was this 7&quot; single that reached number one in the Dutch chart. The song ranked number 251 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2004 list of &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

A British version of the song, with rewritten lyrics, was recorded for the song&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2004 by an ensemble of performers including Rodney P, Chester P, Kano, Simone, Yungun, Sway, J2K, Swiss, Baby Blue, Skibadee, Luke Skys, and MC D.

==Music videos==
The Sugar Hill Gang appeared on the syndicated Soap Factory Disco Show in late 1979, and their performance later became the song&#x27;s official music video. The group&#x27;s performance on the Palisades Park-based program demonstrates the significant overlap between early hip-hop and disco of the late 1970s.

Alternate music videos exist as well. One appears to have been recorded by Dutch broadcasting company AVRO at a hotel pool in early 1980.

The theme was used in Cog, a Honda advertisement.

==Legacy==
&quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Charles M. Blow recalled his memories of the song, hearing it in the rural South: &quot;It sounded revolutionary, even when I was a child, or perhaps especially when I was a child. And it was. It was fierce and fun, simultaneously foreign and familiar.&quot; He added:

The song appears on the soundtrack of several video games. The long single version appears in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, while the full version (albeit censored) appears in &quot;MLB 2K10&quot;. It also appears in Forza Horizon 4, on one of the game&#x27;s radio stations. A cover of the song is on the track list for &quot;Just Dance 2024 Edition&quot;.

The chorus of the 2002 international hit The Ketchup Song (Aserejé) by Las Ketchup is a Spanish gibberish version of Wonder Mikes bit in &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;.

<text>The bandoneon () or bandonion is a type of concertina particularly popular in Argentina and Uruguay. It is a typical instrument in most tango ensembles. As with other members of the concertina family, it is held between the hands, and played by pulling and pushing air through bellows, routing it through sets of tuned metal reeds by pressing the instrument&#x27;s buttons. Unlike most accordions, bandoneons always employ the same sets of reeds to produce their sound, and do not usually have the register switches common on accordions. Nevertheless, the bandoneon can be played very expressively, using various bellows pressures and other techniques. The left and right hand have different timbres due to the wooden box on the left side which gives the left hand a nasal and muted timbre, in contrast with the right hand which is usually bright and sharp.

==History==
The Bandonion, so named by the German instrument dealer Heinrich Band (1821–1860), was originally intended as an instrument for religious and popular music of the day, in contrast to its predecessor, German concertina (), which had predominantly been used in folk music. It is believed that around 1870, German and Italian emigrants and sailors brought the instrument to Argentina, where it was adopted into the nascent genre of tango music, a descendant of the earlier milonga. However, there is no documentation of how exactly the bandoneon was introduced in the Rio de La Plata region. The instrument was also adopted in the in genres such as the Chamamé.

By 1910 bandoneons were being produced in Germany expressly for the Argentine and Uruguayan markets, with 25,000 shipping to Argentina in 1930 alone. However, declining popularity and the disruption of German manufacturing in World War II led to an end of bandoneon mass-production.

The bandoneon was introduced to tango music with prominent composers and bandoneonists such as Eduardo Arolas and Vicente Greco and later was developed into the sextet formation (with two bandoneons) with Pedro Maffia and Pedro Laurenz whose style and technique established the base for the bandoneon section in the orquesta típica.

Original instruments can be seen in a number of German museums, such as the Preuss family&#x27;s Bandoneon Museum in Lichtenberg and the Steinhart family&#x27;s collection in Kirchzarten, Freiburg, which has now been moved to the Tango- and Bandoneon museum in Staufen since July 2014.

Historically, bandoneons were produced primarily in Germany and never in Argentina itself, despite their popularity in that country. As a result, by the 2000s vintage bandoneons had become rare and expensive (costing around $4,000), limiting the opportunities for prospective bandeonists. In 2014, the National University of Lanús announced its plan to develop an affordable Argentine-made bandoneon, which it hoped to market for one-third to one-half of the cost of vintage instruments.

==Technique==

As with other members of the concertina family, the bandoneon is held between the hands, and pulling and pushing actions force air through bellows and then through particular reeds as selected by pressing the instrument&#x27;s buttons. As with other concertinas, the button action is parallel to the motion of the bellows, and not perpendicular to it as with an accordion.

===Bisonoric===
Unlike the piano accordion, but in similar fashion to diatonic free-reed instruments such as the melodeon, Anglo concertina, or harmonica, a given bandoneon button produces different notes on the push and the pull. This means that each keyboard has two layouts: one for opening notes, and one for closing notes. Since the right and left hand layouts are also different, the bandoneon player is faced with learning four completely different keyboard layouts. Because of this challenge, many tango players play almost entirely on the draw/pull, and largely eschew the close stroke (using the air release button to quickly close the bellows, before resuming playing on the pull stroke).

These keyboard layouts are not structured to make it easy to play scale passages of single notes: they were originally laid out to facilitate playing chords in familiar keys, for supporting singers of religious music in small churches with no organ or harmonium, or for clergy requiring a portable instrument (missionaries, traveling evangelists, army and navy chaplains, and so forth). The original more limited bandoneon layouts were supplemented more and more over time with extra chromatic keys, as the musical needs of bandoneon players became more demanding, leading to many variations. 

Because of their origin in earlier diatonic systems that were gradually expanded to include other notes of the chromatic scale over time, bisonoric instruments are often referred to as &quot;diatonic&quot; bandoneons, although, with the later instruments, as used in tango, this description became a misnomer, as the instruments are now capable of playing in all keys. &quot;Diatonic&quot; can also be re-analysed, through folk etymology, to refer to the two (di) different tones played by each key, that is to say, bisonoric.

===Unisonoric===
While the standard bandoneon is bisonoric (different note on push and pull), with an idiosyncratic and difficult to learn layout, some bandoneon variants are unisonoric or monosonoric (same note on push and pull). These include the Ernst Kusserow and Charles Peguri systems, both introduced around 1925. These have some popularity in Europe, but in Argentina, the 142-tone 71-key system still dominates, as most tango repertoire was written on, and is idiomatic to, this system, and therefore certain runs and scale passages written for the tango bandoneon are more difficult on the unisonoric system.

In the 21st century, further efforts have been made to create a simplified bandoneon, with keyboards that mimic the isomorphic layouts of chromatic button accordions. These &quot;hybrid bandoneons&quot; are internally identical to the traditional bandoneon, and preserve the tonal qualities and response of the instrument, but are intended to be easier to learn, more suitable for improvisation, and more accessible to players of other free-reed instruments. They have a similar aim to earlier chromatic bandoneon systems, but endeavour to overcome some of their ergonomic limitations by allowing the hands to move more freely, as with the western chromatic button accordion, or eastern bayan. 

Unisonoric instruments, particularly in the Peguri system, are often referred to as &quot;chromatic bandoneons&quot;, having been designed from the beginning with the expressed purpose of being fully chromatic instruments, unlike their bisonoric cousins.

==Players==

The Argentinian bandleader, composer, arranger, and tango performer Aníbal Troilo was a leading 20th-century proponent of the bandoneon. The bandoneon player and composer Ástor Piazzolla played and arranged in Troilo&#x27;s orchestra from 1939 to 1944. Piazzolla&#x27;s &quot;Fugata&quot; from 1969 showcases the instrument, which plays the initial fugue subject on the 1st statement, then moves on to the outright tango after the introduction. With his solos and accompaniment on the bandoneon, Piazzolla combined a musical composition much derived from classical music (which he had studied intensively in his formative years) with traditional instrumental tango, to form &quot;nuevo tango&quot;, his new interpretation of the genre.

<doc id="209521" wikidata="Q1027673" url="?curid=209521" title="John N. Heiskell">
<text>John Netherland Heiskell (November 2, 1872 – December 28, 1972) was a prominent American newspaper editor who served briefly in the United States Senate after being appointed to fill a vacancy. He was the editor of the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; from 1902 until his death, and served in the United States Senate from Arkansas briefly in 1913. As the result of his long life, Heiskell attained several Senate longevity records, and was the second U.S. Senator to reach the age of 100.

==Early life==
Heiskell was born in Rogersville, Tennessee on November 2, 1872, the son of Carrick White Heiskell and Eliza (Netherland) Heiskell. He was educated at public and private schools in the Knoxville area, and graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1893.

==Start of career==
Heiskell&#x27;s family had been involved in newspaper publishing and editing for several generations, and Heiskell also pursued a career in journalism. He worked as a reporter for newspapers in Knoxville and Memphis, and reported for the Associated Press in Chicago and Louisville. In 1902, the Heiskell family bought a controlling interest in the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;, and Heiskell became the editor, with his brother Fred taking the position of managing editor.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; became known for issues-oriented reporting, and Heiskell used it as a platform to advocate for civic and charitable causes. In 1907, he published several editorials calling for construction of a public library in Little Rock. His advocacy was successful, and when the library opened, Heiskell received its first library card and an appointment to the board of directors, on which he served until his death. Heiskell&#x27;s activism also included service on the state Civil Service Commission and Planning Board and the Pulaski County Planning Board.

Under the leadership of the Heiskell brothers, their newspaper&#x27;s circulation nearly doubled in four years. As part of their issues-oriented approach, they remained neutral in Democratic primary contests (then tantamount to election in most of the South) and supported Democratic candidates against Republicans in general elections. An exception was Heiskell&#x27;s long-term editorial page feud with Governor Jeff Davis, in which Heskiell criticized Davis&#x27; record in office, and Davis accused Heskiell of operating a newspaper financed by and beholden to outsiders.

==United States Senator==
On January 3, 1913, Jeff Davis, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate in 1907, died in office. On January 6, Governor George Washington Donaghey appointed Heiskell to temporarily fill the vacancy until the Arkansas General Assembly could meet to choose a successor. On January 29, the Assembly chose William Marmaduke Kavanaugh to complete Davis&#x27; term, which was scheduled to end on March 3. The legislature also chose Governor Joseph Taylor Robinson for the full six year Senate term that began on March 4, 1913.

As a result of this political maneuvering, Heiskell served as a Senator for 23 days, which remains one of the shortest period of service ever in the U.S. Senate.

==Later career==
Heiskell continued to serve as editor of the &quot;Gazette&quot;, and produced editorials on a wide variety of issues. He advocated for city planning and for the commission form of municipal government. He opposed the Little Rock School Board&#x27;s decision to drop German language classes during World War I, and opposed anti-Semitism, though he favored limits on immigration so that recent arrivals could be more easily assimilated. His was also a supporter of Prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage, while continuing to advocate for traditional cultural morality. On the issue of race relations, Heskiell&#x27;s editorials supported segregation with the argument that &quot;separate but equal&quot; was legal and would cause the least conflict. Despite this paternalistic attitude, Heskiell was also an opponent of lynching and called for a grand jury investigation into the Little Rock mob violence that led to John Carter&#x27;s lynching in 1927.

As an avid student of Arkansas history and collector mementos and ephemera, Heskiell created an archive and library which was stored at the Gazette offices, and the Gazette was believed to be the country&#x27;s only newspaper that employed a full-time staff historian. In 1947, Heskiell selected Harry S. Ashmore to succeed him as executive editor, though Heskiell continued as editor and maintained an active interest in the Gazette&#x27;s management. When the 1957 desegregation of Little Rock&#x27;s Central High School became a contentious issue, Heiskell supported Ashmore&#x27;s advocacy for obedience to the federal courts. Ashmore&#x27;s editorials and the Gazette&#x27;s news coverage of the events surrounding the school&#x27;s desegregation resulted in the award of two Pulitzer Prizes.

==Death and burial==
He died in Little Rock on December 28, 1972. He was buried at Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock.

==Legacy==
In 1958, Heiskell received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award and the honorary degree of LL.D. degree from Colby College. In addition, he received honorary degrees from Syracuse University, Columbia University, and the University of Missouri. In addition, he received the John Peter Zenger Award and an honorary degree from the University of Arizona.

Despite his short time in the Senate, Heiskell&#x27;s long life made him the oldest living former Senator from 1966 until his death, and he was the last Senator to have served in the 1910s.

==Family==
On June 28, 1910, Heiskell married Wilhelmina Mann, the daughter of George R. Mann, a nationally prominent architect. Their children included Elizabeth (1912-1974), Louise (1921-1990), John Jr. (b. 1914), and Carrick (1917-1943). Elizabeth Keiskell was the wife of screenwriter Whitfield Cook. Louise was the wife of Hugh B. Patterson, the longtime business manager and later publisher of the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;. Their Son, Carrick, served as editor until the paper was sold to Gannett. John Jr. died reaching adulthood. Carrick died in an airplane crash while serving in World War II.

Heiskell was a grandson of two prominent Tennessee politicians, John Netherland and Frederick Heiskell.

<text>Charles Edison (August 3, 1890 – July 31, 1969) was an American politician. He was the Assistant and then United States Secretary of the Navy, and served as the 42nd governor of New Jersey. Commonly known as &quot;Lord Edison&quot;, he was a son of the inventor Thomas Edison and Mina Miller Edison.

==Early life==

Charles Edison was born on August 3, 1890, at Glenmont, the Edison family home in West Orange, New Jersey. He was Thomas Edison&#x27;s fifth child and second from his marriage to Mina Miller. He graduated from the Hotchkiss School in 1909.

In 1915–1916, he operated the 100-seat &quot;Little Thimble Theater&quot; with Guido Bruno at 10 Fifth Avenue, New York. The theater staged the works of George Bernard Shaw and August Strindberg, and Charles contributed verse to &quot;Bruno″s Weekly&quot; under the pseudonym Tom Sleeper. Late in 1915, he brought his players to Ellis Island to perform for Chief Clerk Augustus Sherman and more than four hundred detained immigrants.

These avant-garde activities came to a halt when his father put him to work. For a number of years, Charles Edison ran Edison Records. Charles became president of his father&#x27;s company Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in 1927, and ran it until it was sold in 1957, when it merged with the McGraw Electric Company to form the McGraw-Edison Electric Company. Edison was board chairman of the merged company until he retired in 1961.

==Department of the U.S. Navy (1937–1940)==
On January 18, 1937, President Roosevelt appointed Charles Edison as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, then as Secretary on January 2, 1940, Claude A. Swanson having died several months previously. Edison himself only kept the job until June 24, resigning to run for Governor of New Jersey. During his time in the Navy department, he advocated construction of the large s, and that one of them be built at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which secured votes for Roosevelt in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the 1940 presidential election; in return, Roosevelt had BB-62 named the .

==Governor of New Jersey (1941–1944)==
In 1940, he won election as Governor of New Jersey, running in reaction to the political machine run by Frank Hague, but broke with family tradition by declaring himself a Democrat. As governor, he proposed updating the New Jersey State Constitution. Although it failed in a referendum and nothing was changed during his tenure, state legislators did reform the constitution later.

==Later political life==
Between 1951 and 1969, he lived in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he struck up a friendship with Herbert Hoover, who also lived there. In 1962, Edison was one of the founders of the Conservative Party of New York State.

In 1967, Edison hosted a meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York that led to the founding of the Charles Edison Youth Fund, later the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. Attending the meeting were Rep. Walter Judd (R-MN), author William F. Buckley, organizer David R. Jones, and Edison&#x27;s political advisor Marvin Liebman. The name of the organization was changed in 1985 to The Fund for American Studies, in keeping with Edison&#x27;s request to drop his name after 20 years of use.

==Personal life==
Edison married Carolyn Hawkins on March 27, 1918. They had no children.

In 1924, Edison joined the New Jersey Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was assigned national member number 39,292 and state society number 2,894.

In 1948, he established a charitable foundation, originally called &quot;The Brook Foundation&quot;, now the Charles Edison Fund.

==Death==

Charles Edison died on July 31, 1969, in New York City, three days shy of his 79th birthday. He is buried in Rosedale Cemetery in Orange, New Jersey.

<text>Monkey River (or Monkey River Town) is a village in the north of the Toledo District of Belize. It is on the Caribbean Sea on the southern shore of the mouth of Belize&#x27;s Monkey River. In 2011 the estimated population was 200 people.

The village is one of the last purely Creole settlements in Belize, and many traditional practises are still carried out, such as cooking over the &quot;fyah haat&quot; (fire hearth). A road was built in the late 80&#x27;s from the Southern Highway through orange groves and jungle to the village car park, and links the village to the outside world, although much travel is still by sea. The main occupations are fishing and ecotourism. There are two small hotels and a nearby fishing resort which can be reached by a five-minute sea trip. Guides can be easily found at Monkey River village to take visitors up the river to see the howler monkeys and other wildlife in Belize.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Monkey River had a population of 196. Of these, 81.6% were Creole, 14.3% Mixed, 1.5% East Indian, 1.5% Mestizo and 0.5% Ketchi Maya.

==History==
The village was incorporated as a town in 1891 at which time it had a population of some 2500 people, mostly engaged in the lumber and banana industry. With the decline of these industries and a blight of banana trees in this area, in the second half of the 20th century, the population declined, and in 1981 was legally reclassified as a village again, although retaining the historic name of &quot;Town&quot;.

On October 9, 2001, Hurricane Iris made landfall at Monkey River Town as a 145 mph Category Four storm. The storm demolished most of the homes in the village, and destroyed the banana crop. The area&#x27;s formerly large population of black howler monkeys was similarly greatly reduced, but has come back strongly and several troupes are to be seen along the river, a popular eco-tourist attraction. Researchers from the University of Calgary led by Dr. Mary Pavelka study the monkey population year-round.

Erosion of the southern foreshore (the intertidal zone), where the village is located, has been an important issue over recent years; this has been halted by a recent government project which installed a botan sea defence (a seawall). Further work will be carried out as finances permit. The northern foreshore is relatively unaffected.

<text>The Knack was an American rock band based in Los Angeles that rose to fame with its first single, &quot;My Sharona&quot;, an international number-one hit in 1979.

The Knack was founded in 1978 with the original and classic lineup of Doug Fieger (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Berton Averre (lead guitar, backing vocals), Prescott Niles (bass) and Bruce Gary (drums). It was this lineup that recorded the group&#x27;s first three albums. Spearheaded by the success of the &quot;My Sharona&quot; single, their first album, &quot;Get the Knack&quot; (1979), reached number-one on the charts of several countries. However, their next two albums, &quot;...But The Little Girls Understand&quot; (1980) and &quot;Round Trip&quot; (1981), were significantly less successful. Faced with diminishing success, the group disbanded in 1982.

The band reunited in 1986, and released their fourth album &quot;Serious Fun&quot; in 1991, before breaking up again the following year. After a brief reunion in 1994, the Knack reunited again in 1996, recording two more albums, &quot;Zoom&quot; (1998) and &quot;Normal as the Next Guy&quot; (2001). Following Fieger&#x27;s death in 2010, the Knack permanently disbanded. A final album, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Is Good for You: The Fieger/Averre Demos&quot; was released in 2012.

==History==
===Founding (1977–1978)===
Singer Doug Fieger was a native of Oak Park, Michigan, a northern suburb of Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the 9 Mile/Greenfield area. The brother of attorney Geoffrey Fieger (later known for representing Jack Kevorkian in a series of assisted suicide cases), Fieger had previously played in an eclectic rock band called Sky as well as the Sunset Bombers. Although Sky had received a modest amount of acclaim, including being produced by Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller, the band broke up without having any chart success. As a result, Fieger made the decision to move to Los Angeles and start another band.

Shortly after arriving in L.A., Fieger met Berton Averre (lead guitar, backing vocals and keyboards), and the two started a songwriting partnership. Fieger had also known Bruce Gary (drums) for years before forming the Knack in 1978 with Prescott Niles (bass). Niles was the last to join, a week before the band&#x27;s first show in June 1978. In the meantime, Fieger had been doubling on bass on a series of demos that the group had shopped to several record labels, all of which were rejected. Some of these songs later made up the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Get the Knack&quot;, and included &quot;Good Girls Don&#x27;t&quot;.

===&quot;Get the Knack&quot;===
Within months of their live debut, popular club gigs on the Sunset Strip, as well as guest jams with musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and Ray Manzarek, led to the band being the subject of a record label bidding war. The band was pursued by ten record labels, but decided on Capitol Records; at the time, the Knack was given the largest signing sum in the label&#x27;s history. A&amp;R executives Bruce Garfield and Bruce Ravid are credited with signing the band.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Get the Knack&quot;, was one of the year&#x27;s best-selling albums, holding the number one spot on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s album chart for five consecutive weeks and selling two million copies in the United States. The lead single, &quot;My Sharona&quot;, was a No. 1 hit in the US, and became the number-one song of 1979. The follow-up single &quot;Good Girls Don&#x27;t&quot; peaked at No. 11 in the US, and reached No. 1 in Canada.

However, the band&#x27;s rise to the top of the charts also precipitated a backlash. Capitol&#x27;s packaging of &quot;Get the Knack&quot; included a perceived cover likeness to &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; with the record&#x27;s center label being the same design and style as the Beatles&#x27; early 1960s LPs. Coupled with the band&#x27;s &quot;retro&quot; 1960s look and pop/rock sound, the company&#x27;s stylings led detractors to accuse them of being Beatles rip-offs, which the band and their record company denied. Fieger acknowledged the band&#x27;s likeness to the Beatles, claiming that it was their intention to present the Knack as a replica of the British Invasion. He went on to mention how fans of the Knack had not been able to experience the times of the 1960s, and that it was wrong to deny them the privilege of experiencing something similar. Critics fought back, claiming the band was imposing inadequate memories of the 1960s on those who didn&#x27;t know better. Soon, as &quot;Get the Knack&quot; became more popular, the band was met with hostility from other artists who felt the intense marketing of the band was invalidating their own efforts of invoking the 1960 sound. This perception, and the perception that the object of some of the Knack&#x27;s songs were teenaged girls (subsequently acknowledged when the band was years older), quickly led to a &quot;Knuke the Knack&quot; campaign led by San Francisco artist Hugh Brown.

===The follow-up albums (1980–1981)===
The Knack quickly recorded a follow-up album &quot;...But the Little Girls Understand&quot;, which was released in early 1980. Though the album went gold in the US and Japan, and platinum in Canada, it didn&#x27;t meet with the same level of commercial success as their debut. Fieger claimed in later interviews that all of the tracks for &quot;Get the Knack&quot; and &quot;...But the Little Girls Understand&quot; were written before the first LP was recorded and were intended to be put out as a double album. Additionally, the lead single &quot;Baby Talks Dirty&quot; only briefly made the US Top 40, stalling at No. 38 (but reaching No. 13 in Canada); follow-up single &quot;Can&#x27;t Put a Price on Love&quot; missed the top 40 altogether, peaking at No. 62.

After nearly a year of touring in the US, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan, starting in April 1980 the band took a year off because of exhaustion and &quot;internal dissent&quot;. They reconvened in the summer of 1981 to record their third album, &quot;Round Trip&quot;. However, the record (released in October 1981) was a commercial disappointment, only reaching No. 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, selling 150,000 copies. As well, the lead single &quot;Pay the Devil (Ooo, Baby, Ooo)&quot; peaked at No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100. The group made several concert appearances during 1981 to promote &quot;Round Trip&quot;. Keyboardist Phil Jost was brought into the lineup at this time to enable the band to duplicate the more heavily layered sound of their new release. 
With the Knack experiencing rapidly diminishing chart success, and mounting critical backlash against them, Fieger left amidst internal squabbles on December 31, 1981, just months after the release of &quot;Round Trip&quot;. Averre, Niles, and Gary briefly continued with former Roadmaster vocalist Stephen &#x27;Mac&#x27; McNally as &quot;The Game&quot; after the Knack&#x27;s initial break up. By mid-1982, the Knack had split up while Fieger formed a new band, &quot;Doug Fieger&#x27;s Taking Chances&quot;.

===Return of the Knack and final album (1986–2010)===
The Knack reunited in November 1986, to play a benefit for Michele Myers, who had been the first person to book the band for a show in 1978. They continued to play club gigs for the next several years. In July 1989, Billy Ward replaced Bruce Gary as the band&#x27;s drummer (after a brief interim by Pat Torpey of Mr. Big). In 1990, the Knack signed with Charisma Records and recorded the album &quot;Serious Fun&quot; which was released in February 1991. Lead single &quot;Rocket O&#x27; Love&quot; was a top 10 hit on US AOR stations (and a top 30 hit in Canada). To promote the song, they released a music video loaded with visual innuendo thematic to the song. Charisma collapsed after the death of the label&#x27;s founder, Tony Stratton Smith, and the group broke up again in 1992.

In 1994, with Ward back on drums, the band reunited to make some concert appearances to capitalize on the new popularity of &quot;My Sharona&quot; after its appearance in the movie &quot;Reality Bites&quot;. During that time, they appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and performed &quot;My Sharona&quot; for the first time ever on network television.

In 1996, all four original band members, including Bruce Gary, reunited in the studio one last time to record a track for a multi-artist compilation album, saluting the British band Badfinger (where the band covered Badfinger&#x27;s hit &quot;No Matter What&quot;).

The Knack continued as a touring and recording act through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Duane Leinan joined The Knack in the studio and on the road, playing bass guitar from 2008 to 2010. Terry Bozzio replaced Ward as drummer for 1998&#x27;s &quot;Zoom&quot;, and David Henderson (as &quot;Holmes Jones&quot;) took over on drums for 2001&#x27;s &quot;Normal as the Next Guy&quot; and &quot;Live at the Rock N Roll Funhouse&quot; albums. Pat Torpey then returned to take over for Henderson and played with the group until Fieger&#x27;s death in 2010.

In 2005, the Knack made an appearance on the TV program &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, performing &quot;My Sharona&quot; and Jet&#x27;s &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;.

In 2006, Doug Fieger and Berton Averre filed a lawsuit against the hip hop music group Run–D.M.C. for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the defining guitar riff from &quot;My Sharona&quot; was used without permission in the Run-D.M.C. track &quot;It&#x27;s Tricky&quot; from their 1986 album &quot;Raising Hell&quot;.

In 2006, during a performance in Las Vegas, Fieger became disoriented, developing a dull headache, and grasping for the words to the songs that he had written and performed for years. Diagnosed with two brain tumors, Fieger underwent surgery and radiosurgery and returned to performing. However, he still continued to battle brain and lung cancer until his death on February 14, 2010, in Woodland Hills, California, at the age of 57, effectively bringing the band to an end.

==Outside the Knack==
In the interim between the Knack&#x27;s break-up and 1986 reunion, Doug Fieger worked as a guest vocalist on a few tracks by Was (Not Was). (Fieger had grown up with band member Don Was; Was later produced the Knack&#x27;s album &quot;Serious Fun&quot;.) Fieger also recorded a solo album in 2000, and appeared as a solo artist in the Countdown Spectacular 2 concert series in Australia between late-August and early-September 2007. He sang the Knack favorite &quot;My Sharona&quot; only. In 1985, Averre, Niles, and Gary formed The Front with actor Steven Bauer as lead vocalist.

Bruce Gary became a producer (archive recordings of Jimi Hendrix and new recordings of The Ventures) and a sideman performing live and on studio sessions with a wide range of artists. Gary died from lymphoma on August 22, 2006, at the age of 55.

<text>The QED manifesto was a proposal for a computer-based database of all mathematical knowledge, strictly formalized and with all proofs having been checked automatically. (Q.E.D. means in Latin, meaning &quot;which was to be demonstrated.&quot;)

==Overview==
The idea for the project arose in 1993, mainly under the impetus of Robert Boyer. The goals of the project, tentatively named &quot;QED project&quot; or &quot;project QED&quot;, were outlined in the QED manifesto, a document first published in 1994, with input from several researchers. Explicit authorship was deliberately avoided. A dedicated mailing list was created, and two scientific conferences on QED took place, the first one in 1994 at Argonne National Laboratories and the second in 1995 in Warsaw organized by the Mizar group.

The project seems to have dissolved by 1996, never having produced more than discussions and plans. In a 2007 paper, Freek Wiedijk identifies two reasons for the failure of the project. In order of importance:
* Very few people are working on formalization of mathematics. There is no compelling application for fully mechanized mathematics.
* Formalized mathematics does not yet resemble real, traditional mathematics. This is partly due to the complexity of mathematical notation, and partly to the limitations of existing theorem provers and proof assistants; the paper finds that the major contenders, Mizar, HOL, and Coq, have serious shortcomings in their abilities to express mathematics.

Nonetheless, QED-style projects are regularly proposed. The Mizar Mathematical Library formalizes a large portion of undergraduate mathematics, and was considered the largest such library in 2007. Similar projects include the Metamath proof database and the mathlib library written in Lean. 

In 2014 the Twenty years of the QED Manifesto workshop was organized as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic.

<text>dBase (also stylized dBASE) was one of the first database management systems for microcomputers and the most successful in its day. The dBase system included the core database engine, a query system, a forms engine, and a programming language that tied all of these components together.

Originally released as Vulcan for PTDOS in 1978, the CP/M port caught the attention of Ashton-Tate in 1980. They licensed it, re-released it as dBASE II, and later ported it to IBM PC computers running DOS. On the PC platform in particular, dBase became one of the best-selling software titles for a number of years. A major upgrade was released as dBase III and ported to a wider variety of platforms, including UNIX and VMS. By the mid-1980s, Ashton-Tate was one of the &quot;big three&quot; software publishers in the early business-software market, along with Lotus Development and WordPerfect.

Starting in the mid-1980s, several companies produced their own variations on the dBase product and especially the dBase programming language. These included FoxBASE+ (later renamed FoxPro), Clipper, and other so-called xBase products. Many of these were technically stronger than dBase, but could not push it aside in the market. This changed with the poor reception of dBase IV, whose design and stability were so lacking that many users switched to other products.

In the early 1990s, xBase products constituted the leading database platform for implementing business applications. The size and impact of the xBase market did not go unnoticed, and within one year, the three top xBase firms were acquired by larger software companies:
* Borland purchased Ashton-Tate
* Microsoft bought Fox Software
* Computer Associates acquired Nantucket

By the opening decade of the 21st century, most of the original xBase products had faded from prominence and many had disappeared entirely. Products known as dBase still exist, owned by dBase LLC.

==History==

===Origins===

In the late 1960s, Fred Thompson at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was using a Tymshare product named RETRIEVE to manage a database of electronic calculators, which were at that time very expensive products. In 1971, Thompson collaborated with Jack Hatfield, a programmer at JPL, to write an enhanced version of RETRIEVE, which became the JPLDIS project. JPLDIS was written in FORTRAN on the UNIVAC 1108 mainframe, and was presented publicly in 1973. When Hatfield left JPL in 1974, Jeb Long took over his role.

While working at JPL as a contractor, C. Wayne Ratliff entered the office football pool. He had no interest in the game as such, but felt he could win the pool by processing the post-game statistics found in newspapers. In order to do this, he turned his attention to a database system and, by chance, came across the documentation for JPLDIS. He used this as the basis for a port to PTDOS on his kit-built IMSAI 8080 microcomputer, and called the resulting system Vulcan (after the home planet of Mr. Spock on &quot;Star Trek&quot;).

===Ashton-Tate===
George Tate and Hal Lashlee had built two successful start-up companies: Discount Software, which was one of the first to sell PC software programs through the mail to consumers, and Software Distributors, which was one of the first wholesale distributors of PC software in the world. They entered into an agreement with Ratliff to market Vulcan, and formed Ashton-Tate (the name Ashton was chosen purely for marketing reasons) to do so. Ratliff ported Vulcan from PTDOS to CP/M. Hal Pawluk, who handled marketing for the nascent company, decided to change the name to the more business-like &quot;dBase&quot;. Pawluk devised the use of lower case &quot;d&quot; and all-caps &quot;BASE&quot; to create a distinctive name. Pawluk suggested calling the new product version two (&quot;II&quot;) to suggest it was less buggy than an initial release. dBase II was the result and became a standard CP/M application along with WordStar and SuperCalc.

In 1981, IBM commissioned a port of dBase for the then-in-development PC. The resultant program was one of the initial pieces of software available when the IBM PC went on sale in the fall of 1981. dBase was one of a few &quot;professional&quot; programs on the platform then, and became a huge success. The customer base included not only end-users, but an increasing number of &quot;value added resellers&quot;, or VARs, who purchased dBase, wrote applications with it, and sold the completed systems to their customers. The May 1983 release of dBase II RunTime further entrenched dBase in the VAR market by allowing the VARs to deploy their products using the lower-cost RunTime system.

Although some critics stated that dBase was difficult to learn, its success created many opportunities for third parties. By 1984, more than 1,000 companies offered dBase-related application development, libraries of code to add functionality, applications using dBase II Runtime, consulting, training, and how-to books. A company in San Diego (today known as Advisor Media) premiered a magazine devoted to the professional use of dBase, Data Based Advisor; its circulation exceeded 35,000 after eight months. All of these activities fueled the rapid rise of dBase as the leading product of its type.

===dBase III===

As platforms and operating systems proliferated in the early 1980s, the company found it difficult to port the assembly language-based dBase to target systems. This led to a rewrite of the platform in the C programming language, using automated code conversion tools. The resulting code worked, but was essentially undocumented and inhuman in syntax, a problem that would prove to be serious in the future.

In May 1984, the rewritten dBase III was released. Although reviewers widely panned its lowered performance, the product was otherwise well reviewed. After a few rapid upgrades, the system stabilized and was once again a best-seller throughout the 1980s, and formed the famous &quot;application trio&quot; of PC compatibles (dBase, Lotus 123, and WordPerfect). By the fall of 1984, the company had over 500 employees and was taking in US$40 million a year in sales (equivalent to $ million in ), the vast majority from dBase products.

====Cloning====
There was also an unauthorized clone of dBase III called Rebus in the Soviet Union. Its adaptation to the Russian language was reduced to the mechanical replacement of the name, the russification of the help files and the correction of the sorting tables for the Russian language.

===dBase IV===
Introduced in 1988, after delays,
dBase IV had &quot;more than 300 new or improved features&quot;. By then, FoxPro had made inroads,
and even dBase IV&#x27;s support for Query by Example and SQL were not enough. dBase IV added a built-in screen generator; in dBASE III and earlier, third party screen generators were available, including Luis Castro&#x27;s &quot;ViewGen&quot; which was purchased by Fox Software and bundled with FoxPro 1.0 as &quot;FoxView&quot;.

Along the way, Borland, which had bought Ashton-Tate, brought out a revised dBase IV in 1992 but with a focus described as &quot;designed for programmers&quot; rather than &quot;for ordinary users&quot;.

==dBase / xBase programming language==

For handling data, dBase provided detailed procedural commands and functions to

* open and traverse records in data files (e.g., USE, SKIP, GO TOP, GO BOTTOM, and GO recno), 
* manipulate field values (REPLACE and STORE), and 
* manipulate text strings (e.g., STR() and SUBSTR()), numbers, and dates.

dBase is an application development language and integrated navigational database management system which Ashton-Tate labeled as &quot;relational&quot; but it did not meet the criteria defined by Dr. Edgar F. Codd&#x27;s relational model. &quot;dBASE used a runtime interpreter architecture, which allowed the user to execute commands by typing them in a command line “dot prompt.” Similarly, program scripts (text files with PRG extensions) ran in the interpreter (with the DO command).

Over time, Ashton-Tate&#x27;s competitors introduced so-called clone products and compilers that had more robust programming features such as user-defined functions (UDFs), arrays for complex data handling. Ashton-Tate and its competitors also began to incorporate SQL, the ANSI/ISO standard language for creating, modifying, and retrieving data stored in relational database management systems.

Eventually, it became clear that the dBase world had expanded far beyond Ashton-Tate. A &quot;third-party&quot; community formed, consisting of Fox Software, Nantucket, Alpha Software, Data Based Advisor Magazine, SBT and other application development firms, and major developer groups. Paperback Software launched the flexible and fast VP-Info with a unique built-in compiler. The community of dBase variants sought to create a dBase language standard, supported by IEEE committee X3J19 and initiative IEEE 1192. They said &quot;xBase&quot; to distinguish it from the Ashton-Tate product.

Ashton-Tate saw the rise of xBase as an illegal threat to its proprietary technology. In 1988 they filed suit against Fox Software and Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) for copying dBase&#x27;s &quot;structure and sequence&quot; in FoxBase+ (SCO marketed XENIX and UNIX versions of the Fox products). In December 1990, U.S. District judge Terry Hatter Jr. dismissed Ashton-Tate&#x27;s lawsuit and invalidated Ashton-Tate&#x27;s copyrights for not disclosing that dBase had been based, in part, on the public domain JPLDIS. In October 1991, while the case was still under appeal, Borland International acquired Ashton-Tate, and as one of the merger&#x27;s provisions the U.S. Justice Department required Borland to end the lawsuit against Fox and allow other companies to use the dBase/xBase language without the threat of legal action.

By the end of 1992, major software companies raised the stakes by acquiring the leading xBase products. Borland acquired Ashton-Tate&#x27;s dBase products (and later WordTech&#x27;s xBase products), Microsoft acquired Fox Software&#x27;s FoxBASE+ and FoxPro products, and Computer Associates acquired Nantucket&#x27;s Clipper products. Advisor Media built on its Data Based Advisor magazine by launching FoxPro Advisor and Clipper Advisor (and other) developer magazines and journals, and live conferences for developers. However, a planned dBase Advisor Magazine was aborted due to the market failure of dBase IV.

By the year 2000, the xBase market had faded as developers shifted to new database systems and programming languages. Computer Associates (later known as CA) eventually dropped Clipper. Borland restructured and sold dBase. Of the major acquirers, Microsoft stuck with xBase the longest, evolving FoxPro into Visual FoxPro, but the product is no longer offered. In 2006 Advisor Media stopped its last-surviving xBase magazine, FoxPro Advisor. The era of xBase dominance has ended, but there are still xBase products. The dBase product line is now owned by dBase LLC which currently sells dBASE PLUS 12.3 and a DOS-based dBASE CLASSIC (dbDOS to run it on 64-bit Windows).

Some open source implementations are available, such as Harbour, xHarbour, and Clip.

In 2015, a new member of the xBase family was born: the XSharp (X#) language, maintained as an open source project with a compiler, its own IDE, and Microsoft Visual Studio integration. XSharp produces .NET assemblies and uses the familiar xBase language. The XSharp product was originally created by a group of four enthusiasts who have worked for the Vulcan.NET project in the past. The compiler is created on top of the Roslyn compiler code, the code behind the C# and VB compilers from Microsoft.

===Programming examples===
Today, implementations of the dBase language have expanded to include many features targeted for business applications, including object-oriented programming, manipulation of remote and distributed data via SQL, Internet functionality, and interaction with modern devices.

The following example opens an employee table (&quot;empl&quot;), gives every manager who supervises 1 or more employees a 10-percent raise, and then prints the names and salaries.
 USE empl
 REPLACE ALL salary WITH salary * 1.1 FOR supervisors &gt; 0
 LIST ALL fname, lname, salary TO PRINT
 * (comment: reserved words shown in CAPITALS for illustration purposes)
Note how one does not have to keep mentioning the table name. The assumed (&quot;current&quot;) table stays the same until told otherwise. Because of its origins as an interpreted interactive language, dBase used a variety of contextual techniques to reduce the amount of typing needed. This facilitated incremental, interactive development but also made larger-scale modular programming difficult. A tenet of modular programming is that the correct execution of a program module must not be affected by external factors such as the state of memory variables or tables being manipulated in other program modules. Because dBase was not designed with this in mind, developers had to be careful about porting (borrowing) programming code that assumed a certain context and it would make writing larger-scale modular code difficult. Work-area-specific references were still possible using the arrow notation (&quot;B-&gt;customer&quot;) so that multiple tables could be manipulated at the same time. In addition, if the developer had the foresight to name their tables appropriately, they could clearly refer to a large number of tables open at the same time by notation such as (&quot;employee-&gt;salary&quot;) and (&quot;vacation-&gt;start_date&quot;). Alternatively, the alias command could be appended to the initial opening of a table statement which made referencing a table field unambiguous and simple. For example. one can open a table and assign an alias to it in this fashion, &quot;use EMP alias Employee&quot;, and henceforth, refer to table variables as &quot;Employee-&gt;Name&quot;.

Another notable feature is the re-use of the same clauses for different commands. For example, the FOR clause limits the scope of a given command. (It is somewhat comparable to SQL&#x27;s WHERE clause.) Different commands such as LIST, DELETE, REPLACE, BROWSE, etc. could all accept a FOR clause to limit (filter) the scope of their activity. This simplifies the learning of the language.

dBase was also one of the first business-oriented languages to implement string evaluation.
 i = 2
 myMacro = &quot;i + 10&quot;
 i = &amp;myMacro
 * comment: i now has the value 12
Here the &quot;&amp;&quot; tells the interpreter to evaluate the string stored in &quot;myMacro&quot; as if it were programming code. This is an example of a feature that made dBase programming flexible and dynamic, sometimes called &quot;meta ability&quot; in the profession. This could allow programming expressions to be placed inside tables, somewhat reminiscent of formulas in spreadsheet software.

However, it could also be problematic for pre-compiling and for making programming code secure from hacking. But, dBase tended to be used for custom internal applications for small and medium companies where the lack of protection against copying, as compared to compiled software, was often less of an issue.
==File formats==
A major legacy of dBase is its file format, which has been adopted in a number of other applications. For example, the shapefile format, developed by ESRI for spatial data in its PC ArcInfo geographic information system, uses .dbf files to store feature attribute data.

Microsoft recommends saving a Microsoft Works database file in the dBase file format so that it can be read by Microsoft Excel.

A package is available for Emacs to read xbase files.

LibreOffice and OpenOffice Calc can read and write all generic dbf files.

dBase&#x27;s database system was one of the first to provide a header section for describing the structure of the data in the file. This meant that the program no longer required advance knowledge of the data structure, but rather could ask the data file how it was structured. There are several variations on the .dbf file structure, and not all dBase-related products and .dbf file structures are compatible. VP-Info is unique in that it can read all variants of the dbf file structure.

A second filetype is the file format for memo fields. While character fields are limited to 254 characters each, a memo field is a 10-byte pointer into a file which can include a much larger text field. dBase was very limited in its ability to process memo fields, but some other xBase languages such as Clipper treated memo fields as strings just like character fields for all purposes except permanent storage.

dBase uses files for single indexes, and &quot;(multiple-index)&quot; files for holding between 1 and 48 indexes. Some xBase languages such as VP-Info include compatibility with files while others use different file formats such as used by Clipper and used by FoxPro or FlagShip. Later iterations of Clipper included drivers for indexes.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot;″s Jerry Pournelle in July 1980 called Vulcan &quot;infuriatingly excellent&quot; because the software was powerful but the documentation was poor. He praised its speed and sophisticated queries, but said that &quot;we do a lot of pounding at the table and screaming in rage at the documentation&quot;.

&quot;Is [dBASE IV 1.0] worth the wait? I think so&quot;, Malcolm Rubel wrote in the magazine in 1989, describing it as &quot;a quantum leap over dBASE III Plus in functionality, power, and ease of use&quot;. He said that the software was 100% upward compatible as Ashton-Tate had promised, and praised Control Center as greatly improving on III Plus&#x27;s Assist mode. The magazine noted early reports of bugs and promised a followup, but concluded that &quot;the product seems solid overall&quot;.

<doc id="209538" wikidata="Q1083004" url="?curid=209538" title="Nim Li Punit">
<text>Nim Li Punit () is a Maya Classic Period site in the Toledo District of the nation of Belize, located 50 kilometres north of the town of Punta Gorda, and directly adjacent to the village of Indian Creek. Nim Li Punit is sometimes known as Big Hat or Top Hat; the name is Kekchi Maya for &quot;Big Hat&quot;, referring to the large elaborate head-dress on a stela sculpture found on site depicting one of the site&#x27;s ancient kings. It is bordered by the Maya Mountains to the west and lowland swamps and the Caribbean Sea to the east. 

Nim Li Punit is a medium-sized site from the Maya Classic Period, flourishing from the 5th century AD through the 8th century AD. It consists of structures around three plazas, including several step-pyramids, the tallest being 11 meters high. It was populated in the Maya Classic Period and reached a maximum population of around 7000 residents, but was rapidly abandoned when the Maya civilization began to decline. There was extensive trade throughout the region in goods such as obsidian during this period. In addition to trade, fertile soils in the area helped in the success of the settlement. Archaeological exploration of Nim li Punit began in 1976, though the site was already known to locals. 

==Geography and geology==

Nim Li Punit is situated in the foothills of the Maya Mountains in close proximity to multiple mountain streams. The Maya Mountains form a nearly impenetrable backdrop of forest to the north and west, while the expansive somewhat swampy coastal lowlands adjoining the Caribbean Sea lie to the east. Low-lying swampland between the Sarstoon and Temash Rivers is situated to the south. The site is within two kilometres of Belize&#x27;s Southern Highway, accessed by an unpaved road. (The Southern Highway itself is paved in the vicinity of the site). Area soils are relatively fertile for tropical standards, and explain the region&#x27;s ability to support sizeable indigenous settlements such as Nim Li Punit. Local sandstones are found in nearby stream and river beds, and these materials were used as the principal building stones for the site&#x27;s structures and stelae. The Maya Mountains and foothills are among the oldest surface rock formations of Central America; these Paleozoic sediments were uplifted about 200 million years ago in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Early Permian periods.

== Economy and trade ==

In addition to Nim li Punit, the Maya Mountains of Southern Belize contain four major Maya archaeological sites- Xnaheb, Lubaantun, Uxbennka, and Pushilha. All these sites are in close proximity to one another, with the farthest site from Nim li Punit, Pushilha, being only 47 kilometers to the southwest. Despite their close geographic proximity, the extent of the economic and political relationships between Nim li Punit and these other polities is still debated, and scholars remain unsure of what allowed them all to thrive so close to one another. Archaeologists have used goods with economic value in Maya culture discovered at Nim li Punit have to draw conclusions on the extent to which these interactions occurred.

One of these goods that has been extensively uncovered at Nim li Punit is obsidian. Obsidian was used to denote status in the Maya Classic Period and was available primarily to royalty. An analysis of obsidian artifacts from Nim li Punit and Lubaantun, revealed that the majority of the obsidian they received originated from El Chayal and Ixtepeque, which are both located in present-day Guatemala. Compared to Lubaantun, Nim li Punit received around twice as much obsidian from Ixtepeque. The ratio of the total mass of obsidian compared to the total mass of pottery was also approximately twice as high at Nim li Punit than at Lubaantun. Overall, obsidian was more abundant at Nim li Punit than other nearby settlements.

==Architecture==

The ancient city of Nim Li Punit was laid out in a fashion consistent with other Maya lowland Classic Era sites, such as Lubaantun, Pusilha and Uxbenka; the latter two of these sites are deemed to have arisen earlier than the former two. Nim Li Punit is constructed in the Classic Period prototypical geometric form, using large amounts of fill material to achieve expansive plazas and terraces. 

It is thought that within the Plaza of the Stela in the South Group that there is an &quot;E Group&quot; geometry that would have been used for astronomical observations. For example, several monuments present before a long terrace known as Structure One, which mark the location of solstices and equinoxes. Unlike Lubaantun, where dry-stone construction was employed, the stone structures are cemented with Maya mortar; moreover, the elaborate notched jointing often found in Lubaantun is absent in Nim Li Punit.

==Population and occupation==

The peak population of Nim Li Punit is estimated to have been in the range of 5000 to 7000 people during the peak occupation Late Classic period. Early residents of this site probably migrated from Guatemala, similar to the history of nearby Lubaantun. The peoples of Nim Li Punit are thought to have spoken a dialect of the Cholan language, commonly spoken in the Maya heartland. Evidence from carved stelae document that the site was active in the period 721 to 790 AD, based upon actual Maya calendar dates inscribed on at least six different stones. As at many other Maya sites, occupation of Nim Li Punit ceased rather suddenly in the 9th century AD, probably associated with areawide overpopulation exceeding the region&#x27;s carrying capacity of the then prevalent milpa farming system. The Nim Li Punit population is thought to have aligned with Maya settlements such as Tikal in the Petén Basin region of Guatemala.

==Ecology==
Nim Li Punit is situated in a locale rich in forest, soil, rock and other natural resources. These assets, coupled with proximity to ample flowing mountain streams, provided the indigenous Maya at Nim Li Punit a resource base that allowed their civilization to thrive. While most of the surrounding broadleaf tropical rainforest is secondary growth, due to the disturbance of the Maya themselves, there is considerable biodiversity of trees, herbs, mammals, birds, reptiles and other life forms. In addition to the soils being able to support staple crops such as beans and corn, there are a diversity of herbs in the vicinity known to have been used for medicinal purposes.

Mammals found in the area include two primate species: The Yucatán black howler monkey, &quot;Alouatta pigra&quot; and Central American spider monkey, &quot;Ateles geoffroya&quot;. Numerous rodents are found here including the common paca, &quot;Agouti paca&quot;. A variety of carnivores are present, such as the cougar &quot;Puma concolor&quot; and jaguar &quot;Panthera onca&quot;. Hosts of bats frequent the forest as well.

==Archaeology and excavation==
Nim Li Punit was first investigated by archaeologists from outside of Belize in 1976, through research conducted by Norman Hammond of the British Museum-Cambridge University, though site had been known to local Maya people well before this date. Hammond produced the first site map and excavated a portion of the central plaza. Barbara McLeod of the University of Texas, Austin, then produced the first detailed analyses of stelae inscriptions. Richard Levanthal in 1983 bored test pits and surveyed the site as part of an overall southern Belize Maya mapping project. In the 1990s minor excavations were conducted by the Belize Department of Archaeology under the supervision of John Morris and Juan Luis Bonor. In 2015, tomb excavations were conducted by the Toledo Regional Interaction Project directed by Geoffrey Braswell. This excavation unearthed numerous clay pots and a large jade pendant inscribed with Mayan hieroglyphs.

<text>Pride&#x27;s Purge is the name commonly given to an event that took place on 6 December 1648, when soldiers prevented members of Parliament considered hostile to the New Model Army from entering the House of Commons of England.

Despite defeat in the First English Civil War, Charles I retained significant political power. This allowed him to create an alliance with Scots Covenanters and Parliamentarian moderates to restore him to the English throne. The result was the 1648 Second English Civil War, in which he was defeated once again.

Convinced only his removal could end the conflict, senior commanders of the New Model Army took control of London on 5 December. The next day, soldiers commanded by Colonel Thomas Pride forcibly excluded from the Long Parliament those MPs viewed as their opponents, and arrested 45.

The purge cleared the way for the execution of Charles in January 1649, and establishment of the Protectorate in 1653; it is considered the only recorded military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in English history.

==Background==
When the First English Civil War began in 1642, the vast majority on both sides believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated. They disagreed on what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Puritans believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.

&quot;Puritan&quot; was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or &quot;purify&quot;, the Church of England, and contained many different perspectives. Presbyterians were the most prominent in the Long Parliament; in general, they wanted to convert the Church of England into a Presbyterian body, similar to the Church of Scotland. Independents opposed any state church, and although smaller in number, included Oliver Cromwell along with a significant portion of the New Model Army.

Having won control of Scotland in the 1639 to 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, the Covenanters viewed the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant as a way to preserve their dominance by preventing a Royalist victory in England. Moderate Parliamentarians like Denzil Holles wanted to re-establish what they considered to be a long-standing English legal principle that the king ruled with the consent of Parliament, a principle violated by the period of Personal Rule from 1629 to 1640. They took up arms to uphold the traditional political structure, not destroy it, and as the war progressed, both they and their Scottish co-religionists came to see the Independents and political factions such as the Levellers as a greater threat to the established order than the Royalists.

In 1646, most Parliamentarians assumed military defeat would force Charles I to comply with their terms, but his refusal to make any substantial concessions frustrated allies and opponents alike. He successfully exploited divisions among his opponents to negotiate an alliance with Scots and English Presbyterians which led to the 1648 Second English Civil War. Although quickly suppressed, it created a political grouping within the New Model Army who believed Charles had proved he could not be trusted and only his removal could end the conflict. For the vast majority, including Cromwell, at this stage, it meant Abdication rather than execution.

Parliament continued negotiations with Charles but by the beginning of November, the Army had lost its patience. On 10 November, Henry Ireton presented the draft Remonstrance to the Army General Council, which set out a constitutional vision of a state with Charles replaced by an elected monarch. While the Council was initially divided on whether to approve it, they did so on the 15th when it seemed Parliament was about to restore Charles unconditionally. They decided to act after intercepting secret messages from Charles stating any concessions he made were intended only to facilitate his escape.

==Pride&#x27;s Purge==
On 1 December, Fairfax ordered Charles be taken from his Parliamentary guards on the Isle of Wight, and moved to Hurst Castle on the mainland. The next day, the New Model Army occupied key positions in London, to prevent interference from Presbyterian elements of the London Trained Bands; Fairfax established his headquarters in Whitehall, near the Houses of Parliament.

After an all-day meeting on 5 December, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king. Next morning, acting under orders from Ireton, a detachment under Colonel Thomas Pride and Sir Hardress Waller ordered the Trained Bands who normally guarded the House to withdraw. They then took up position on the stairs leading into the chamber, supported by cavalry from Nathaniel Rich&#x27;s Regiment of Horse.

As the MPs arrived, Pride checked their names against a list of those considered enemies of the Army, assisted by Lord Grey of Groby, who helped identify them. The list contained the names of 180 of the 470 eligible members, including all 129 who the day before had voted to continue negotiations with the King. Some prominent opponents, such as Denzil Holles, fled the city.

A total of 140 MPs were refused entry by Pride, 45 of whom were arrested, and held in two inns in the Strand. Many later complained of rough treatment from their New Model guards, who blamed them for their arrears of pay. Most were released in late December, but former Parliamentarian generals William Waller and Richard Browne were held for nearly three years.

This left around 156 members present in London, with another 40 or so absent elsewhere, which became known as the Rump Parliament. While assumed to be supportive of the Army, this was not necessarily the case; many were horrified by Pride&#x27;s actions, and more than 80 of those who remained in London refused to attend. The vote to end negotiations with Charles was taken by only 83 MPs.

==Aftermath==
Between December 1648 to January 1649, Pride&#x27;s regiment received nearly £8,000 in back pay, substantially more than any other unit in this period. He was later appointed to the tribunal that tried Charles for treason, and signed his death warrant; he became wealthy under the Protectorate, and died in 1659.

The Purge eliminated from Parliament those who backed a negotiated settlement with Charles, which included moderate Independents, as well as Presbyterians. Even those who wanted him removed did not necessarily support his execution; this included Fairfax, who refused to take part in his trial, and initially Cromwell, who returned to London from the siege of Pontefract Castle in early December. In return for sparing his life, he hoped Charles would order the Duke of Ormond to end negotiations with the Irish Confederacy, and prevent a new war in Ireland.

Once it became clear Charles had no intention of doing so, Cromwell became convinced he had to die, stating &quot;we will cut off his head with the crown still on it&quot;. On 1 January 1649, the Commons passed an Ordinance to try the king for treason; when this was rejected by the House of Lords, the Commons declared themselves the supreme power in the state, and proceeded with the trial.

The trial was backed by republicans like Edmund Ludlow, who argued Charles must die to &quot;appease the wrath of God for the blood shed during the wars&quot;, and supported the Purge as the only way to ensure this. They were outnumbered by those who opposed it; only 52 of the 135 appointed judges turned up. A demand by Charles that he be tried by Parliament was blocked by Ireton and Cromwell, as even the Rump Parliament was likely to vote against the death sentence.

Charles was executed on 30 January, but in a society that placed enormous emphasis on the rule of law, the circumstances of his death, and the military coup that preceded it, tainted the subsequent Protectorate from its inception. Intended to remove the Army&#x27;s opponents from Parliament, the Purge only deepened internal divisions, which continued until it was dissolved in 1653.

<text>The Coalsack Nebula (Southern Coalsack, or simply &quot;the&quot; Coalsack) is a dark nebula, which is visible to the naked eye as a dark patch obscuring part of the Milky Way east of Acrux (Alpha Crucis) in the constellation of Crux.

==General information==
Historically any other dark cloud in the night sky was called coalsack. The Coalsack Nebula was juxtaposed in 1899 by Richard Hinckley Allen through naming the Northern Coalsack Nebula.

The Coalsack Nebula covers nearly 7° by 5° and extends into the neighboring constellations Centaurus and Musca. The first observation was reported by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1499. It was named &quot;&quot;il Canopo fosco&quot; (the dark Canopus) by Amerigo Vespucci and was also called &quot;Macula Magellani&quot; (Magellan&#x27;s Spot) or &quot;Black Magellanic Cloud&quot;&quot; in opposition to the Magellanic Clouds.

In Australian Aboriginal astronomy, the Coalsack forms the head of the &quot;emu in the sky&quot; in several Aboriginal cultures. Amongst the Wardaman people, it is said to be the head and shoulders of a &quot;law-man&quot; watching the people to ensure they do not break traditional law. According to a legend reported by W. E. Harney, this being is called &quot;Utdjungon&quot; and only adherence to the tribal law by surviving tribe members could prevent him from destroying the world with a fiery star. There is also a reference by Gaiarbau (1880) regarding the coalsacks replicating bora rings on Earth. These astronomical sites allowed the spirits to continue ceremony similar to their human counterparts on Earth. As bora grounds are generally located on the compass points north–south, the southern coal sack indicates the ceremonial ring.

In Inca astronomy this nebula was called &quot;Yutu&quot;, after a partridge-like South American bird, or Tinamou.

== In Popular Culture ==

The Coalsack Nebula appeared in Kenji Miyazawa&#x27;s story Night on the Galactic Railroad, where the protagonist, Giovanni, experiences his friend, Campanella, departing to his personal afterlife referred to as &quot;True Heaven&quot; where he sees his dead mother waiting for him. Giovanni is unable to see True Heaven, and is represented, instead, as the empty, black Coalsack to Giovanni.

The Coalsack Nebula and the galactic area surrounding it played a large role in Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s CoDominium Universe, particularly The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye and the sequel The Gripping Hand, both co-authored with Larry Niven.
In these novels, a human-colonized system, New Caledonia, is on the opposite side of the Coalsack from Earth. Set against the Coalsack is a red supergiant, and between the supergiant and New Caledonia is a yellow F6 star, known as &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

<text>Point of No Return (International title: The Assassin) is a 1993 American action film directed by John Badham and starring Bridget Fonda and Gabriel Byrne. It is a remake of Luc Besson&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;.

==Plot==
In Washington, D.C., Maggie Hayward is a drug addict convicted of murdering a police officer during a robbery shootout, and is about to be executed by lethal injection. Her death is faked and a spy, &quot;Bob&quot;, informs her she has to work for him. She reluctantly agrees to cooperate and begins a regimen of intensive training that includes not only martial arts and firearms training, but also etiquette and computer use.

Senior Operative Amanda transforms Maggie into a more refined, elegant woman. She is taken on a dinner date with Bob, who informs her about her first job: assassinating a VIP eating at the same restaurant. Maggie kills the VIP and his bodyguard and then is pursued by a team of the VIP&#x27;s bodyguards. She shoots several of the bodyguards and escapes from the kitchen by jumping down a laundry chute. This task was her final test and she has now completed her training.

The following morning, Maggie heads to Venice, California, where she enters into a romantic relationship with apartment house manager J.P. While her first assignments, both hit jobs, are ultimately successful, Maggie comes to hate her work. As matters progress between her and J.P. and her double life threatens their relationship, she asks to leave the agency. Maggie&#x27;s request is denied, but Bob agrees to get her out of the agency if she completes the next task: masquerade as Angela, the girlfriend of Fahd Bakhtiar, an Iranian business magnate trading in nuclear weapons. As Maggie prepares for the job, J.P. continues to complain about her mysterious friends and mocks the improvised backstory that Bob had provided for himself and Maggie.

Taking out Angela proves problematic and results in the deaths of Angela&#x27;s two bodyguards and the injury of Maggie’s partner, Beth. Director Kaufman then sends in Victor, a &quot;cleaner&quot;, to get rid of the bodies and salvage the mission. Unbeknownst to Maggie, he has also been ordered to kill both agents as failure in a mission results in death. After killing the wounded Beth in front of Maggie, he drives her to Fahd&#x27;s home. At gunpoint, she gets Fahd to unlock his computer and reveal his secrets, but he escapes assassination and she is forced to flee.

As they purportedly drive back to her residence, Maggie sees a gun in Victor&#x27;s waistband and correctly suspects he is going to kill her. This leads to a struggle and the car spins out of control. Ultimately, Victor is dragged over a ravine and killed. Maggie makes her way back to her apartment, but leaves during the night. Bob subsequently learns of her disappearance from J.P. As Bob is leaving, he sees Maggie watching him through the mist. Instead of reporting her, he calls Kaufman informing him the cleaner is dead, and after some hesitation, tells him that Maggie is also dead.

Gaumont, who handled the sales of distribution rights for &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, sold the remake rights to Warner Bros. In 1991, it was reported Luc Besson had been commissioned to write the English-language remake. Although Besson and a team of American writers completed a first draft of the script, Besson and Warner Bros. did not agree on a directing deal, stalling development until John Badham joined the project later that year. Prior to the casting of Fonda, a number of actresses who campaigned for the role including Winona Ryder, Madonna, Demi Moore, Juliette Lewis, and Robin Wright. Julia Roberts supposedly turned down two offers to star in the lead. Bridget Fonda was hesitant to accept the lead role not sold on doing a remake of such a recent film, but was eventually convinced to do the film after being convinced by John Badham and her &quot;Single White Female&quot; director Barbet Schroeder. Filming began in March 1992 in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Washington, D.C. The movie was known under the working title &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; during development, but was also considered for the title &quot;The Specialist&quot; before settling on &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the original &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; three and a half stars out of four, gave &quot;Return&quot; three stars, saying: &quot;&quot;Point of No Return&quot; is actually a fairly effective and faithful adaptation and Bridget Fonda manages the wild identity swings of her role with intensity and conviction, although not the same almost poetic sadness that Anne Parillaud brought to the original movie. If I didn&#x27;t feel the same degree of involvement with &quot;Point of No Return&quot; that I did with &quot;Nikita&quot; it may be because the two movies are so similar in plot, look, and feel. I had déjà vu all through the movie. There are a few changes, mostly not for the better. By making the heroine&#x27;s boyfriend a photographer this time instead of a checkout clerk, the movie loses the poignancy of their relationship; Nikita liked her clerk precisely because he was completely lacking in aggression.&quot; 

===Box office===
The film debuted at number 2 at the U.S. box office, behind &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, with a gross of $7.2 million for the weekend from 1,545 screens. It grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada and $19.9 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $49.9 million.

==Soundtrack==
Maggie/Claudia has a fascination with the singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone. Throughout the film, various songs of Simone&#x27;s are used.
* &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;
* &quot;I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl&quot;
* &quot;Feeling Good&quot;
* &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;
* &quot;Black Is the Color (Of My True Love&#x27;s Hair)&quot;

Together with the earlier re-release of &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot; in 1982, the film helped bring Nina Simone back into the public limelight and made her better known with a younger audience.

The film score was composed by Hans Zimmer.

<doc id="209553" wikidata="Q1477668" url="?curid=209553" title="Rump Parliament">
<text>The Rump Parliament was the English Parliament after Colonel Thomas Pride had commanded his soldiers, on 6 December 1648, to purge the Long Parliament of members against the Grandees&#x27; intention to try King Charles I for high treason.

&quot;Rump&quot; normally means the hind end or backside of a mammal; its use meaning &quot;remnant&quot; was first recorded in the above context in English in 1649.

==Treaty of Newport==
In September 1648, at the end of the Second English Civil War, the Long Parliament was concerned with the increasing radicalism in the New Model Army. The Long Parliament began negotiations with King Charles I. The members wanted to restore the king to power, but wanted to limit the authority he had. Charles I conceded militia power, among other things, but he later admitted that it was only so he could escape. In November the negotiations began to fail, and the New Model Army seized power. Charles I was then taken into the Army&#x27;s custody to await trial for treason.

==Pride&#x27;s Purge==

The New Model Army wanted to prevent Parliament from agreeing on the Treaty of Newport to reinstate King Charles I. While Presbyterian and moderate elements within Parliament were inclined to continue negotiations, the Army was impatient with Charles. Thomas Fairfax, by issuing a command to Commissary General Ireton, organized a military coup in 1648. Ireton intended to dissolve the Long Parliament but was persuaded to purge it instead. He then ordered Colonel Thomas Pride to prevent the signing of the Treaty of Newport.

Between 6 and 12 December, Pride—supported by two regiments—prevented 231 known supporters of the treaty from entering the House, imprisoning 45 for a few days. The remaining free members then became the Rump Parliament.

==Execution of Charles I and abolition of the monarchy==

When it became apparent to the leaders of the New Model Army that Parliament—then controlled by the Presbyterian faction—was ready to come to an agreement with the King that would restore him to the throne (though without effective power) and negate the power of the Army, they resolved to shatter the power of both King and Parliament. Pride&#x27;s Purge brought Parliament to heel under the direct control of the Army; the remaining Commons (the Rump) then on 13 December 1648, broke off negotiations with the King. Two days later, the Council of Officers of the New Model Army voted that the King be moved from the Isle of Wight, where he was prisoner, to Windsor, &quot;in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice&quot;. The King was brought from Windsor to London in the middle of December.

On 4 January 1649, the House of Commons passed an ordinance to set up a High Court of Justice, to try Charles I for high treason in the name of the people of England. The House of Lords rejected it, and as it did not receive royal assent, Charles asked at the start of his trial on 20 January in Westminster Hall, &quot;I would know by what power I am called hither. I would know by what authority, I mean lawful authority&quot;, knowing that there was no legal answer under the constitutional arrangements of the time. He was convicted with fifty-nine commissioners (judges) signing the death warrant.

The execution of Charles I was stayed until 30 January, so that the House of Commons could pass an emergency act, the &quot;Act prohibiting the proclaiming any person to be King of England or Ireland, or the Dominions thereof&quot;, that made it an offence to proclaim a new King, and to declare the representatives of the people, the House of Commons, as the source of all just power. The Commons voted to abolish the House of Lords on 6 February and to abolish the monarchy on 7 February; an act abolishing the kingship was formally passed by the Rump on 17 March, followed by an act to abolish the House of Lords on 19 March. The establishment of a Council of State was approved on 14 February, and on 19 May an was passed. The Treasons Act made it an offence to say that the House of Commons (without the Lords or the King) was not the supreme authority of the land.

==Membership, attendance, and allegiances==
Although an exact number is unknown, it is estimated that there were about 210 members of the Rump Parliament, or less than half the membership of the Long Parliament (470 members) before Pride&#x27;s Purge. Though nine new members were admitted to the Rump Parliament, the vast majority were transferred from the Long Parliament.

Most of the membership continued to regard purged colleagues as members of parliament and remained hopeful that the excluded members would be readmitted. &quot;The Rump did not think of itself as a corporate political entity distinct in membership, aims and character from the Long Parliament&quot;. There were a variety of reasons why people wanted to be a part of the Rump Parliament. Some members stayed in the Rump Parliament because they supported the revolutionary changes afoot, while others were there for financial advantage, civilian power, or to satisfy their relish for political activity.

Because of the varied energies within the Rump, the parliament divided into two categories, front benchers and back benchers, meaning respectively those who attended parliament regularly and those who did not. Only about one-third of the Rump Parliament became front benchers while the other two-thirds were back benchers. Within the active third of the Rump, there were many family allegiances, local allegiances and most importantly, common interest groups. The majority of active rumpers could fit into one of the two common interest categories:

# Members of Parliament who were professional lawyers and cooperated to oppose the reformation of the English legal system. Some of the best-known lawyer allies were Bulstrode Whitelocke, Sir Thomas Widdrington, Nicholas Lechmere and Lisliborne Long.
# Members who were particularly concerned with commercial matters and politics in the City of London. Three remarkable pairs of allies in this category are Jon Venn and Miles Corbet, Isaac Pennington and Thomas Atkin, and Frances Allen and Richard Salwey.

Although lawyers and merchants were a minority compared to the large number of rural land lords that occupied the Rump Parliament, their interest groups&#x27; energy and cohesiveness was able to largely influence Rump politics.

==Political changes==
During the time of the Commonwealth of England (1649–1653), the Rump passed a number of acts in the areas of religion, law, and finance, as well as in commercial and colonial policy. Most of the members of the Rump wanted to promote &quot;godliness&quot;, but also to restrict the more extreme puritan sects like the Quakers and the Ranters. An Adultery Act of May 1650 imposed the death penalty for incest and adultery and three months imprisonment for fornication; the Blasphemy Act of August 1650 was aimed at curbing extreme religious &quot;enthusiasm&quot;. To stop extreme evangelicals from preaching, they formed a &quot;Committee for the Propagation of the Gospel&quot;, which issued licenses to preach. To allow Puritans freedom of worship, they repealed the Elizabethan requirement of compulsory attendance at an Anglican Church. As lawyers were overrepresented in the Rump Parliament, the Rump did not respond to the popular requests made by the Levellers to change the expensive legal system.

The Rump raised revenue through the sale of Crown lands and Church property, both of which were popular. Revenue raised through excise levies and through an Assessment Tax on land were unpopular as they affected everyone who owned property. The proceeds from confiscated Royalist estates were a valuable source of income, but it was a double-edged sword. It ingratiated Parliament to people like John Downes who were making a fortune from the business but it did nothing to heal the wounds of the Civil War.

Three acts of the parliament in 1650 and 1651 are notable in the historical development of England&#x27;s commercial and colonial programs. These include the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament on 1 August 1650. The instructions to the named commissioners included consideration of both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufactures, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, but also the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. This act&#x27;s statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions, along with an October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the first Navigation Act of October 1651, formed the first definitive expression of England&#x27;s commercial policy. They represent the first attempt to establish a legitimate control of commercial and colonial affairs, and the instructions indicate the beginnings of a policy which had the prosperity and wealth of England exclusively at heart.

==Oliver Cromwell==
In 1653, after learning that Parliament was attempting to stay in session despite an agreement to dissolve, and having failed to come up with a working constitution, Cromwell&#x27;s patience ran out. On 20 April he attended a sitting of Parliament and listened to one or two speeches. Then he stood up and harangued the members of the Rump. This speech does not survive, but has often been paraphrased, for instance in the &quot;Book of Days&quot;: &quot;You have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately ... Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!&quot; He then declared &quot;you are no Parliament&quot; and called in a troop of soldiers, under the command of Major-General Thomas Harrison, ordering them to clear the chamber. According to Charles Dickens in &quot;A Child&#x27;s History of England&quot; and Hilaire Belloc, he then turned to the Speaker&#x27;s Mace, the symbol of parliamentary power, declared it a &quot;fool&#x27;s bauble&quot;, and ordered the troops &quot;here, carry it away&quot;. Cromwell&#x27;s motives are uncertain, but may lie in his disapproval of Sir Henry Vane&#x27;s scheme for a redistribution of constituencies that retained sitting members of Parliament and continued to fill vacancies with recruiter elections.

A more detailed record of the event is recounted by Thomas Salmon in his &quot;Chronological Historian&quot; (London, 1723, 106):

Salmon does not cite his own sources but the version is sufficiently detailed to suggest that he had access to descriptions of the event that were certainly current in his time, and were probably derived from eye-witness descriptions. It is therefore probably at least accurate in general tone, if not precise detail.

Within a month of the Rump&#x27;s dismissal, Oliver Cromwell on the advice of Harrison and with the support of other officers in the Army, sent a request to Congregational churches in every county to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government. On 4 July, a Nominated Assembly, nicknamed the &quot;Assembly of Saints&quot; or Barebone&#x27;s Parliament (named after one of its members), took on the role of more traditional English parliaments.

==Restoration, 1659–1660 ==
Richard Cromwell, the third (and eldest surviving) son of Oliver Cromwell, was appointed Lord Protector after his father&#x27;s death. He called the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659. Along with the Army, it was unable to form a stable government. After seven months, the Army removed Cromwell; on 6 May 1659, it reinstalled the Rump Parliament. The Rump Parliament issued a declaration establishing a &quot;Commonwealth without a king, single person, or house of lords&quot;.

According to Edmond Ludlow:
On 14 May:
After a few months, divisions in the Commonwealth were settled by force of arms. On 12 October the Rump voted to declare the seven commissioners&#x27; responsibility for the Army void and appointed Charles Fleetwood commander-in-chief under the Speaker of the House. The next day on 13 October 1659 the Army in London under the command of John Lambert assisted by Charles Fleetwood excluded the Rump from Parliament by locking the doors to the Palace of Westminster and stationing armed guards outside. Lambert and Fleetwood created a 23 member Committee of Safety to govern the country in place of the Rump with General Fleetwood and Lambert directly under him, commander of the Army in England and Scotland.

Sir Arthur Haselrig appealed to other Army generals to support the Rump against Fleetwood and Lambert. Fearing anarchy because of the conflict within Parliament and the general anger at the decisions the Rump had made, General George Monck, commander-in-chief of the English army in Scotland, declared that he was ready to uphold Parliament&#x27;s authority and marched at the head of his army to London, holding true to a statement in his book, &quot;Observations Upon Military and Political Affairs&quot; in which he said he valued the stability of his nation and the power of Parliament over his own life.

Monck was also in a particularly powerful position because of his former relationship with and endorsement from Oliver Cromwell. Many imbued him with the power to affect who the next king would be. Lambert marched north against Monck in November 1659. Lambert&#x27;s army began to melt away, and he was kept in suspense by Monck till his whole army deserted and he returned to London almost alone. On 24 December 1659, the chastened Fleetwood approached the Speaker, William Lenthal, asking him to recall the Rump. The same day Lenthal took possession of the Tower and appointed commissioners for its government. The Rump met again on 26 December 1659. Parliament declared Monck commander-in-chief in England as well as Scotland.

Monck marched into England in January 1660, as Lambert&#x27;s supporters in the Army were cashiered and his authority crumbled. When Sir Thomas Fairfax emerged from retirement to declare his support for Monck, Army support for Monck became almost unanimous. Monck entered London in February 1660 and he allowed the Presbyterian members, &#x27;secluded&#x27; in Pride&#x27;s Purge of 1648, to re-enter parliament on 21 February 1660 on the condition that the restored Long Parliament would agree to dissolve themselves once general elections had been held. The &quot;Long Parliament&quot; dissolved itself on 16 March 1660, after preparing legislation for the Convention Parliament that formally invited King Charles II to be the English monarch in what has become known as the Restoration (of the House of Stuart).

<text>Enewetak Atoll (; also spelled Eniwetok Atoll or sometimes Eniewetok; , , or , ; known to the Japanese as Brown Atoll or Brown Island; ) is a large coral atoll of 40 islands in the Pacific Ocean and with its 296 people (as of 2021) forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands. With a land area total less than , it is no higher than and surrounds a deep central lagoon, in circumference. It is the second-westernmost atoll of the Ralik Chain and is west from Bikini Atoll.

It was held by the Japanese from 1914 until its capture by the United States in February 1944 during World War II, then became Naval Base Eniwetok. Nuclear testing by the US totaling the equivalent of over 30 megatons of TNT took place during the Cold War; in 1977–1980, a concrete dome (the Runit Dome) was built on Runit Island to deposit radioactive soil and debris.

The Runit Dome is deteriorating and could be breached by a typhoon, though the sediments in the lagoon are even more radioactive than those which are contained.

== Etymology ==
The U.S. government referred to the atoll as &quot;Eniwetok&quot; until 1974, when it changed its official spelling to &quot;Enewetak&quot; (along with many other Marshall Islands place names, to more properly reflect their pronunciation by the Marshall Islanders).

==Geography==
Enewetak Atoll formed atop a seamount. The seamount was formed in the late Cretaceous. This seamount is now about below sea level. It is made of basalt, and its depth is due to a general subsidence of the entire region and not because of erosion.

Enewetak has a mean elevation above sea level of .

==History==
Humans have inhabited the atoll since about 1,000 B.C.

The islands were first settled by Austronesian islanders.

The first European colonizers to Enewetak, Spanish explorer Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón, arrived on 10 October 1529. He called the island &quot;Los Jardines&quot; (The Gardens). In 1794, sailors aboard the British merchant sloop &quot;Walpole&quot; called the islands &quot;Brown&#x27;s Range&quot; (thus, the Japanese name &quot;Brown Atoll&quot;). It was visited by about a dozen ships before the establishment of the German colony of the Marshall Islands in 1885.

=== World Wars I and II ===
With the rest of the Marshalls, Enewetak was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1914, during World War I and mandated to the Empire of Japan by the League of Nations in 1920. The Japanese administered the island under the South Seas Mandate, but mostly left affairs in hands of traditional local leaders until the start of World War II. The atoll, together with other parts of Marshall Islands located to the west of 164°E, was placed under the governance of Pohnpei district during the Japanese administration period, separately from the rest of the Marshall Islands.

In November 1942, the Japanese built an airfield on Engebi Island. As they used it only for refueling planes between Truk and islands to the east, no aviation personnel were stationed there and the island had only token defenses. When the Gilberts fell to the United States, the Imperial Japanese Army assigned defense of the atoll to the 1st Amphibious Brigade, formed from the 3rd Independent Garrison, which had previously been stationed in Manchukuo. The 1st Amphibious Brigade arrived on January 4, 1944. Some 2,586 of its 3,940 men were left to defend Eniwetok Atoll, supplemented by aviation personnel, civilian employees, and laborers. However, they were unable to finish the fortifications before the American attack came in February. During the ensuing Battle of Eniwetok, the Americans captured Enewetak in a five-day amphibious operation. Fighting mainly took place on Engebi Islet, site of the most important Japanese installation, although some combat occurred on the main islet of Enewetak itself and on Parry Island, where there was a Japanese seaplane base.

Following its capture, the anchorage at Enewetok became a major US Naval Advance Base with Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10 stationed in the lagoon. The daily average of ships present during the first half of July 1944 was 488; during the second half of July, the daily average number of ships at Enewetak was 283. Naval Base Eniwetok was part of the vast Naval Base Marshall Islands. US Navy Seabees of the 110th Naval Construction Battalion arrived on February 21 and 27 to begin construction of Stickell Field. It had two taxiways and a runway. In June 1945, the 67th CB arrived to build a 35,000 man recreation center to be turned over to CBMU 608.

In 1950, John C. Woods, who executed the Nazi war criminals convicted at the Nuremberg Trials, was accidentally electrocuted there.

=== Nuclear weapons testing ===
After the end of World War II, Enewetak came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. During its tenure, the United States evacuated the local residents many times, often involuntarily. The atoll was used for nuclear testing, as part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. Before testing commenced, the U.S. exhumed the bodies of United States servicemen killed in the Battle of Enewetak and returned them to the United States to be re-buried by their families. 43 nuclear tests were fired at Enewetak from 1948 to 1958.

The first hydrogen bomb test, code-named Ivy Mike, occurred in late 1952 as part of Operation Ivy; it vaporized the islet of Elugelab, It also created two new elements : Fermium and Einsteinium. This test included B-17 Flying Fortress drones to fly through the radioactive cloud to test onboard samples. B-17 mother ships controlled the drones while flying within visual distance of them. In all, 16 to 20 B-17s took part in this operation, of which half were controlling aircraft and half were drones. To examine the explosion clouds of the nuclear bombs in 1957/58, several rockets (mostly from rockoons) were launched. One USAF airman Jimmy Robinson was lost at sea during the tests. Robinson&#x27;s F-84 Thunderjet crashed and sank short of the island. Robinson&#x27;s body was never recovered.

=== Radiological cleanup ===
A radiological survey of Enewetak was conducted from 1972 to 1973. In 1977, the United States military began decontamination of Enewetak and other islands. During the three-year, US$100 million cleanup process, the military mixed more than of contaminated soil and debris from the islands with Portland cement and buried it in an atomic blast crater on the northern end of the atoll&#x27;s Runit Island. The material was placed in the deep, wide crater created by the May 5, 1958, &quot;Cactus&quot; nuclear weapons test. A dome composed of 358 concrete panels, each thick, was constructed over the material. The final cost of the cleanup project was US$239 million. The United States government declared the southern and western islands in the atoll safe for habitation in 1980, and residents of Enewetak returned that same year. The military members who participated in that cleanup mission are suffering from many health issues, but the U.S. Government refused to provide health coverage until 2022 with the passage of the Honoring our PACT Act.

The 2000 environmental restoration award included funds for additional cleanup of radioactivity on Enewetak. Rather than scrape the topsoil off, replace it with clean topsoil, and create another radioactive waste repository dome at some site on the atoll (a project estimated to cost US$947 million), most areas still contaminated on Enewetak were treated with potassium. Soil that could not be effectively treated for human use was removed and used as fill for a causeway connecting the two main islands of the atoll (Enewetak and Parry). The cost of the potassium decontamination project was US$103.3 million.

A report by the US Congressional Research Service projects that the majority of the atoll will be fit for human habitation by 2026–2027, after nuclear decay, de-contamination and environmental remediation efforts create sufficient dose reductions. However, in November 2017, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that rising sea levels caused by climate change are seeping inside the dome, causing radioactive material to leak out.

=== U.S. relations with Marshall Islands ===
Section 177 of the 1983 Compact of Free Association between the governments of the United States and the Marshall Islands establishes a process for Marshallese to make a claim against the United States government as a result of damage and injury caused by nuclear testing. That same year, an agreement was signed to implement Section 177, which established a US$150 million trust fund. The fund was intended to generate US$18 million a year, which would be payable to claimants on an agreed-upon schedule. If the US$18 million a year generated by the fund was not enough to cover claims, the principal of the fund could be used. A Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal was established to adjudicate claims. In 2000, the tribunal made a compensation award to the people of Enewetak consisting of US$107.8 million for environmental restoration; US$244 million in damages to cover economic losses caused by loss of access and use of the atoll; and US$34 million for hardship and suffering. In addition, as of the end of 2008, another US$96.658 million in individual damage awards were made. Only US$73.526 million of the individual claims award has been paid, however, and no new awards were made between the end of 2008 and May 2010. Due to stock market losses, payments rates that have outstripped fund income, and other issues, the fund was nearly exhausted, as of May 2010, and unable to make any additional awards or payments. A lawsuit by Marshallese arguing that &quot;changed circumstances&quot; made Nuclear Claims Tribunal unable to make just compensation was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the United States in April 2010.

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates Enewetak Elementary School. Marshall Islands High School on Majuro serves the community.

==Eniwetok Airfield==

Men from the 110th Naval Construction Battalion arrived on Eniwetok between 21 and 27 February 1944 and began clearing the island for construction of a bomber airfield. A by runway with taxiways and supporting facilities was built. The first plane landed on 11 March. By 5 April the first operational bombing mission was conducted.
The base was later named for Lieutenant John H. Stickell.

In mid-September 1944 operations at Wrigley Airfield on Engebi Island were transferred to Eniwetok.

US Navy and Marine units based at Eniwetok included:

*VB-102 operating PB4Y-1s from 12–27 August 1944
*VB-108 operating PB4Y-1s from 11 April-10 July 1944
*VB-109 operating PB4Y-1s from 5 April-14 August 1944
*VB-116 operating PB4Y-1s from 7 July-27 August 1944
*VPB-121 operating PB4Y-1s from 1 March-3 July 1945
*VPB-144 operating PV-2s from 27 June 1945 until September 1946

The airstrip is now abandoned and its surface partially covered by sand.

==Parry Island seaplane base==
The Imperial Japanese Navy had developed a seaplane base on Parry Island. Following its capture on 22 February, Seabee&#x27;s from the 110th Naval Construction Battalion expanded the base, building a coral-surfaced parking area and shops for minor aircraft and engine overhaul. A marine ways was installed on a Japanese pier and boat-repair shops were also erected.

US Navy and Marine units based at Parry Island included:

*VP-13 operating PB2Y-3s from 26 February-22 June 1944
*VP-16 operating PBM-3Ds from 7 June-1 August 1944
*VP-21 operating PBM-3Ds from 19 August-17 October 1944 and from 15 July-11 September 1945
*VP-23 operating PBY-5As from 20 August 1944 – 9 April 1945
*VP-MS-6 operating PBM-5Es from 1 February 1948 in support of Operation Sandstone
*VP-102 operating PB2Y-3s from 3 February-30 August 1944
*VP-202 operating PBM-3Ds from 24 February-1 March 1944
*VPB-19 operating PBM-3Ds from 2 November 1944 – 12 February 1945 and 6 March 1945-January 1946
*VPB-22 operating PBM-3Ds from 10 October-30 November 1944 and from 25 June-7 August 1945

==Missile Impact Location System==
From 1958 through 1960 the United States installed the Missile Impact Location System (MILS) in the Navy managed Pacific Missile Range, later the Air Force managed Western Range, to localize the splash downs of test missile nose cones. MILS was developed and installed by the same entities that had completed the first phase of the Atlantic and U.S. West Coast SOSUS systems. A MILS installation, consisting of both a target array for precision location and a broad ocean area system for good positions outside the target area, was installed at Eniwetok as part of the system supporting Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) tests. Other Pacific MILS shore terminals were at the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay supporting Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) tests with impact areas northeast of Hawaii and the other ICBM test support systems at Midway Island and Wake Island.

<text>In the 19th century, the philosophers of the 18th-century Enlightenment began to have a dramatic effect on subsequent developments in philosophy. In particular, the works of Immanuel Kant gave rise to a new generation of German philosophers and began to see wider recognition internationally. Also, in a reaction to the Enlightenment, a movement called Romanticism began to develop towards the end of the 18th century. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science, including evolution, most notably postulated by Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and theories regarding what is today called emergent order, such as the free market of Adam Smith within nation states, or the Marxist approach concerning class warfare between the ruling class and the working class developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Pressures for egalitarianism, and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.

== Brief historical outline ==
With the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic and political change. European philosophy reflected on, participated in, and drove, many of these changes.

=== Influences from the late Enlightenment ===
The last third of the 18th century produced a host of ideas and works which would both systematize previous philosophy, and present a deep challenge to the basis of how philosophy had been systematized. Immanuel Kant is a name that most would mention as being among the most important of influences, as is Jean-Jacques Rousseau. While both of these philosophers were products of the 18th century and its assumptions, they pressed at the boundaries. In trying to explain the nature of the state and government, Rousseau would challenge the basis of government with his declaration that &quot;Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains&quot;. Kant, while attempting to preserve axiomic skepticism, was forced to argue that we do not see true reality, nor do we speak of it. All we know of reality is appearances. Since all we can see of reality is appearances, which are subject to certain necessary and subjective forms of perceptions, Kant postulates the idea of an unknowable (while at the same time limiting our use of science and the principle of causality to the appearances). Hegel&#x27;s distinction between the unknowable and the circumstantially unknown can be seen as the beginnings of Hegel&#x27;s rational system of the universe.

Yet another philosopher of the late Enlightenment that was influential in the 19th century was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), whose formulation of nomological determinism is famous up to this day.

== Philosophical schools and tendencies ==
This is a partial list of schools of 19th-century philosophy (also known as late modern philosophy).

===German idealism===
One of the first philosophers to attempt to grapple with Kant&#x27;s philosophy was Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose development of Kantian metaphysics became a source of inspiration for the Romantics. In &quot;Wissenschaftslehre&quot;, Fichte argues that the self posits itself and is a self-producing and changing process.

Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, a student of Fichte, continued to develop many of the same ideas and was also assimilated by the Romantics as something of an official philosopher for their movement. But it was another of Fichte&#x27;s students, and former roommate of Schelling, who would rise to become the most prominent of the post-Kantian idealists: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. His work revealed the increasing importance of historical thinking in German thought.

Arthur Schopenhauer, rejecting Hegel and also materialism, called for a return to Kantian transcendentalism, at the same time adopting atheism and determinism, amongst others. His secular thought became more popular in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, which coincided with the advents of Darwinism, positivism, Marxism and philological analysis of the Bible.

In the second half of the 19th century, an even more orthodox return to Kantian thought was espoused by a number of Neo-Kantian philosophers based in two main locations: the Marburg School and the Baden School. This trend of thought survived into the beginning of the next century, influencing 20th-century philosophical movements such as neopositivism and phenomenology.

One of the most famous opponents of idealism in the first half of the German 19th century was Ludwig Feuerbach, who advocated materialism and atheism.

===Utilitarianism===

Utilitarianism is a consequentialist approach to normative ethics that holds morally right actions are those that promote the most human happiness. Jeremy Bentham, who created his version of the theory in 1829, and John Stuart Mill who made his in 1861 are considered the founders of utilitarianism, though the basic concept predates either of the two philosophers. Utilitarianism remains as one of the more appealing and compelling approaches to normative ethics.

===Marxism===

Developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-to-late-19th century, Marxism is a sociopolitical and economic view based on the philosophy of dialectical materialism, which opposes idealism in favour of the materialist viewpoint. Marx analysed history itself as the progression of dialectics in the form of class struggle. From this it is argued that &quot;the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.&quot; According to Marx, this began with the phase of primitive communism (hunter-gatherer society), after which the Neolithic Revolution gave way to slave societies, progressing into the feudal society, and then into his present era of the Industrial Revolution, after which he held that the next step was for the proletariat to overthrow the owners of industry and establish a socialist society, which would further develop into a communist society, in which class distinctions, money, and the state would have withered from existence entirely.

Marxism had a profound influence on the history of the 20th century.

===Existentialism===

Existentialism as a philosophical movement is properly a 20th-century movement, but its major antecedents, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche wrote long before the rise of existentialism. In the 1840s, academic philosophy in Europe, following Hegel, was almost completely divorced from the concerns of individual human life, in favour of pursuing abstract metaphysical systems. Kierkegaard sought to reintroduce to philosophy, in the spirit of Socrates: subjectivity, commitment, faith, and passion, all of which are a part of the human condition.

Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche saw the moral values of 19th-century Europe disintegrating into nihilism (Kierkegaard called it the &quot;levelling&quot; process). Nietzsche attempted to undermine traditional moral values by exposing its foundations. To that end, he distinguished between master and slave moralities, and claimed that man must turn from the meekness and humility of Europe&#x27;s slave-morality.

Both philosophers are precursors to existentialism, among other ideas, for their importance on the &quot;great man&quot; against the age. Kierkegaard wrote of 19th-century Europe, &quot;Each age has its own characteristic depravity. Ours is perhaps not pleasure or indulgence or sensuality, but rather a dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual man.&quot;

===Positivism===

Auguste Comte, the self-professed founder of modern sociology, put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called &quot;sociology&quot;, which is the study of the &quot;dynamics and statics of society&quot;.

===Pragmatism===

The American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce and William James developed the pragmatist philosophy in the late 19th century. This school of thought holds that the value of an idea is based upon its practicability or utility rather than the extent to which it reflects reality.

===British idealism===

The twilight years of the 19th century in Britain saw the rise of British idealism, a revival of interest in the works of Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and a reaction against British Empiricism and Utilitarianism. The movement was partly kickstarted by James Hutchison Stirling&#x27;s two-volume work &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot; which helped facilitate the study of Hegel in England and introduced some elements that became characteristic of the British Idealist interpretation of Hegel. Besides incorporating varying portions of the philosophies of Kant and Hegel, many British Idealists also took ideas from earlier thinkers such as Aristotle and Plato. T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet are considered some of the major thinkers of British idealism.

===Transcendentalism===

Transcendentalism was rooted in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s transcendence and German idealism, led by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who encountered German ideas through their readings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle. The main belief was in an ideal spiritual state that &#x27;transcends&#x27; the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual&#x27;s intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.

===Social Darwinism===

&quot;Social Darwinism&quot; refers to theories that apply the evolutionary concept of natural selection to human society in fields such as sociology, economics, and politics. Two major thinkers of this movement were Herbert Spencer and Francis Galton.

===Ontologism===

Ontologism is an ideological system, favored by many Catholic philosophers, which asserts that God and Divine ideas are the first object of our intelligence and the intuition of God the first act of our intellectual knowledge. Nicolas Malebranche was a source for many philosophers of Ontologism. In 1861, the Holy Office condemned Ontologism as unsafe for teaching (&quot;tuto tradi non possunt&quot;). Two major thinkers of this movement are Vincenzo Gioberti and Antonio Rosmini.

<doc id="209584" wikidata="Q757669" url="?curid=209584" title="Atomic Age">
<text>The Atomic Age, also known as the Atomic Era, is the period of history following the detonation of the first nuclear weapon, The Gadget at the &quot;Trinity&quot; test in New Mexico on 16 July 1945 during World War II. Although nuclear chain reactions had been hypothesized in 1933 and the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction (Chicago Pile-1) had taken place in December 1942, the Trinity test and the ensuing bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World WarII represented the first large-scale use of nuclear technology and ushered in profound changes in sociopolitical thinking and the course of technological development.

While atomic power was promoted for a time as the epitome of progress and modernity, entering into the nuclear power era also entailed frightful implications of nuclear warfare, the Cold War, mutual assured destruction, nuclear proliferation, the risk of nuclear disaster (potentially as extreme as anthropogenic global nuclear winter), as well as beneficial civilian applications in nuclear medicine. It is no easy matter to fully segregate peaceful uses of nuclear technology from military or terrorist uses (such as the fabrication of dirty bombs from radioactive waste), which complicated the development of a global nuclear-power export industry right from the outset.

In 1973, concerning a flourishing nuclear power industry, the United States Atomic Energy Commission predicted that by the turn of the 21st century, 1,000 reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the U.S. However, the &quot;nuclear dream&quot; fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology produced a range of social problems, from the nuclear arms race to nuclear meltdowns, and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning. Since 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.

By the late 1970s, nuclear power had suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread public opposition, coming to a head with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for many decades.

== Early years ==
In 1901, Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford discovered that radioactivity was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another, involving the release of energy. Soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially &quot;inexhaustible&quot; source of energy and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to &quot;transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen poles, and make the whole earth one smiling Garden of Eden.&quot; The promise of an &quot;atomic age,&quot; with nuclear energy as the global, utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs, has been a recurring theme ever since. But &quot;Soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons&quot;.

The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was hypothesized in 1933, shortly after James Chadwick&#x27;s discovery of the neutron. Only a few years later, in December 1938 nuclear fission was discovered by Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann. Hahn understood that a &quot;burst&quot; of the atomic nuclei had occurred. The first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction took place at Chicago Pile-1 in December 1942 under the leadership of Enrico Fermi.

In 1945, the pocketbook &quot;The Atomic Age&quot; heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. One science writer, David Dietz, wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week, you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill. Glenn T. Seaborg, who chaired the Atomic Energy Commission, wrote &quot;there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles, nuclear powered artificial hearts, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more&quot;.

== World War II ==

The phrase &quot;Atomic Age&quot; was coined by William L. Laurence, a journalist with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who became the official journalist for the Manhattan Project which developed the first nuclear weapons. He witnessed both the Trinity test and the bombing of Nagasaki and went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union would go on to test its first nuclear weapon in 1949.

In 1949, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, David Lilienthal stated that &quot;atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy, but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man&#x27;s whole life&quot;.

== 1950s ==


The phrase gained popularity as a feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete, and nuclear power plants would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from irradiating food to preserve it, to the development of nuclear medicine. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would &quot;provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space&quot;. This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in technological progress as the first smelting of bronze, of iron, or the commencement of the Industrial Revolution.

This included even cars, leading Ford Motor Company to display the Ford Nucleon concept car to the public in 1958. There was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and nuclear-powered aircraft, which the U.S. federal government even spent US$1.5 billion researching. Nuclear policymaking became almost a collective technocratic fantasy, or at least was driven by fantasy:

The very idea of splitting the atom had an almost magical grip on the imaginations of inventors and policymakers. As soon as someone said—in an even mildly credible way—that these things &quot;could&quot; be done, then people quickly convinced themselves ... that they &quot;would&quot; be done.
In the US, military planners &quot;believed that demonstrating the civilian applications of the atom would also affirm the American system of private enterprise, showcase the expertise of scientists, increase personal living standards, and defend the democratic lifestyle against communism&quot;. Some media reports predicted that thanks to the giant nuclear power stations of the near future electricity would soon become much cheaper and that electricity meters would be removed, because power would be &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot;

When the Shippingport reactor went online in 1957 it produced electricity at a cost roughly ten times that of coal-fired generation. Scientists at the AEC&#x27;s own Brookhaven Laboratory &quot;wrote a 1958 report describing accident scenarios in which 3,000 people would die immediately, with another 40,000 injured&quot;. However Shippingport was an experimental reactor using highly enriched uranium (unlike most power reactors) and originally intended for a (cancelled) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.

Kenneth Nichols, a consultant for the Connecticut Yankee and Yankee Rowe nuclear power stations, wrote that while considered &quot;experimental&quot; and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, they &quot;became competitive because of inflation ... and the large increase in price of coal and oil.&quot; He wrote that for nuclear power stations the capital cost is the major cost factor over the life of the plant, hence &quot;antinukes&quot; try to increase costs and building time with changing regulations and lengthy hearings, so that &quot;it takes almost twice as long to build a (U.S.-designed boiling-water or pressurised water) atomic power plant in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.&quot; French pressurised-water nuclear plants produce 60% of their electric power and have proven to be much cheaper than oil or coal.

=== Atomic City ===

During the 1950s, Las Vegas earned the nickname &quot;Atomic City&quot; for becoming a hotspot where tourists would gather to watch above-ground nuclear weapons tests taking place at Nevada Test Site. Following the detonation of Able, one of the first atomic bombs dropped at the Nevada Test Site, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce began advertising the tests as an entertainment spectacle to tourists.

The detonations proved popular, and casinos throughout the city capitalised on the tests by advertising hotel rooms or rooftops which offered views of the testing site or by planning &quot;Dawn Bomb Parties&quot; where people would come together to celebrate the detonations. Most parties started at midnight, and musicians would perform at the venues until 4:00 a.m. when the party would briefly stop so guests could silently watch the detonation. Some casinos capitalised on the tests further by creating so called &quot;atomic cocktails&quot;, a mixture of vodka, cognac, sherry and champagne. Meanwhile, groups of tourists would drive out into the desert with family or friends to watch the detonations.

Despite the health risks associated with nuclear fallout, tourists and viewers were told to simply &quot;shower&quot;. Later on, however, anyone who had worked at the testing site or lived in areas exposed to nuclear fallout fell ill and had higher chances of developing cancer or suffering pre-mature deaths.

== 1960s ==

The term &quot;atomic age&quot; was initially used in a negative, futuristic sense, but by the 1960s the threats posed by nuclear weapons had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom. In the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; TV series, a set of vehicles was presented that were imagined to be completely nuclear, as shown in cutaways presented in their comic-books.

=== Project Plowshare ===
By exploiting the peaceful uses of the &quot;friendly atom&quot; in medical applications, earth removal and subsequently in nuclear power plants, the nuclear industry and U.S. government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of nuclear weapons. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the U.S. initiated Project Plowshare, involving &quot;peaceful nuclear explosions&quot;. The United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman announced that Plowshare was intended to &quot;highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests&quot;. Plowshare &quot;was named directly from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another&quot;.

Proposed uses included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract shale oil in eastern Utah and western Colorado. Serious consideration was given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California&#x27;s Sacramento Valley for a water transport project.

However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare&#x27;s 27 nuclear explosions. Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.

== 1970s to 1990s ==
French advocates of nuclear power developed an aesthetic vision of nuclear technology as art to bolster support for the technology. Leclerq compares the nuclear cooling tower to some of the grandest architectural monuments of Western culture:

The age in which we live has, for the public, been marked by the nuclear engineer and the gigantic edifices he has created. For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.
In 1973, the AEC predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century 1,000 reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the U.S. But after 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.

Nuclear power has proved controversial since the 1970s. Highly radioactive materials may overheat and escape from the reactor building. Nuclear waste (spent nuclear fuel) needs to be regularly removed from the reactors and disposed of safely for up to a million years, so that it does not pollute the environment. Recycling of nuclear waste has been discussed, but it creates plutonium which can be used in weapons, and in any case still leaves much unwanted waste to be stored and disposed of. Large, purpose-built facilities for long-term disposal of nuclear waste have been difficult to site.

By the late 1970s, nuclear power suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread public opposition, coming to a head with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for decades thereafter. A cover story in the 11 February 1985 issue of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine addresses the overall management of the nuclear power program in the United States:

The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale ... only the blind, or the biased, can now think that the money has been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.
In a period just over 30 years, the early dramatic rise of nuclear power went into equally meteoric reverse. With no other energy technology has there been a conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence, followed so quickly by equally transformative demise.

== 21st century ==
In the 21st century, the label of the &quot;Atomic Age&quot; connotes either a sense of nostalgia or naïveté and is considered by many to have ended with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, though the term continues to be used by many historians to describe the era following the conclusion of the Second World War. Atomic energy and weapons continue to have a strong effect on world politics in the 21st century.

The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs, but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur, and natural disasters can effect nuclear power plants, such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that damaged the Fukushima plant in Japan. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima accident cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that if nuclear power use tripled from 2005 to 2055 (2%–7%), at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.

In September 2012, in reaction to the Fukushima disaster, Japan announced that it would completely phase out nuclear power by 2030, although the likelihood of this goal became unlikely during the subsequent Abe administration. Germany planned to completely phase out nuclear energy by 2022 but was still using 11.9% in 2021. In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom pledged to build up to 8 new reactors to reduce their reliance on gas and oil and hopes that 25% of all energy produced will be by nuclear means.

On August 1, 2024, Vipin Narang, a senior Pentagon official, remarked, &quot;We now find ourselves in nothing short of a new nuclear age.&quot; He attributed this development to an &quot;unprecedented mix of multiple revisionist nuclear challengers who are uninterested in arms control or risk-reduction efforts, each rapidly modernizing and expanding their nuclear arsenals.&quot;

== Anti-nuclear movement ==

A large anti-nuclear demonstration was held on 6 May 1979, in Washington D.C., when 125,000 people including the governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power. In New York City on 23 September 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a protest against nuclear power. Anti-nuclear power protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham, Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other nuclear power plants.

On 12 June 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City&#x27;s Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the Cold War arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on 20 June 1983, at 50 sites across the United States.
In 1986, hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., in the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s.

On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades.

* November 1961 – In &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, an article by Gilbert Burck appears outlining the plans of Nelson Rockefeller, Edward Teller, Herman Kahn, and Chet Holifield for the construction of an enormous network of concrete-lined underground fallout shelters throughout the United States sufficient to shelter millions of people to serve as a refuge in case of nuclear war.
* 12 October 1962 to 28 October 1962 – The Cuban Missile Crisis brings the world to the brink of nuclear war.
* 10 October 1963 – The Partial Test Ban Treaty goes into effect, banning above ground nuclear testing.
* 26 August 1966 – The first pebble-bed reactor goes online in Jülich, West Germany (some nuclear engineers think that the pebble-bed reactor design can be adapted for atomic powered vehicles).
* 27 January 1967 – The Outer Space Treaty bans the deployment of nuclear weapons in space.
* 1968 – Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes building a space ark using an Orion nuclear-pulse propulsion rocket powered by hydrogen bombs. The rocket would have a payload of 50,000 tonnes, a crew of 240, and be able to travel at 3.3% of the speed of light and would reach Alpha Centauri in 133 years. It would cost $367 billion in 1968 dollars, which is the equivalent of about $3.3 trillion in 2024 dollars.

=== Three Mile Island and Chernobyl ===
* 28 March 1979 – The Three Mile Island accident occurs at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, dampening enthusiasm in the United States for nuclear power, and causing a dramatic shift in the growth of nuclear power in the United States.
* 6 May 1979 – A large anti-nuclear demonstration was held in Washington, D.C., when 125,000 people including the Governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power.
* 23 September 1979 – In New York City, almost 200,000 people attended a protest against nuclear power.
* 26 April 1986 – The Chernobyl disaster occurs at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, Ukraine, USSR, reducing enthusiasm for nuclear power among many people in the world, and causing a dramatic shift in the growth of nuclear power.

=== Nuclear arms reduction ===
* 8 December 1987 – The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is signed in Washington 1987. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev agreed after negotiations following the 11–12 October 1986 Reykjavík Summit to go farther than a nuclear freeze – they agreed to reduce nuclear arsenals. IRBMs and SRBMs were eliminated.
* 1993–2007 – Nuclear power is the primary source of electricity in France. Throughout these two decades, France produced over three quarters of its power from nuclear sources (78.8%), the highest percentage in the world at the time.
* 31 July 1991 – As the Cold War ends, the Start I treaty is signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, reducing the deployed nuclear warheads of each side to no more than 6,000 each.
* 1993 – The Megatons to Megawatts Program is agreed upon by Russia and the United States and begins to be implemented in 1995. When it is completed in 2013, five hundred tonnes of uranium derived from 20,000 nuclear warheads from Russia will have been converted from weapons-grade to reactor-grade uranium and used in United States nuclear plants to generate electricity. This has provided 10% of the electrical power of the U.S. (50% of its nuclear power) during the 1995–2013 period.
* 2006 – Patrick Moore, an early member of Greenpeace and environmentalists such as Stewart Brand suggest the deployment of more advanced nuclear power technology for electric power generation (such as pebble-bed reactors) to combat global warming.
* 21 November 2006 – Implementation of the ITER fusion power reactor project near Cadarache, France is begun. Construction is to be completed in 2016 with the hope that the research conducted there will allow the introduction of practical commercial fusion power plants by 2050.
* 2006–2009 – Nuclear engineers begin to suggest that, to combat global warming, it would be more efficient to build nuclear reactors that operate on the thorium cycle.
* 8 April 2010 – The New START treaty is signed by the United States and Russia in Prague. It mandates the eventual reduction by both sides to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear weapons each.

=== Fukushima ===
* 11 March 2011 – A tsunami resulting from the Tōhoku earthquake causes severe damage to the Fukushima I nuclear power plant in Japan, causing partial nuclear meltdowns in several of the reactors. Many international leaders express concerns about the accidents, and some countries re-evaluate existing nuclear energy programs. The event is rated level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale by the Japanese government&#x27;s nuclear safety agency. Other than the Chernobyl disaster, it is the only nuclear accident to be rated at level 7, the highest level on the scale, and caused the most dramatic shift in nuclear policy to date.

== Influence on popular culture ==

* 1945 – The Atomaton chapter of Sweet Adelines was formed by Edna Mae Anderson after she and her sister singers decided, &quot;We have an atom of an idea and a ton of energy.&quot; The name also recognized the Atomic Age—just three days after Sweet Adelines was founded (13 July 1945), the first nuclear bomb, Trinity, was detonated.
* 5 July 1946 – The bikini swimsuit, named after Bikini Atoll, where an atomic bomb test called Operation Crossroads had taken place a few days earlier on 1 July 1946, was introduced at a fashion show in Paris.
* 1954 – &quot;Them!&quot;, a science fiction film about humanity&#x27;s battle with a nest of giant mutant ants, was one of the first of the &quot;nuclear monster&quot; movies.
* 1954 – The science fiction film &quot;Godzilla&quot; was released, about an iconic fictional monster that is a gigantic irradiated dinosaur, transformed from the fallout of a hydrogen bomb test.
* 23 January 1957 – Walt Disney Productions released the film &quot;Our Friend the Atom&quot; describing the marvelous benefits of atomic power. As well as being presented as an episode on the TV show &quot;Disneyland&quot;, this film was also shown to almost all baby boomers in their public school auditoriums or their science classes and was instrumental in creating within that generation a mostly favorable attitude toward nuclear power.
* 1958 –The peace symbol was designed for the British nuclear disarmament movement by Gerald Holtom.
* 1959 – The popular film &quot;On the Beach&quot; shows the last remnants of humanity in Australia awaiting the end of the human race after a nuclear war.
* 1964 – The film &quot;Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (aka &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;), a black comedy directed by Stanley Kubrick about an accidentally triggered nuclear war, was released.
* 1982 – The documentary film &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, detailing society&#x27;s attitudes toward the atomic bomb in the early Atomic Age, debuted to widespread acclaim.
* 1982 – Jonathan Schell&#x27;s book &quot;Fate of the Earth&quot;, about the consequences of nuclear war, is published. The book &quot;forces even the most reluctant person to confront the unthinkable: the destruction of humanity and possibly most life on Earth&quot;. The best-selling book instigated the Nuclear Freeze campaign.
* 20 November 1983 – &quot;The Day After,&quot; an American television movie was aired on the ABC Television Network and in the Soviet Union. The film portrays a fictional nuclear war between the United States/NATO and the Soviet Union/Warsaw Pact. After the film, a panel discussion was presented in which Carl Sagan suggested that we need to reduce the number of nuclear weapons as a matter of &quot;planetary hygiene&quot;. This film was seen by over 100,000,000 people and was instrumental in greatly increasing public support for the Nuclear Freeze campaign.

<text>Phoumi Vongvichit (&quot;Phumi Wongwichit;&quot; ; 6 April 1909 – 7 January 1994) was a leading figure of the Pathet Lao and an elder statesman of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic.

He was born April 6, 1909, in Xieng Khouang, the son of a civil servant. He was educated in the Lao capital Vientiane, after which he joined the colonial civil service. After postings in Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang, he was promoted to district chief (&quot;chao muang&quot;) and served in Xieng Khouang (1939) and Vientiane (1940 - 1945). In January 1945 he was appointed governor (&quot;chao khoueng&quot;) of Houaphan where he remained until the Japanese surrender in August 1945. The following month, Phoumi cooperated with Free French forces when they briefly seized the town of Sam Neua, but subsequently he joined the anti-colonialist Lao Issara movement and worked closely with the Viet Minh to oppose the return of French authority in Indochina.

In 1946, after the French reasserted their authority in Laos, Phoumi made his way to northern Thailand where for the next three years he was active in the Lao Issara. At the end of 1949, having refused to accept the offer of amnesty upon dissolution of the Lao Issara government-in-exile in Thailand, Phoumi was one of the handful of Lao who joined Souphanouvong in northern Vietnam. There he attended the founding congress of the Neo Lao Issara (the Free Laos Front). Phoumi was nominated both Secretary-General of the Front, and Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister in the Pathet Lao Resistance government that the Front established in opposition to the Royal Lao government in Vientiane. The Resistance government gained no international recognition, but Phoumi nominally retained both positions until the Geneva Agreements of 1954 brought the First Indochina War to an end.

In 1954 and 1955, Phoumi led Pathet Lao delegations in negotiations with the Royal Lao government over reintegration of the provinces of Phong Saly and Houaphan. In March 1955, Phoumi was one of the founding members of the Lao People&#x27;s Party and was elected to its Political Bureau (Politburo). The following January he was elected to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front (Neo Lao Hak Xat). In 1956, Phoumi continued to be involved in negotiations over integration which eventuated in the signing of a series of agreements, known as the Vientiane Agreements, the following year. These opened the way for formation of the First Coalition government in which Phoumi served as Minister of Religion and Fine Arts. (The other Pathet Lao minister was Souphanouvong at the Ministry of Economy and Plan.) From this time, Phoumi took a lively interest in the Buddhist Sangha, recognizing its potential as a propaganda organ for opposition to the Americanization of Lao society, but also as a vehicle for the propagation of Lao cultural values.

In the supplementary elections of May 1958, Phoumi was elected to the National Assembly to serve as a deputy for Luang Prabang. In the political crisis that followed the electoral success of the left, Phoumi lost his ministry. In July 1959 he was arrested along with other Pathet Lao deputies, and imprisoned without ever being brought to trial. In a famous May 1960 episode he escaped with Souphanouvong and other leading Pathet Lao prisoners and their guards, and made the long march to the Pathet Lao zone in Xieng Khouang.

After the Battle of Vientiane in December 1960 and the subsequent retreat of Neutralist forces to the Plain of Jars, Phoumi was instrumental in arranging for Pathet Lao-Neutralist collaboration. He led the Pathet Lao delegation to the Geneva Conference on the neutrality of Laos in 1962, and served as Minister of Information, Propaganda and Tourism in the Second Coalition government. In 1964, after a series of political assassinations, Phoumi left Vientiane with other Pathet Lao ministers.

By this time Laos had been dragged into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War) between the United States and North Vietnam. For the next ten years, Phoumi alternated between living in the limestone caverns of Viengxay and leading various Pathet Lao delegations to international communist gatherings. He retained his positions in both the Politburo and the Lao Patriotic Front, and took a leading role in negotiations leading to formation of the Third Coalition government in 1974, in which he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

After formation of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic in December 1975, Phoumi was named Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Sport and Religious Affairs. In the reorganization that followed the Third Congress of the LPRP in 1982, Phoumi became a member of the Inner Cabinet with overall responsibility for education, information and culture. In 1986, when Souphanouvong was forced to step down from the Presidency for reasons of health, Phoumi was named Acting President of the LPDR and Chairman of the Lao Front for National Construction. He retired from the Acting Presidency and the Politburo at the Fifth Party Congress in March 1991.

Since 1991, he and Prince Souphanouvong, Sisomphon Lovansay is Advisors of Party&#x27;s Central Committee.

<text>Heather Christensen (born October 1, 1979) is an American glamor model, noted for her work in various &quot;Playboy&quot; publications.

She was &quot;Playboy Special Editions&quot; Model of the Year for 2001. In 2002, she posed as a mermaid in the &quot;Wet and Wild&quot; 2002 edition.

Christensen was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to Tampa, Florida when she was 20. She was seen by a scout from &quot;Playboy&quot;, and began to model, which &quot;sort of interrupted&quot; her longer term plans.

Christensen has a wide range of hobbies, including rock climbing, diving, snowboarding, hiking, and singing. She is an especially noted skateboarder, who has been skating since 1998, first with a boyfriend, then by herself. The hobby cost her a broken arm, at Skatopia in Ohio, when she fell on a metal ramp; the fracture forced her to quit her job (and her boyfriend left her). She stayed with the hobby, and later lived with professional skateboarder Anthony Furlong. &quot;Playboy&quot; airbrushed out the scars on her arm in her pictures, and asked her to skate topless for a pictorial (which she says was &quot;... embarrassing. I was like &#x27;this hurts really bad!&#x27;&quot;). The hobby has been a conflict for her modeling, as she can&#x27;t skate for a week before a pictorial, to avoid bruises.

Christensen continued to study while working as a model. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology, and went to veterinary school, to become a veterinarian specializing in reptiles. She says she&#x27;d like to &quot;Live in a tropical paradise [...] traveling around the world rescuing exotic animals&quot;, and has kept turtles, snakes, lizards, and frogs at her home. Other hobbies include restoring a 1968 Ford Mustang.

<doc id="209627" wikidata="Q868967" url="?curid=209627" title="Klein–Gordon equation">
<text>The Klein–Gordon equation (Klein–Fock–Gordon equation or sometimes Klein–Gordon–Fock equation) is a relativistic wave equation, related to the Schrödinger equation. It is second-order in space and time and manifestly Lorentz-covariant. It is a differential equation version of the relativistic energy–momentum relation formula_1.

==Statement==
The Klein–Gordon equation can be written in different ways. The equation itself usually refers to the position space form, where it can be written in terms of separated space and time components formula_2 or by combining them into a four-vector formula_3 By Fourier transforming the field into momentum space, the solution is usually written in terms of a superposition of plane waves whose energy and momentum obey the energy-momentum dispersion relation from special relativity. Here, the Klein–Gordon equation is given for both of the two common metric signature conventions formula_4

Here, formula_5 is the wave operator and formula_6 is the Laplace operator. The speed of light formula_7 and Planck constant formula_8 are often seen to clutter the equations, so they are therefore often expressed in natural units where formula_9

Unlike the Schrödinger equation, the Klein–Gordon equation admits two values of for each : One positive and one negative. Only by separating out the positive and negative frequency parts does one obtain an equation describing a relativistic wavefunction. For the time-independent case, the Klein–Gordon equation becomes
: formula_10
which is formally the same as the homogeneous screened Poisson equation. In addition, the Klein–Gordon equation can also be represented as:

: formula_11

where, the momentum operator is given as:
: formula_12

==Relevance==
The equation is to be understood first as a classical continuous scalar field equation that can be quantized. The quantization process introduces then a quantum field whose quanta are spinless particles. Its theoretical relevance is similar to that of the Dirac equation. 
The equation solutions include a scalar or pseudoscalar field. In the realm of particle physics electromagnetic interactions can be incorporated, forming the topic of scalar electrodynamics, the practical utility for particles like pions is limited. There is a second version of the equation for a complex scalar field that is theoretically important being the equation of the Higgs Boson. In the realm of condensed matter it can be used for many approximations of quasi-particles without spin.

The equation can be put into the form of a Schrödinger equation. In this form it is expressed as two coupled differential equations, each of first order in time. The solutions have two components, reflecting the charge degree of freedom in relativity. It admits a conserved quantity, but this is not positive definite. The wave function cannot therefore be interpreted as a probability amplitude. The conserved quantity is instead interpreted as electric charge, and the norm squared of the wave function is interpreted as a charge density. The equation describes all spinless particles with positive, negative, and zero charge.

Any solution of the free Dirac equation is, for each of its four components, a solution of the free Klein–Gordon equation. Despite historically it was invented as a single particle equation the Klein–Gordon equation cannot form the basis of a consistent quantum relativistic &quot;one-particle&quot; theory, any relativistic theory implies creation and annihilation of particles beyond a certain energy threshold. 

== Solution for free particle ==
Here, the Klein–Gordon equation in natural units, formula_13, with the metric signature formula_14 is solved by Fourier transformation. Inserting the Fourier transformationformula_15and using orthogonality of the complex exponentials gives the dispersion relationformula_16This restricts the momenta to those that lie on shell, giving positive and negative energy solutionsformula_17For a new set of constants formula_18, the solution then becomesformula_19It is common to handle the positive and negative energy solutions by separating out the negative energies and work only with positive formula_20:formula_21In the last step, formula_22 was renamed. Now we can perform the formula_20-integration, picking up the positive frequency part from the delta function only:

formula_24

This is commonly taken as a general solution to the free Klein–Gordon equation. Note that because the initial Fourier transformation contained Lorentz invariant quantities like formula_25 only, the last expression is also a Lorentz invariant solution to the Klein–Gordon equation. If one does not require Lorentz invariance, one can absorb the formula_26-factor into the coefficients formula_27 and formula_28.

==History==
The equation was named after the physicists Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon, who in 1926 proposed that it describes relativistic electrons. Vladimir Fock also discovered the equation independently in 1926 slightly after Klein&#x27;s work, in that Klein&#x27;s paper was received on 28 April 1926, Fock&#x27;s paper was received on 30 July 1926 and Gordon&#x27;s paper on 29 September 1926. Other authors making similar claims in that same year include Johann Kudar, Théophile de Donder and Frans-H. van den Dungen, and Louis de Broglie. Although it turned out that modeling the electron&#x27;s spin required the Dirac equation, the Klein–Gordon equation correctly describes the spinless relativistic composite particles, like the pion. On 4 July 2012, European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN announced the discovery of the Higgs boson. Since the Higgs boson is a spin-zero particle, it is the first observed ostensibly elementary particle to be described by the Klein–Gordon equation. Further experimentation and analysis is required to discern whether the Higgs boson observed is that of the Standard Model or a more exotic, possibly composite, form.

The Klein–Gordon equation was first considered as a quantum wave equation by Erwin Schrödinger in his search for an equation describing de Broglie waves. The equation is found in his notebooks from late 1925, and he appears to have prepared a manuscript applying it to the hydrogen atom. Yet, because it fails to take into account the electron&#x27;s spin, the equation predicts the hydrogen atom&#x27;s fine structure incorrectly, including overestimating the overall magnitude of the splitting pattern by a factor of for the -th energy level. The Dirac equation relativistic spectrum is, however, easily recovered if the orbital-momentum quantum number is replaced by total angular-momentum quantum number . In January 1926, Schrödinger submitted for publication instead &quot;his&quot; equation, a non-relativistic approximation that predicts the Bohr energy levels of hydrogen without fine structure.

In 1926, soon after the Schrödinger equation was introduced, Vladimir Fock wrote an article about its generalization for the case of magnetic fields, where forces were dependent on velocity, and independently derived this equation. Both Klein and Fock used Kaluza and Klein&#x27;s method. Fock also determined the gauge theory for the wave equation. The Klein–Gordon equation for a free particle has a simple plane-wave solution.

==Derivation==
The non-relativistic equation for the energy of a free particle is
: formula_29

By quantizing this, we get the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for a free particle:
: formula_30
where 
: formula_31
is the momentum operator ( being the del operator), and 
: formula_32
is the energy operator.

The Schrödinger equation suffers from not being relativistically invariant, meaning that it is inconsistent with special relativity.

It is natural to try to use the identity from special relativity describing the energy:

: formula_33

Then, just inserting the quantum-mechanical operators for momentum and energy yields the equation

: formula_34

The square root of a differential operator can be defined with the help of Fourier transformations, but due to the asymmetry of space and time derivatives, Dirac found it impossible to include external electromagnetic fields in a relativistically invariant way. So he looked for another equation that can be modified in order to describe the action of electromagnetic forces. In addition, this equation, as it stands, is nonlocal (see also Introduction to nonlocal equations).

Klein and Gordon instead began with the square of the above identity, i.e.
: formula_35
which, when quantized, gives
: formula_36

which simplifies to
: formula_37

Rearranging terms yields
: formula_38

Since all reference to imaginary numbers has been eliminated from this equation, it can be applied to fields that are real-valued, as well as those that have complex values.

Rewriting the first two terms using the inverse of the Minkowski metric , and writing the Einstein summation convention explicitly we get
: formula_39

Thus the Klein–Gordon equation can be written in a covariant notation. This often means an abbreviation in the form of
: formula_40
where
: formula_41
and
: formula_42

This operator is called the wave operator.

Today this form is interpreted as the relativistic field equation for spin-0 particles. Furthermore, any &quot;component&quot; of any solution to the free Dirac equation (for a spin-1/2 particle) is automatically a solution to the free Klein–Gordon equation. This generalizes to particles of any spin due to the Bargmann–Wigner equations. Furthermore, in quantum field theory, every component of every quantum field must satisfy the free Klein–Gordon equation, making the equation a generic expression of quantum fields.

=== Klein–Gordon equation in a potential ===

The Klein–Gordon equation can be generalized to describe a field in some potential formula_43 as
: formula_44
Then the Klein–Gordon equation is the case formula_45.

Another common choice of potential which arises in interacting theories is the formula_46 potential for a real scalar field formula_47
:formula_48

==== Higgs sector ====

The pure Higgs boson sector of the Standard model is modelled by a Klein–Gordon field with a potential, denoted formula_49 for this section. The Standard model is a gauge theory and so while the field transforms trivially under the Lorentz group, it transforms as a formula_50-valued vector under the action of the formula_51 part of the gauge group. Therefore, while it is a vector field formula_52, it is still referred to as a scalar field, as scalar describes its transformation (formally, representation) under the Lorentz group. This is also discussed below in the scalar chromodynamics section.

The Higgs field is modelled by a potential
:formula_53,
which can be viewed as a generalization of the formula_46 potential, but has an important difference: it has a circle of minima. This observation is an important one in the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Standard model.

==Conserved U(1) current==
The Klein–Gordon equation (and action) for a complex field formula_55 admits a formula_56 symmetry. That is, under the transformations
:formula_57
:formula_58
the Klein–Gordon equation is invariant, as is the action (see below). By Noether&#x27;s theorem for fields, corresponding to this symmetry there is a current formula_59 defined as

:formula_60
which satisfies the conservation equation
formula_61
The form of the conserved current can be derived systematically by applying Noether&#x27;s theorem to the formula_56 symmetry. We will not do so here, but simply verify that this current is conserved.

From the Klein–Gordon equation for a complex field formula_63 of mass formula_64, written in covariant notation and &quot;mostly plus&quot; signature,
: formula_65
and its complex conjugate
: formula_66

Multiplying by the left respectively by formula_67 and formula_63 (and omitting for brevity the explicit formula_69 dependence),

: formula_70
: formula_71

Subtracting the former from the latter, we obtain

: formula_72
or in index notation,
: formula_73

Applying this to the derivative of the current formula_74 one finds
:formula_61

This formula_56 symmetry is a global symmetry, but it can also be gauged to create a local or gauge symmetry: see below scalar QED. The name of gauge symmetry is somewhat misleading: it is really a redundancy, while the global symmetry is a genuine symmetry.

== Lagrangian formulation ==
The Klein–Gordon equation can also be derived by a variational method, arising as the Euler–Lagrange equation of the action

: formula_77

In natural units, with signature &quot;mostly minus&quot;, the actions take the simple form

for a real scalar field of mass formula_78, and

for a complex scalar field of mass formula_64.

Applying the formula for the stress–energy tensor to the Lagrangian density (the quantity inside the integral), we can derive the stress–energy tensor of the scalar field. It is

:formula_80

and in natural units,

:formula_81

By integration of the time–time component over all space, one may show that both the positive- and negative-frequency plane-wave solutions can be physically associated with particles with &quot;positive&quot; energy. This is not the case for the Dirac equation and its energy–momentum tensor.

The stress energy tensor is the set of conserved currents corresponding to the invariance of the Klein–Gordon equation under space-time translations formula_82. Therefore, each component is conserved, that is, formula_83 (this holds only on-shell, that is, when the Klein–Gordon equations are satisfied). It follows that the integral of formula_84 over space is a conserved quantity for each formula_85. These have the physical interpretation of total energy for formula_86 and total momentum for formula_87 with formula_88.

==Non-relativistic limit==
===Classical field===
Taking the non-relativistic limit () of a classical Klein–Gordon field begins with the ansatz factoring the oscillatory rest mass energy term,

:formula_89

Defining the kinetic energy formula_90, formula_91 in the non-relativistic limit formula_92, and hence

:formula_93

Applying this yields the non-relativistic limit of the second time derivative of formula_55,

:formula_95
:formula_96

Substituting into the free Klein–Gordon equation, formula_97, yields

:formula_98

which (by dividing out the exponential and subtracting the mass term) simplifies to

:formula_99

This is a &quot;classical&quot; Schrödinger field.

===Quantum field===
The analogous limit of a quantum Klein–Gordon field is complicated by the non-commutativity of the field operator. In the limit , the creation and annihilation operators decouple and behave as independent quantum Schrödinger fields.

==Scalar electrodynamics==

There is a way to make the complex Klein–Gordon field formula_55 interact with electromagnetism in a gauge-invariant way. We can replace the (partial) derivative with the gauge-covariant derivative. Under a local formula_56 gauge transformation, the fields transform as
:formula_102
:formula_103
where formula_104 is a function of spacetime, thus making it a local transformation, as opposed to a constant over all of spacetime, which would be a global formula_56 transformation. A subtle point is that global transformations can arise as local ones, when the function formula_106 is taken to be a constant function.

A well-formulated theory should be invariant under such transformations. Precisely, this means that the equations of motion and action (see below) are invariant. To achieve this, ordinary derivatives formula_107 must be replaced by gauge-covariant derivatives formula_108, defined as 
:formula_109
:formula_110
where the 4-potential or gauge field formula_111 transforms under a gauge transformation formula_112 as 
:formula_113. 
With these definitions, the covariant derivative transforms as
:formula_114 
In natural units, the Klein–Gordon equation therefore becomes
: formula_115

Since an &quot;ungauged&quot; formula_56 symmetry is only present in complex Klein–Gordon theory, this coupling and promotion to a &quot;gauged&quot; formula_56 symmetry is compatible only with complex Klein–Gordon theory and not real Klein–Gordon theory.

In natural units and mostly minus signature we have
where formula_118 is known as the Maxwell tensor, field strength or curvature depending on viewpoint.

This theory is often known as scalar quantum electrodynamics or scalar QED, although all aspects we&#x27;ve discussed here are classical.

=== Scalar chromodynamics ===
It is possible to extend this to a non-abelian gauge theory with a gauge group formula_119, where we couple the scalar Klein–Gordon action to a Yang–Mills Lagrangian. Here, the field is actually vector-valued, but is still described as a scalar field: the scalar describes its transformation under space-time transformations, but not its transformation under the action of the gauge group.

For concreteness we fix formula_119 to be formula_121, the special unitary group for some formula_122. Under a gauge transformation formula_123, which can be described as a function formula_124 the scalar field formula_55 transforms as a formula_126 vector
:formula_127
:formula_128.
The covariant derivative is
:formula_129
:formula_130
where the gauge field or connection transforms as 
:formula_131
This field can be seen as a matrix valued field which acts on the vector space formula_126.

Finally defining the chromomagnetic field strength or curvature,
:formula_133
we can define the action.
==Klein–Gordon on curved spacetime==
In general relativity, we include the effect of gravity by replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives, and the Klein–Gordon equation becomes (in the mostly pluses signature)

: formula_134

or equivalently,

: formula_135

where is the inverse of the metric tensor that is the gravitational potential field, &quot;g&quot; is the determinant of the metric tensor, is the covariant derivative, and is the Christoffel symbol that is the gravitational force field.

With natural units this becomes

This also admits an action formulation on a spacetime (Lorentzian) manifold formula_64. Using abstract index notation and in &quot;mostly plus&quot; signature this is

<text>Margaret Mattson was one of two women tried and acquitted in Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania for witchcraft in 1683.

==Biography==
Nils and Margaret Mattson arrived in the colony of New Sweden in present-day southeastern Pennsylvania on May 22, 1654, on the ship Orn. They settled on land near Eddystone, Pennsylvania.

Of Swedish-Finnish descent, Nils was a reputed healer working from Finnish tradition. In 1683, some of Margaret&#x27;s neighbors claimed that she had bewitched cattle.

Charges of practicing witchcraft were brought before the Pennsylvania Provincial Council on February 7, 1683 (under Julian calendar). This occurred nineteen years after the Swedish territory became a British common law colony and subject to English Witchcraft Act 1603.

Accused by several neighbors, as well as her own daughter in law, Mattson&#x27;s alleged crimes included making threats against neighbors, causing cows to give little milk, bewitching and killing livestock and appearing to witnesses in spectral form. On February 27, 1683, charges against Mattson and a neighbor Gertro (a.k.a. Yeshro) Jacobsson, wife of Hendrick Jacobsson, were brought by the Attorney General before a grand jury of 21 men overseen by the colony&#x27;s proprietor, William Penn. The grand jury returned a true bill indictment that afternoon, and the cases proceeded to trial. A petit jury of 12 men was selected by Penn and an interpreter was appointed for the Finnish women, who did not speak English. Penn barred the use of prosecution and defense lawyers, conducted the questioning himself, and permitted the introduction of unsubstantiated hearsay. Penn himself gave the closing charge and directions to the jury, but what he told them was not transcribed. According to the minutes of the Provincial Council, dated February 27, 1683, the jury returned with a verdict of &quot;Guilty of having the Comon Fame of a Witch, but not Guilty in manner and Forme as Shee stands Endicted.&quot;

Thus Mattson was found guilty of having the reputation of a witch, but not guilty of bewitching animals. Neither woman was convicted of witchcraft. &quot;Hence the superstitious got enough to have their thinking affirmed. Those less superstitious, and justice minded, got what they wanted.&quot; The accused were released on their husbands posting recognizance bonds of 50 pounds and promising six months&#x27; good behavior.

A popular legend tells of William Penn dismissing the charges against Mattson by affirming her legal right to fly on a broomstick, saying &quot;Well, I know of no law against it.&quot; The record fails to show any such commentary, but the story probably reflects popular views of Penn&#x27;s socially progressive Quaker values.

<text>The Sibley–Monroe checklist is a list of bird species based on a study conducted by Charles Sibley and Burt Monroe. It drew on extensive DNA–DNA hybridization studies to reassess the relationships between modern birds. It was considered a landmark in ornithology on its release. The Sibley–Monroe assignment of individual species to families, and of families to orders remains controversial. Critics maintain that while it marks a leap forward so far as the evidence from DNA–DNA hybridization goes, it pays insufficient attention to other forms of evidence, both molecular and on a larger scale. There is no true consensus, but the broad middle-ground position is that the Sibley–Monroe classification, overall, is &quot;about 80% correct&quot;. Research and debate concerning bird classification continue. There are 9994 species on the checklist.

<text>The Star of David () is a symbol generally recognized as representing both Jewish identity and Judaism. Its shape is that of a hexagram: the compound of two equilateral triangles. 
A derivation of the Seal of Solomon was used for decorative and mystical purposes by Muslims and Kabbalistic Jews. The hexagram appears occasionally in Jewish contexts since antiquity as a decorative motif, such as a stone bearing a hexagram from the arch of the 3rd–4th century Khirbet Shura synagogue. A hexagram found in a religious context can be seen in a manuscript of the Hebrew Bible from 11th-century Cairo.

Its association as a distinctive symbol for the Jewish people and their religion dates to 17th-century Prague. In the 19th century, the symbol began to be widely used by the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, ultimately coming to represent Jewish identity or religious beliefs. It became representative of Zionism after it was chosen as the central symbol for a Jewish national flag at the First Zionist Congress in 1897.

By the end of World War I, it was an internationally accepted symbol for the Jewish people, used on the gravestones of fallen Jewish soldiers.

Today, the star is the central symbol on the national flag of the State of Israel.

==Roots==

Unlike the menorah, the Lion of Judah, the shofar and the lulav, the hexagram was not originally a uniquely Jewish symbol. The hexagram, being an inherently simple geometric construction, has been used in various motifs throughout human history, which were not exclusively religious. It appeared as a decorative motif in both 4th-century synagogues and Christian churches in the Galilee region.

Gershom Scholem writes that the term &quot;seal of Solomon&quot; was adopted by Jews from Islamic magic literature, while he could not assert with certainty whether the term &quot;shield of David&quot; originated in Islamic or Jewish mysticism. Leonora Leet argues though that not just the terminology, but the esoteric philosophy behind it had pre-Islamic Jewish roots. She also shows that Jewish alchemists were the teachers of their Muslim and Christian counterparts, and that a way-opener such as Maria Hebraea of Alexandria (2nd or 3rd century CE; others date her earlier) already used concepts which were later adopted by Muslim and Christian alchemists and could be graphically associated with the symbolism of the upper and lower triangles constituting the hexagram, which came into explicit use after her time. The hexagram however only becomes widespread in Jewish magical texts and amulets (&quot;segulot&quot;) in the early Middle Ages, which is why most modern authors have seen Islamic mysticism as the source of the medieval Spanish Kabbalists&#x27; use of the hexagram. The name &quot;Star of David&quot; originates from King David of ancient Israel.

==Use as Jewish emblem==
Only around one millennium later, however, did the star begin to be used as a symbol to identify Jewish communities, a tradition that seems to have started in Prague before the 17th century, and from there spread to much of Eastern Europe.

In the 19th century, it came to be adopted by European Jews as a symbol to represent Jewish religion or identity in the same manner the Christian cross identified that religion&#x27;s believers. The symbol became representative of the worldwide Zionist community after it was chosen as the central symbol on a flag at the First Zionist Congress in 1897, due to its usage in some Jewish communities and its lack of specifically religious connotations. It was not considered an exclusively Jewish symbol until after it began to be used on the gravestones of fallen Jewish soldiers in World War I.

==History of Jewish usage==
===Early use as an ornament===
The hexagram does appear occasionally in Jewish contexts since antiquity, apparently as a decorative motif. For example, in Israel, there is a stone bearing a hexagram from the arch of the 3rd–4th century Khirbet Shura synagogue in the Galilee. It also appears on a temple on Bar Kokhba Revolt coinage which dates from 135 CE. Originally, the hexagram may have been employed as an architectural ornament on synagogues, as it is, for example, on the cathedrals of Brandenburg and Stendal, and on the Marktkirche at Hanover. A hexagram in this form is found on the ancient synagogue at Capernaum.

The use of the hexagram in a Jewish context as a possibly meaningful symbol may occur as early as the 11th century, in the decoration of the carpet page of the famous Tanakh manuscript, the Leningrad Codex dated 1008. Similarly, the symbol illuminates a medieval Tanakh manuscript dated 1307 belonging to Rabbi Yosef bar Yehuda ben Marvas from Toledo, Spain.

===Kabbalistic use===
A hexagram has been noted on a Jewish tombstone in Taranto, Apulia in Southern Italy, which may date as early as the third century CE. The Jews of Apulia were noted for their scholarship in Kabbalah, which has been connected to the use of the Star of David.

Medieval Kabbalistic grimoires show hexagrams among the tables of segulot, but without identifying them as &quot;Shield of David&quot;.

In the Renaissance, in the 16th-century Land of Israel, the book Ets Khayim conveys the Kabbalah of Ha-Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria) who arranges the traditional items on the seder plate for Passover into two triangles, where they explicitly correspond to Jewish mystical concepts. The six sfirot of the masculine Zer Anpin correspond to the six items on the seder plate, while the seventh sfira being the feminine Malkhut corresponds to the plate itself.

However, these seder-plate triangles are parallel, one above the other, and do not actually form a hexagram.

According to G. S. Oegema (1996):

Isaac Luria provided the hexagram with a further mystical meaning. In his book &quot;Etz Chayim&quot; he teaches that the elements of the plate for the Seder evening have to be placed in the order of the hexagram: above the three sefirot &quot;Crown&quot;, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Insight&quot;, below the other seven.

Similarly, M. Costa wrote that M. Gudemann and other researchers in the 1920s claimed that Isaac Luria was influential in turning the Star of David into a national Jewish emblem by teaching that the elements of the plate for the Seder evening have to be placed in the order of the hexagram. Gershom Scholem (1990) disagrees with this view, arguing that Isaac Luria talked about parallel triangles one beneath the other and not about the hexagram.

The Star of David at least since the 20th century remains associated with the number seven and thus with the Menorah, and popular accounts associate it with the six directions of space plus the center (under the influence of the description of space found in the Sefer Yetsira: Up, Down, East, West, South, North, and Center), or the Six Sefirot of the Male (Zeir Anpin) united with the Seventh Sefirot of the Female (Nukva). Some say that one triangle represents the ruling tribe of Judah and the other the former ruling tribe of Benjamin. It is also seen as a dalet and yud, the two letters assigned to Judah. There are 12 Vav, or &quot;men&quot;, representing the 12 tribes or patriarchs of Israel.

===Official usage in Central European communities===
In 1354, King of Bohemia Charles IV approved for the Jews of Prague a red flag with a hexagram. In 1460, the Jews of Ofen (Buda, now part of Budapest, Hungary) received King Matthias Corvinus with a red flag on which were two Shields of David and two stars. In the first Hebrew prayer book, printed in Prague in 1512, a large hexagram appears on the cover. In the colophon is written: &quot;Each man beneath his flag according to the house of their fathers...and he will merit to bestow a bountiful gift on anyone who grasps the Shield of David.&quot; In 1592, Mordechai Maizel was allowed to affix &quot;a flag of King David, similar to that located on the Main Synagogue&quot; on his synagogue in Prague. Following the Battle of Prague (1648), the Jews of Prague were again granted a flag, in recognition of their contribution to the city&#x27;s defense. That flag showed a yellow hexagram on a red background, with a &quot;Swedish star&quot; placed in the center of the hexagram.

In the 1650s, the Jews of Vienna adopted a seal with the hexagram on it, likely choosing the motif used on the seal for the Jews of Prague. When a boundary was fixed between Vienna and the Jewish ghetto, a marker was fashioned which separated the two communities. The Christians were identified by the cross and the Jews by the hexagram. When the Jews of Vienna were expelled in 1669, many refugees fled to other cities which in turn used the symbol for their community seal. 

===As a symbol of Judaism and the Jewish community===
The symbol became representative of the worldwide Zionist community, and later the broader Jewish community, after it was chosen to represent the First Zionist Congress in 1897.

A year before the congress, Herzl had written in his 1896 Der Judenstaat:

We have no flag, and we need one. If we desire to lead many men, we must raise a symbol above their heads. I would suggest a white flag, with seven golden stars. The white field symbolizes our pure new life; the stars are the seven golden hours of our working-day. For we shall march into the Promised Land carrying the badge of honor.
David Wolffsohn (1856–1914), a businessman prominent in the early Zionist movement, was aware that the nascent Zionist movement had no official flag, and that the design proposed by Theodor Herzl was gaining no significant support, wrote:

At the behest of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make preparations for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of the essence of the Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.

In the early 20th century, the symbol began to be used to express Jewish affiliations in sports. Hakoah Vienna was a Jewish sports club founded in Vienna, Austria, in 1909 whose teams competed with the Star of David on the chest of their uniforms, and won the 1925 Austrian League soccer championship. Similarly, The Philadelphia Sphas basketball team in Philadelphia (whose name was an acronym of its founding South Philadelphia Hebrew Association) wore a large Star of David on their jerseys to proudly proclaim their Jewish identity, as they competed in the first half of the 20th century.

In boxing, Benny &quot;the Ghetto Wizard&quot; Leonard (who said he felt as though he was fighting for all Jews) fought with a Star of David embroidered on his trunks in the 1910s. World heavyweight boxing champion Max Baer fought with a Star of David on his trunks as well, notably, for the first time as he knocked out Nazi Germany hero Max Schmeling in 1933; Hitler never permitted Schmeling to fight a Jew again.

===The Holocaust===

A Star of David, often yellow, was used by the Nazis during the Holocaust to identify Jews. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, there initially were different local decrees forcing Jews to wear distinct signs (e.g. in the General Government, a white armband with a blue Star of David; in the , a yellow badge, in the form of a Star of David, on the left breast and on the back). If a Jew was found in public without the star, he could be severely punished. The requirement to wear the Star of David with the word (German for Jew) was then extended to all Jews over the age of six in the Reich and in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (by a decree issued on September 1, 1941, and signed by Reinhard Heydrich) and was gradually introduced in other Nazi-occupied areas. Others, however, wore the Star of David as a symbol of defiance against Nazi antisemitism, as in the case of United States Army private Hal Baumgarten, who wore a Star of David emblazoned on his back during the 1944 invasion of Normandy.

==Contemporary use==

The flag of Israel, depicting a blue Star of David on a white background, between two horizontal blue stripes was adopted on October 28, 1948, five months after the country&#x27;s establishment. The origins of the flag&#x27;s design date from the First Zionist Congress in 1897; the flag has subsequently been known as the &quot;flag of Zion&quot;.

Many Modern Orthodox synagogues, and many synagogues of other Jewish movements, have the Israeli flag with the Star of David prominently displayed at the front of the synagogues near the Ark containing the Torah scrolls.

Magen David Adom (MDA) (&quot;Red Star of David&quot; or, translated literally, &quot;Red Shield of David&quot;) is Israel&#x27;s only official emergency medical, disaster, and ambulance service. It has been an official member of the International Committee of the Red Cross since June 2006. According to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Magen David Adom was boycotted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which refused to grant the organization membership because &quot;it was [...] argued that having an emblem used by only one country was contrary to the principles of universality.&quot; Other commentators said the ICRC did not recognize the medical and humanitarian use of this Jewish symbol, a Red Shield, alongside the Christian cross and the Muslim crescent.

===Use in sports===

Since 1948, the Star of David has carried the dual significance of representing both the state of Israel and Jewish identity in general. In the United States especially, it continues to be used in the latter sense by a number of athletes.

In baseball, Jewish major leaguer Gabe Kapler had a Star of David tattooed on his left calf in 2000, with the words &quot;strong-willed&quot; and &quot;strong-minded&quot;, major leaguer Mike &quot;Superjew&quot; Epstein drew a Star of David on his baseball glove, and major leaguer Ron Blomberg had a Star of David emblazoned in the knob of his bat which is on display at the Baseball Hall of Fame.

NBA basketball star Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, who says he is spiritually and culturally Jewish, had a Star of David tattoo put on his left hand in 2010. NFL football defensive end Igor Olshansky has Star of David tattoos on each side of his neck, near his shoulders. Israeli golfer Laetitia Beck displays a blue-and-white Magen David symbol on her golf apparel.

In boxing, Jewish light heavyweight world champion Mike &quot;The Jewish Bomber&quot; Rossman fought with a Star of David embroidered on his boxing trunks, and also has a blue Star of David tattoo on the outside of his right calf.

Other boxers fought with Stars of David embroidered on their trunks include world lightweight champion, world light heavyweight boxing champion Battling Levinsky, Barney Ross (world champion as a lightweight, as a junior welterweight, and as a welterweight), world flyweight boxing champion Victor &quot;Young&quot; Peres, world bantamweight champion Alphonse Halimi, and more recently World Boxing Association super welterweight champion Yuri Foreman, light welterweight champion Cletus Seldin, and light middleweight Boyd Melson. Welterweight Zachary &quot;Kid Yamaka&quot; Wohlman has a tattoo of a Star of David across his stomach, and welterweight Dmitriy Salita even boxes under the nickname &quot;Star of David&quot;.

Maccabi clubs still use the Star of David in their emblems.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; cites a 12th-century Karaite document as the earliest Jewish literary source to mention a symbol called &quot;Magen Dawid&quot; (without specifying its shape).

The name &#x27;Shield of David&#x27; was used by at least the 11th century as a title of the God of Israel, independent of the use of the symbol. The phrase occurs independently as a divine title in the Siddur, the traditional Jewish prayer book, where it poetically refers to the divine protection of ancient King David and the anticipated restoration of his dynastic house, perhaps based on Psalm 18, which is attributed to David, and in which God is compared to a shield (v. 31 and v. 36). The term occurs at the end of the &quot;Samkhaynu/Gladden us&quot; blessing, which is recited after the reading of the Haftara portion on Saturday and holidays.

The earliest known text related to Judaism which mentions a sign called the &quot;Shield of David&quot; is &quot;Eshkol Ha-Kofer&quot; by the Karaite Judah Hadassi, in the mid-12th century CE:

Seven names of angels precede the mezuzah: Michael, Gabriel, etc. ...Tetragrammaton protect you! And likewise the sign, called the &quot;Shield of David&quot;, is placed beside the name of each angel.

This book is of Karaite, and not of Rabbinic Jewish origin, and it does not describe the shape of the sign in any way.

*Some criminal gangs, including the Gangster Disciples and those affiliated with the Folk Nation, use the Star of David as their symbol. In the case of the Gangster Disciples this is a reference to the group&#x27;s founder, David Barksdale, also known as &quot;King David&quot;.
*The insignia of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has included a hexagram since the end of the 19th century.

<doc id="209646" wikidata="Q2427065" url="?curid=209646" title="Northern Thai people">
<text>The Northern Thai people or Tai Yuan (, ), self-designation khon mu(e)ang ( meaning &quot;people of the (cultivated) land&quot; or &quot;people of our community&quot;), are a Tai ethnic group, native to nine provinces in Northern Thailand, principally in the area of the former kingdom of Lan Na. As a Tai group, they are closely related to Tai Lü and Tai Khün with regards to common culture, language and history in contrast to Thailand&#x27;s dominant Thai ethnic group (referred to as &quot;Siamese&quot; or &quot;Central Thai&quot;). There are approximately 6 million Tai Yuan. Most of them live in Northern Thailand, with a small minority 29,442 (2005 census) living across the border in Bokeo Province of Laos. Their language is called Northern Thai, Lanna or &quot;Kham Mueang&quot;.

== Exonym and endonym==

=== Endonyms ===
The Northern Thai people refer to themselves as khon muang, meaning &quot;people of the (cultivated) land,&quot; &quot;people of our community&quot; or &quot;society&quot; (&quot;mueang&quot; is a central term in Tai languages that has a broad meaning and is essential to the social structure of Tai peoples). With that name, they historically identified themselves as the inhabitants of the alluvial plains, river valleys and plateaus of their native area, where they lived in local communities, called &quot;muang&quot;, and cultivated rice on paddy fields. That distinguished them from the indigenous peoples of the area (&quot;hill tribes&quot;), like the Lua&#x27;, who lived in the wooded mountains practicing slash-and-burn agriculture. Membership of the Northern Thai was therefore defined by lifestyle, rather than genetics. At the same time, it was a term of dissociation from the Burmese and Siamese, who held suzerainty over the Lanna Kingdom for centuries and who were not &quot;people of our &quot;muang&quot;&quot;.

For the same reasons, the &quot;khon muang&quot; call themselves &quot;kammuang&quot; or &quot;kham muang&quot; in which &quot;kam&quot; means language or word, and &quot;muang&quot; means town; hence, the meaning &quot;town language&quot;, contrasts those of the many hill tribes in the surrounding mountainous areas.

=== Exonyms ===
The exonym Tai Yuan is likely derived from Sanskrit &quot;yavana&quot; meaning &quot;stranger,&quot; which itself comes from the name of the Greek tribe of the Ionians, or from Pali . In everyday speech, &quot;Tai&quot; prefixed to some location is understood as meaning &quot;Tai person&quot; of that place. Predecessors to the term &quot;Yuan&quot; were used by the Chams, Vietnamese, and Khmer as exonyms for other ethnic groups in the region. The Khmer form is still used today, as a pejorative exonym for the Vietnamese. The Burmese historically referred to the Northern Thai people as the Yun (), which in turn is now the Burmese word for &quot;lacquerware.&quot;

The British colonial rulers in neighbouring Burma (now Myanmar) referred to them as &quot;Siamese Shan&quot; to distinguish them from the Shan proper, whom they called &quot;Burmese Shan&quot;. 

Until the 20th century, the Siamese considered Northern Thais to be &quot;Lao&quot;, due to linguistic and cultural differences, or more specifically as &quot;Lao phung dam&quot;, or black-bellied Lao because of their tradition of tattooing their abdomens (&quot;phung&quot;), which contrasted with the Lao to their east, who did not have that custom. According to Jit Bhumisak, a prominent Thai historian, Northern Thais consider themselves Tai-Thai and do not refer to themselves as Lao. That is reflected in various inscriptions in which the term &quot;Thai-Tai&quot; is used to refer to themselves. The term &quot;Lao&quot; is seen as an insult by Northern Thais, as it is associated with a savage and uncivilized culture. Therefore, the use of the term &quot;Khon Muang&quot; is a way for Northern Thais to assert their distinct identity and cultural heritage and to distance themselves from the negative connotations of the term &quot;Lao&quot;.

The Northern Thais also call Central Thais &quot;Thai&quot; and add the word &quot;South&quot; to refer to Southern Thais or &quot;Southerners.&quot; However, they do not use the term Tai/Thai to refer to other ethnicities that interact more closely with La Nna society, such as Tai Yai, Tai Khoen, Tai Lue people, which reflects the fact that they see themselves and those ethnic groups as distinct entities.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
According to a shared legend amongst various Tai peoples, a possibly-mythical king, Khun Borom Rachathiriat of Mueang Then begot several sons that settled and ruled other mueang, or city-states, across Southeast Asia and southern China. Descended from ancient peoples known to the Chinese as the Yue and the Ai Lao, the Tai tribes began migrating into South-East Asia by the beginning of the 1st millennium, but large-scale migrations took place between the 7th and the 13th centuries AD, especially from what is now Sipsongbanna, Yunnan Province and Guangxi. The possible reasons for Tai migration include pressures from Han Chinese expansion, Mongol invasions, finding suitable land for wet rice cultivation and the fall of the states in which the Tais inhabited.
According to linguistic and other historical evidence, Tai-speaking tribes migrated southwestward to the modern territories of Laos and Thailand from Guangxi sometime between the 8th and the 10th centuries. The Tai assimilated or pushed out indigenous Austroasiatic Mon–Khmer peoples, and settled on the fringes of the Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer Empire. The blending of peoples and the influx of Indian philosophy, religion, language, culture and customs via and alongside some Austroasiatic element enriched the culture of the Tai peoples, but the Tais remained in contact with the other Tai mueang.

The presence of the Yuan in what is now northern Thailand has been documented since the 11th century. The core of their original settlement area lies in the basin of the Kok and Ing rivers in what is now Chiang Rai province. Since the Yuan, like other Tai peoples, traditionally live from wet rice cultivation, they settled only in the river plains of northern Thailand, not in the mountain ranges that run through it and make up three quarters of the area. They formed small-scale principalities (Mueang). The geography of the settlement area prevented the formation of larger communities.

=== Kingdom of Hiran ===
The Kingdom of Hiran was a state formed in the 7th century AD in what is now northern Thailand. There are no written records of Hiran prior to the reign of King Mangrai, the founder and ruler of Lan na from 1296 to 1317. In the 8th century, the city of Yonok was founded in the area of today&#x27;s Chiang Saen district by subjugating the pre-existing Khmu and Lawa populations. After the city of Yonok was destroyed in an earthquake, the Tai Yuan rebuilt the city at Vieng Prueksa in present-day Mae Sai district (Chiang Rai Province), where they formed an elected monarchy. Vieng Prueksa came under the sphere of influence of the Lavo Kingdom, now Lopburi, which was a vassal state of the Khmer state of Chenla.

The king of Lavo forced the accession to the throne of Lawachangkarat, who became ruler of the new kingdom in 638 and changed the name of the capital to Hiran. Around the year 850, the seventh king of Hiran, Laokiang, had Yonok rebuilt on the current site of Chiang Saen, which took the name of Ngoenyang and became the new capital. From then on, the Kingdom of Hiran was called the Kingdom of Ngoenyang and expanded significantly, subsequently by occupying the Laotian territories of Meuang Sua and Mueang Theng, today&#x27;s Luang Prabang and Dien Bien Phu.

=== Independent state of Lan Na ===
Mangrai, the ruler of &quot;Mueang&quot; Ngoenyang, united a number of these principalities after his accession to the throne around 1259 and founded the city of Chiang Rai in 1263. Around 1292 he conquered the Mon kingdom of Hariphunchai, which had dominated large parts of what is now northern Thailand in political, economic and cultural terms. That laid the foundation for the new Kingdom of Lan Na (&quot;One Million Rice Fields&quot;) when its capital, Mangrai, founded Chiang Mai in 1296. The remaining &quot;Mueang&quot;, which were dependent on Lan Na, retained their own dynasties and extensive autonomy, but had to swear loyalty to the king and pay tribute (mandala model). Lan Na was ethnically very heterogeneous and the Northern Thai did not constitute the majority of the population in large parts of their domain.
However, the different cultures converged, so the originally animist and illiterate Tai Yuan adopted their religion, Theravada Buddhism, and their writing system from the Mon of Hariphunchai (the Tai Tham script is developed from the Old Mon script). As a result, a common identity among the peoples of Lan Na became increasingly common in the 14th century, and the non-Tai peoples largely assimilated to the Tai Yuan. Anyone who integrated themselves into the communities in the river valleys and plains &quot;(Mueang)&quot; was regarded as Tai, regardless of ethnic origin, hence the self-designation &quot;Khon Mueang&quot;. Only the indigenous peoples such as the Lawa, who lived outside the &quot;Mueang&quot; in the highlands of the mountains and practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, were not included. They were grouped together by the Tai as &quot;kha&quot;. Ethnicity was defined less by descent than by way of life.

The Tai Yuan had very close ties with the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. In 1546, Setthathirath, a Lao prince, was elected king of Lan Na. By the middle of the 15th century at the latest, they had the technology to manufacture and use cannons and fireworks rockets. The expansion of the sphere of influence of Lan Na reached a climax in the second half of the 15th century under King Tilok. The sphere of interest of Lan Na clashed with that of the central Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya, which resulted in several wars over the &quot;Mueang&quot; of Sukhothai, Phitsanulok and Kamphaeng Phet, that lied between the two kingdoms.

The first decades of the 16th century are considered to be the heyday of the Lan Na literature. The classical works of the time, however, were written not in the native language of the Tai Yuan but in the scholarly language of Pali. At the same time, however, Ayutthaya was expanding north and Siamese troops penetrated deep into the Yuan-inhabited area of Lan Na. The fighting was extremely costly, and a number of high-ranking generals and nobles of the Yuan perished. In addition to the population losses of men of armed age as a result of the war, much of the population also fell victim to natural disasters and epidemics around 1520, which initiated the decline of Lan Na. In 1558, Lan Na came under the rule of the Burmese Taungoo dynasty (Kingdom of Ava).

As there was often a shortage of labour in pre-modern Southeast Asia, it was customary after wars to drag parts of the population of the defeated party to the area of the victor. In the 17th century, after the subjugation of Lan Na by the Burmese, some Tai Yuan were brought to their capital Ava, where they belonged to the category of royal servants and provided lacquerware. The Burmese control over the Tai Yuan increased the differences between them and the Siamese in Ayutthaya.

Nevertheless, after the fall of Ayutthaya, the Tai Yuan nobility of Lan Na entered into an alliance with King Taksin of Thonburi (the new Siamese kingdom) and, with his support, shook off Burmese supremacy in 1774, but that was immediately replaced by that of the Siamese (from 1782 under the Chakri dynasty and with the capital of Bangkok). After conquering Chiang Saen in 1804, the last Burmese outpost in what is now Thailand, the Siamese deported thousands of Tai Yuan residents to the Siamese heartland, the Chao Phraya Basin of central Thailand. As a result, a significant number of Tai Yuan still live in the provinces of Ratchaburi and Saraburi, where in the Sao Hai District an enclave with a Tai Yuan majority still exists.

=== Annexation into Thailand and Thaification ===
Until the 19th century, Lan Na retained its own structure and autonomy in internal affairs within the Siamese dominion. Its inhabitants were considered western Lao (or &quot;black-bellied Lao&quot; because of the tradition of male Tai Yuan to tattoo themselves above the hips), but not as Siamese. The Tai Yuan also saw themselves more as relatives of the Lao than the Siamese of the central Thai lowlands. As recently as the 1980s, the government of Laos referred to the Tai Yuan-inhabited provinces of northern Thailand as their &quot;lost territories&quot;. The Siamese King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) wrote in 1883 to his high commissioner in Chiang Mai about the Tai Yuan, which he called &quot;Lao&quot;:

After Siam had to cede what is now Laos to France in 1893, the Thai government stopped designating the Lao and Tai Yuan living in Thailand as Lao to avoid justifying further expansion of the French protectorate of Laos. Lan Na lost its independence in 1899, when the administrative reform under King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) introduced the centralised &quot;thesaphiban&quot;-system. Chulalongkorn&#x27;s son Rama VI (Vajiravudh), who ruled from 1905, endeavoured to turn the population of his empire into a nation and Thailand into a nation state. There was less and less differentiation between Siamese, Lao or Tai Yuan, and there was increasingly talk of the Thai nation. Vajiravudh strove to unite the different tribes under one dominant culture. During the Monthon reforms of the north region at the turn of the 20th century, the region of Lanna was assigned to &quot;Monthon Phayap&quot; () from the Sanskrit word for &quot;northwest&quot;.

This policy of Thaification was intensified after the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932 and the takeover of power by Plaek Phibunsongkhram in 1938. Phibunsongkhram decreed in 1939 that from now on, the country should be called only Thailand and its inhabitants only Thai. He forbade any ethnic or regional differentiation. The Lanna script was subsequently repressed in favour of the Thai alphabet. The use of the central Thai dialect was also promoted in the north in displace the Lanna language. As a result, many Thais cannot distinguish between citizenship &quot;(san-chat)&quot; and ethnicity or origin &quot;(chuea-chat)&quot;. The Lanna script formerly in use by northern Thai people is also called Tai Tham script. The effects of Thaification in the wake of Monthon reforms have caused few northern Thai to be able to read or write it, as it no longer represents accurately the orthography of the spoken form.

=== Contemporary history ===
Despite the Thaification policies, the Tai Yuan have retained their own cultural identity even if that is now mostly referred to as Northern Thai) The Tai Yuan have their own dance tradition, and a cuisine very different from that of central Thailand. Even if almost all residents of northern Thailand understand and can speak the standard Thai language, which is compulsory in schools, most of them still speak the Northern Thai language at home. However, since 1985 the use of the language has declined. Since then, the younger generations have used the Northern Thai language less and less amd so the language was to be expected to disappear in the medium term.

On the other hand, there has been a renaissance of Lanna culture since the mid-1990s. Especially around the 700th anniversary of Chiang Mai in 1996, a great pride in its own history and tradition could be established. At Chiang Mai University in particular, a number of scholars are dedicated to researching traditions and cultivating cultural heritage. Since then, some Northern Thai women, mainly the middle and upper classes, have been wearing the classic dresses of the north again on special occasions, made of hand-made cotton. In many public institutions and government agencies it is customary to wear clothes made of traditional textiles on Fridays. There are regular performances of Lan Na music and dance, as well as demonstrations of traditional handicrafts. As an expression of the own regional character, signs with lettering in Lanna script are again being set up in some places.

==Culture==
===Language===

The Tai Yuan speak the Northern Thai language, also known as Kham Mueang and Lanna, which is like Lao and Thai one of the Tai languages. Northern Tai is similar to the Tai Lue language, which is mainly located in the south of Yunnan but also present in the northern areas of Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, and to the Khün language, located in the eastern part of the Shan State of Myanmar.

The Northern Tai language has its own writing system, the Tai Tham script, which is also called the Lanna script. The script is still taught to Lao Buddhist monks. After being banned from schools as part of the thaification process, the script has recently been rediscovered by the population. It is believed by the Tai Yuan that the script has divine powers, and tattoos and amulets written in Tai Tham are thought to possess particular powers.

===Religion===

The Tai Yuan have practiced Theravada Buddhism for several centuries. Chiang Mai is historically one of the places where Lanna sacred art has developed the most, with ancient temples and Buddha sculptures. In Laos, religious practices have returned to normal after the obstacles posed by the communist government in the first years after the seizure of power in 1975. Traditionally the Tai Yuan, like most Tai peoples, have remained clinging to their animist roots. Small sanctuaries dedicated to this belief scattered throughout the territory are still frequented by devotees who ask for the protection of the spirits. Many of the private gardens also have a spirit house which is stocked daily with votive offerings.

A widespread cult among the Tai Yuan is that of the spirit of Chao Luang Kham Daeng, which is passed down through two legends. The first describes him as a human being sent by the god Indra to become king and teach Buddhist precepts to his subjects. In this capacity he founded the city Lanna, became its ruler and on his death he was placed by the citizens of Chiang Mai at the helm of the protective spirits of the city. The second legend reports that Chao Luang Kham Daeng is the lord of the ogres who guard the treasure of the sacred cave of Chiang Dao. It is assumed that the second legend comes from the tradition of the Lawa people, the people that had settled in the Chiang Mai area before its foundation and the arrival of the Tai Yuan.

<doc id="209650" wikidata="Q1569770" url="?curid=209650" title="Struthionidae">
<text>Struthionidae (; ) is a family of flightless birds, containing the extant ostriches and their extinct relatives. The two extant species of ostrich are the common ostrich and Somali ostrich, both in the genus &quot;Struthio&quot;, which also contains several species known from Holocene fossils such as the Asian ostrich. The common ostrich is the more widespread of the two living species, and is the largest living bird species. The extinct genus &quot;Pachystruthio&quot; from the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene of Eurasia is one of the largest birds ever.

The first species of &quot;Struthio&quot; appear during the Miocene epoch, though various Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene fossils may also belong to the family. Ostriches are classified in the ratite group of birds, all extant species of which are flightless, including the kiwis, emus, and rheas. Traditionally, the order Struthioniformes contained all the ratites. However, recent genetic analysis has found that the group is not monophyletic, as it is paraphyletic with respect to the tinamous, so the ostriches are usually classified as the only members of the order, though the IUCN uses a broader classification and includes all &quot;ratites&quot; and tinamous in Struthioniformes.

==Evolution==
Struthionidae is a member of the Struthioniformes, a group of paleognath birds which first appeared during the Early Eocene, and includes a variety of flightless forms which were present across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia and North America) during the Eocene epoch. The closest relatives of Struthionidae within the Struthioniformes are the Ergilornithidae, known from the late Eocene to early Pliocene of Asia. It is therefore most likely that Struthionidae originated in Asia. The oldest records of Struthionidae, belonging to the genus &quot;Struthio&quot;, are from the Early Miocene of Africa, around 21 million years old. &quot;Struthio&quot; dispersed into and became widespread in Eurasia during the late middle-Late Miocene epoch beginning around 12 million years ago. &quot;Pachystruthio&quot; from the Late Pliocene of Eurasia contains some of the largest bird species ever with some species likely weighing up to .
While the relationship of the African fossil species is comparatively straightforward, many Asian species of ostriches have been described from fragmentary remains, and their interrelationships and how they relate to the African ostriches are confusing. In China, ostriches are known to have become extinct only around or even after the end of the last ice age; images of ostriches have been found there on prehistoric pottery and petroglyphs.

==Distribution and habitat==

Today ostriches are only found natively in the wild in Africa, where they occur in a range of open arid and semi-arid habitats such as savannas and the Sahel, both north and south of the equatorial forest zone. The Somali ostrich occurs in the Horn of Africa, having evolved isolated from the common ostrich by the geographic barrier of the East African Rift. In some areas, the common ostrich&#x27;s Masai subspecies occurs alongside the Somali ostrich, but they are kept from interbreeding by behavioral and ecological differences. The Arabian ostriches in Asia Minor and Arabia were hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th century, and in Israel attempts to introduce North African ostriches to fill their ecological role have failed. Escaped common ostriches in Australia have established populations.

==Taxonomy==

In 2019, the species &quot;S. pannonicus&quot;, &quot;S. dmanisensis&quot; (the giant ostrich), and &quot;S. transcaucasicus&quot; were transferred to the genus &quot;Pachystruthio&quot;.

<doc id="209658" wikidata="Q268732" url="?curid=209658" title="Arthur Erickson">
<text>Arthur Charles Erickson (June 14, 1924 – May 20, 2009) was a Canadian architect and urban planner. He studied at the University of British Columbia and, in 1950, received his B.Arch. (Honours) from McGill University. He is known as Canada&#x27;s most influential architect and was the only Canadian architect to win the American Institute of Architects AIA Gold Medal (in 1986, for the Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.). When told of Erickson&#x27;s award, Philip Johnson said, &quot;Arthur Erickson is by far the greatest architect in Canada, and he may be the greatest on this continent.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Erickson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 14, 1924. The son of Oscar Erickson and Myrtle Chatterson, he had an early interest, and talent for, painting and horticulture. As had his father, Erickson served in the Canadian Army, enlisting with the Canadian Army Intelligence Corps during World War II and serving in India, British Ceylon, and Malaysia.

Erickson’s original intention was to go into the Diplomatic corps; he changed his mind when he saw the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. He studied at the University of British Columbia, followed by the McGill University School of Architecture. After graduating from McGill in 1950, Erickson was granted a travel scholarship and traveled around the Mediterranean, studying climate and style in their relationship to architecture. He spent ten years teaching at the University of Oregon and the University of British Columbia, during which time he designed some of British Columbia&#x27;s most important houses--&quot;Canadian Homes Magazine&quot; called his 1959 Filberg House &quot;Canada&#x27;s most fabulous house&quot;. Erickson spent a few years at Thompson Berwick and Pratt and Partners then, in 1962, founded Erickson/Massey Architects with Geoffrey Massey. In 1963, Erickson and Massey submitted the winning design for Simon Fraser University.

== Style and method ==
Erickson&#x27;s early buildings were often modernist concrete or wooden structures designed to respond to the natural conditions of their locations, especially climate. Erickson always integrated light and water features into his designs, along with the characteristic horizontal elements and terraces that came from the vernacular architecture of the Far East. Many buildings, such as the Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, were inspired by the post and beam architecture of the Coastal First Nations, Asian temples and the North American log cabin. Erickson is also known for numerous futuristic designs such as the Fresno City Hall, the UCI School of Biological Sciences and the 1967 Catton House, also known as the &#x27;Starship House&#x27;. His work balanced the style of modernism with an integration of the surrounding natural environment. Erickson constantly stressed the importance of greenery and water in all of his designs—as a teacher, he impressed this upon his students by making them draw blades of grass. He insisted on bringing in a landscape architect at the outset of all of his projects and, for most of his projects, worked with the landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander.

== Significant works ==

=== Simon Fraser University (Burnaby, BC) ===

Simon Fraser University is located on top of Burnaby Mountain, at Greater Vancouver&#x27;s eastern edge, 1,214 feet above sea level. The scale of the project is reminiscent of utopian designs from French architects in the late eighteenth century such as Etienne-Louis Bouillee, and provides a balance between the British Columbia context and the structural ambitions of the 1960s period of Modern architecture. The unfinished concrete blends in with the surrounding geography in colour but not in shape. When viewed from above in plan, the campus forms a geometric contrast to the snowy mountains of its context but does not interfere with the site&#x27;s spectacular views and is open to its natural surroundings. While Erickson had 900 acres on which to build, he kept the campus tight and left the rest for meadow and playing fields. The design features a covered plaza with massive skylights which respond to Vancouver’s wet climate. The campus is landscaped to provide numerous small spaces for study; in its centre, Erickson placed a large rectangular pool containing an enormous block of Fraser River jade. Perhaps most significantly, academic disciplines are not isolated in separate buildings; the campus is a quadrangle designed so that people have to cross paths and interact with each other. The design was met with international acclaim, with one critic writing that it &quot;answered questions about the nature of education&quot;.

=== Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC) ===

The Museum of Anthropology was built in 1976, as an inclusion to the campus at the University of British Columbia. It houses artifacts and exhibits from world cultures, with an emphasis on Pacific Northwest cultures and the First Nations of British Columbia. This building blends methods of reinforced concrete and the traditional post-and-beam construction to articulate the structure. Oversized beams evoke a monumental feeling in many of Erickson&#x27;s projects, calling on the size and scale of the trees found in the surrounding context. It is well known for Erickson’s use of concrete piers and large stretches of glass. By using concrete beams to represent de-materialized logs and opening up the main atrium through expanses of glass, Erickson refers to the traditional notion of post-and-beam construction while integrating these characteristics into a modernist building. The structure sits on a promontory facing the ocean and mountains. The landscape of the site was particularly important, as Erickson wanted to depict the connection between indigenous Pacific Northwest cultures to the land. He and Oberlander studied the landscapes of Haida Gwaii, with its totem poles standing on mounds covered with wild grasses and surrounded by forest. A seed expert provided the correct plantings of indigenous grasses and flowers, fallen logs were left in situ, a gravel pond was created to reflect the mountains and sky, and mounds of earth were used to both muffle traffic and create the sense of hills rolling to the ocean. The university describes the museum as: ...&quot;a total work of art, expressing a convergence of the site, building, collection and the performances and ceremonies that take place there.&quot;

=== Robson Square (Vancouver, BC) ===

Built in Vancouver in 1979 as a large civic center, Erickson’s design for Robson Square included waterfalls, a roof garden, several plazas, and stairs with ramps integrated within. This complex is one of the few in North America that integrates everything from public space and landscape to a set of surrounding buildings, spanning from the art gallery to the law courts. Many changes have been made to the square since it was first built, and some complain that certain changes conflict with the intent of the original design. For example, glass barriers have been installed near the waterfall, preventing people from getting close to it, and barriers have also been installed on the edges of planters to stop people from sitting on them. It has also since lost the outdoor restaurants, cinema, and large auditorium that once existed on the site. On the design of the roof garden, Erickson was assisted by his former student, architect Bing Thom; the landscape architect on Robson Square was Cornelia Oberlander.

=== Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto, ON) ===
Designed and built in the city of Toronto, Roy Thomson Hall was not designed to blend into its surroundings in order to be recognized as a landmark and home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Characteristic of Erickson&#x27;s other designs with additions of water and other natural elements, this project includes a water feature of pond and rocks adjacent the building. Due to its placement below-grade, it can go unnoticed to pedestrians walking by. The interior of the building was designed by Erickson&#x27;s life partner Francisco Kipacz, the only Canadian published as &quot;Designer of the Year&quot; by the American Press Institute. The interior used a colour palette of grey and silver to harmonize with the concrete structure and create a peaceful atmosphere. This interior has since been retrofitted by the firm KPMB Architects, adding wood planking as well as purple and plum seating throughout the hall in attempt to make the atmosphere warmer.

=== Canadian Chancery (Washington, DC) ===
The personal selection of Arthur Erickson as the architect for the Canadian Chancery in Washington, DC by then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was controversial, because Trudeau and Erickson were close friends and the Prime Minister overruled the objections and choices of the embassy&#x27;s design committee. Erickson&#x27;s biographer Nicholas Olsberg described the building as &quot;making fun of the ridiculous terms to which buildings must adhere in Washington... mocking the US and all of its imperial pretensions.&quot; In fact, Erickson had to obey his client&#x27;s instructions, which were to express neighbourliness, openness and friendship, while adhering to the restrictions put in place by the 20 committees which regulate what happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. He blended the Neoclassicism of existing structures with the idiom of the Plantation house to create an expanse of space. Oberlander landscaped the courtyard with northern plants; Erickson had Haida artist Bill Reid create the massive sculpture Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe, which sits in the courtyard in a pool of water. While his detractors may have had initial doubts about his ability to create a structure which represented Canada, it is this building which won Erickson the AIA Gold Medal.

=== Museum of Glass (Tacoma, WA) ===
The Museum of Glass was built in the city of Tacoma, Washington, as part of an initiative to revitalize the waterfront which was one of the most polluted industrial areas in Washington in the past. Erickson&#x27;s design for the museum features a 90-foot-tall metal cone erupting from a structure of steel and concrete. The enormous cone acts as a &#x27;chimney&#x27; for the museum&#x27;s amphitheater, where visitors can overlook visiting artists as they create glass art. Large public art displays and concrete plazas overlook the neighbouring waterway, while pools of water interlaced with stairs and switchback ramps to connect each levels. The museum aims to connect the downtown core to the city&#x27;s waterfront as well, through a 150-foot long bridge named the Chihuly Bridge of Glass. The bridge is named after Tacoma native Dale Chihuly, who was a pioneer of the Studio Glass Movement and has many works on display at the museum.

== Reputation, influences and legacy ==
Erickson was the mentor of many other noted local architects and urbanists, including founding members of many of Vancouver&#x27;s premier design-oriented architectural firms. His buildings were also the subject of paintings by artists including Vancouver-based Tiko Kerr.

In 1971, he received the Royal Bank Award. In 1973, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1981. Erickson received the Chicago Architectural Award in 1984 alongside Philip Johnson and Joan Burgee. In 1986, he received the AIA Gold Medal, making him the first ever Canadian architect to receive this award.

Erickson lived in Point Grey with his life partner and interior design collaborator, Francisco Kripacz. He died in Vancouver on May 20, 2009. His legacy still lives on through the Arthur Erickson Foundation. The foundation has been registered in the province of British Columbia since 1993 as a non-profit charitable society. Founded originally as the Arthur Erickson House and Garden Foundation in 1993, the organization was created by Erickson&#x27;s neighbour and fellow landscape architect Elizabeth Watts in order to raise money to buy Erickson&#x27;s Point Grey home after he went bankrupt. The society succeeded and became owner of the Point Grey residence in Vancouver, BC. After his death, the foundation was expanded to offer education, research, and work in preservation with stewardship, education, and tours offered to keep people informed about the legacy of one of Canada&#x27;s first internationally acclaimed architects.

<text>Captain Kong Le (Lao: ກອງແລ; 6 March 1934 – 17 January 2014) was a Laotian military officer and prominent military figure in Laos during the 1960s. 

He led the premier unit of the Royal Lao Army, the 2nd Parachute Battalion, that played a significant role during the first phases of the Laotian Civil War. The idealistic young American-trained officer became known worldwide when, on 10 August 1960, he and his mutinous paratroopers overthrew the Royal Lao Government in a coup d&#x27;état. Le declared that he aimed to end the government corruption; to the shock of American officials, he declared U.S. policies were responsible for the ongoing fraud.

Once ousted by the U.S.-backed 14 December 1960 countercoup by General Phoumi Nosavan, Kong Le and his fellow putschist officers retreated to the strategic Plain of Jars, gathering recruits to form a rebel group that would be known as the Neutral Armed Forces (FAN). However, this rebel group would begin to splinter as its members began to favor either the Communist or Royalist forces in the Laotian Civil War. In April 1963, the Patriotic Neutralists broke off to ally themselves with the communist Pathet Lao, while Kong Le engineered a rapprochement with the Royalists for FAN.

Over the next couple of years, FAN&#x27;s battle performance in support of the Royalists was poor; especially striking was their inability to overcome a Vietnamese communist stronghold overlooking the FAN main base at Muang Soui&#x27;s all-weather airfield. As Kong Le&#x27;s subordinates became increasingly dissatisfied, and FAN units began to mutiny, he was forced to leave Laos on 17 October 1966.

He would remain in exile in Indonesia, Hong Kong, the United States, and France. He died in the latter on 17 January 2014.

==Early life and military career ==

Kong Le was born on 6 March 1934 to ethnic Lao Theung parents and spoke Phu Tai. He stood tall and was a slender but muscular man. His ethnic origin showed in his wide cheekbones and dark skin. He acquired an excellent command of French, as well as knowing functional English.

His father died in 1940, leaving his family destitute and forcing the then six-year-old Le to farm in a rice farm. He received a little formal education at the Savannakhet Lycee before enlisting in the Royal Lao Army in 1951. He showed enough martial promise to be included in the third Officer Candidate School class at Dong Hene. He graduated 19th in his class of 21. He was noted for his changeable temperament and rapid mood swings.

Kong Le&#x27;s first assignment after OCS subordinated him to Captain Ouane Rattikone in Luang Prabang. In 1957, he underwent Scout Ranger training at Fort William McKinley, the Philippines. After returning to Laos, he was trained by Kopassus. Upon his return to Laos in 1958, he joined &quot;2ème bataillon de parachutistes&quot; (Parachute Battalion 2) as its second in command. During his early paratroop service, he befriended two other officers who would become important in Laotian history, Vang Pao and Thao Ma.

== Coups ==

In December 1959, Captain Kong Le was approached by his uncle-in-law, General Ouane Rattikone while the commanding officer of BP 2 was in the United States, leaving Kong Le in charge. On 25 December 1959, the term of the National Assembly expired. General Phoumi Nosavan convinced Kong Le of the necessity to fill the political vacuum. The 25 December coup in Vientiane succeeded without harming anyone. General Phoumi became the Minister of Defense and held actual power over the Royal Lao Government thanks to the captain.

Kong Le&#x27;s unit, &quot;2ème bataillon de parachutistes&quot; (Parachute Battalion 2), was considered the cream of the Royal Lao Army. As such, they were constantly deployed for a year, went unpaid for months at a time, and lacked time to even build themselves barracks for shelter. The paratroopers became mutinous. On 10 August 1960, Kong Le led the paras in a coup that saw only six killed. The same vital points were seized as in the 1959 coup, with the addition of the arrest of General Sounthone Pathammavong, the Chief of Staff, as Kong Le seized power for the second time.

Kong Le&#x27;s aims in seizing the capital became apparent in his radio broadcasts:

What leads us to carry out this revolution is our desire to stop the bloody civil war; eliminate grasping public servants and military commanders ... whose property amounts to much more than their monthly salaries can afford. ... It is the Americans who have brought government officials and army commanders, and caused war and dissension in our country.

Phoumi Nosavan did not acquiesce. On 10 August, he flew to Bangkok. He solicited support from his first cousin, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, the dictator of the Kingdom of Thailand. Phoumi flew to Savannakhet to establish a headquarters and pull together a resistance movement in Savannakhet.

On 11 August, the Pathet Lao pledged their cooperation with Kong Le. The next four months of turmoil saw Kong Le struggle to maintain control over the Kingdom of Laos in the face of a burgeoning resistance. Kong Le convinced Souvanna Phouma to become Prime Minister in the new government; in turn, Souvanna appointed General Ouane commander in chief of the RLA. Lao commanding officers such as Generals Amkha Soukhavong, Kouprasith Abhay, Oudone Sananikone, and Sing Rattanasamy backed Kong Le with various levels of enthusiasm.

In early October, Vang Pao declared that Military Region 2&#x27;s forces backed Phoumi. After the internecine struggle, Military Region 1 also remained in Phoumi&#x27;s control. On 16 November, General Ouane flew to Savannakhet to join Phoumi. With Central Intelligence Agency financial backing, and aided by CIA-trained commandos, Phoumi&#x27;s troops set forth at 0800 hours on 21 November 1960 to reclaim Vientiane.

== The Battle of Vientiane ==
On 13 December 1960, Phoumi&#x27;s counter-coup column began his assault on Kong Le&#x27;s paratroopers occupying Vientiane. For four days, the two sides shot at each other with crew-served weapons without closing for near-range combat. Although the two sides caused little harm to one another, about 600 homes burned, an estimated 600 civilians were killed, and downtown Vientiane was destroyed. On 16 December, Kong Le&#x27;s forces withdrew northward toward the strategic Plain of Jars, leaving Phoumi once again in charge of Laos.

By 4 January 1961, Kong Le&#x27;s forces—by now dubbed &quot;Forces Armées Neutralistes&quot; (Neutralist Armed Forces)—held the Plain of Jars from Muang Soui eastward along Route 7 (Laos) to the Vietnamese border. The Soviet supply airlift that had begun just before the fighting began in Vientiane continued to supply FAN. The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam supplied advisers to FAN; they also supplied advisers to beef up the Pathet Lao units supporting FAN. In the meantime, Phoumi&#x27;s American backers struggled to find a covert source of airpower to oppose Kong Le, as the RLA ground forces proved incapable of dealing with FAN. Eventually, the Americans settled on supplying the Royal Lao Air Force with its first strike aircraft, four T-6 Texans, as well as forming the abortive Operation Millpond.

On 12 April 1962, Kong Le reached a rapprochement with Vang Pao; the guerrilla leader agreed to loan Kong Le security forces for guard duty. On 1 May 1962, the Pathet Lao proposed a truce. Fighting halted two days later. On 6 May, the International Control Commission originally established under the 1954 Geneva Agreements was revived to oversee peace efforts.

==Renewed conflict==

By the time the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos agreed upon on 23 July 1962 came into effect, FAN had ramped up to a strength of 8,000 troops. Three battalions under Brigadier General Khoumane Boupha were occupying far northern Phongsali Province. There were two new infantry battalions outposted in Vang Vieng on Route 13, threatening Vientiane from the north. Three battalions moved southward into the panhandle to occupy Tchepone, Nhommarath, and Mahaxay. FAN&#x27;s center of gravity on the Plain of Jars was four paratroop battalions and two artillery battalions. The new artillery battalions were not the only heavy weapons units added to FAN. An armored company of amphibious tanks formed from the 45 PT-76s passed on to FAN by the PAVN. There was also a small air arm, consisting of two C-47s and two Beavers flown north from Vientiane during the retreat to the Plain; in December 1962, they would be augmented by three Li-2s from the Soviet Union. To command all this, Kong Le promoted himself to Major General.

Meanwhile, Kong Le mended fences with the Royalists he had been opposing. In turn, on 6 April 1963, the Pathet Lao launched several simultaneous surprise attacks on Kong Le&#x27;s forces on the Plain of Jars. Although FAN was driven from its positions, it evacuated most of its tanks and heavy weaponry to Muong Phanh. On 10 April 1963, President John F. Kennedy approved U.S. military aid supply drops to bolster FAN. On 12 April. Kong Le met with Vang Pao at Sam Thong. They agreed on cooperation between their forces; a contingent of Vang Pao&#x27;s troops would don Neutralist uniforms and guard FAN headquarters, freeing Neutralists for combat duty. Hmong Royalist military irregulars also cratered Route 7, thus closing the main communist supply line. Then too, Hmong units would ambush Route 4 traffic behind communist lines, as well as harassing various of their units with hit-and-run raids. However, Kong Le&#x27;s forces would suffer 85 killed, while the communists lost 71 dead.

However, this strength would soon be vitiated in April 1963, as a schism split the newly named &quot;Forces Armées Neutralistes&quot; (Neutral Armed Forces). As neutralists began to favor either communists or royalists, there were several political assassinations among officers favoring either persuasion. Colonel Deuane Sunnalath and Brigadier General Khamouane Boupha tolled away four neutralist infantry battalions, as well as an artillery battalion, to form the Patriotic Neutralists. The Patriotic Neutralists allied themselves with the Pathet Lao. In the southern panhandle, the majority of &quot;4ème bataillon d&#x27;infanterie&quot; (Infantry Battalion 4) defected to the new movement. As the breakaway Patriotic Neutralists had allied themselves with the communists, Route 9 from Khe Sanh, Vietnam to Xepon, Laos was now open for North Vietnamese invaders.

May 1963 saw Kong Le in a quandary. The answer to dissent in his ranks could be a renewed offensive; to remain quiescent would risk dissolution of FAN. However, a new assault on the communists might evoke an overwhelming counterattack by PAVN. As it turned out, his newly acquired American advisor counseled against aggression, and a planned FAN attack never came off. Meanwhile, Hmong forces continued to interdict communist supply lines as a means of relieving communist pressure on FAN.

Nor were heavy casualties and the Patriotic Neutralist desertion the only diminutions of Kong Le&#x27;s forces. FAN&#x27;s dismal performance in the Battle of Lak Sao ended in January 1964 with whipped FAN units giving up their presence in Military Region 3 when they were withdrawn to the Plain of Jars. Further defeats in early 1964, followed by the April coup in Vientiane sparked further discontent within FAN&#x27;s ranks; there were further defections to the pro-communist Patriotic Neutralists. By the time Operation Triangle came around, FAN had to be reinforced by Thai mercenary artillerymen. The fighting in Operation Triangle ended in late July 1964 with FAN&#x27;s failure to conquer the Vietnamese stronghold overlooking the FAN base at Muang Soui. In December 1964, another FAN offensive on the communist-held high ground planned to take advantage of the morale boost elicited by Kong Le&#x27;s leadership. During this attack, communist tanks killed 12 FAN troopers and wounded 68. By the 10th, the repelled Neutralists were back at their starting point of Muang Soui. Kong Le, who had sat out the assault by serving as a Buddhist monk, fired the attack&#x27;s commander for embezzling 1.5 million Lao kips.

By February 1965, Kong Le was locked in conflict with his battalion commanders over the unsuccessful operations against Phou Khout and squabbles about promotions and money. Nearby FAN &quot;5ème bataillon d&#x27;infanterie&quot; (Infantry Battalion 5) at Moung Hiem, commanded by Souvanna Phouma&#x27;s nephew, co-existed pacifically with nearby PAVN units. However, on 11 March 1965, the Vietnamese unexpectedly overran the battalion and executed its three senior officers.

==The search abroad==

In April 1965, Kong Le flew to Jakarta, Indonesia seeking additional military aid for his army. As a result, on 21 August 1965, an Indonesian C-130 landed at Wattay International Airport with seven tons of uniforms and other military equipment for FAN. It departed, carrying 68 of FAN&#x27;s lower-ranking officers for extended training in Indonesia. A second flight followed suit two days later. This arrangement perturbed the Americans, who were suspicious of the Indonesian government&#x27;s left-leaning politics. Their supply efforts to date had maintained FAN at a static level. They now upgraded FAN weaponry and improved the runway at Muang Soui. In October, Kong Le toured the United States for a month, receiving military honors at Fort Myer, Virginia. Upon returning to Laos, FAN made another unsuccessful assault on the communist ridgeline strongpoint overlooking Muang Soui. Kong Le sat out the action while serving as a Buddhist monk.

In January 1966, &quot;14ème bataillon d&#x27;infanterie&quot; (Infantry Battalion 14) mutinied in protest against Kong Le&#x27;s lack of leadership. Kong Le&#x27;s reply was another attack on &quot;Phou Khout&quot; on 20 February. Lacking air support, it failed. Ongoing attacks throughout March, although supported by air raids using napalm, did no better. &quot;8ème bataillon d&#x27;infanterie&quot; (Infantry Battalion 8) then mutinied on 30 March 1966, walking off the battlefield. &quot;2ème bataillon spécial de commandos&quot; (Special Commando Battalion 2) nearly joined them. On 1 April, during a Royalist General Staff meeting, Kong Le gave a lengthy lecture on the necessity of requesting mercenary troops from Indonesia. In turn, he was told by Souvanna Phouma that his FAN battalions would be sequentially withdrawn for retraining in Lop Buri, Thailand, before being placed under the command of Royalist Military Region commanders. In August 1966, BI 8&#x27;s new commanding officer launched them in another unsuccessful assault against his foe&#x27;s overwatch positions. By now, Kong Le had lost the support of most of his subordinate officers. His interest in a French intelligence officer&#x27;s daughters did not help matters. Three of his subordinates divided up command of FAN and forced him into exile. Kong Le sought asylum in the Indonesian embassy in Vientiane. On 17 October 1966, he left Laos.

In March 1967, Kong Le left Indonesia to Hong Kong. In June, he left there for France. Once in France, he began plotting a return to Laos.

In the mid-1980s, Kong Le spent two years in Meng La, China in a futile attempt to spark an invasion of his native country.

In the late 1980s and part of the 1990s, Kong Le lived in the United States. He then lived in exile in Paris until he died in January 2014.

<text>Charles Gald Sibley (August 7, 1917 – April 12, 1998) was an American ornithologist and molecular biologist. He had an immense influence on the scientific classification of birds, and the work that Sibley initiated has substantially altered our understanding of the evolutionary history of modern birds.

Sibley&#x27;s taxonomy has been a major influence on the sequences adopted by ornithological organizations, especially the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

Charles Sibley is of no known family relation to renowned bird artist and prolific author of numerous bird identification guides David Sibley.

== Life and work ==
Educated in California (A.B. 1940; Ph.D. 1948 in Zoology, University of California, Berkeley.
Minor fields: Paleontology, Botany), he did his first fieldwork in Mexico in 1939 and 1941, then in Solomon Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, and the Philippines during World War II while on leave from the U.S. Navy, in which he was Ensign to Lieutenant in the Communications and Medical Service Corps. He was based for much of the war at Emirau Island, in what is now New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. His first job after college was from 1948 to 1949 as instructor in Zoology and Curator of Birds, University of Kansas, followed from 1949 to 1953 as assistant professor of zoology, San Jose State College, California. From 1953 to 1965 he was associate professor then Professor of Zoology and director of the ornithological laboratory at Cornell. Between 1965 and 1986 he was Professor of Biology and William Robertson Coe Prof. of Ornithology, Dept of Biology; and Curator of Birds at the Peabody Museum at Yale. From 1986 to 1992 he was Dean&#x27;s Professor of Science and Professor of Biology at San Francisco State University, and from 1993 until his death he was adjunct professor of biology at Sonoma State University.

Sibley developed an interest in hybridisation and its implications for evolution and taxonomy and, in the early 1960s he began to focus on molecular studies: of blood proteins, and then the electrophoresis of egg-white proteins.

By the early 1970s Sibley was pioneering DNA-DNA hybridisation studies, with the aim of discovering, once and for all, the true relationships between the modern orders of birds. These were highly controversial to begin with, and regarded by colleagues as anything from snake-oil salesmanship on the one hand to Holy Writ on the other. With the passage of time and ever-improving laboratory methods, the balance of scientific opinion has shifted closer to the latter interpretation, though the picture is by no means clear-cut and simple. Some of Sibley&#x27;s results – such as the close relationship of galliform birds and waterfowl and their distinctness from other neognaths – have been verified. Other results such as the inclusion of diverse groups into the Ciconiiformes have turned out to be very much in error.

Sibley became estranged from his American co-workers for a time and corresponded with overseas colleagues extensively. But by the mid to late 1980s, Sibley&#x27;s ongoing work had reversed the trend. His revised phylogeny of living birds in the light of DNA analysis, published in various forms in 1986–1993 was both controversial and highly influential.

In 1986 he was elected a Member, National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. In 1988 Sibley and Jon Ahlquist were awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected President of the International Ornithological Congress in 1990. His landmark publications, &quot;Phylogeny and Classification of Birds&quot; (written with Ahlquist) and &quot;Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World&quot; (with Burt Monroe) are among the most-cited of all ornithological works, the former setting out the influential Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy.

== Personality ==
During the 1970s, Sibley was a highly controversial figure in ornithological circles, for both professional and personal reasons. His friend Richard Schodde, writing Sibley&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Emu&quot;, commented that he was:

Partly due to personality conflicts, Sibley had few long-term collaborations with other scientists, with the notable exception of Jon Ahlquist. Nonetheless, he was effective in persuading others to provide him with the blood, tissue, and egg white samples which were the key to his work.

== Other ornithological Sibleys ==

Charles Gald Sibley is of no known family relation to renowned bird artist and bird guide author David Sibley, although the families knew each other: one of Charles&#x27; daughters babysat David, and David&#x27;s father Fred worked for Charles at Yale.

There is some family resemblance, and Charles did a fair amount of genealogical research but could only establish that any relationship was no closer than fourth cousin.

<doc id="209669" wikidata="Q1064319" url="?curid=209669" title="Goldfinger (band)">
<text>Goldfinger is an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1994. In their early years, the band was considered a contributor to the movement of third-wave ska, a mid-1990s revitalization in the popularity of ska, evidenced in their first three albums: &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1996), &quot;Hang-Ups&quot; (1997) and &quot;Stomping Ground&quot; (2000). However, the releases of &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; (2002) and &quot;Disconnection Notice&quot; (2005) saw the band shed most of the ska influence, and they have been more commonly placed in the punk rock genre in later years. They have since released three more albums: &quot;Hello Destiny...&quot; (2008), &quot;The Knife&quot; (2017) and &quot;Never Look Back&quot; (2020). The band is also noted for their support for animal rights.

Frontman John Feldmann has been the sole constant member of the group. Other longtime members have included Charlie Paulson (guitar), Simon Williams (bass), Kelly LeMieux (bass) and Darrin Pfeiffer (drums). As of 2019, the band consists of Feldmann, Paulsen, Philip Sneed (guitar), Mike Herrera (bass), and Nick Gross (drums).

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and &quot;Hang-Ups&quot; (1994–1998)===
Goldfinger was formed by former Electric Love Hogs member John Feldmann on vocals and guitar, Simon Williams on bass, former drummer of Zero Tolerance Darrin Pfeiffer on drums, and Charlie Paulson on guitar. At the time the band was formed, Feldmann and Williams were working at the same shoe store where they were discovered by A&amp;R Executive Patrick McDowell. Before they were signed to a major label, they released an EP titled &quot;Richter&quot; on the independent label Mojo Records, which received favorable reviews and a substantial amount of airplay on college radio, leading to Goldfinger and Mojo signing a major-label contract with Universal Records.

Many of the songs on &quot;Richter&quot; are demo versions of songs on the band&#x27;s full-length debut, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, which was produced by Jay Rifkin and released by Mojo Records on February 29, 1996. The song &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot; from the album was especially popular and helped the band gain a solid fanbase. In 2006, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; listed the self-titled Goldfinger album as one of the &quot;10 Albums That Shaped 1996&quot; alongside No Doubt, Weezer and others. The band released its second album, &quot;Hang-Ups&quot;, on September 9, 1997. Founding bassist Simon Williams left the band following &quot;Hang-Ups.&quot; During this time, Goldfinger released a popular cover of the song &quot;More Today Than Yesterday&quot; by Spiral Starecase, which also helped the band stay out of obscurity.

On November 9, 1999, Goldfinger released &quot;Darrin&#x27;s Coconut Ass: Live from Omaha&quot;, a collection of 8 cover songs from the band. Goldfinger&#x27;s third studio LP was &quot;Stomping Ground&quot;, which was released on March 28, 2000. The album sold poorly in the US but was a modest hit in some European countries, thanks to their cover of Nena&#x27;s &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; sung partly in German. In 2000, during their tour of England, Goldfinger recorded one of their sets, issuing the live &quot;Foot in Mouth&quot;, available only at shows and through the band&#x27;s official website. In 2001, Goldfinger announced that Charlie Paulson was leaving the band and was being replaced by former Ünloco member, Brian Arthur. Their next album, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; (2002), was the first for their new record label, Jive/Zomba. On this album, the band abandoned much of its ska influences in favor of a more heavy sound. Furthermore, some of the lyrics discussed animal rights, a subject which had not been touched upon in earlier albums. The band recorded a music video for the title track of the album, which was also focused on animal rights.

===&quot;Disconnection Notice&quot; and return of Charlie Paulson (2004–2006)===

In early 2005, they released its first album for their new label, Maverick Records, titled &quot;Disconnection Notice&quot;, which was written, produced and recorded all throughout 2004. The song &quot;Wasted&quot; from the album was released as a single. The CD was less well received compared to former Goldfinger albums. In 2005, Brian departed from the band after the release of the album. Shortly after Brian&#x27;s departure, Goldfinger announced that their original guitarist Charlie Paulson would return. Charlie returned to the stage playing three songs at the Key Club in LA when the band finished a Western USA tour.

===&quot;Hello Destiny...&quot; (2007–2010)===
Goldfinger signed to the independent record label SideOneDummy in 2007. On April 22, 2008, the band released their sixth full-length record called &quot;Hello Destiny...&quot;. To promote the album, the band embarked on a successful North American tour with Less Than Jake in summer of 2008. They also played in the UK at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on August 22–23, 2008.

Recently, frontman John Feldmann has produced records for Mest, The Used (whose vocalist Bert McCracken sang some guest vocals on &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Woodchuck&quot;, &quot;Ocean Size&quot;, and &quot;Handjobs for Jesus&quot;), Hilary Duff and Story of the Year. He also produced Good Charlotte&#x27;s single &quot;The Anthem&quot; (whose guitarist Benji Madden provides guest vocals on &quot;January&quot;, which was originally named &quot;Oracle of Elcaro&quot;). He also signed the band Ünloco with Maverick Records.

In November 2010, Goldfinger played a handful of shows on a small, west coast tour with Reel Big Fish. These are the first shows performed without Darrin Pfeiffer on drums. Drumming duties were handled by Branden Steineckert of Rancid. Also, on the Los Angeles show at the House of Blues, original bassist, Simon Williams came out to perform several songs off their first album. This was the first time Williams had performed with the band in over a decade. He played the Las Vegas show as well.

===&quot;The Knife&quot; (2010–2020)===
In the November/December 2010 issue No. 43 of &quot;SMASH&quot; magazine, Feldmann stated that a new EP or a possible full-length album was &quot;in the works&quot; with Feldmann having penned 4/5 new tracks, and Pfeiffer having recorded the drum tracks. Feldmann also states in the article that with the release of any new material would be supported with an extended tour. According to Feldmann, Goldfinger was expecting to have their new album out sometime in 2012. The band released a new song, &quot;Am I Deaf&quot;, on Friday May 24, 2013.

In 2015, Feldmann did an interview with Fuse, noting that the band&#x27;s future largely amounts to the occasional tour: &quot;We&#x27;ll probably release a song or two but I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re going to release albums anymore. We play the same songs we&#x27;ve always done.&quot;

On July 21, 2017, the group released &quot;The Knife&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album featuring Mike Herrera, Travis Barker, and Philip Sneed (aka Moon Valjean) of Story Of The Year and Greek Fire (band) fame. Darrin, Kelly, and Charlie left the band prior to its release. Darrin Pfeiffer left the band due to personality conflicts with Feldmann. Darrin spoke about some of the conflicts with Feldmann on an episode of Mike Herrera&#x27;s podcast. Kelly Lemieux currently tours with Buckcherry, along with other bands and has cited that for his reasoning behind not being an active participant with Goldfinger. Charlie Paulson did rejoin the band on stage for the 2019 Back to the Beach festival and Vans Warped Tour 25th Anniversary. Paulson has since rejoined the band as he has played with them in all their recent shows as well as joining them on their &quot;Fueling The fire&quot; tour with Less Than Jake in September 2019. The band&#x27;s live lineup generally consists of Feldmann, Paulson, Herrerra and Sneed, with Barker occasionally playing live shows and other friends of Feldmann playing drums. Other musicians fill-in on guitar and bass when Paulson, Sneed, and Herrerra are not present at shows as well. Their live shows often feature horn players from numerous other ska bands, including Ruben Durazo, Matt Appleton, Billy Kottage, and numerous others.

During the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, Goldfinger began producing and releasing a series of live performances to YouTube, designated &quot;Quarantine Videos&quot;. Individual members recorded their performances in their own homes, to be subsequently mixed and mastered by Feldman. The first performance was a rendition of &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot;. To date, the band have released eight &quot;Quarantine Videos&quot; for songs including their cover of Nena&#x27;s &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; and original song, &quot;Superman&quot;. Notably, seven of the eight video performances featured musician and entrepreneur, Nick Gross, on drums.

===&quot;Never Look Back&quot; (2020–present)===
December 4, 2020, marked the release of &quot;Never Look Back&quot; with members John Feldmann, Charlie Paulson, Mike Herrera, Philip Sneed, and Nick Gross. It is the first album since 2008&#x27;s &quot;Hello Destiny&quot; to feature Paulson, the group&#x27;s original guitarist.

On December 10, 2020, the band held an online-only release party in support of the album where they live streamed an entire set. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, an in-person event was not feasible. The band started playing shows again in late 2022 and early 2023, with The Planet Smashers, Mustard Plug, and Catch 22.

On July 29, 2022, the band announced the deluxe version of &quot;Never Look Back&quot;, which features three rerecorded tracks (that of Here in Your Bedroom with Avril Lavigne, Superman with Biffy Clyro, and 99 Red Balloons) and four new bonus tracks. It was released on August 5.

==Animal rights==
Since the band began, Feldmann became a vegan and animal rights supporter, as can be seen briefly in the music video for &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. They also donated the song &quot;What Gives You The Right&quot; to the Southern Animal Rights Coalition benefit CD, &quot;Until Every Cage Is Empty&quot;, as well as writing the song &quot;Free Kevin Kjonaas&quot;, an animal rights activist in prison, known as the most involved individual in the SHAC 7. One of the songs, &quot;FTN&quot;, harshly criticizes Ted Nugent and Jennifer Lopez for their hunting tactics and fur fashion, respectively. He also advocates and supports the Animal Liberation Front. For the song &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; from the album &quot;Disconnection Notice&quot;, Feldmann convinced PETA president and co-founder Ingrid Newkirk to allow him to sample one of her speeches on animal cruelty.

==In film and video games==
Goldfinger songs have made several appearances in motion pictures. Their cover of &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; is featured in the movies &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, &quot;Eurotrip&quot;, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, &quot;Rocket Power: Race Across New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;. Their cover of &quot;More Today Than Yesterday&quot; by Spiral Starecase is featured during the ending credits of &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. &quot;Superman&quot; is featured in the Disney film &quot;Meet the Deedles&quot; and the comedy &quot;Kingpin&quot;. &quot;Walking in the Dark&quot; is featured in the movie &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;. &quot;Hopeless&quot; appears on the soundtrack of &quot;BASEketball.&quot;

The band&#x27;s video game debut was in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; with the song &quot;Superman&quot; and was reused as part of the soundtracks in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater HD&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;. Another song, &quot;Spokesman&quot;, was used in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; was featured in the game &quot;MTV Sports: Skateboarding Ft Andy Macdonald&quot;. &quot;99 Red Balloons&quot; is also featured in &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec,&quot; as well as in Paramount Picture&#x27;s Sonic The Hedgehog 3, during the post title card sequence of Sonic, Tails and Knuckles having a race. Goldfinger&#x27;s song &quot;I Want&quot; from &quot;Disconnection Notice&quot; is featured in &quot;Burnout Revenge&quot; on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360, and is also featured in &quot;Burnout Legends&quot; on the PlayStation Portable.&quot;My Everything&quot; is featured on &quot;SSX On Tour&quot; also by Electronic Arts. Goldfinger also appeared in the Reel Big Fish video &quot;Sell Out&quot; for a couple of seconds. The song &quot;Counting the Days&quot; is featured on &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot;. The song &quot;Superman&quot; was released as downloadable content in the music videogame Rock Band 4.

<text>Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik (; born 6 December 1936) is a statistician, researcher, and academic. He is one of the main developers of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory of statistical learning and the co-inventor of the support-vector machine method and support-vector clustering algorithms.

==Early life and education==
Vladimir Vapnik was born to a Jewish family in the Soviet Union. He received his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the Uzbek State University, Samarkand, Uzbek SSR in 1958 and Ph.D in statistics at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow in 1964. He worked at this institute from 1961 to 1990 and became Head of the Computer Science Research Department.

==Academic career==
At the end of 1990, Vladimir Vapnik moved to the USA and joined the Adaptive Systems Research Department at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey. While at AT&amp;T, Vapnik and his colleagues did work on the support-vector machine (SVM), which he also worked on much earlier before moving to the USA. They demonstrated its performance on a number of problems of interest to the machine learning community, including handwriting recognition. The group later became the Image Processing Research Department of AT&amp;T Laboratories when AT&amp;T spun off Lucent Technologies in 1996. In 2001, Asa Ben-Hur, David Horn (Israeli physicist), Hava Siegelmann and Vapnik developed Support-Vector Clustering, which enabled the algorithm to categorize inputs without labels—becoming one of the most ubiquitous data clustering applications in use. Vapnik left AT&amp;T in 2002 and joined NEC Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked in the Machine Learning group. He also holds a Professor of Computer Science and Statistics position at Royal Holloway, University of London since 1995, as well as a position as Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, New York City since 2003. As of February 1, 2021, he has an h-index of 86 and, overall, his publications have been cited 226597 times. His book on &quot;The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory&quot; alone has been cited 91650 times.

On November 25, 2014, Vapnik joined Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (now Meta AI), where he is working alongside his longtime collaborators Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Ronan Collobert, and Yann LeCun.
In 2016, he also joined Peraton Labs.

==Honors and awards==
Vladimir Vapnik was inducted into the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2006. He received the 2005 Gabor Award from the International Neural Network Society, the 2008 Paris Kanellakis Award, the 2010 Neural Networks Pioneer Award, the 2012 IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award, the 2012 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science from the Franklin Institute, the 2013 C&amp;C Prize from the NEC C&amp;C Foundation, the 2014 Kampé de Fériet Award, the 2017
IEEE John von Neumann Medal. In 2018, he received the Kolmogorov Medal from University of London and delivered the Kolmogorov Lecture. In 2019, Vladimir Vapnik received
BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award.

<text>Major general Ouane Rattikone (Ouan Rathikoun), a Laotian senior military officer, was the commander-in-chief of the Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: &quot;Forces Armées du Royaume&quot; – FAR), the official military of the Royal Lao Government and the Kingdom of Laos, during the 1960s. He was born in 1912 in Luang Prabang.

An ally of the United States during the Vietnam War, Ouane developed a close relationship with William H. Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Laos, and Ted Shackley, the CIA station chief in Vientiane. Despite the intense conflicts amongst the FAR regional commanders, Ouane was pivotal in providing local military support against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Pathet Lao in the northern regions of Laos.

Ouane was also heavily involved in the opium trade throughout Southeast Asia. Despite widespread conspiracy theories of CIA complicity in drug trafficking, an investigation by the U.S. Senate found no evidence of CIA involvement. In his memoirs, Shackley unapologetically stated that the CIA essentially turned a blind eye to the drug trafficking because their resources were already being sapped by the war in neighboring Vietnam. He is believed to have died in October 1978.

<text>Dame Harriette Chick DBE (6 January 1875 – 9 July 1977) was a British microbiologist, protein scientist and nutritionist. She is best remembered for demonstrating the roles of sunlight and cod liver oil in preventing rickets.

== Biography ==
===Early life and education===
She was born in London, England as the fifth child of seven daughters and four sons of Samuel Chick and Emma Hooley, a Methodist family. Her father owned property and sold lace. The Chick children were brought up strictly with no frivolities and regular attendance at family prayers. All seven girls attended Notting Hill High School, a girls&#x27; school thought to be outstanding for its teaching in the sciences. Subsequently, six of the sisters including Harriette continued to study for university degrees. Another of them, Frances Wood, became a notable statistician. Harriette was enrolled at Bedford College, and then as a science student at University College London in 1894 and then proceeded to obtain her doctorate in bacteriology at the same university.

=== Death ===
She died in Cambridge, England in 1977, aged 102.

== Work ==

===Early research on sewage disposal and mechanisms of disinfection===
During the years 1898–1901 an award from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 enabled her to undertake research with Prof Max von Gruber in the Institute for Hygiene in Vienna and with Prof Rubert Boyce in University College, Liverpool. In 1902 she was appointed as assistant to Dr AC Houston, Chief Bacteriologist to the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal. In 1903 she returned to work with Gruber after his move to Munich in 1902. In 1904 she was awarded a DSc from London University for her work on green algae in polluted waters. In 1905 at the suggestion of Charles Scott Sherrington she applied for the Jenner Memorial Research Studentship at the Lister Institute. Her application raised a number of objections as no woman had been bestowed the fellowship previously. Her relationship with the Lister was long. Employed until 1945 with the institute, she was an honorary staff member thereafter for 25 years.
Chick and Lister Institute director Charles James Martin discovered that the process of protein denaturation was distinct from protein coagulation (or flocculation), beginning the modern understanding of protein folding. She is known for having formulated &quot;Chick&#x27;s Law&quot; in 1908, giving the relationship between the kill efficiency of organisms and contact time with a disinfectant. Chick&#x27;s Law was later modified by H. E. Watson in 1908 to include the coefficient of specific lethality. The Chick-Watson Equation is still used. A new and, at the time, more realistic test for the effectiveness of disinfectants, the Chick-Martin test, was also devised and named for the two collaborators (see Phenol coefficient).

===Experience as early woman scientist===
In 1909 Chick was a cosignatory to a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper from a group of women graduates of the University of London calling for them to be allowed to vote for the Member of Parliament returned by their university. In 1913 she was one of the first three women to be admitted to the Biochemical Society following its renaming and change of policy on the admission of women.

===Work at the Lister Institute during and immediately after the First World War: transition to nutritional studies===
In 1915, she briefly went to the Lister Institute in Elstree to test and bottle tetanus antitoxin for the army and to develop the first disinfectants aimed at specific microorganisms. She returned to the Chelsea building, however, to prepare agglutinating sera for diagnosis of typhoid and related diseases in troops. Subsequently, however, she commenced studies on rectifying nutritional deficiencies in the wartime diets of both the native population and overseas forces. Initially this involved surveys of the ability of various foodstuffs to counter scurvy and beriberi. In 1919, together with Dr. Elsie Dalyell, she led a team, including Margaret Hume and Hannah Henderson Smith, from the Lister Institute and the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) to study the relation of nutrition to childhood bone disease in post-war Vienna. They discovered the nutritional factor causing rickets, and proved that fat-soluble vitamins present in cod liver oil, or exposure to ultra violet light, could cure and prevent rickets in children.

Chick was appointed Head of a new nutrition section at the Lister Institute and continued with her research on rickets and, additionally, pellagra. The department was relocated to the Cambridge house of the Lister director CJ Martin during the Second World War.

==Honours and distinctions==
She served as secretary of the League of Nations health section committee on the physiological bases of nutrition from 1934 to 1937. In 1941 she was a founding member of the Nutrition Society, of which she served as president from 1956 to 1959. She was appointed CBE in 1932 and subsequently Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1949. In 1960 she received an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine.
In 1918 she was elected to the Physiological Society. She served as Secretary of the Accessory Food Factors Committee of the Medical Research Council from 1918–1945.

<text>Khamphoui (; 12 July 1912 – 1982?) was the Queen of Laos by marriage to Sisavang Vatthana, the second (and last) King of Laos. She was arrested with the rest of her family and reportedly died in a re-education camp in 1982.

==Early life==

She was born in Luang Prabang, then capital city of the Kingdom of Luang Prabang (now part of Laos) in French Indochina, on 12 July 1912. 

On 7 August 1930, she married Sisavang Vatthana and they had five children: Crown Prince Vong Savang, Prince Savang, Prince Sauryavong Savang, Princess Savivanh Savang, and Princess Thala Savang. She had a happy marriage with King Sisavang Vatthana, who abolished polygamy.

==Queen of Laos==

She became Queen Consort of Laos in late October 1959. As queen, she and her husband attended public events and ceremonies. In 1963, she accompanied the king on an official state visit to the United States, where they were hosted by US President, John Kennedy.

Her husband was forced to abdicate the throne on 2 December 1975. After the coup, the former royal couple lived in house arrest in the former royal palace.
She was arrested in 1977 along with the former King and her family, and sent to a Communist &#x27;re-education camp&#x27;. After their arrest, the former Royal Palace was made in to a museum.

She reportedly died in 1982 in a Communist &#x27;re-education camp&#x27; in northern Laos along with her husband and their son Crown Prince Vong Savang, probably around Sop Hao.

<doc id="209697" wikidata="Q6434680" url="?curid=209697" title="Kouprasith Abhay">
<text>Major General Kouprasith Abhay (; nicknamed &#x27;Fat K&#x27;; 1926–1999?) was a prominent military leader of the Kingdom of Laos during the Laotian Civil War. Scion of a socially prominent family, his military career was considerably aided by their influence. In early 1960, he was appointed to command of Military Region 5, which included Laos&#x27; capital city, Vientiane. Removed from that command on 14 December for duplicitous participation in the Battle of Vientiane, he was reappointed in October 1962. He would hold the post until 1 July 1971, thus controlling the troops in and around the capital. Over the years, he would be involved in one way or another in the coups of 1960, 1964, 1965, 1966, and 1973. His service was marked by a deadly feud with another Laotian general, Thao Ma; the feud was largely responsible for the latter two coup attempts against the government.

After the Royal Lao Government fell to the communists in 1975, Kouprasith retired to exile in France.

==Rise to power==

Kouprasith Abhay was the son of Kou Abhay. The Abhays were an aristocratic family of Chinese-Lao heritage from Khong Island, which is sited on the Mekong River near the Cambodian border in extreme southern Laos. Siho Lamphouthacoul, who was younger than Kouprasith, was raised as a protégé of the Abhay household. For unknown reasons, Siho resented this. Kouprasith Abhay was also related to the influential Sananikone family, since his own mother came from that family. Kouprasith would also marry into the Sananikone family.

Kouprasith followed Colonel Phoumi Nosavan and his aide de camp Lieutenant colonel Siho Lamphouthacoul to France, where they attended staff courses at the School of Advanced Military Studies (French: &quot;Centre des hautes études militaires&quot;) in Paris, followed by a posting as the Royal Lao Government&#x27;s first military attaché to France. While in that post, Kouprasith procured two Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopters for Laos. He returned to Laos early in 1960 to take command of the Royal Lao Army (RLA) troops in Military Region 5, headquartered in Vientiane.

==In command==
When Captain Kong Le seized power in his August 1960 coup, Kouprasith made a weak offer of support to the new satrap. He retained the command in Military Region 5, which included Vientiane. However, his sympathies actually lay with the deposed General, Phoumi Nosavan. When Phoumi&#x27;s counter-coup attacked Vientiane, Kouprasith sided with him. At one point during the counter-coup, Kouprasith made his own bid for power. Though he actually held the city for a short while, and announced a regime change, he named neither Phoumi nor himself as the new head of the nation. However, a distrustful Phoumi removed Kouprasith from command of MR 5 on 14 December 1960, and subordinated him to a Phoumi loyalist. Kouprasith&#x27;s cause was not aided when he took to his sick bed upon relief from the command.

During the ensuing standoff between Kouprasith and Phoumi, Kong Le and his Neutralist Armed Forces (French: &quot;Forces Armées Neutralistes&quot; – FAN) escaped to the Plain of Jars on 16 December to establish an independent neutralist faction within the Laotian Civil War. A makeshift regiment, Mobile Group Vientiane (French: &quot;Groupement Mobile Vientiane&quot; – GMV) was hastily formed to pursue Kong Le northwards up Route 13. Kouprasith was appointed to command it, and between 7 and 17 January 1961, the GMV followed the retreating FAN as far as Vang Viang. Once there, he called for air support from the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) before turning over his command and hastening back to the capital to safeguard his own interests. When the new GMV commander was unable to ward off counterattacks, Kouprasith was restored to his command on 27 January, and placed his troops in the south of Muang Kasi on Route 13. In his absence, on 22 April 1961, the regiment advanced northward into an ambush at Vang Viang. U.S. Special Forces (USSF) Team Moon was accompanying the move. Captain Walter Moon and Sergeant Orville Ballenger were captured, and Moon was later executed. Colonel Kouprasith helicoptered in and recovered the two surviving USSF team members.

==Neutrality beckons==

After the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos had been effectuated in October 1962, Kouprasith was once again in command of Military Region 5. Although MR 5 did not saw much fighting, under his command he had a regiment of regulars, Mobile Group 17 (French: &quot;Groupement Mobile 17&quot; – GM 17), four volunteer battalions (French: &quot;Batallions de Voluntaires&quot;), the Directorate of National Coordination (DNC) paramilitary Security Agency and its GMS airborne-qualified regiment, and nine ADC militia companies. His foster brother, Lieutenant colonel Siho Lamphouthacoul, commanded the DNC/GMS special battalions, which was rated as the best military unit in Laos. GM 17 was also commanded by a Kouprasith protégé.

During the first half of April 1964, two Royal Lao Government missions flew to Saigon in order to secretly coordinate joint military operations in southern Laos. GM 17 was posted away from Vientiane to the Plain of Jars in MR 2. At about the same time, Siho approached Kouprasith about using the DNC Security Agency to take over the kingdom in a military coup. Kouprasith agreed, and on 18 April 1964, Siho seized the key national government buildings when he seized control of Vientiane. A new governing body, The &quot;Revolutionary Committee of the National Army&quot; took office, with Kouprasith as its head and Siho as deputy. Kouprasith withdrew GM 17 from the Plain of Jars to reinforce the coup, abandoning a defensive line on the Plain to the communists. On 23 April, however, U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger intervened and ended the coup by restoring the legal government. Amid speculation about the early April missions, Kouprasith would subsequently claim to have patterned his coup after that of Nguyễn Khánh.

==Operation Triangle and the coups==

Operation Triangle, staged in July 1964, was the first combined arms operation of the Laotian Civil War. Commanded by Kouprasith, it was a three-pronged offensive against an isolated Pathet Lao garrison at the vital road intersection of Routes 7 and 13. The Government task-force were a mixture of Royal Lao Army regulars, neutralist paratroopers, and hill tribes guerrillas, working in conjunction with a close air support effort. By 30 July, Kouprasith was victorious, as the columns converged on the objective.

On 4 August 1964, Phoumi attempted a coup using his training battalion. The trainees erected roadblocks throughout the streets of Vientiane, but they were promptly overrun by Kouprasith&#x27;s troops. The training battalion was subsequently disbanded, and an antsy Phoumi was left with no troops to command.

In January 1965, the Laotian Prime-Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma convened a meeting of the RLA generals in Luang Prabang, where it made clear that he backed Kouprasith and Ouane Rattikone rather than Siho and Phoumi. Thus the latter two officers remained sidelined, with no troops being assigned to them. On 27 January, Phoumi convinced the Military Region 2 commander that the RLA units stationed in Vientiane were about to stage a coup d&#x27;état, and therefore a rescue mission was launched from MR 2. Even without any troops under his command, Phoumi was managing to attempt a coup.

On 31 January, while Phoumi&#x27;s begged troops were still inbound, Colonel Bounleut Saycocie also tried his own coup by using three companies from Mobile Group 17. He was on the air long enough to broadcast five radio communiqués. In that time, Kouprasith turned out the remainder of GM 17; the dissidents promptly rejoined the ranks of the RLA as Bounleut made peace with Kouprasith. However, even though Siho was not involved in the coup, Kouprasith distrusted him. In a pre-emptive move, Kouprasith besieged the Directorate of National Coordination&#x27;s Border Police (formerly known as the GMS) headquarters in Vientiane with RLA infantry units backed by armored cars, light tanks and artillery. After the assault, both the DNC and its Border Police battalions were disbanded. Kouprasith then dealt with the troops coming to Phoumi&#x27;s aid, attacking and dispersing them. By 4 February, the coups were over, with Phoumi and Siho escaping to exile in Thailand, their military careers at an end. A purge of Royal Lao Army officers loyal to Phoumi or Siho followed suit – during March and April 1965 many promising young officers were either murdered, imprisoned, or forced into exile, further weakening the RLA.

==Ongoing career==

However, one pro-Phoumi officer was too necessary to the war effort to be purged: Major general Vang Pao, the leader of the CIA-sponsored Hmong Special Guerrilla Units (SGUs) operating in northeastern Laos. The resulting poor relationship between Kouprasith and Vang Pao was worsened by a murder incident which occurred that autumn. A Hmong SGU guerrilla fighter killed a Royalist regular soldier in a fit of rage and then sought refuge at Vang Pao&#x27;s villa in Vientiane. When Kouprasith&#x27;s Royalist soldiers surrounded the villa, Vang Pao strongly objected. The two generals became even more estranged because of this incident until 11 November 1965, when they were finally reconciled by an intermediary.

Brigadier general Thao Ma, the commander of the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), was another Phoumi loyalist bereft of his support. By July 1965, Kouprasith began gossiping that Brig. Gen. Thao Ma was planning a coup. Major general Ouane Rattikone floated a scheme to split the C-47 transports and the T-28D fighter-bombers into separate contingents, allowing the RLAF commander to concentrate upon the latter. Brig. Gen. Thao Ma protested to U.S. Ambassador William H. Sullivan, claiming that the other generals wanted to seize control of the C-47 transports for their personal clandestine gold- and opium-smuggling operations, and for paid passenger services. Prince Souvanna Phouma scotched the reorganization.

On 2 April 1966, during a strategy meeting of the American Embassy staff and the Royal Lao Army&#x27;s General Staff, Kouprasith and Ouane protested against Operation Barrel Roll&#x27;s schedule of air strikes that allotted a large percentage of the U.S. Air Force bombing raids to the Ho Chi Minh Trail in southern Laos. They wanted more air power used to support the RLA and SGU troops fighting in the Plain of Jars in northern Laos. Meanwhile, during Summer 1966, RLAF operations slowly grounded to a near standstill as Brig. Gen. Thao Ma was being pressured to move his headquarters from Seno Air Base, near Savannakhet, to the vicinity of the RLA General Staff headquarters in Vientiane, so that they could keep a close eye on his activities.

==More coups==

Kouprasith wanted Royalist control of Kong Le&#x27;s Neutralists. Some of Kong Le&#x27;s subordinate officers, with the connivance of the RLA General Staff, deposed him on 17 October 1966, sending him into exile. Four days later, in a separate action, Thao Ma and Bounleut Saycocie launched an unsuccessful airborne coup against the government. After failing to kill Kouprasith with an air strike on the General Staff headquarters the Royal Lao Air Force general led ten of his T-28 fighter pilots in a flight into exile in Thailand.

On 24 November 1966, Pathet Lao troops captured government positions at Tha Thom in Military Region 2. However, since Kouprasith&#x27;s MR 5 troops were closer to the scene, he flew in Royalist reinforcements while the RLAF bombed the enemy. Tha Thom was retaken on the 28th.

When the General Staff shuffled officers&#x27; assignments in July 1968, Kouprasith retained command of Military Region 5. In early March 1970, Kouprasith was charged with holding the vital Route 7/13 intersection with a four battalion force. At about the same time, the March 1970 change of government in Cambodia led to increased communist activity in the vicinity of Kouprasith&#x27;s native Khong Island. By 18 July, the North Vietnamese had captured the eastern ferry landing on the mainland. The Military Region 4 commander was overwhelmed dealing with the communist offensive roaring forth from the Ho Chi Minh Trail. On the 20th, Kouprasith hastily forwarded two battalions and a pair of 105 mm howitzers to defend the island. A third battalion was supplied from Military Region 3. A makeshift fourth battalion was thrown together from personnel drafted from all the MR 5 battalions; it too went to Khong Island.

Prince Sisouk na Champassak became the Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in August 1970. He began to revamp the Lao military. First, he engineered the retirements of Generals Ouane and Oudone from their posts as commander and deputy commander of the RLA in March 1971. He also placed constraints on Kouprasith&#x27;s command of MR 5. When the high command was reorganized on 1 July 1971, Kouprasith was transferred to administration, becoming the deputy commander in chief of the Royal Lao Army.

When Khong Island was once again threatened by the communists in October 1972, Kouprasith took charge of the relief expedition. With little opposition, he defeated the Vietnamese in three weeks.

On 20 August 1973, Thao Ma again tried to kill Kouprasith with a bombing raid. Thao Ma returned from exile in a motorized column containing 60 adherents. Once they captured Wattay Airbase, Thao Ma returned to the sky in a commandeered T-28. Thao Ma and his wingman tried to kill Kouprasith by dive bombing; they demolished Kouprasith&#x27;s brick villa, killing his nephew. However, the airfield was retaken from the coup force while the air strike was in progress. When they returned, a truck-mounted machine gun manned by a government soldier brought Thao Ma down. He was hauled wounded from his crash-landed plane and taken to Kouprasith&#x27;s headquarters. There Thao Ma was executed on Kouprasith&#x27;s order.

==Fall from power==

When the final Pathet Lao offensive drove through Vientiane in May 1975, Kouprasith resigned on the 11th and fled to Thailand. In October 1978, he joined the Royal Lao Government in Exile in France, but retired shortly thereafter. He reportedly died in 1999.

<text>Brigadier-General Thao Ma (1931–1973) was a Laotian military and political figure of the Laotian Civil War and the Vietnam War (aka Second Indochina War). Thao Ma began his military career as a paratrooper in the French Union Army, when France administered the Kingdom of Laos. He switched to aviation, first as a transport pilot, then as a fighter-bomber pilot. From 1959 to 1966, Thao Ma was the commander of the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), and was noted for his charisma and aggressiveness. However, his dedication to soldierly virtues put him at odds with other Laotian generals who were involved in the drug trade. As a result, he made three futile attempts to seize control of the Laotian military and the Royal Lao Government. During the last of these attempted coups, in 1973, he was executed without trial at age 42.

==Early life==
Thao Ma Manosith was born in 1931 at Salavan in the French Protectorate of Laos, of mixed Laotian and Vietnamese heritage. He became a Laotian patriot, initially opposed to any foreign intervention in Laos. His views changed as he became involved in the battle for Laotian independence.

==Aviation service 1955-1966==
Thao Ma&#x27;s early training as an aviator took place under the French rule. A French military mission in Laos began training Laotian pilots in January 1955, with the aim of staffing the newly founded Laotian Aviation (French: &quot;Aviation Laotiènne&quot;), the air wing of the Laotian National Army (French: &quot;Armée Nationale du Laos&quot; – ANL). Thao Ma, already trained as a paratrooper in the ANL airborne forces, retrained as a transport pilot.

In 1959, Thao Ma was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of Laotian Aviation, which the following year became the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), with him remaining at its helm. At the same time, Col. Thao Ma continued to take advanced flight courses, which enabled him to master strike aircraft types such as the North American T-6G Texan, followed by the North American T-28D Trojan.

In 1964, as the air war in Laos intensified, Col. Thao Ma led the RLAF&#x27;s T-28 attack squadron in the raids against the Ho Chi Minh Trail and in support of Major-General Vang Pao&#x27;s SGU guerrilla forces in northeastern Laos. He devised an early version of the AC-47 gunship by using a few modified Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports as weapons platforms. He improvised removable machine-gun mounts to arm the transports with AN/M2 heavy machine-guns, and also had installed cargo rollers leading to the loading door; 250 lb bombs could be thus be rolled out the door while in-flight.

Although his personal involvement led to the rise of a high esprit de corps within the RLAF, Col. Thao Ma came into conflict with other Laotian generals, as his whole-hearted commitment of employing RLAF aircraft for military purposes stood in the way of their plans of using them for their own gold- and opium-smuggling operations. In February 1965, he refused to accept bribes from higher-ranking officers and categorically informed them that he would not allow his pilots to be coerced into drug smuggling. The generals&#x27; response was to move the RLAF headquarters from Wattay Air Base, near Vientiane, to Seno Air Base, near Savannakhet; most of the T-28 pilots stationed there were Thai mercenaries rather than Laotians. Later in the summer of 1965, a number of RLAF pilots were bribed to mutiny against their own commander. In response, Col. Thao Ma attempted a coup d&#x27;état on 4 June 1965.

By August 1965, the RLAF strike component had increased to 27 T-28s, with Thao Ma being promoted to brigadier-general. Brig. Gen. Thao Ma had not only successfully managed to increase the T-28s&#x27; combat sortie rate, but continued to personally fly many strike missions.

In the wake of the failed coup, Brig. Gen. Thao Ma was both pressured to allow the smuggling of drugs by the RLAF&#x27;s C-47 transports and enticed with bribe offers. Despite the ongoing pressure, however, he remained intransigent. Finally, in May 1966 the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR) General Staff summoned Brig. Gen. Thao Ma from the RLAF headquarters at Seno Air Base to inform him they had detached the C-47 transport planes from RLAF Air Command and formed them into a separate command under Colonel Sourith Don Sasorith, himself also a former Army paratrooper. Brig. Gen. Thao Ma was also ordered to transfer his headquarters back to Vientiane, where he could be under the General Staff&#x27;s watchful eye. Instead, he pleaded for a six-month grace period before relocating his headquarters to the capital city and fled to Luang Prabang. By now, he was fearful of assassination and was psychologically deteriorating under the stress. During the six-month grace period, he desperately sought alternatives to the ordered transfer, seeking unsuccessfully the intercession of King Savang Vatthana, of his American sponsors, and of his friend Captain Kong Le.

On 22 October 1966, Brig. Gen. Thao Ma attempted a coup via air strike when he personally led a flight of Laotian T-28 pilots loyal to him in a combat sortie directed at Vientiane. An attempt to kill the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Lao Army (RLA), Major-General Kouprasith Abhay, with rocket fire aimed at his home failed. Two ammunition dumps at Wattay Air Base outside the city were blown up, killing over 30 people on the ground and many more wounded.

As the coup attempt fell apart, the dissident T-28 pilots had no choice but to return to Seno Air Base. Brig. Gen. Thao Ma was then persuaded by American officials not to fly a followup strike. At 01:45 hours of 23 October, he and ten remaining loyal RLAF pilots took off from Seno and flew their T-28s into exile in Thailand. The loss of a third of its T-28 pilots was a serious setback for the RLAF.

==Return from exile, and death==
On 20 August 1973, Thao Ma returned from exile in a motorized column carrying 60 adherents to stage another coup attempt. Once they quickly captured Wattay Air Base, he took a commandeered T-28, and he and his wingman attempted to again kill Maj. Gen. Kouprasith Abhay with a dive bombing raid on his brick villa in Vientiane, demolishing the building and killing his nephew. Thao Ma and six other pilots then flew their T-28s in a strike against the Royal Lao Army headquarters. However, Wattay Air Base was retaken by loyalist troops of the RLA while the air strikes were in progress. When Thao Ma&#x27;s strike force returned to the airfield, a truck-mounted Browning M2HB .50 Cal Heavy machine-gun manned by a government soldier brought Thao Ma&#x27;s T-28 down while he was attempting to land. He was hauled wounded from his crash-landed plane and taken to Kouprasith&#x27;s headquarters in Vientiane. There Thao Ma was executed on Kouprasith&#x27;s order. He was 42 years old.

<doc id="209706" wikidata="Q17104735" url="?curid=209706" title="XER (Villa Acuña)">
<text>XER (1932–1933), licensed to Villa Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico, was John R. Brinkley&#x27;s first high-powered &quot;border-blaster&quot; radio station. It first came on the air in 1932. It was shut down by the Mexican authorities in 1933 and the Villa Acuña Broadcasting Company was dissolved.

==History of XER==
XER called itself the &quot;Sunshine Station between the Nations&quot;, and it broadcast on 735 kHz, on the AM band from Villa Acuña, Coahuila. The owner was Dr. John R. Brinkley of Kansas, who established a management company called Villa Acuña Broadcasting Company located just across the Rio Grande in Del Rio, Texas. It first signed on August 18, 1932, with a 50-kW transmitter and claimed 75 kW power output via an omnidirectional antenna. The engineering was by Will Branch of Fort Worth, who had engineered WBAP for Amon Carter, owner of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. For a brief period, XER-AM was licensed for one million watts, but XER was shut down by the Mexican authorities on February 24, 1933, and the Villa Acuña Broadcasting Company of Del Rio, which had managed the station, was dissolved.

The XER call sign was assigned in 1943 to a new station in Linares, Nuevo León, which migrated to FM and is now XHR-FM.
