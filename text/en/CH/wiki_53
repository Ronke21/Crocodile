<text>Communicative language teaching (CLT), or the communicative approach (CA), is an approach to language teaching that emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of study.

Learners in environments using communication to learn and practice the target language by communication with one another and the instructor, the study of &quot;authentic texts&quot; (those written in the target language for purposes other than language learning), and the use of the language both in class and outside of class.

Learners converse about personal experiences with partners, and instructors teach topics outside of the realm of traditional grammar to promote language skills in all types of situations. That method also claims to encourage learners to incorporate their personal experiences into their language learning environment and to focus on the learning experience, in addition to the learning of the target language.

According to CLT, the goal of language education is the ability to communicate in the target language. This is in contrast to previous views in which grammatical competence was commonly given top priority.

CLT also positions the teacher as a facilitator, rather than an instructor. Furthermore, the approach is a non-methodical system that does not use a textbook series to teach the target language but works on developing sound oral and verbal skills prior to reading and writing.

== Background ==
=== Societal influences ===
The rise of CLT in the 1970s and the early 1980s was partly in response to the lack of success with traditional language teaching methods and partly by the increase in demand for language learning. In Europe, the advent of the European Common Market, an economic predecessor to the European Union, led to migration in Europe and an increased number of people who needed to learn a foreign language for work or personal reasons. Meanwhile, more children were given the opportunity to learn foreign languages in school, as the number of secondary schools offering languages rose worldwide as part of a general trend of curriculum-broadening and modernization, with foreign-language study no longer confined to the elite academies. In Britain, the introduction of comprehensive schools, which offered foreign-language study to all children, rather than to the select few of the elite grammar schools, greatly increased the demand for language learning.

The increased demand included many learners who struggled with traditional methods such as grammar translation, which involves the direct translation of sentence after sentence as a way to learn the language. Those methods assumed that students aimed to master the target language and were willing to study for years before expecting to use the language in real life. However, those assumptions were challenged by adult learners, who were busy with work, and by schoolchildren who were less academically gifted and so could not devote years to learning before they could use the language. Educators realized that to motivate those students an approach with a more immediate reward was necessary, and they began to use CLT, an approach that emphasizes communicative ability and yielded better results.

=== Academic influences ===
Already in the late 19th century, the American educator John Dewey was writing about learning by doing, and later that learning should be based on the learner&#x27;s interests and experiences. In 1963, American psychologist David Ausubel released his book &quot;The Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning&quot; calling for a holistic approach to learners teaching through meaningful material. American educator Clifford Prator published a paper in 1965 calling for teachers to turn from an emphasis on manipulation (drills) towards communication where learners were free to choose their own words. In 1966, the sociolinguist Dell Hymes posited the concept of communicative competence considerably broadening out Noam Chomsky&#x27;s syntactic concept of competence. Also, in 1966, American psychologist Jerome Bruner wrote that learners construct their own understanding of the world based on their experiences and prior knowledge, and teachers should provide scaffolding to promote this. Bruner appears to have been influenced by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist whose zone of proximal development is a similar concept.

Later in the 1970s British linguist M.A.K. Halliday studied how language functions are expressed through grammar. 

The development of communicative language teaching was bolstered by these academic ideas. Before the growth of communicative language teaching, the primary method of language teaching was situational language teaching, a method that was much more clinical in nature and relied less on direct communication. In Britain, applied linguists began to doubt the efficacy of situational language teaching, partly in response to Chomsky&#x27;s insights into the nature of language. Chomsky had shown that the structural theories of language then prevalent could not explain the variety that is found in real communication. In addition, applied linguists like Christopher Candlin and Henry Widdowson observed that the current model of language learning was ineffective in classrooms. They saw a need for students to develop communicative skill and functional competence in addition to mastering language structures.

In 1966, the linguist and anthropologist Dell Hymes developed the concept of communicative competence, which redefined what it meant to &quot;know&quot; a language. In addition to speakers having mastery over the structural elements of language, they must also be able to use those structural elements appropriately in a variety of speech domains. That can be neatly summed up by Hymes&#x27;s statement: &quot;There are rules of use without which the rules of grammar would be useless.&quot; The idea of communicative competence stemmed from Chomsky&#x27;s concept of the linguistic competence of an ideal native speaker. Hymes did not make a concrete formulation of communicative competence, but subsequent authors, notably Michael Canale, have tied the concept to language teaching. Canale and Swain (1980) defined communicative competence in terms of three components: grammatical competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. Canale (1983) refined the model by adding discourse competence, which contains the concepts of cohesion and coherence.

An influential development in the history of communicative language teaching was the work of the Council of Europe in creating new language syllabi. When communicative language teaching had effectively replaced situational language teaching as the standard by leading linguists, the Council of Europe made an effort to once again bolster the growth of the new method, which led to the Council of Europe creating a new language syllabus. Education was a high priority for the Council of Europe, which set out to provide a syllabus that would meet the needs of European immigrants. Among the studies that it used in designing the course was one by a British linguist, D. A. Wilkins, that defined language using &quot;notions&quot; and &quot;functions,&quot; rather than more traditional categories of grammar and vocabulary. The new syllabus reinforced the idea that language could not be adequately explained by grammar and syntax but instead relied on real interaction.

In the mid-1990s, the Dogme 95 manifesto influenced language teaching through the Dogme language teaching movement. It proposed that published materials stifle the communicative approach. As such, the aim of the Dogme approach to language teaching is to focus on real conversations about practical subjects in which communication is the engine of learning. The idea behind the Dogme approach is that communication can lead to explanation, which leads to further learning. That approach is the antithesis of situational language teaching, which emphasizes learning by text and prioritizes grammar over communication.

A survey of communicative competence by Bachman (1990) divides competency into the broad headings of &quot;organizational competence,&quot; which includes both grammatical and discourse (or textual) competence, and &quot;pragmatic competence,&quot; which includes both sociolinguistic and &quot;illocutionary&quot; competence. Strategic competence is associated with the interlocutors&#x27; ability in using communication strategies.

==Classroom activities==
CLT teachers choose classroom activities based on what they believe will be most effective for students developing communicative abilities in the target language (TL). Oral activities are popular among CLT teachers compared to grammar drills or reading and writing activities, because they include active conversation and creative, unpredicted responses from students. Activities vary based on the level of language class they are used in. They promote collaboration, fluency, and comfort in the TL. The six activities listed and explained below are commonly used in CLT classrooms.

=== Role-play ===
Role-play is an oral activity usually done in pairs, whose main goal is to develop students&#x27; communicative abilities in a certain setting.

Example:
# The instructor sets the scene: where is the conversation taking place? (E.g., in a café, in a park, etc.)
# The instructor defines the goal of the students&#x27; conversation. (E.g., the speaker is asking for directions, the speaker is ordering coffee, the speaker is talking about a movie they recently saw, etc.)
# The students converse in pairs for a designated amount of time.
This activity gives students the chance to improve their communication skills in the TL in a low-pressure situation. Most students are more comfortable speaking in pairs rather than in front of the entire class.

Instructors need to be aware of the differences between a conversation and an utterance. Students may use the same utterances repeatedly when doing this activity and not actually have a creative conversation. If instructors do not regulate what kinds of conversations students are having, then the students might not be truly improving their communication skills.

=== Interviews ===
An interview is an oral activity done in pairs, whose main goal is to develop students&#x27; interpersonal skills in the TL.

Example:
# The instructor gives each student the same set of questions to ask a partner.
# Students take turns asking and answering the questions in pairs.
This activity, since it is highly structured, allows for the instructor to more closely monitor students&#x27; responses. It can zone in on one specific aspect of grammar or vocabulary, while still being a primarily communicative activity and giving the students communicative benefits.

This is an activity that should be used primarily in the lower levels of language classes, because it will be most beneficial to lower-level speakers. Higher-level speakers should be having unpredictable conversations in the TL, where neither the questions nor the answers are scripted or expected. If this activity were used with higher-level speakers it wouldn&#x27;t have many benefits.

=== Group work ===
Group work is a collaborative activity whose purpose is to foster communication in the TL, in a larger group setting.

Example:
# Students are assigned a group of no more than six people.
# Students are assigned a specific role within the group. (E.g., member A, member B, etc.)
# The instructor gives each group the same task to complete.
# Each member of the group takes a designated amount of time to work on the part of the task to which they are assigned.
# The members of the group discuss the information they have found, with each other and put it all together to complete the task.
Students can feel overwhelmed in language classes, but this activity can take away from that feeling. Students are asked to focus on one piece of information only, which increases their comprehension of that information. Better comprehension leads to better communication with the rest of the group, which improves students&#x27; communicative abilities in the TL.

Instructors should be sure to monitor that each student is contributing equally to the group effort. It takes a good instructor to design the activity well, so that students will contribute equally, and benefit equally from the activity.

=== Information gap ===
Information gap is a collaborative activity, whose purpose is for students to effectively obtain information that was previously unknown to them, in the TL.

Example:
# The class is paired up. One partner in each pair is Partner A, and the other is Partner B.
# All the students that are Partner A are given a sheet of paper with a time-table on it. The time-table is filled in half-way, but some of the boxes are empty.
# All the students that are Partner B are given a sheet of paper with a time-table on it. The boxes that are empty on Partner A&#x27;s time-table are filled in on Partner B&#x27;s. There are also empty boxes on Partner B&#x27;s time-table, but they are filled in on Partner A&#x27;s.
# The partners must work together to ask about and supply each other with the information they are both missing, to complete each other&#x27;s time-tables.
Completing information gap activities improves students&#x27; abilities to communicate about unknown information in the TL. These abilities are directly applicable to many real-world conversations, where the goal is to find out some new piece of information, or simply to exchange information.

Instructors should not overlook the fact that their students need to be prepared to communicate effectively for this activity. They need to know certain vocabulary words, certain structures of grammar, etc. If the students have not been well prepared for the task at hand, then they will not communicate effectively.

=== Opinion sharing ===
Opinion sharing is a content-based activity, whose purpose is to engage students&#x27; conversational skills, while talking about something they care about.

Example:
# The instructor introduces a topic and asks students to contemplate their opinions about it. (E.g., dating, school dress codes, global warming)
# The students talk in pairs or small groups, debating their opinions on the topic.
Opinion sharing is a great way to get more introverted students to open up and share their opinions. If a student has a strong opinion about a certain topic, then they will speak up and share.

Respect is key with this activity. If a student does not feel like their opinion is respected by the instructor or their peers, then they will not feel comfortable sharing, and they will not receive the communicative benefits of this activity.

=== Scavenger hunt ===
A scavenger hunt is a mingling activity that promotes open interaction between students.

Example:
# The instructor gives students a sheet with instructions on it. (e.g. Find someone who has a birthday in the same month as yours.)
# Students go around the classroom asking and answering questions about each other.
# The students wish to find all of the answers they need to complete the scavenger hunt.
In doing this activity, students have the opportunity to speak with a number of classmates, while still being in a low-pressure situation, and talking to only one person at a time. After learning more about each other, and getting to share about themselves, students will feel more comfortable talking and sharing during other communicative activities.

Since this activity is not as structured as some of the others, it is important for instructors to add structure. If certain vocabulary should be used in students&#x27; conversations, or a certain grammar is necessary to complete the activity, then instructors should incorporate that into the scavenger hunt.

== Criticism ==
Although CLT has been extremely influential in the field of language teaching, it is not universally accepted and has been subject to significant critique.

In his critique of CLT, Michael Swan addresses both the theoretical and practical problems with CLT. He mentions that CLT is not an altogether cohesive subject but one in which theoretical understandings (by linguists) and practical understandings (by language teachers) differ greatly. Criticism of the theory of CLT includes that it makes broad claims regarding the usefulness of CLT while citing little data, it uses a large amount of confusing vocabulary, and it assumes knowledge that is predominately not language-specific (such as the ability to make educated guesses) to be language-specific. Swan suggests that those theoretical issues lead to confusion in the application of CLT techniques.

Where confusion in the application of CLT techniques is readily apparent is in classroom settings. Swan suggests that CLT techniques often suggest prioritizing the &quot;function&quot; of a language (what one can do with the language knowledge one has) over the &quot;structure&quot; of a language (the grammatical systems of the language). That priority can leave learners with serious gaps in their knowledge of the formal aspects of their target language. Swan also suggests that in CLT techniques, the languages that a student might already know are not valued or employed in instructional techniques.

Further critique of CLT techniques in classroom teaching can be attributed to Elaine Ridge. One of her criticisms of CLT is that it falsely implies that there is a general consensus regarding the definition of &quot;communicative competence,&quot; which CLT claims to facilitate. Because there is no such agreement, students may be seen to be in possession of &quot;communicative competence&quot; without being able to make full or even adequate use of the language. That individuals are proficient in a language does not necessarily entail that they can make full use of that language, which can limit an individual&#x27;s potential with that language, especially if that language is an endangered language. That criticism largely has to do with the fact that CLT is often highly praised and is popular though it may not necessarily be the best method of language teaching.

Ridge also notes that CLT has nonspecific requirements of its teachers, as there is no completely standard definition of what CLT is, which is especially true for the teaching of grammar, the formal rules governing the standardized version of the language in question. Some critics of CLT suggest that the method does not put enough emphasis on the teaching of grammar and instead allows students to produce utterances, despite being grammatically incorrect, as long as the interlocutor can get some meaning from them.

Stephen Bax&#x27;s critique of CLT has to do with the context of its implementation. Bax asserts that many researchers associate the use of CLT techniques with modernity and so the lack of CLT techniques as a lack of modernism. That way, those researchers consider teachers or school systems that fail to use CLT techniques as outdated and suggest that their students learn the target language &quot;in spite of&quot; the absence of CLT techniques, as if CLT were the only way to learn a language, and everyone who fails to implement its techniques is ignorant and cannot teach the target language.

<doc id="1025901" wikidata="Q7319682" url="?curid=1025901" title="Reynolds decomposition">
<text>In fluid dynamics and turbulence theory, Reynolds decomposition is a mathematical technique used to separate the expectation value of a quantity from its fluctuations.

==Decomposition==
For example, for a quantity formula_1 the decomposition would be
formula_2
where formula_3 denotes the expectation value of formula_1, (often called the steady component/time, spatial or ensemble average), and formula_5, are the deviations from the expectation value (or fluctuations). The fluctuations are defined as the expectation value subtracted from quantity formula_1 such that their time average equals zero. 

The expected value, formula_3, is often found from an ensemble average which is an average taken over multiple experiments under identical conditions. The expected value is also sometime denoted formula_8, but it is also seen often with the over-bar notation.

Direct numerical simulation, or resolution of the Navier–Stokes equations completely in formula_9, is only possible on extremely fine computational grids and small time steps even when Reynolds numbers are low, and becomes prohibitively computationally expensive at high Reynolds&#x27; numbers. Due to computational constraints, simplifications of the Navier-Stokes equations are useful to parameterize turbulence that are smaller than the computational grid, allowing larger computational domains.

Reynolds decomposition allows the simplification of the Navier–Stokes equations by substituting in the sum of the steady component and perturbations to the velocity profile and taking the mean value. The resulting equation contains a nonlinear term known as the Reynolds stresses which gives rise to turbulence.

<text>Club de Fútbol América S.A. de C.V., commonly known as Club América, is a professional football club based in Mexico City. Nicknamed &quot;Las Águilas&quot; (The Eagles), it competes in Liga MX, the top tier of Mexican football. The club was founded in 1916, and since 1959 has been owned by mass media company Televisa. The team plays its home games at Estadio Azteca, the largest stadium in Latin America and one of the largest in the world.

América is one of the founding members of the Primera División. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Guadalajara, as both are the most successful and most supported teams in the country and are among the seven clubs to have never been relegated. Matches between them are known as &quot;El Súper Clásico&quot;, considered to be the biggest rivalry in Mexico, and one of the biggest in the world. América also plays derbies against Cruz Azul and Club Universidad Nacional. Together the clubs make up the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Mexican football.

Club América have won more titles than any other team in Mexican football. Domestically, the club has won a record sixteen league titles, a record six Copa México titles, and a joint-record seven Campeón de Campeones cups. In international competitions, América has won ten FIFA recognized club trophies, the most for a club from CONCACAF, with a record seven CONCACAF Champions Cup/Champions League titles, one CONCACAF Giants Cup, and two Copa Interamericanas. The club also holds numerous distinctions, including topping the all-time league table in victories, points, and goals scored, most appearances in the &quot;liguilla&quot; (playoffs) stage, the most playoff final appearances (21) and second-most runner-up finishes, after Cruz Azul. It is one of four clubs to win back-to-back league titles since the introduction of the &quot;liguilla&quot; format, and the only team to achieve a three-peat under the format. In 2021, América was named by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics as the best North American club of the first decade (2001–2011) of the 21st century.

==History==

===Founding===
By 1916 football was already a popular sport in Mexico, particularly amongst college students in Mexico City. College students from Colegio Mascarones and Colegio Marista de la Perpetua formed two football teams with the names &quot;Récord&quot; and &quot;Colón&quot;. On 12 October 1916, the two squads decided to consolidate to make a more competitive squad. Many names were considered for this new squad, and team player Pedro &quot;Cheto&quot; Quintanilla suggested the name &quot;América&quot;, since they had formed the team on Columbus Day (&quot;Día del descubrimiento de América&quot;). The players agreed and soon designed a crest which had the map of the Americas centered with a &#x27;C&#x27; for &quot;Club&quot; on the left and an &#x27;A&#x27; for &quot;América&quot; on the right. In deciding the team&#x27;s colors, Rafael Garza Gutiérrez got a pair of his father&#x27;s navy blue trousers and a yellow shirt and it was decided amongst the group that those would be the club&#x27;s kit and colors.

In 1916, Club América had to prove itself to the Mexican Football League, then known as the Primera Fuerza. At the time, América was the only club in Mexico City with Mexican-born players. Necaxa, Atlante, Real Club España, Germania, and Asturias were already members of the &quot;Liga Mayor de la Ciudad&quot;. América&#x27;s acceptance into the league rested on three games they had to win. América won two games, tied the third and were accepted.

In 1918, the team changed its name to Club Centro Unión, though it would revert to using the name América only two years later.
América won their first Primera Fuerza title in the 1924–25 season, being crowned champions after defeating Asturias 1–0 in the deciding match. América would win the Primera Fuerza three more times, all of them back-to-back. In 1926, América became the first Mexican club to play outside of Mexico. Aside from broadening their horizons, Club América, along with Atlante petitioned to reduce the number of foreign players in the league. Shortly after the Mexican Football Federation was formed in 1928, Rafael Garza Gutiérrez was designated as the head coach of the Mexico national team. Most of the national team that participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics and 1930 World Cup consisted of players from Club América.

===1940–1969===
Until 1942, Mexico had several leagues, although the league in Mexico City was considered the most developed. In 1942–43, the first National League was established and it was known as the Liga Mayor (Major League). Club América had declined from its then-prime of the 1920s and 1930s: aging players, diminishing financial resources, and resulting lack of interest made the team a bottom-feeder at the start of the beginning stage of the professional era7.

It was also during this time that the rivalry with Guadalajara was born; especially during the 1945–1946 season when Guadalajara beat América by 6–4 and 4–2 scorelines. The 1951–1952 season saw América finish in 11th place out of 12, with a 3-point-advantage over Veracruz, who were relegated. In 1954 América defeated rivals Guadalajara on penalties after a 0–0 draw in the Copa México final, thus winning their first league cup.

In 1956, the club was sold to soft drink manufacturer Jarritos. The new owner was trying to build upon the club&#x27;s National Cup titles in 1954 and 1955 against Guadalajara. During the 1954–55 season América won their first Campeón de Campeones championship, defeating Zacatepec 3–2. The owner failed to build upon previous success and on 22 July 1959, Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, owner of Telesistema Mexicano, bought América from Isaac Bessudo. Following the acquisition, Azcárraga told his players, &quot;I do not know much about football, but I do know a lot about business, and this, gentlemen, will be a business.&quot;

The 1959–1960 season saw América reach second place in the league, behind Guadalajara. On 21 April 1964, at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario, the team, now coached by Alejandro Scopelli, defeated Monterrey 6–5 in the final match of the Copa México. During the match Alfonso Portugal scored five of América&#x27;s six; José González scored the other goal to win the championship.

On 7 May 1965, América regained the Mexican &quot;Copa&quot; championship after a 4–0 victory over Morelia at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario. The goals were scored by Javier Fragoso and Vavá, each scoring twice.

===1970s===
After Mexico hosted the 1970 FIFA World Cup, the league tournament format was changed in response to the championship&#x27;s disputed winners, hence the Liguilla (play-offs) format was started. The first play-off final was in 1971 between Toluca and América, leaders of Groups 1 and 2, respectively. After a 0–0 draw in Toluca, América obtained their second league title after winning the second-leg 2–0 at the Estadio Azteca. The following season saw América eliminated from the playoffs by Cruz Azul. América would defeat Cruz Azul in the 1973 Copa México final. A few years followed in which América did not qualify for the playoffs. They finished in first place during the 1975–1976 season, and defeated Tecos UAG and Union de Curtidores in the quarter-finals and semi-finals to reach the final against Universidad de Guadalajara. América won the championship after beating UDG in the Jalisco Stadium 3–0 and 1–0 at the Estadio Azteca. They also won the Campeón de Campeones title by beating Tigres UANL 2–0.

In 1978, América participated in their first Copa Interamericana, playing against Argentine club Boca Juniors, winners of the 1977 Copa Libertadores. After losing the first-leg and winning the second, América would win the championship in a playoff match by a score of 2–1 after extra-time, with a last second free-kick goal by midfielder Carlos Reinoso. América became the first team from Mexico and from the CONCACAF region to win the competition. América also became the first confederation side to earn the &quot;double&quot; in a single year as it won the delayed 1977 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

===1980s===
The 1980s are generally considered América&#x27;s &quot;golden decade&quot;. During this period, América won the league title five times, including three consecutive titles; the 1983–84 season, the 1984–85 season, the Prode-85 tournament, the 1987–88 and 1988–89 seasons. They also won the Mexican Super Cup twice, in 1987–88 and 1988–89, as well as the 1987 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

The 1983–1984 season saw América reach the top of the table and reach the finals, where they would face arch-rivals Guadalajara, who the previous season had eliminated América in the semi-finals. Following a 2–2 draw at the Estadio Jalisco, América defeated Guadalajara in the Azteca Stadium 3–1, and a 5–3 aggregate score. To date, it is the only match between these two teams in the league finals, though they would face each other in other phases of the playoffs. The series has since been dubbed the &quot;Final del Siglo&quot; (&quot;Final of the Century&quot;). The following season América once again reached the finals, this time against city-rivals Pumas UNAM. After two draws in both the Azteca Stadium and the Mexico &#x27;68 Stadium, the last game was played in the Estadio Corregidora in Querétaro, where Daniel Brailovsky secured the championship for América by scoring two goals with the final score of 3–1.

Due to Mexico hosting the 1986 World Cup and stadium and infrastructure preparations, the tournament was split in two short tournaments: Prode-85 and Mexico-86. América clinched the top of their group in the Prode-85 and defeated Universidad de Guadalajara and Atlante (which was rescheduled following the earthquake suffered in Mexico City) to reach the final, where they faced Jaibos Tampico Madero. The game in Tampico was a 4–1 victory for Tampico, but at the Azteca Stadium, América beat Tampico Madero 4–0 to win the championship.

For the 1987–88 season, América met UNAM in the final, in a replay of the 1985 final. They defeated UNAM by an aggregate score of 4–2. The following season, América once again reached the league final and faced Cruz Azul, which was the first time the two clubs met in the final since 1972. The first-leg finished in a 3–2 victory for América. A 2–2 draw in the second-leg meant América won the championship by a 5–4 aggregate score.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, América only managed to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1990, a Copa Interamericana in 1993, and a second CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1993. During the 1990–1991 season, América dominated its group and reached the playoffs to eliminate Universidad de Guadalajara in the quarter-final round and Guadalajara in the semi-final round, only to reach the final and lose to UNAM.

In 1994, club president Emilio Diez Barroso announced the hiring of Dutch manager Leo Beenhakker. The club also announced the signing of two African players, Cameroon international François Omam-Biyik and Zambia national team captain Kalusha Bwalya. Other Mexican players such as Joaquín del Olmo, Raúl Gutiérrez, among others were signed as well. América finished the season with 51 points, and scoring 88 goals. With only a few matches remaining in the regular season, Beenhakker was abruptly fired as manager. It was rumored that conflict between the coach and Diez Barosso regarding Beenhacker&#x27;s defending of playing Del Olmo was the reason for his sacking. América reached the semi-finals, losing to Cruz Azul. This América team is considered one of the best in the club&#x27;s history, despite not winning any silverware.

In 1998 América, along with Guadalajara, became the first Mexican club to participate in the Copa Libertadores tournament. They were inserted in a group where both teams confronted clubs from Venezuela. América finished in second position of the qualifying stage and advanced to the group stages. América was put in Group 3 along with Guadalajara and Brazilian clubs Grêmio and Vasco da Gama. América qualified to the next round finishing in third place, being eliminated by Argentine club River Plate.

===2000s===
In August 2001, América won the CONCACAF Giants Cup after defeating MLS club D.C. United 2–0. The following year, América would reach the league final against Necaxa, winning by a 3–2 aggregate score. After losing in the first-leg 0–2, América won the second by the same scoreline, forcing extra-time to be played. A golden goal from a Hugo Norberto Castillo header in the 107th minute gave América the victory, and the club its first league championship in 13 years.

The club once again reached the league final during the Clausura 2005 tournament, finishing third in the standings and defeating Santos Laguna and Cruz Azul in the quarterfinals and semi-finals to face Tecos UAG. After a 1–1 draw in the first-leg, América was victorious in the second, winning the match 6–3 at the Estadio Azteca – 7–4 on aggregate – to win the club&#x27;s tenth league title.

On 19 April 2006, América defeated fellow-Mexican side Toluca to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, thus qualifying for the FIFA Club World Cup that same year. At the tournament, América won its first match against Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors of South Korea. América went on to lose the next match against Spanish side FC Barcelona. It ended its participation in the tournament, losing the match for third place to Al Ahly of Egypt.

====2007====
After the Club World Cup, América qualified for the playoffs of the Clausura 2007 defeating Atlas and Guadalajara in the quarter and semi-finals. They played the final against Pachuca, finishing runners-up.

For the Apertura 2007, after starting off the season on a poor run, Luis Fernando Tena was sacked, and was replaced by Daniel Brailovsky. After finishing third in their group and sixth in the general standings, América played Morelia for the last spot in the playoffs, being beaten 3–0 in the first-leg, and winning 1–0 in the second-leg. With this, América was eliminated from the competition.

América also participated in the Copa Sudamericana, reaching the finals to play against Arsenal de Sarandí of Argentina. They would lose the first-leg at the Estadio Azteca by a 2–3 score, and win 2–1 in Argentina. The aggregate result was 4–4, but due to the away goals rule, Arsenal won the championship.

América finished 2007 ranked tenth in the IFFHS&#x27;s Club World Rankings, becoming the first Mexican club to reach the top ten.

====2008====
América started off 2008 winning the InterLiga tournament, defeating Cruz Azul 5–3 on penalties in the final following a 3–3 draw after 120 minutes, thus assuring qualification to the Copa Libertadores tournament that same year.

The Clausura tournament saw América end in next-to-last place in the general standings. This had not been seen since the mid-1950s. In the first five months of 2008, América was showered with twelve defeats, two draws and three victories, which resulted in the third-straight tournament without qualifying for the playoffs. The manager at the time was Rubén Omar Romano, who was one of the least successful coaches in the club&#x27;s history. Coincidentally, after being replaced by Juan Antonio Luna, América got their third victory of the Clausura against Monterrey. Despite their poor domestic form, América fared well in the Copa Libertadores, defeating Brazilian side Flamengo 3–0 in the round-of-16 at the Estádio do Maracanã, overturning a 2–4 first-leg deficit, and advancing to the quarter-finals. They defeated Santos FC to reach the semifinal stage of the tournament, being eliminated by eventual champions LDU Quito after drawing 1–1 on aggregate.

===2010s===
For the Apertura 2010, América brought back former manager Manuel Lapuente, who led the club to the league title in 2002. The return of striker Vicente Matías Vuoso and the signing of Uruguayan Vicente Sánchez gave América one of the most dangerous front lines in all of the league. They finished the tournament in first place of Group 2, fourth in the general standings, with 27 points. With this, they would advance to the playoffs, and automatically qualify for the first time since 2008 for the 2011 Copa Libertadores. They would be eliminated in the semi-finals by Santos Laguna by a 4–5 aggregate score.

América had a bad start to the Clausura 2011 tournament; a 0–2–1 record in the first three games the tournament led to the sacking of Lapuente. Carlos Reinoso was named his successor, who had already managed the club two times before. His first game was against Atlas, which América won 2–0. América ended the Clausura with an 8–1–5 record, and would be eliminated in the quarter-finals by Morelia. On 18 September 2011, Reinoso was sacked as manager, with Alfredo Tena taking over as interim-manager. América would finish the Apertura in 17th place, the second worse finish in the club&#x27;s history. On 8 November, Michel Bauer stepped down as president. That same day, former América player Ricardo Peláez was presented as Sporting President, while Yon De Luisa would be named Operations President. Miguel Herrera was presented as the club&#x27;s new manager, the fourth in a year. In his first year at the helm, Herrera brought the team to the semi-finals on two consecutive occasions.

On 26 May 2013, América won their eleventh league title by defeating Cruz Azul in the Clausura final 4–2 on penalties after a dramatic comeback from a 0–1 first-leg loss to win 2–1 in the second-leg, and tie 2–2 on aggregate, with goalkeeper Moisés Muñoz scoring the second goal in injury-time. With this, América tied Guadalajara for most league titles. For the Apertura 2013, América finished the regular phase of the tournament at the top of the standings with 37 points and would again appear in the league final, though failing to achieve a repeat, being defeated by León by an aggregate score of 1–5. On 17 December 2013, Antonio Mohamed was announced as América&#x27;s new manager for the Clausura 2014 tournament, replacing Miguel Herrera after two years in charge. América would finish fifth in the standings, and was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Santos Laguna due to the away-goals rule after drawing 6–6 on aggregate.

América finished the Apertura 2014 tournament at the top of the general standings with 31 points, and defeated UNAM and Monterrey in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. Prior to the league final, the club was marred in media speculation regarding the future of Antonio Mohamed (he ultimately admitted he would leave the club after the final) and the separation of Paul Aguilar from the team prior to the first-leg of the semi-finals. On 14 December, América won a record-twelfth league title after defeating Tigres UANL 3–1 on aggregate in the final, coming back from a 0–1 first-leg loss to win 3–0 in the second-leg at the Estadio Azteca. Three days after winning the final, América announced Gustavo Matosas as Mohamed&#x27;s successor, signing a two-year contract.

In April 2015, the club won its sixth CONCACAF Champions League title after defeating Montreal Impact in the finals by a 5–3 aggregate score. Despite inconsistent displays throughout the Clausura tournament, América managed to finish second in the standings, though was eliminated by Pachuca in the quarter-finals. Three days later, with various media reports suggesting Gustavo Matosas would be sacked due to differences with the board regarding transfer strategy, it was confirmed in a press conference which was attended by both Matosas and club president Ricardo Pelaéz that he would indeed leave after only six months in charge. On 26 May, Ignacio Ambríz was presented as the new manager, signing a two-year contract. América lost its FIFA Club World Cup quarter-final match to Chinese team Guangzhou Evergrande, and defeated African club TP Mazembe to claim fifth place in the competition.

In April 2016, América successfully defended the CONCACAF Champions League title after defeating Tigres UANL 4–1 on aggregate in the finals, and winning a record seventh continental title. América culminated the year with a fourth place finish at the Club World Cup and finishing runners-up in the Apertura championship match against Tigres UANL.

América won its record thirteenth league title following a 2–0 aggregate victory over Cruz Azul in the 2018 Apertura final. In April 2019, América defeated Ascenso MX side FC Juárez in the final of the Clausura edition of the Copa MX, winning a record sixth title. In winning the cup, América became the outright record holders of the Liga MX, Copa MX, and CONCACAF Champions League. The team followed this up by winning the 2019 Campeón de Campeones against Tigres UANL and reaching the 2019 Apertura finals, losing 4–2 on penalties to Monterrey.

===2020s===
América began the new decade by finishing third in the Apertura general standings before being eliminated by Guadalajara in the quarter-finals. They finished the following Clausura in second place, only to be eliminated once again in the quarter-final stage, this time against Pachuca. América led the table during the 2021 Apertura and faced elimination in the same phase again, losing 3–1 on aggregate to UNAM. From the 2022 Clausura onwards, América managed to qualify consecutively to the semi-finals, only to face eliminations against Pachuca, Toluca (2022 Apertura), and Guadalajara (2023 Clausura), respectively.

América ended the regular phase of the 2023 Apertura first in the standings, with the best attack and defensive records. They defeated León and Atlético San Luis in the quarter-final and semi-final, and beat Tigres UANL 4–1 on aggregate to win a record-extending 14th title and end the club&#x27;s five-year league drought. América successfully defended the title after defeating Cruz Azul in the 2024 Clausura finals, winning back-to-back Liga MX titles for the first time in club history since the introduction of the playoff format, and the fourth club to do so under such format. They also became the first team to achieve this feat having topped the standings of both Apertura and Clausura championships.

== Crest and colors ==
=== Crest ===
When Club América was founded in 1916, the crest consisted of the letter &#x27;C&#x27;, standing for &quot;Club&quot;, overlapped by an &#x27;A&#x27;, which stood for &quot;América&quot;. After a brief period in which the team&#x27;s name was changed to Club Unión, it was reverted to Club América in the mid-1920s, and the crest was modified, with a map of the Americas behind the &#x27;CA&#x27;, and encased in a football, all in the team&#x27;s colors – which were cream and blue. Since then, the design of the crest has seen minimal change; at the beginning of the 21st century, the vertical line at the crest&#x27;s center was removed. During the early 1980s, the crest was surrounded by an image of an eagle (due to the club&#x27;s nickname), and was even enclosed in a triangle. The most recent modification of the crest was in 2010, with the yellow and blue more vibrant and a darker outline and border.

=== Colors ===

Club founder Rafael Garza Gutiérrez chose what would be América&#x27;s first uniform. He took some of his father&#x27;s navy blue trousers and a yellow-cream shirt and it was decided amongst the other players that those would be the club&#x27;s colors. The club&#x27;s kit design would go largely unchanged, and it would not be until the 1980s that the team colors changed, with the cream color replaced with a more vibrant yellow and blue, along with the introduction of the inverted triangle design on the shirt in 1982. A third, alternate white and blue shirt was introduced towards the end of the decade, but it was not worn frequently.

During the Apertura 2011 tournament – what was the club&#x27;s 95th anniversary – a commemorative jersey was unveiled paying homage to the original uniform, as well as an altered crest. The uniform was used during the &quot;Súper Clásico&quot; match against Guadalajara.

In May 2016, as part of the club&#x27;s centenary, a dark red away kit was revealed honouring Italian club Torino, who functioned as the club&#x27;s first opponent at the Estadio Azteca in the 1966 inaugural match.

== Nicknames ==
Throughout Club América&#x27;s history, it has been given a number of nicknames. During the club&#x27;s early years it was given the nickname &quot;Estudiantes&quot; (Students), because it had been established as a result of a merger of students from the colleges of &quot;Mascarones&quot; and &quot;La Perpetua&quot;. They were also given the nicknames &quot;Cremas&quot; (Creams) and &quot;Azul-cremas&quot; (Blue-creams) in reference to the kit colors. During the 1960s, following businessman Emilio Azcárraga Milmo&#x27;s purchase of Club América, it was given its infamous &quot;Millonetas&quot; (Millionaires) nickname. In an effort to change the fortunes of the club which for years had been struggling financially and was suffering a five-year trophy-less drought, Azcárraga Milmo prioritized high-profile signings of foreign players and executives, notably hiring Guillermo Cañedo de la Bárcena, the successful president of Zacatepec. The &quot;Águilas&quot; (Eagles) nickname was the result of a rebranding and media campaign undertaken by Televisa in 1981. Along with a new kit and color scheme, the &quot;Águilas&quot; nickname was introduced at a press conference held by the club at the Estadio Azteca.

== Grounds ==


América plays its home games at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The stadium was designed by Mexican architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, and was inaugurated on 29 May 1966 with a match between América and Torino, which was tied 2–2. The first goal was scored was by Brazilian Arlindo Dos Santos and the second by José Alves. Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, President of Mexico, made the initial kick and Sir Stanley Rous, FIFA President, was the witness.

The club has shared the stadium as a home ground with the Mexico national football team since its inauguration. Other club sides have also used the stadium as their home at different times, namely Necaxa (1966–70 and 1982–2003), Atlante (1966–82, 1996–2001 and 2004–2007), Universidad Nacional (1967–1969), Atlético Español (1970–1982) and Cruz Azul (1971–1996 and 2018-2023).

As well as acting as a home ground the stadium has also hosted the 1968 Summer Olympics, 1970 FIFA World Cup, 1975 Pan American Games, 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship, 1986 FIFA World Cup, 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup Final, Copa Interamericana, Copa Libertadores de América, music concerts, political events and the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1999.

The rivalry between Club América and Club Universidad Nacional is known as the &quot;Clásico Capitalino&quot;, due to the fact that both teams are based in Mexico City—the country&#x27;s capital. The first match between the two clubs took place on 1 July 1962, where América hosted UNAM, who had recently been promoted from the second division. In Mexico the match is often perceived as the representation of a struggle between two antagonistic powers and institutions: Club América is regarded as the club representing the establishment and the wealthy. The fact that the club is owned by the mass media company Televisa has further intensified this image. Club Universidad, representing the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, identifies itself as the club of the intellectuals and middle-class. The rivalry is particularly fierce from UNAM&#x27;s side: according to surveys the majority of their supporters consider América as their main rival. However, America&#x27;s fans see it as an important match but deem the match against Chivas as more important.

===&quot;Clásico Joven&quot;===

Club América&#x27;s other capital-based rival is Cruz Azul, with matches between the two known as the &quot;Clásico Joven&quot; (&quot;Juvenile Classic&quot; in Spanish). In a similar perspective between América and UNAM&#x27;s rivalry, the rivalry between América and Cruz Azul is also seen as based on social class differences: América representing the wealthy and powerful while Cruz Azul is said to represent the working class, hence fans of Cruz Azul and the team itself being dubiously referred to by the nickname of &quot;Los Albañiles&quot; (&quot;bricklayers&quot; in Spanish), a reference to Cruz Azul&#x27;s eponymous parent company, which is one of Mexico&#x27;s major companies specializing in concrete and construction.

==Support==
Club América has consistently ranked, along with rivals Guadalajara, as Mexico&#x27;s most supported team. In December 2013, the newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot; had América as the country&#x27;s most popular club with 25 percent in a nationwide survey, and the most popular in Mexico City. In a February 2015 poll conducted by the firm &quot;Consulta Mitofsky&quot;, América was named the most popular club with 31.1 percent of the population being supporters, more than rivals Guadalajara (17.9) and Cruz Azul (12.7) combined. In 2016 and 2017 America was the country&#x27;s most supported team, and in 2018 fell to second behind Guadalajara. In 2019 América regained the top spot with 32 percent, doubling the amount of Guadalajara supporters for the first time. As of 2021, América ranks first as Mexico&#x27;s most popular team with 23.9 percent. Its extensive fan base also makes Club América among the most followed teams on social media, ranking third in all of Latin America behind only Brazilian sides Flamengo and Corinthians. Additionally, it generates the most social media interactions in Mexico, and among the most in Latin America.

América is also among the most popular teams in the United States. According to a 2020 survey by Gilt Edge Soccer Marketing, América is the ninth most popular team in the U.S., the only non-European in the top ten, and the only one from Latin America. Also, a 2014 study conducted by EuroAmericas Sports Marketing ranked América as the most popular Mexican club in Asia.

Conversely, América is the most hated team in Mexico, ranking first in that metric in every annual survey.
Ever since the club was bought by media mogul Emilio Azcárraga Milmo from Issac Bessudo in 1959, the club has had the unique distinction of being both one of the most popular clubs and the most hated. An emphasis on heavy spending on Mexican and foreign players and managers in subsequent seasons, as well as success in domestic and international competitions, created an increasing sense of enmity from rival fans. The fact that Azcárraga Milmo was also the owner of telecommunications company Telesistema Mexicano furthered the notion that América was the club of the &quot;establishment&quot; and the &quot;wealthy&quot;, while others were considered teams representing the &quot;working class&quot;. Being reputed as the most hated club in the country has been embraced by the club and its fans, with the phrase &quot;Ódiame Más&quot; (&quot;Hate me more&quot; in English) being known as one of the team&#x27;s unofficial slogans.

Three Club América supporters&#x27; groups (&quot;barra bravas&quot; in Spanish) exist: &quot;La Monumental&quot;, &quot;Disturbio&quot;, and &quot;Ritual del Kaos&quot;. &quot;La Monumental&quot; was established in April 1999 as the first &quot;barra brava&quot; officially recognized by the club, however internal conflicts led some members to leave the group and establish &quot;Ritual del Kaos&quot; that same year. The group is not officially recognized by Club América. &quot;Disturbio&quot; was created in October 2000 as an affiliate group of &quot;La Monumental&quot;. Both groups occupy a section of the lower north zone of the Estadio Azteca during home games, while &quot;Ritual&quot; occupies a section in the upper north zone.

<doc id="1025921" wikidata="Q3912956" url="?curid=1025921" title="Maqta'">
<text>In Persian, Turkic and Urdu poetry, the maqta″ (from Arabic ; ; ; ; ; ) is the final &quot;bayt&quot;, or couplet, of a &quot;ghazal&quot;. In this sense, it is the opposite of the &quot;matla&#x27;&quot;. The poet&#x27;s &quot;takhallus&quot;, or pen name, is usually employed in the &quot;maqta″&quot;, often in very creative ways.

A &quot;shayar&quot; can use the &quot;maqta″&quot; in a variety of interesting ways. He can &quot;talk to himself&quot;, &quot;to somebody else&quot;, &quot;refer to something&quot; etc. For example &quot;Firaq&quot; Gorakhpuri, whose &quot;takhallus&quot; is the word for the common theme in Urdu poetry of the state of pining for the beloved, plays on his pen name and the word &quot;firaq&quot;:

Urdu:

تو یہ نہ سمجھنا کے فِراق تیری فِراق میں ہیں

فِراق اُسکی فِراق میں ہہ جو تیری فِراق میں ہہ

Roman Urdu:
:&quot;Tu yeh na samajh ke Firaq teri Firaq mein hai&quot;
:&quot;Firaq uski Firaq mein hai jo teri Firaq mein hai&quot;

English Translation:
:Don&#x27;t think that Firaq pines for you
:Firaq pines for the one who pines for you

== Examples ==
A sher by Mir Taqi Mir:

Mir in neem baaz aankhon mein

Saari masti sharaab ki see hai

Another by Mirza Ghalib:

Kaba kis munh se jaaoge Ghalib

sharm tum ko magar nahiN aati

Another by Nasir kazmi:

Itefaqaat zamaana bhi ajab hai Nasir

Aaj woh dekh rahe hai, ko suna karte the

<doc id="1025929" wikidata="Q12068685" url="?curid=1025929" title="Selwyn, New Zealand">
<text>Selwyn is a village in the Selwyn District of Canterbury, New Zealand. It was laid out in the 1860s for a population of 2,000 people, but it currently has very few houses.

==Naming==
Captain Joseph Thomas, the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, named the Selwyn River after Bishop Selwyn, New Zealand&#x27;s first Anglican Bishop. This township, the district and an electorate later used the same name.

==Geography and transport==
Selwyn is located just south of the Selwyn River / Waikirikiri and is prone to occasional flooding. It was established around the rail corridor of the Main South Line that was planned in the 1860s. The railway first reached the township in 1867. Most of the time, the river can be forded, and the road bridge was not built until 1927. Its successor bridge now carries State Highway 1 traffic, which crosses the railway line in Selwyn; initially, two right angle bends were provided, later to be replaced by a sweeping S-bend.

Selwyn is south-west of Christchurch, and north-east of Dunsandel.

==History==
Albert Beetham was an engineer and surveyor from Christchurch. Aware of the plans for the Main South railway, Beetham bought a piece of land on either side of the gazetted corridor approximately in size. He subdivided it into 470 s for a target population of 2,000 and provided two town squares, Victoria Square and Market Square.

The railway reached Rolleston in October 1866, the north bank of the Selwyn River on 7 October 1867, and Selwyn Station via a bridge over the Selwyn River on 16 December 1867. This original bridge, though, was destroyed in a flood on 4 February 1868. Brickwork piers used for the original bridge were replaced by piles in the reconstruction. Due to financial problems of the Canterbury Provincial Council, Selwyn remained the terminus of the line for some years.

For a time, the demand for sections in Selwyn was brisk, and even speculators started buying some of them. At one point, Selwyn had a blacksmith, bootmaker, butcher, saddler, and a wheelwright, and amenities included a boarding house, billiard saloon, a hotel with stables, and some shops. The railway yards were a depot for construction works undertaken by the Provincial Council.

Selwyn&#x27;s importance waned when the railway reached the south bank of the Rakaia River, where the township of Rakaia formed. The Rakaia River Bridge was formally opened by the provincial Superintendent, William Rolleston, on 29 May 1873.

A far greater problem was ongoing flooding, though. Many residents left Selwyn for the neighbouring township of Dunsandel. Even the hotel itself was, in about 1900, shifted to Dunsandel. Today, Selwyn has fewer than ten houses, with many derelict cottages still visible. Selwyn celebrated its 150th birthday in September 2012.

<doc id="1025934" wikidata="Q4115548" url="?curid=1025934" title="Bahr (poetry)">
<text>A baḥr (from Arabic , ; ; ; ; ; ) means a meter in Arabic, Persian, Turkic and Urdu poetry. Essentially, &quot;bahr&quot; is a specific pattern, combining the &quot;arkaan&quot; of Urdu prosody that define the &quot;length&quot; of a &quot;sher&quot;. However, generally &quot;bahr&quot; is categorized in three classes: Short, medium, long, depending upon the length of the &quot;sher&quot; of the &quot;ghazal&quot;.

For a &quot;ghazal&quot;, since all the &quot;shers&quot; in it should be of the same &quot;bahr&quot;, determining the &quot;bahr&quot; of one &quot;sher&quot; (or even one line of the &quot;sher&quot;) is enough to determine the &quot;bahr&quot; of the entire &quot;ghazal&quot;. For example, in this &quot;ghazal&quot; of Ghalib, the length and meter of the ashaar is same throughout. In terms of the European method of scansion, the metre can be written as follows (where &quot;x&quot; = long or short, &quot;u&quot; = short, &quot;–&quot; = long, &quot;u u&quot; = one long or two short syllables):

:x u – – u – u – u u –

:&quot;koii ummiid bar nahiin aatii&quot;
:&quot;koii suurat nazar nahiin aatii &quot;

:&quot;aage aatii thii haal-e-dil pe hansii &quot;
:&quot;ab kisii baat par nahiin aatii &quot;

:&quot;jaanataa huun savaab-e-taa&#x27;at-o-zahad&quot;
:&quot;par tabiiyat idhar nahiin aatii &quot;

:&quot;hai kuchh aisii hii baat jo chup huun&quot;
:&quot;varna kyaa baat kar nahiin aatii &quot;

:&quot;kaabaa kis muunh se jaaoge &#x27;Ghaalib&quot;&#x27;
:&quot;sharm tumako magar nahiin aatii&quot;

The ghazal above is written in a bahr called: &quot;khafiif musaddas makhbuun mahzuuf maqtu&quot; (Meter G8). This is a ten-syllable bahr and by the standards of Urdu poetry, is a &quot;chotii&quot; (small) bahr.

As with the scansion of Persian poetry, a syllable such as &quot;miid&quot; or &quot;baat&quot; consisting of a long vowel plus consonant, or &quot;sharm&quot; consisting of a short vowel and two consonants, is &quot;overlong&quot;, and counts as a long syllable + a short one.

In Urdu prosody, unlike Persian, any final long vowel can be shortened as the metre requires, for example, in the word &quot;kaabaa&quot; in the last verse above.

== Taqti ==
Taqti is the process of breaking down words of all verses of a &quot;ghazal&quot; or a poem into fundamental syllables, calculating their weights (&quot;vazn&quot;), and checking if all verses have a consistent meter. For example, the word &quot;jaanisaar&quot; can be broken down into four syllables: &quot;jaa&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, &quot;saa&quot; and &quot;r&quot;. The weight of &quot;jaa&quot; is 2, &quot;ni&quot; is 1, &quot;saa&quot; is 2 and &quot;r&quot; is 1, thus making the weight of the word &quot;jaanisaar&quot; 2121. Rekhta has developed a free online tool (Rekhta Taqti) that can be used to identify the &quot;bahr&quot; of any given &quot;ghazal&quot; or &quot;sher&quot;.

== Types of bahr ==
There exist many bahrs, but mainly there are 19 bahrs used in Urdu poetry. These bahrs are further distributed in different types, but they are not described here. The names are:

* baHr-e-rajaz
* baHr-e-ramal
* baHr-e-baseet 
* baHr-e-taweel 
* baHr-e-kaamil
* baHr-e-mutadaarik
* baHr-e-hazaj 
* baHr-e-mushaakil 
* baHr-e-madeed 
* baHr-e-mutaqaarib 
* baHr-e-mujtas 
* baHr-e-muZaara
* baHr-e-munsareH 
* baHr-e-waafer 
* baHr-e-qareeb 
* baHr-e-saree 
* baHr-e-khafeef 
* baHr-e-jadeed 
* baHr-e-muqtaZeb

<text>Lough Derg, historically Lough Dergart (), is a freshwater lake in the Shannon River Basin, Ireland. It is the third-biggest on the island of Ireland (after Lough Neagh and Lough Corrib) and the second largest lake in the Republic of Ireland.

It is a long, narrow lake, with shores in counties Clare (south-west), Galway (north-west), and Tipperary (to the east). It is the southernmost of three large lakes on the River Shannon; the others being Lough Ree and Lough Allen. Towns and villages on Lough Derg include Portumna, Killaloe &amp; Ballina, Dromineer, Terryglass, Mountshannon and Garrykennedy.

The lake&#x27;s name evolved from the Irish &quot;Loch Deirgdheirc&quot;. This was one of the names of The Dagda, the father of gods and men in Irish mythology, and literally means &quot;red eye&quot;.

Lough Derg has many islands including Inis Cealtra or Holy Island.

==Geography==
At its deepest, the lake is deep and covers an area of . Close downstream from where Lough Derg empties into the Shannon are the falls of Doonass, the largest fall on the otherwise gently sloping river. Nearby is the location of the hydroelectric power plant at Ardnacrusha, which, when built in 1927 was the world&#x27;s largest.

==Usage==
In the nineteenth century, Lough Derg was an important artery from the port at Limerick to Dublin through the canals in the midlands of Ireland. Navigable over its full length, Lough Derg is today popular with cruisers and other pleasure craft, as well as sailing and fishing. The University of Limerick has an activity centre by the lake, just north of Killaloe, where there are canoes, kayaks, windsurfing, sailing dingies, and other recreations.

Lough Derg is home to an RNLI Lifeboat which is based at Dromineer, the first inland station in Ireland. In June 2013, 35 people were brought to safety when a major rescue effort was undertaken after an international rowing event was hit by severe weather.

Dublin City Council published a plan in 2011 for a pipeline to supply up to 350 million litres of water a day from Lough Derg to Dublin city and region. In 2016 the Parteen Basin at the south of lough was chosen as the proposed site of extraction. Water would be pumped to a break pressure tank at Knockanacree near Cloughjordan in County Tipperary and gravity fed from there to Dublin.

==Ecology==
A breeding pair of white-tailed eagles first nested on an island in Lough Derg in 2012. This marked a great success for the Irish reintroduction programme started in the summer of 2007.

&quot;Nitellopsis obtusa&quot;, an invasive alga in the family Characeae (stoneworts), was first recorded in Ireland in this lough in 2016. 
In 2021, invasive quagga mussels were discovered in the lake and in Lough Ree by a research team from UCD.

The North-East Shore is listed as a Special Area of Conservation.

<text>Sukkur (; ) is a city in the Pakistani province of Sindh along the western bank of the Indus River, directly across from the historic city of Rohri. Sukkur is the third largest city in Sindh after Karachi and Hyderabad, and 14th largest city of Pakistan by population. The city was originally founded by the Rai dynasty of Sindh. The modern city was built in the 1840s. New Sukkur was established during the British era alongside the village of Sukkur. Sukkur&#x27;s hill, along with the hill on the river island of Bukkur, form what is sometimes considered the &quot;Gate of Sindh&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name Sukkur is derived from the Sindhi language word sakhar meaning &#x27;superior&#x27;.

== History ==
The region around Sukkur has been inhabited for millennia. The ruins of Lakhan-jo-daro, located near an industrial park on the outskirts of Sukkur, date from the Mature Harappan period of the Indus Valley Civilization, between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE covers more than 300 Hectares of area and is touted to be second largest city of the Indus Valley Civilization just 75 Kilometers away from another major city of Indus Valley Civilization, Mohenjo Daro

By the 12th Century Rohri and Sukkur had been incorporated in dominion of the Bhati Rajputs. 
&quot;Old Sukkur&quot; was initially a small village prior to the establishment of a military garrison in 1839. Sukkur was built on a low limestone ridge on the banks of the Indus River. The city was once surrounded by groves of date palms that were traditionally believed to have grown from the discarded date-pits from Arab invaders in the 8th century.
The village of Sukkur was directly across from the larger town of Rohri, which served as a busy port along the Indus by the 1200s, and was a major trading centre for agricultural produce. An tall minaret was built at Sukkur&#x27;s shrine of Mir Masum Shah in 1607.

=== British ===
Modern Sukkur, or New Sukkur, was built during British rule alongside what was once a small village directly across from the historic city of Rohri. The British established a military garrison here in 1839, which was abandoned in 1845, though Sukkur continued to grow in importance as a trading center. The Sukkur Municipality was constituted in 1862.

Completed in 1889, Sukkur&#x27;s Lansdowne Bridge connects the Sukkur to Rohri across the Indus, and was one of the first bridges to cross the river. The bridge made the journey between Karachi and Multan easier. The bridge was built with two large pylons rather than a series of pillars extending across the river – a cutting-edge design for such an expansive span. The bridge was also made of metal, and features an unusual design.

Sukkur Barrage (formerly called Lloyd Barrage), built under the British Raj on the Indus River, controls one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. It was designed by Sir Arnold Musto KCIE, and constructed under the overall direction of Sir Charlton Harrison between 1923 and 1932. The long barrage is made of yellow stone and steel and can water nearly 10 million acres (40,000 km2) of farmland through its seven large canals.

On the eve of the Partition of British India in 1947, Sukkur&#x27;s old town was home to about 10,000 residents, while New Sukkur was home to 80,000.

===Modern===
After the formation of Pakistan most of the city&#x27;s Hindu population migrated to India, though like much of Sindh, Sukkur did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal. According to the 1941 census, about 70% of the population of Sukkur was Hindu, this number decreased to 2% by the 1951 census as a result of the partition. However, less than 500 Hindus were killed in all of Sindh between 1947 and 1948 as Sindhi Muslims largely resisted calls to turn against their Hindu neighbours. Hindus did not flee Sukkur &quot;en masse&quot; until riots erupted in Karachi on 6 January 1948, which sowed fear in Sindh&#x27;s Hindus despite the fact that the riots were local and related to Sikh refugees from Punjab seeking refuge in Karachi. Muslim refugees from India settled in Sukkur.

The Sindh Industrial Trading Estate in Sukkur was established in 1950. The Ayub Bridge was built in 1962, and spans the Indus River alongside the British-era Landsdowne Bridge. The city suffered major flooding during the 2010 Pakistan floods which inundated large parts of the city.

==Geography==
The small Eocene limestone outcropping upon which Sukkur was founded is the most significant land deformation on the vast plains along the Indus Valley in Sindh and Punjab. The outcropping is part of the &quot;Jacobabad-Khairpur High&quot; and Rohri Hills. The outcropping, along with the similar outcropping on Bukkar Island are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sukkur Gorge,&quot; and has historically served as the traditional northern boundary of Sindh.
==Climate==
Sukkur has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), characterised by extremely hot and hazy summers with mild and foggy winters. Sukkur is known for its extremely hot summers, and was described as the hottest city in British India. Wind speed is low throughout the year, and sunshine is abundant. Summer temperatures regularly surpass . Dry heat is experienced starting April to early June until the Monsoon season starts to arrive. Monsoons in Sukkur are not very wet, but bring high dew points, resulting in high heat indices. Monsoons recede by September, but it is not until late October that the short lived autumn season is experienced before the onset of the region&#x27;s cool winters. The average annual rainfall of Sukkur is and mainly occurs in the monsoon season. The highest annual rainfall ever is , recorded in 2022 and the lowest annual rainfall ever is 0 mm in 1941.

==Demography==
Sukkur is the third largest city in Sindh after Karachi and Hyderabad. The population of Sukkur is 551,357 according to the 2017 Census of Pakistan. Around 70% of the population speaks Sindhi natively, while 20% of the population speaks Urdu natively. Roughly 96% of the city is Muslim, while the remaining 4% comprise other minorities, overwhelmingly Hindus.

==Economy==
Sukkur&#x27;s economy is largely reliant upon the agricultural produce from northern Sindh&#x27;s farms, and serves as a trading and processing center for agricultural goods. The city also once had a bustling shipbuilding industry.

Sukkur is well-connected to the rest of Pakistan by road and rail, which in turn has attracted new industries such as chemical manufacturing, metalworking, and cement manufacturing.

===Agriculture===
Sukkur had a large fertile and cultivable land area. During &quot;kharif&quot;, rice, bajra, cotton, tomatoes and peas are cultivated; whereas during &quot;rabi&quot; the main crops are wheat, barley, graham and melons. Sukkur is famous, world over, for its dates. Sukkur also has a large Riveraine forest along the course of the Indus. These tropical forests are found within the protective embankments on either side of the Indus. During 1997–98 the total area under forests was which yielded of timber and of firewood besides other mine products.

==Transportation==
===Road===
The city is connected to Multan by M-5 motorway, with onwards motorway connections to Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. Sukkur will also be connected to Hyderabad by the M-6 motorway, with onwards connections to Karachi via the M-9 motorway. The M-5 is ready whereas the M-6 is being built as part of the wider China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

===Rail===
Sukkur railway station serves as the city&#x27;s main rail station. Passenger services are provided exclusively by Pakistan Railways. The city&#x27;s station is serviced by the Jaffar Express that runs between Rawalpindi and Quetta, the Sukkur Express that runs between Karachi and Jacobabad, and the Akbar Express that runs between Quetta and Peshawar.

===Air===
Sukkur Airport, located 8 km outside of the city, is served by Pakistan International Airlines, with direct flights to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

==Administration==
The city of Sukkur is the capital of Sukkur Division and Sukkur District. Sukkur District has four Tehsils (Talukas) and many Union Councils. Sukkur is home to one of three circuit benches of the Sindh High Court.

==Education==

The Sukkur IBA University (&quot;previously&quot; Sukkur Institute of Business Administration or Sukkur IBA) is a business school founded in 1994. The institute is ranked 3rd among the five independent business schools of Pakistan included in the Higher Education Commission Pakistan Business School Ranking 2013.

<doc id="1025941" wikidata="Q1140527" url="?curid=1025941" title="Emergency exit">
<text>An emergency exit in a building or other structure is a special exit used during emergencies such as fires. The combined use of regular and emergency exits allows for faster evacuation, and emergency exits provide alternative means of evacuation if regular exits are inaccessible.

Emergency exits must:
* Be clearly marked (usually with signage that is normally illuminated, or is illuminated by a backup power source if central power fails)
* Be in easily-accessible locations
* Direct people to safe areas (usually outside)
* Be regularly maintained and free of obstructions (they may not be used for storage)
* Be secured to prevent unauthorized entry during normal operations

An emergency exit&#x27;s path usually ends in an outward-opening door with a crash bar with exit signs pointing to it. It is usually a door to an area outside of the building, but may also lead to an adjoining, fire-isolated structure with clear exits of its own. 

A fire escape is a special kind of emergency exit consisting of stairs and/or extendable ladders mounted on the outside of a building.

==Buildings==

Local building codes or building regulations often dictate the number of fire exits required for a building of a given size, including the number of stairwells. For any buildings bigger than a private house, modern codes invariably specify at least two sets of stairs, completely isolated from each other so that if one becomes impassable due to smoke or flames, the other remains usable. 

The traditional way to satisfy this requirement was to construct two separate stairwell stacks, each occupying its own footprint within each floorplan. Each stairwell is internally configured into an arrangement often called a &quot;U-return&quot; or &quot;return&quot; design. The two stairwells may be constructed next to each other, separated by a fireproof partition, or optionally the two stairwells may be located at some distance from each other within the floorplan. The traditional arrangement has the advantage of being easily understood by building occupants and occasional visitors.

Some architects save space while still meeting the exit requirement, by housing two stairwells in a &quot;double helix&quot; or &quot;scissors stairs&quot; configuration whereby two stairwells occupy the same floor footprint, but are intertwined while being separated by fireproof partitions along their entire run. However, this design deposits anybody descending the stack into alternating locations on each successive floor, and this can be very disorienting. Some building codes recommend using a color-coded stripe and signage to distinguish otherwise identical-looking stairwells from each other, and to make following a quick exit path easier.

In older buildings that predate modern fire codes, and which lack space for a second stairwell, having intertwining stairs so close to each other may not allow firefighters going up and evacuees going down to use separate stairways. 

For example, Westfield Stratford City uses a scissors stairway configuration in its upper car park. This part of the building has eight storeys: LG, G, and 1 are part of the shopping centre; 2 has some offices and a storage area; CP1, CP2, CP3, and CP4 are a multi-storey car park. The floors are served by the main public lifts and escalators, and by 1 set of a double-helix stairway and lift per , going into the service areas. The main public escalators do not count as fire exits, as the doors may be locked during less busy periods. The building has one fire exit per of floor space.

Knowing the location of emergency exits in buildings can save lives. Some buildings, such as schools, have fire drills to practice using emergency exits. Many disasters could have been prevented if people had known where fire escapes were and if emergency exits had not been blocked. For example, in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, some of the emergency exits inside the building were inaccessible, while others were locked. In the Stardust Disaster and the 2006 Moscow hospital fire, the emergency exits were locked and most windows barred shut. In the case of the Station Nightclub, the premises were over capacity the night fire broke out, the front exit was not designed well (right outside the door, the concrete approach split 90 degrees and a railing ran along the edge), and an emergency exit swung inward, not outward as code requires.

In many countries, it is required that all new commercial buildings include well-marked emergency exits. Some older buildings must be retrofitted with fire escapes. In countries where emergency exits are not standard, or the standards are not enforced, fires will often result in a much greater loss of life.

===Signage===

The UK Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996 define a fire safety sign as an illuminated sign or acoustic signal that provides information on escape routes and emergency exits. Well-designed emergency exit signs are necessary for emergency exits to be effective.

Fire escape signs usually display the word &quot;EXIT&quot; or the equivalent word in the local language with large, well-lit, green letters, or the green pictorial &quot;running-man&quot; symbol developed and adopted in Japan around 1980 and introduced in 2003 by ISO 7010. Pictorial green &quot;running-man&quot; sign is mandatory in Japan, European Union, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and increasingly becoming common elsewhere.

Some states in the United States currently require the exit signs to be colored red, despite the usage of color red in signage usually implies hazards, prohibited actions or stop, while the color green implies safe place/actions or to proceed. Older building code in Canada required red exit signs, but no new installation is allowed.

===Emergency door release===

An emergency door release call point (or a pull station in the United States) is used to disengage locking devices such as electromagnets, bolt locks, and electric locks while also ensuring positive security and failsafe operation.

==Nightclubs, restaurants, and similar venues==
Worldwide, there have been repeated mass casualties in nightclubs and related venues where large numbers of people may gather. A violent personal dispute, fire, terrorist attack, or other incident can cause a mass panic or stampede for the exits. If the exits are blocked, locked, hidden, or inadequate, large numbers of casualties and deaths can result. The 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston caused over 400 deaths from a flash fire in a blacked-out nightclub with only a single obvious exit through a revolving door. Building codes and life safety regulations were extensively reformed in the US in the following years, and influenced changes in many other countries as well.

However, mass casualty incidents still occur in the US and elsewhere in the world, due to inadequate enforcement of safety rules. For a list of some of the most notable incidents, see .

==Blocked exits==
Firefighters have cited overzealous security guards who told people during a fire that they are not allowed to use emergency exits. The practice is actually quite common in the absence of fires, as well. Some skyscrapers have stairwells with standard emergency exit signs on each door, which then lock upon closing. Users of these stairwells can get trapped if they do not know that the only door that opens from the inside is the one on the ground floor.

A further problem becoming very common in the US is that retail stores at night close one of their main entrance/exits through makeshift heavy metal barriers, signage, paper notes, or junk placed in front of the exits. Some actually lock their exits. A large array of signage and mechanical exit systems have also been devised, including signage that says contradictorily, &quot;This is not an exit&quot;, &quot;Do not use this exit&quot;, or warning users that a heavy penalty will be assessed for non-emergency use.

Some systems do not allow the exit to be opened until the user signals the intention to exit (through a button or lever) for some amount of time, such as 20 seconds. It is also common for these exits to remain completely locked until somebody tests them.

Some have alarms activated when they are opened, to alert staff of unauthorized use during non-emergencies. On many exits, the user may have to push against a crash bar or other door opening device for a period of time to unlock the door. Many exits have a sign reading, &quot;Emergency exit only, alarm will sound if opened&quot;, to warn of the fact that it is an emergency exit only.

==Aircraft==
In aircraft terms, an &quot;exit&quot; is any one of the main doors (entry doors on the port side of the aircraft and service doors on the starboard side) and an &quot;emergency exit&quot; is defined as an exit that is only ever used in an emergency (such as overwing exits and permanently-armed exits). 

In the early years, the emergency exit was a hatch in the ceiling of the aircraft. Because in the 1928 KLM Fokker F.III Waalhaven crash the passengers didn&#x27;t know the location of this emergency exit, one passenger couldn&#x27;t escape in time and died. As a result, better visibility of the emergency exit inside the cabin was advised by the investigative committee.

Passengers seated in exit rows may be called upon to assist and open exits in the event of an emergency.

The number and type of exits on an aircraft is regulated through strict rules within the industry, and is based on whether the aircraft is single or twin-aisled; the maximum passenger load; and the maximum distance from a seat to an exit. The goal of these regulations is to make possible the evacuation of an airliner&#x27;s designed maximum occupancy of passengers and crew within 90 seconds even if half of the available exits are blocked.

Any aircraft where the emergency exit door sill height is above that which would make unaided escape possible is fitted with an automatic inflatable evacuation slide, which allows occupants to slide to the ground safely.
† 9 passenger aircraft only

Ventral exits must allow the same rate of egress as a Type I exit, tailcone exit are aft of the fuselage.
Aircraft for less than 19 passenger must have one sufficient exit in each side of the fuselage, two per side for more, no more than apart from each other.

In November 2019, the EASA allowed &quot;Type-A+&quot; exits with a dual-lane evacuation slide to increase maximum accommodation increased to 480 seats up from 440 with four pairs of doors on the A350-1000, and up to 460 on the A330-900.

==History==

Following the events of the Victoria Hall disaster in Sunderland, England, in 1883 in which more than 180 children died because a door had been bolted at the bottom of a stairwell, the British government began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum numbers of outward opening emergency exits as well as locks which could be opened from the inside.

These moves were not globally copied for some time. For example, in the United States, 146 factory workers died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 when they were stopped by locked exits, and 492 people died in the Cocoanut Grove fire in a Boston nightclub in 1942. This led to regulations requiring that exits of large buildings open outward, and that enough emergency exits be provided to accommodate the building&#x27;s capacity.

Similar disasters around the world also resulted in public fury and calls for changes to emergency regulations and enforcement. An investigation was launched by the Argentine federal government after 194 people were killed during the 2004 República Cromañón nightclub fire in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The emergency exits had been chained shut by the owners, to prevent people from sneaking into the nightclub without paying.

<text>Yahoo! Native (formerly known as Yahoo! Advertising, Yahoo! Search Marketing and Yahoo! Gemini) is a native &quot;Pay per click&quot; Internet advertising service provided by Yahoo.

Yahoo began offering this service after acquiring Overture Services, Inc. The current offering of Yahoo Native launched in 2014 as Yahoo! Gemini. It handles advertising for both Yahoo and AOL properties, as well as other media outlets.

== History ==

===GoTo and Overture===

GoTo (not to be confused with Go.com or Go2Net) was an Idealab spin off and was the first company to successfully provide a pay-for-placement search service. It started off with the purchase of World Wide Web Worm (WWWW), one of the oldest search engines. GoTo is considered to have been an influential pioneer of paid search.

In February 1998, GoTo offered advertisers the option of bidding on how much they would be willing to pay to appear at the top of results in response to specific searches. The bid amount was paid by the advertiser to GoTo every time a searcher clicked on a link to the advertiser&#x27;s website. By July 1998, advertisers were paying anything up to a dollar per click. In June 1999, GoTo launched a tool set &quot;direct traffic centre&quot; (dtc) to enable advertisers access to keywords and real time bidding.

GoTo&#x27;s business model was based on the idea that its paid listings would make it more relevant than other services, especially for general searches, and web sites that pay more are probably better sites. A similar service had been offered by Open Text in 1996, but this precipitated outcries and bad publicity because searchers at the time did not want the search process more commercialized.

In contrast, GoTo&#x27;s pay-for-placement model was very successful. Commenters theorized that the Internet had matured in the intervening two years, and this type of economic models were more acceptable since the web was no longer just a place for academic research, but also a place for buying products. GoTo founder Bill Gross speculated at the launch that GoTo would succeed because, as a relatively new service, it had no reputation to taint with paid listings, unlike Open Text.

On October 8, 2001, GoTo renamed itself Overture Services, Inc. GoTo&#x27;s chief operating officer Jaynie Studenmund, mother of fallen U.S. soldier Scott Studenmund, said, &quot;We also felt it was a sophisticated enough name, in case our products expand.&quot;

Through partnerships, Overture enabled portals such as MSN and Yahoo to monetize the hundreds of millions of web searches made each day on their sites. Indeed, these partnerships proved highly lucrative, and in a period otherwise marked by dot-com failures, Overture became a substantial profit driver for portals like Yahoo

This success enabled Overture to acquire web sites such as AltaVista and AlltheWeb.

===Acquisition of Overture by Yahoo!===
On October 7, 2003, Overture was acquired by its biggest customer, Yahoo!, for $1.63 billion. The old brand name of Overture was phased out as Yahoo rebranded many of its products under the Yahoo name. The exception to this was in Japan and Korea where the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand.

===Panama===
Panama was an online advertising platform created by Yahoo!, launched on 5 February 2007. Panama was Yahoo&#x27;s effort to close the wide gap with Google in the race for search advertising dollars, a fast-growing business then dominated by Google, which is now also dominated by Google. Customers with accounts already on Yahoo! were transferred to the new system over the following few months. Yahoo! inherited the search advertising business when it purchased Overture (previously named Goto.com). Until Panama, Yahoo! search continued to operate the original simplistic algorithm which ranked text ads according to how much advertisers bid for the keyword searched by the user. Meanwhile, Google operates under a more sophisticated model, which ranks paid ads on the basis of bid price as well as prior click-through rates. This improvement generally produces higher click through rates (hence higher revenues) for the search engine. This also allowed Yahoo to control the pricing of ad auctions rather than having the auctions operate at market value.

For example, an ambulance-chasing attorney bidding for the keywords &quot;back pain&quot; would likely get a lower clickthrough rate than the keyword &quot;physiotherapist&quot;, regardless of what the two parties bid per click. An algorithm that eventually de-prioritizes the attorney&#x27;s ad is better for the search engine (in terms of revenue produced) and the user (more relevant ads).

Key players in the Panama project were Brian Acton, David Henke &amp; Qi Lu.

==== Features ====
The platform provided advertisers with a digital dashboard where they can manage their marketing campaigns, aim ads geographically, and test their effectiveness. It included interactive tools that suggest to advertisers what to bid based on their budget and the number of users they want to attract.

===Yahoo Gemini===
During the tenure of Marissa Mayer as Yahoo&#x27;s CEO she started a new advertising platform project under the name Gemini. The goal was to build a native advertising solution, where the ads take on the format of the content they accompany.

The so-called &quot;quality index&quot; gave advertisers a sense of how the system would rank an ad along with sophisticated analytical tools that gave advertisers insights on why certain campaigns had been effective.

==Patent litigation==
In May 1999, GoTo filed a patent application titled &quot;System and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine&quot;, which was granted as in July 2001. A related patent has also been granted in Australia and other patent applications remain pending.

Prior to its acquisition by Yahoo, Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent against FindWhat.com in January 2002 and Google in April 2002.

The lawsuit against Google related to its AdWords service. In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select that allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture&#x27;s search-listing auctions.

Following Yahoo&#x27;s acquisition of Overture, the lawsuit was settled with Google agreeing to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license.

==Trademark issues==
In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc. that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased Yahoo and Google AdWords search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts&#x27; federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and was scheduled to appear before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017.

==Adware partnership==
In April 2003, Overture announced a three-year partnership with Gator Corporation, (now Claria Corporation) an adware company. Under the partnership, Gator&#x27;s software monitored a web-user&#x27;s activity on web sites and search engines (even sites such as Google that are not affiliated with Overture) and grabbed search keywords. These keywords were submitted to the Overture search engine. As a result, advertisers who paid for listings in Overture found their products advertised through Gator&#x27;s Search Scout software, even if they wanted nothing to do with Gator. Overture faced a great deal of criticism for entering into this partnership.

When Yahoo acquired Overture, the Claria software impaired the operation of Yahoo&#x27;s services. For example, when a user with a Claria application installed used Yahoo Search, they received a standard set of Yahoo results with sponsored listings at the top supplied by Overture. The user would then receive a full-screen pop-under window from Search Scout. Since Search Scout uses Overture&#x27;s paid listings as well, Claria&#x27;s window has exactly the same listings as the Yahoo search results.

Subsequently, Yahoo came out with the &quot;Yahoo Toolbar&quot;, which allows users to remove adware and spyware from their system. The toolbar affected the operation of Claria&#x27;s software and may have put stress on the relationship between the two companies.

<doc id="1025943" wikidata="Q17146953" url="?curid=1025943" title="Logical schema">
<text>A logical data model or logical schema is a data model of a specific problem domain expressed independently of a particular database management product or storage technology (physical data model) but in terms of data structures such as relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tags. This is as opposed to a conceptual data model, which describes the semantics of an organization without reference to technology.

== Overview ==

Logical data models represent the abstract structure of a domain of information. They are often diagrammatic in nature and are most typically used in business processes that seek to capture things of importance to an organization and how they relate to one another. Once validated and approved, the logical data model can become the basis of a physical data model and form the design of a database.

Logical data models should be based on the structures identified in a preceding conceptual data model, since this describes the semantics of the information context, which the logical model should also reflect. Even so, since the logical data model anticipates implementation on a specific computing system, the content of the logical data model is adjusted to achieve certain efficiencies.

The term &#x27;Logical Data Model&#x27; is sometimes used as a synonym of &#x27;domain model&#x27; or as an alternative to the domain model. While the two concepts are closely related, and have overlapping goals, a domain model is more focused on capturing the concepts in the problem domain rather than the structure of the data associated with that domain.

== History ==
When ANSI first laid out the idea of a &quot;logical schema&quot; in 1975, the choices were &quot;hierarchical&quot; and &quot;network&quot;. The relational model – where data is described in terms of tables and columns – had just been recognized as a data organization theory but no software existed to support that approach. Since that time, an object-oriented approach to data modelling – where data is described in terms of classes, attributes, and associations – has also been introduced.

== Logical data model topics ==

=== Reasons for building a logical data structure ===
* Helps common understanding of business data elements and requirement
* Provides foundation for designing a database
* Facilitates avoidance of data redundancy and thus prevent data and business transaction inconsistency
* Facilitates data re-use and sharing
* Decreases development and maintenance time and cost
* Confirms a logical process model and helps impact analysis.

=== Conceptual, logical and physical data model ===
A logical data model is sometimes incorrectly called a physical data model, which is not what the ANSI people had in mind. The physical design of a database involves deep use of particular database management technology. For example, a table/column design could be implemented on a collection of computers, located in different parts of the world. That is the domain of the physical model.

Conceptual, logical and physical data models are very different in their objectives, goals and content. Key differences noted below.

<doc id="1025947" wikidata="Q2268800" url="?curid=1025947" title="Selwyn River">
<text>The Selwyn River (, officially gazetted as Selwyn River / Waikirikiri) flows through the Selwyn District of Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand.

==Description==
The river has its source in the Southern Alps and flows east for before emptying into Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, south of Banks Peninsula. Terrace cliffs above the river&#x27;s upper reaches gave the town of Whitecliffs its name.

For much of its course the river flows through wide shingle channels. In drought years, the river can disappear beneath this bed and seem to dry up completely. This frequently occurs where State Highway 1 crosses the river at the settlement of Selwyn, about upstream from its outflow into Lake Ellesmere.

In the foothills, the Selwyn flows year-round. On the plains, the riverbed is highly permeable, and the river overlays a deep and porous aquifer. As soon as the river reaches the plains, water begins leaking down through the bed and into the aquifer. In most months, all river-water disappears within of leaving the foothills. The next of the river remains dry for most of the year, apart from a small section around the confluence with the permanently flowing Hororata River. About upstream from Lake Ellesmere shallow groundwater rises back to the surface, and the Selwyn becomes permanent again.

== Bridges ==
There are six bridges that cross the Selwyn River. These are at: Whitecliffs (Whitecliffs Road), Glentunnel (SH 77), Coalgate (Hororata Road), Hororata (Bealey Road), Selwyn (SH 1) and Irwell (Leeston Road). It is also possible to cross at Coes Ford when the river is not in flood. Chamberlains Ford is no longer a ford. The nearby Irwell bridge provides access to the other side of the river.

== Ecology ==
Disappearing river flows have significant ecological effects: when the river’s surface water disappears, so does the habitat for many aquatic plants and animals. In response to loss of surface water, aquatic invertebrates and fish must disperse, seek refuge in remnant aquatic habitats, or die. Aquatic plants, algae, and bacteria must form resting stages or die. The dry central reaches of the Selwyn River also constitute a significant barrier for dispersal of invertebrates and for fish migrating between Lake Ellesmere and the headwaters.

=== Fishing ===
The Selwyn river was viewed historically as one of New Zealand’s best trout fisheries. In the 1960s a trout trap at Coes Ford was reported to count up to 14,000 returning spawning trout. In 2017, the numbers have declined to the stage that only dozens of trout could be counted when returning to spawn. The fish in the river have been described as low in number and the majority of the fish are quite small.

== Pollution ==
The Canterbury Regional Council (ECan) has permitted intensive dairy farming around Selwyn and it has been suggested that this has led to a deterioration in the water quality of the Selwyn river. In May 2021, it was reported that Nitrate levels in the Selwyn River has increased by 50%.

It is no longer recommended that people go swimming in the Selwyn River. Coes Ford was once a well known swimming spot in Canterbury. The water at Coes Ford was reported to be in the worst 25% in New Zealand for total nitrate levels in 2020. The pollution at Coes Ford is thought to come from Silverstream creek, which used surrounded by many of the dairy farms in the area.

Chamberlain&#x27;s Ford which crosses the Selwyn RIver had an algal bloom health warning issued in December 2020. There were benthic cyanobacteria found in the river. Algal Blooms of benthic cyanobacteria have also been reported at in the Selwyn river at Whitecliffs Domain and Whitecliffs Road in March 2021.

Greenpeace placed billboards in the Selwyn River to protest the degree of pollution in it in February 2020.

==Naming==
The Selwyn River and its gorge were named in 1849 by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, for Bishop Selwyn. The name was later adopted for the township, the district, and an electorate.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;gravelly stream&quot; for .

<doc id="1025950" wikidata="Q150056" url="?curid=1025950" title="Kingdom of Cochin">
<text>The Kingdom of Cochin or the Cochin State, named after its capital in the city of Kochi (Cochin), was a kingdom in the central part of present-day Kerala state. It originated in the early part of the 12th century and continued to rule until its accession to the Dominion of India in 1949.

Historically, the capital of Cochin was in Kodungallur (Cranganore), but in 1341, the capital was moved to Cochin to remedy a disastrous flood. By the early 15th century, Cochin lost its ability to fully defend itself. By the late 15th century, the kingdom had shrunk to its minimal extent as a result of invasions by the Zamorin of Calicut.

When Portuguese armadas arrived in India, the kingdom of Cochin had lost its vassals to the Zamorins, including Edapalli and Cranganore, the later of which had even been at the centre of the kingdom historically. Cochin was looking for an opportunity to preserve its independence, which was at risk. King Unni Goda Varma warmly welcomed Pedro Álvares Cabral on 24 December 1500 and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and the Cochin kingdom, directed against the Zamorin of Calicut. A number of forts were built in the area and controlled by the Portuguese East Indies, the most important of which was Fort Manuel. Cochin became a long-term Portuguese protectorate (1503–1663) providing assistance against native and foreign powers in India. After the Luso-Dutch War, the Dutch East India Company (1663–1795) was an ally of Cochin. That was followed by the British East India Company (1795–1858, confirmed on 6 May 1809) after the Anglo-Dutch War, with British paramountcy over the Cochin state.
The kingdom of Travancore merged with the kingdom of Cochin to form the state of Travancore-Cochin in 1950. The five Tamil-majority taluks of Vilavancode, Kalkulam, Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, and Sengottai were transferred from Travancore-Cochin to Madras State in 1956. The Malayalam-speaking regions of Travancore-Cochin merged with the Malabar District (excluding Laccadive and Minicoy Islands) and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara district in Madras State to form the modern Malayalam-state of Kerala on 1 November 1956, according to the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 of the Government of India.

The kingdom of Cochin, originally known as Perumpadappu Swarupam, was under the rule of the Later Cheras in the Middle Ages. After the fall of the Mahodayapuram Cheras in the 12th century, along with numerous other provinces Perumpadappu Swarupam became a free political entity. However, it was only after the arrival of Portuguese on the Malabar Coast that the Perumpadappu Swarupam acquires any political importance. Perumpadappu rulers had family relationships with the Nambudiri rulers of Edappally. After the transfer of Kochi and Vypin from the Edappally rulers to the Perumpadappu rulers, the latter came to be known as kings of Kochi.

==Territories==

During 1800 to 1947, the kingdom of Cochin included much of modern-day Thrissur district excluding Chavakkad taluk, a few areas of Alathur taluk and the whole of Chittur taluk of the Palakkad district and Kochi taluk (excluding Fort Kochi), most of Kanayannur taluk (excluding Edappally), parts of Aluva taluk (Karukutty, Angamaly, Kalady, Chowwara, Kanjoor, Sreemoolanagaram, Malayattoor, Manjapra), parts of Kunnathunad taluk and parts of Paravur Taluk (Chendamangalam) of the Ernakulam district which are now the part of Kerala.

==History==

=== Origin ===

There is no extant written evidence about the emergence of the kingdom of Cochin or of the Cochin royal family, also known as Perumpadapu Swaroopam. All that is recorded are folk tales and stories, and a somewhat blurred historical picture about the origins of the ruling dynasty.

The surviving manuscripts, such as &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, &quot;Keralamahatmyam&quot;, and &quot;Perumpadapu Grandavari&quot;, are collections of myths and legends that are less than reliable as conventional historical sources.

The &quot;Perumpadapu Grandavari&quot; contains an additional account of the dynastic origins: The last &quot;Thavazhi&quot; of &quot;Perumpadapu Swaroopam&quot; came into existence on the &quot;Kaliyuga&quot; day &quot;shodashangamsurajyam&quot;. Cheraman Perumal divided the land in half, 17 &quot;amsa&quot; north of Nileshwaram and 17 amsa south, totaling 34 amsa, and gave his powers to his nephews and sons. Thirty-four kingdoms between Kanyakumari and Gokarna (now in Karnataka) were given to the &quot;thampuran&quot; who was the daughter of the last niece of Cheraman Perumal.

Keralolpathi recorded the division of his kingdom in 345 Common Era, Perumpadapu Grandavari in 385 Common Era, William Logan in 825 Common Era. There are no written records on these earlier divisions of Kerala, but according to some historians the division might have occurred during the Second Chera kingdom at the beginning of the 12th century.
===Early history===

The original headquarters of the kingdom was at Perumpadappu near Ponnani in present-day Malappuram district. The ruler of Perumpadappu (near Ponnani) fled to Kodungallur in the early medieval period, when the Zamorin of Calicut annexed Ponnani region, after Tirunavaya war.

Calicut (Porlathiri kingdom) was conquered by Zamorin of Eranad, who then conquered parts of Perumpadappu kingdom, and tried to assert his suzerainty over it.

Although losing their northern homeland and original capital, the Perumpadappu dynasty maintained a kingdom over a vast area in central Kerala (still formally referred to as &quot;Perumpadappu Swaroopam&quot;). Their state stretched from Pukkaitha in the north, Aanamala in the east, to Purakkad in the south.

=== Royal dynasty and succession ===

The Perumpadappu dynasty eventually produced five branches (Mutts, Elaya, Pallurutti, Madattumkil and Chaliyur), each with its own family seat, retainers and military of Nairs. But the five branches (&quot;tavali&quot;) came together under a common ruling king (&quot;raja&quot;), which was the oldest male member of all five branches together.

The Perumpadappu (and future Cochin) royal dynasty followed matriarchal rules of succession common in Kerala (similar to Travancore). Succession went via the female line – that is, not to the king&#x27;s sons, but to his uterine brothers and then to his sisters&#x27; sons (i.e. nephews). In theory, the successor should be the next oldest in age among potential candidates. This was later relaxed, and in practice kingship became elective, to ensure the successor was not too old or incompetent. The overlooked true elder was compensated with symbolic or ceremonial dignities (notably the religiously significant title &quot;Muppustanam&quot;).
Retirement was also forced – it was customary and expected for a king to retire upon reaching a certain old age or military inability, withdrawing to take up a religious life. Power was passed over to his successor, or to a regent until the successor came of age.

Succession often led to quarrels among the five branches. The Zamorin of Calicut exploited these family quarrels, sometimes in the role of arbitrator, allowing him to increase his influence in the southern kingdom.

=== Transition to Cochin ===

The future city of Cochin was originally just a small village along a long embankment. Violent floods and overflows of the Periyar River in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula (&quot;karapuram&quot;) from what is now Vypin island.

As the waterways connecting Cranganore to the sea were silting up, commercial traffic began re-directing away from Cranganore to the new break at Cochin, and merchant families began to relocate and set up warehouses and eventually homes there. The once-great old port city of Kodungallur (Cranganore) declined as the new port-city of Kochi (Cochin) rose in wealth and importance. The urban center of the early city developed on relatively high ground in the village of Mattancherry (now a district in Kochi city, once called &quot;&quot;Cochim de Cima&quot;).

The original owners of the territory of what later became Cochin city was the Ellangallur royal family of the Rajas of Edapalli (&quot;Repelim&quot;) (on the east side of the lagoon). Drawn from the Brahmin class, the Edapalli royal family followed different rules of succession. In the early 1400s, the king of Edapalli had married a sister of the Elaya branch of Perumpadappu, and so their son was doubly royal heir to two houses – via father to Edapalli, via mother to Perumpadappu . But he was apparently not first in the line of succession to Perumpadappu.

In the early 1400s, the King of Edapalli granted part of his lands, specifically southern Vypin island and northern part of Karapuram peninsula around the new break, as an appanage fief for his prince son. It was originally not supposed to be a permanent cession, but rather to serve as a training ground, to allow the heir to cultivate his governing skills. Upon succession to his father, he was expected to move across the lagoon to Edapalli, and cede Cochin as a seat to the next heir. As the ruler was always a prince in training, he was addressed as &quot;Kocchu Thampuran&quot;&quot; (meaning &#x27;junior lord&#x27; or &#x27;junior king&#x27;), thus the fief became known as &quot;Kochi/Cochin&quot; after him. So the original &quot;kingdom of Cochin&quot; (&quot;Kochi rajyam&quot;) started off as a small Edapalli offshoot, distinct and separate from the much larger Perumpadappu state.

The growing wealth of Cochin gave the junior prince in Cochin power and ascendancy, eventually enabling him to assert himself as king over senior relatives from other branches of the Perumpadappu dynasty, as well as allowing him to detach Cochin from Edapalli, and chart his own separate course.

As a result of this transition, the large &quot;kingdom of Perumpadappu&quot; (&quot;Perumpadappu Swaroopam&quot;) came to be referred to as the &quot;kingdom of Cochin&quot;, and the capital of the kingdom shifted from Kodungallur to Vypin in present-day Kochi. During the new kingdom, rules were changed to confine succession within the Elaya branch of Cochin, rather across all branches of Perumpadappu (much to the chagrin of the branches).

=== Ming dynasty alliance (1411–1433) ===

The port at Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, held superior economic and political position on the medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam, and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. On the Malabar coast during the early 15th century, Calicut and Cochin were in an intense rivalry, so the Ming dynasty of China decided to intervene by granting special status to Cochin and its ruler, known as &quot;Keyili&quot; (可亦里) to the Chinese. Calicut had been the dominant port-city in the region, but Cochin was emerging as its main rival. For the fifth Ming treasure voyage, Admiral Zheng He was instructed to confer a seal upon &quot;Keyili&quot; of Cochin and designate a mountain in his kingdom as the &quot;Zhenguo Zhi Shan&quot; (鎮國之山, Mountain Which Protects the Country). Zheng He delivered a stone tablet, inscribed with a proclamation composed by the Yongle Emperor himself, to Cochin. As long as Cochin remained under the protection of Ming China, the Zamorin of Calicut was unable to invade Cochin and a military conflict was averted. The cessation of the Ming treasure voyages consequently had negative results for Cochin, as the Zamorin of Calicut later launched an invasion against Cochin. In the late 15th century, the Zamorin occupied Cochin and installed his representative as the king.

=== Vassal of Calicut===

The conflict between the upstart king of Cochin and his relatives of Perumpadappu branches (eager to recover their role) and Edapalli (eager to recover its land), drew in the interference of the Zamorin of Calicut, who attacked Cochin in the name of justice for the relatives. The Zamorin&#x27;s armies were eventually successful and imposed a settlement, which confined the king of Cochin to his domains, and extracted an oath of vassalage to Calicut. The kingdom of Cochin was required to obtain the Zamorin&#x27;s consent during succession, and obliged to provide annual tribute and troops to the Zamorin&#x27;s campaigns.

This was roughly the situation when the Portuguese arrived in 1500. The kingdom of Cochin was half-in-vassalage, half-at-war with the Zamorin of Calicut. The king of Cochin, Unni Goda Varda (referred to as &quot;Trimumpara Raja&quot; in Portuguese chronicles) was grating at the settlement. He perceived an alliance with Portuguese arms as way to overthrow the Zamorin&#x27;s power, recover Cochin&#x27;s independence and impose his ascendancy over his relatives.

=== Portuguese alliance (1500–1663) ===

The Portuguese arrived at Kappad, Kozhikode in 1498 during the Age of Discovery, thus opening a direct sea route from Europe to India. Cochin was the scene of the first European settlement in India. In the year 1500, the Portuguese Admiral Pedro Álvares Cabral landed at Cochin after being repelled from Calicut. The Raja of Cochin welcomed the Portuguese and a treaty of friendship was signed. The raja allowed them to build a factory at Cochin (and upon Cabral&#x27;s departure Cochin allowed thirty Portuguese and four Franciscan friars to stay in the kingdom). Assured by the offer of support, the raja declared war on his enemy, the Zamorins of Calicut.

In 1502, a new expedition under the command of Vasco da Gama arrived at Cochin, and the friendship was renewed. Vasco da Gama later bombarded Calicut and destroyed the Arab factories there. This enraged the Zamorin, the ruler of Calicut, and he attacked Cochin after the departure of Vasco da Gama and destroyed the Portuguese factory. The raja of Cochin and his Portuguese allies were forced to withdraw to Vypin Island. However, the arrival of a small reinforcement Portuguese fleet and, some days later of Duarte Pacheco Pereira and the oncoming monsoons alarmed the Zamorin. Calicut recalled the army and abandoned the siege.

After securing the throne for the Raja of Cochin, the Portuguese got permission to build a fort – Fort Emmanuel (at Fort Kochi, named after the king of Portugal) – surrounding the Portuguese factory, in order to protect it from any further attacks from Calicut and on 27 September 1503 the foundations of a timber fort, the first fort erected by the Portuguese in India, were laid. The entire work of construction was commissioned by the local raja, who supplied workers and material. In 1505, the stone fortress replaced the wooden fort. Later, for a better defence of the town, a fort called &quot;Castelo de Cima&quot; was built on Vypeen Island. At the departure of the Portuguese fleet, only Duarte Pacheco Pereira and a small fleet were left in Cochin. Meanwhile, the Zamorin of Calicut formed a massive force and attacked them. For five months, Cochin kingdom was able to drive back Calicut&#x27;s assaults, with the help of Pacheco Pereira and his men.

The ruler of the kingdom of Tanur, who was a vassal to the Zamorin of Calicut, sided with the Portuguese against his overlord at Kozhikode. As a result, the kingdom of Tanur (&quot;Vettathunadu&quot;) became one of the earliest Portuguese colonies in India. The ruler of Tanur also sided with Cochin. Many of the members of the royal family of Cochin in 16th and 17th centuries were selected from Vettom. However, the Tanur forces under the king fought for the Zamorin of Calicut in the Battle of Cochin (1504). However, the allegiance of the Muslim Mappila merchants in Tanur region stayed with the Zamorin of Calicut.

The raja of Cochin continued to rule with the help of the Portuguese. Meanwhile, the Portuguese secretly tried to enter into an alliance with the Zamorin. A few later attempts by the Zamorin to conquer the Cochin port were thwarted by the raja of Cochin with the help of the Portuguese. Slowly, the Portuguese armoury at Cochin was increased, presumably to help the king protect Cochin. And for a long a time, right after Goa, Cochin situated in the center of East Indies, was the best place Portugal had in India. From there the Portuguese exported large volumes of spices, particularly pepper.

In 1530, Saint Francis Xavier arrived and founded a Latin Christian mission. Cochin hosted the grave of Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese viceroy, who was buried at St. Francis Church until his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539.
Soon after the time of Afonso de Albuquerque, Portuguese influence in Kerala declined.

=== Dutch alliance (1663–1766) ===

Portuguese alliance was followed by that of the Dutch, who had by then conquered Quilon after various encounters with the Portuguese and their allies. Discontented members of the Cochin Royal family called on the assistance of the Dutch for help in overthrowing the Cochin Raja. The Dutch successfully landed at Njarakal and went on to capture the fort at Pallippuram, which they handed over to the Zamorin.

=== Mysorean invasion (1766–1799) ===
Mysorian ruler Hyder Ali conquered Cochin. After his conquest of Bednur reached Ali Rajah of Cannanore in 1763, he promptly asked Ali to invade Kerala and help him deal with the Zamorin of Calicut. The Muslim chieftain of Cannanore, an old rival of the neighbouring powerful Kolathiri, was an active ally of Mysore under the occupation.

Ali Raja seized and set fire to the palace of Kolathiri Raja. The latter escaped with his followers to the then-British settlement at Tellicherry. After the victory, Ali entered the kingdom of Kottayam in present-day North Malabar and occupied it, with assistance from native Muslims, after some resistance by the Kottayam army.

After taking Calicut in a bloody battle, Ali, with a large amount of money, marched south-east towards Coimbatore through Palghat. Mysore appointed Raja as military governor and Madonna (a former revenue officer) as civil governor of the newly acquired province of Malabar.

===British princely state (1814–1947)===

In 1814, according to the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, the islands of Kochi, including Fort Kochi and its territory, were ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for the island of Banca. Even prior to the signing of the treaty, there is evidence of English residents in Kochi. During the British Raj, the Princely State of Cochin was surrounded by British Malabar District to three sides (i.e., To north, west, and east), and by Travancore to the south.
Towards the early 20th century, trade at the port had increased substantially and the king wanted to develop the port even further. The king brought a harbour engineer Robert Bristow to Cochin in 1920, with the help of Lord Willingdon, then Governor of Madras. Over a span of 21 years he helped the king of Cochin to transform Cochin into the safest harbour in south Asia, where ships berthed alongside the newly reclaimed inner harbour, which was equipped with a long array of steam cranes.

Meanwhile, Fort Cochin, which was a part of Malabar District until 1956, was made a municipality on 1 November 1866, along with Kannur, Thalassery, Kozhikode, and Palakkad, according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, and its first Municipal Council election with a board of 18 members was conducted in 1883. The Maharajah of Cochin initiated local administration in 1896 by forming town councils in Mattancherry and Ernakulam. In 1925, a Kochi legislative assembly was also constituted to help the public participate in the administration. The assembly consisted of 45 members, 10 were officially nominated. Thottakkattu Madhaviamma was the first woman to be a member of any legislature in India.

Cochin was the first princely state to willingly join the new Dominion of India in 1947. India became a republic on 26 January 1950. Travancore merged with Cochin to create Travancore-Cochin, which was in turn unified with the Malabar district of Madras Presidency. Kasaragod was merged into it and Kanyakumari was removed from it. On 1 November 1956, the Indian state of Kerala was formed.

== Administration ==

For administrative purposes, Cochin was divided into seven taluks.(from 1860 to 1905 AD) Chittur, Cochin, Cranganore, Kanayannur, Mukundapuram, Trichur and Talapilly.

=== Capitals ===

The capital of Perumpadapu Swaroopam was located at Chitrakooda in the Perumpadapu village of Vanneri from the beginning of the 12th century to the end of the 13th century. Even though the capital of Perumpadapu Swaroopam was in Vanneri, the Perumpadapu king had a palace in Mahodayapuram.

When the Zamorins attacked Vanneri in the later part of the 13th century, Perumpadapu Swaroopam shifted their capital from Vanneri to Mahodayapuram. In 1405, Perumpadapu Swaroopam changed their capital from Mahodayapuram to Cochin. By the end of the 14th century the Zamorin conquered Thrikkanamathilakam and it became a threat for Mahodayapuram (Thiruvanchikulam), which may be the reason that Perumpadapu Swaroopam changed their capital to Cochin from Mahodayapuram. Moreover, in the year 1341 a flood created an island, Puthuvippu (Vypin), and Cochin became a noted natural harbour for the Indian Ocean trade. The old Kodungallore (Cranganore) port lost its importance, which may also be a cause for the shift of the capital. From there on Perumpadapu Swaroopam used the name Cochin Royal Family.

Finally, the arrival of the Portuguese on the Indian subcontinent in the sixteenth century likely influenced Cochin politics. The kingdom of Cochin was among the first Indian nations to sign a formal treaty with a European power, negotiating trade terms with Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500.

The palace at Kalvathhi was originally the residence of the kings. In 1555, though, the royal palace moved to Mattancherry, and later relocated to Thrissur. At that time Penvazithampuran (Female Thampuran) and the other Kochuthampurans (other Thampurans except the Valliathampuran (King)) stayed at a palace in Vellarapilly.

In the beginning of the 18th century Thripunithura started gaining prominence. The kingdom was ruled from Thrissur, Cochin and Thripunithura. Around 1755 Penvazithampuran (Female Thampuran) and the other Kochuthampurans (other Thampurans) left Vellarapalli and started to live in Thripunithura. Thus Thripunithura became the capital of the Cochin Royal Family.

== List of Maharajas of Cochin ==

Veerakerala Varma, nephew of Cheraman Perumal, is the person traditionally believed to be the first Maharaja of Cochin. The written records of the dynasty, however, date from 1503 CE. The Maharaja of Cochin was also called Gangadhara Kovil Adhikaarikal, meaning head of all temples. The kings followed matrilineal system of inheritance.

==Prime Ministers of Cochin (1947–49)==

== Chiefs of Cochin ==

The Paliath Achan of the Paliam family of Chendamangalam, played an important part in the politics of Cochin State since the early seventeenth century, and held hereditary rights to the ministership of Cochin. The Paliath Achan was the most powerful person after the king, and he sometimes exerted more power than the king. The &quot;Paliyam swaroopam&quot;, was second to the &quot;Perumpadappu swaroopam in terms of power but much larger in terms of wealth and land owned.&quot;

Other powerful lords around these areas were Cheranellore Karthavu who was the head of the Anchi Kaimals, Muriyanatt (Mukundapuram-Nadavarambu) Nambiar who was the head of Arunattil Prabhus, Kodassery Kartha Mappranam Prabhu-Vellose Nair, Changaramponnath Kartha, Chengazhi Nambiar (Chengazhinad Naduvazhi), and Edappali Nampiyathiri.

KP Padmanabha Menon in his &quot;History of Kerala, Vol 2&quot; mentions the Anji Kaimals whose Chief was the Cheranellur Kartha as owning all of Eranakulam. In fact, Eranakulam is known as Anji Kaimal in the early maps of Kerala. See Dutch in Malabar (Dutch Records No 13), 1910 shows a map from Common Era1740 that shows the area of AnjiKaimal as almost twice as large as the Cochin State. The other chiefs he mentions quoting Gollennesse (Dutch East India Company) is the 1) Moorianatt Nambiar 2) Paliath Achan (mentioned above), 3)Codacherry (Kotasseri) Kaimal, 4) Caimalieone (female Kaimal) of Corretty, 5) Changera Codda Kaimal, and 6) Panamoocattu Kaimal (Panambakadu Kaimal). The last four Kaimals are known as the Kaimals of Nandietter Nadu. The Kaimals of Nandietter Nadu had Nayar troops of 43,000 according to Heer Van Reede of the Dutch East India Company from 1694.

==Matrilineal inheritance==

The Cochin royal family followed the system of matrilineal succession known as Marumakkatayam.
Traditionally the female members of the family marry (Sambandham) with Namboodiri Brahmins while male members marry women of the Nair/Menon class. These wives of the male members are not Ranis or Queens as per the matrilineal system but instead get the title of Nethyar Amma.

==Traditional rituals==

The term &quot;Shodasakriyakal&quot; refers to sixteen rites to be performed by all members, as structured through &quot;Smruthi&quot;.

# Sekom (Garbhaadhaanam): A rite to be performed just before the first sexual intercourse after marriage.
# Pumsavanom: To be performed just after conception.
# Seemantham: Performed after Pumsavanom.
# Jathakarmam: Performed just after birth.

*Eldest son – Rama Varma
*Second son – Kerala Varma .
*Third son – Ravi Varma
*Fourth son - Rama Varma

=== Naming practice of female Thampuran ===

In the Cochin royal family the female Thampurans were named according to the following convention.

*Second daughter – &quot;Subhadra&quot;

This naming convention is followed again to the third daughter and fourth etc.

Both the female and male members are called by the name &quot;Thampuran&quot; and have same last name (Thampuran).

== Parukutty Nethyar Amma ==

Maharaja Rama Varma (popularly known as Madrassil Theepetta Thampuran), who reigned from 1914 to 1932, was assisted by a particularly able consort named Parukutty Nethyar Amma. She was a member of the famous Thrissur Vadakke Kurupath family which was an aristocratic Nair/Menon family. Her father Kuroor Narayanan Namboothirippad, belonged to a family that traditionally had the honour of anointing the Kings of Palakkad. She married the Maharaja, then fourth in line to the succession when she was fourteen years old in 1888. Her husband ascended the throne as a result of the abdication of his predecessor. Since the Maharaja was a scholar and had other interests, she took over the finances of the state. Under her guidance salaries were quadrupled and the increased revenue earned her a 17-gun salute. Parukutty Nethyar Amma was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal by King George V in 1919 for public work and came to be known as Lady Rama Varma of Cochin.

== Cochin royal family today ==

Members of the dynasty are spread all over the world. The family is one of the world&#x27;s largest royal families, numbering more than 1000 people, and many members of the family still live in and around Thripunithura, Thrissur (Chazhur), and other parts of Kochi. The current head of the Royal Family of Cochin is Smt. Mrinalini Thampuran (b. 1925) who is 99 years old and resides in Tripunithura.
Other known family members include Dr Kocha Varma, 
Dr Chris Kerala Varma

<doc id="1025955" wikidata="Q528671" url="?curid=1025955" title="Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network">
<text>Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) is a nonprofit organization that operates an online flight-simulation network noted for its active membership and realism. Users are able to connect to VATSIM and fly aircraft as a pilot, or direct traffic as an air traffic controller in what has been described as a close approximation of real-life aviation procedures.

==Overview==

Communications between pilots and controllers are carried out using integrated VoIP or in-game text messages. Users are required to use custom software, designated as approved clients, in order to connect to the simulation.

The main organs of the network consist of the Board of Governors, three of whom are responsible for one of the three geographic regions—namely, the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas region, referred to as VATEMEA, VATAPAC and VATAMAS respectively. These regions are further subdivided into divisions, some of which further divide into virtual area control centers, and virtual air route traffic control centers. Operating procedures within each area reflect local standards.

The network also has a volunteer team of supervisors that help those who may need assistance in flying on the network and also help resolve reports of other fellow users breaking the VATSIM Code of Conduct. Upon registering for the VATSIM network, new users have to undertake an entry-level test about basic piloting skills and about the rules of the network. This was introduced on September 1, 2020, alongside a further restructuring of the pilot rating system to teach VATSIM users how to properly use the network and reduce the number of cases of pilots connecting without knowing what to do in busy airspace, causing disruption and frustration for some controllers.

Because the simulation adheres as closely as possible to real-life aviation procedures and radio phraseology, VATSIM can function as a training aid for student pilots lacking experience and private and commercial pilots looking to enhance their skills in radio communications. Events in the simulation are not hard coded on the network but rather emerge through human interaction and error. Consequently, the network has been described as bringing immersion to what was historically a solitary exercise and credited with playing a key role in the commodification of flight-simulation software.

==History==

===Formation of VATSIM===
Spearheaded by Harvey Stein, the founding of VATSIM was announced on July 12, 2001, following the dissolution of the Simulated Air Traffic Controllers Organization (SATCO). This occurred after the founding of another network, IVAO, which was more European-oriented, unlike SATCO, which was more American-oriented. The board drew up terms of agreement with Randy Whistler, the then President of SATCO, declaring VATSIM the official successor of SATCO.

In 2020, VATSIM announced it had achieved 100,000 active users for the first time, an increase of 20,000 users in two years.

===SquawkBox and ProController===
The advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s enabled users of modern flight simulators to fly together using multiplayer functionality. In 1997, &quot;SquawkBox&quot; was created by Jason Grooms as an add-on for &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 95&quot;, enhancing the built-in multiplayer features to allow large numbers of players to connect to the game. &quot;ProController&quot;, a radar-simulation program also developed by Jason Grooms, was created in the same year to connect virtual pilots with virtual controllers. The &quot;FSD Server&quot; was created by Marty Bochane to provide the signaling infrastructure and logic required to integrate &quot;ProController&quot; and &quot;Squawkbox&quot;, enabling users to fly in real-world weather conditions. ProController was retired as an approved ATC client on March 13, 2004.

=== ASRC and Roger Wilco ===
Sometime in 2002, ProController was slowly being phased out in favour of ASRC (Advanced Simulated Radar Client), created by Mike Evans and David Hendleman, and was released to the public in early 2003. Alongside that, Roger Wilco (software) was used to facilitate voice communications between pilots and ATC, with ATC denoting that voice communications were available with them with the callsign format codice_1, alongside putting their voice server IP and voice room name in their ATIS. Later, however, Roger Wilco was phased out in favour of the Advanced Voice Client, which required VATSIM authentication to prevent any non-VATSIM users from logging into the voice servers.

The ASRC software was retired as an ATC client on April 1, 2021, due to its not being in active development, which will make it incompatible with fast position updates that will be brought with VATSIM Velocity.

On March 27, 2005, an alternative add-on to FS2002/FS2004 and FSX called FSInn was approved for use on the VATSIM network alongside SquawkBox.

=== Air Traffic Controller clients ===
On April 17, 2006, the Virtual Radar Client (VRC) was approved for use on the VATSIM network. Created by Ross Carlson, it was mainly used in the American and Oceanic regions, due to its easy setup, but comes with a lack of customizability. Discontinued as of October 9, 2023, besides the Network Supervisors VRC isn&#x27;t used by anyone.

On September 15, 2007, the EuroScope ATC client was approved for use on the VATSIM network. Created by Gergely Csernák, the client is reported to be the most used ATC client on VATSIM, due to its custom plugin support, realistic radar screens, and automatic controller coordination. It is designed to integrate with other ATC clients like VRC, vSTARS, and vERAM, however. It is generally used mostly in the Europe, Asia and South American regions.

On January 14, 2012, the vSTARS ATC client was approved for use on the VATSIM network. Also created by Ross Carlson, the client aims to replicate the real-world STARS system used in many US TRACON facilities.

On February 27, 2016, the vERAM ATC client was approved for use on the VATSIM network. Also created by Ross Carlson, the client aims to replicate the real-world ERAM system used in many US ARTCC facilities.

On July 18, 2020, the vatSys ATC client was approved for use on the VATSIM network. Created by Jake Saw, the client aimed to replicate the real-word TAAATS system used in Australia, but is now modelled off the Eurocat/TopSky systems. It features an advanced profiling system which &quot;means that the look and feel of the client can be adjusted with a simple few clicks&quot;.

As of October 9, 2023, VRC, vSTARS, and vERAM are being deprecated and replaced by the Virtual National Airspace System (vNAS) suite of products. This software is being actively developed and utilized by all ARTCCs in VATUSA. CRC includes has several modes (STARS, ERAM, ASDE-X and Tower Cab) included within single client and it is highly customizable unlike its predecessor VRC.

Pilot Clients

VATSIM has 3 approved pilot clients as of July 2024

Swift pilot client is a multi-platform (Windows, MacOs, Linux) and multi-flight simulator (X-Plane 11, MSFS (FS2020), P3D, FSX, FS9, FlightGear), this pilot client is not as popular among pilots anymore due to its old GUI, nevertheless it is still being actively developed.

vPilot created by Ross Carlson is still being actively developed and used by majority of MSFS, P3D and FSX users.

xPilot developed by Justin Shannon is a pilot client for X-Plane, as of August 2020 this project was moved to be an open-source to help with development

=== Audio for VATSIM ===

From its inception, VATSIM employed a system consisting of voice &#x27;rooms&#x27;, in which, by using custom-written TeamSpeak 2 servers as a backbone, each virtual &#x27;frequency&#x27; functioned similarly to a VoIP conference call, and any pilot(s) can transmit on a frequency and talk to each other on any frequency, but it is prohibited to use the frequencies for any non-operational reasons.

In October 2019, VATSIM had finished a complete overhaul of its voice system and called it Audio for VATSIM, a key feature of which is simulation of the entire VHF radio range, thus eliminating the need for voice rooms. The system realistically simulates signal degradation, audio quality, transceiver operation, frequency cross-coupling, and altitude effects.

=== Microsoft partnership ===
On July 23, 2020, VATSIM, alongside announcing a complete overhaul of their branding, announced that they had entered into a partnership with Microsoft, to ensure that the desktop PC version of &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020&quot; would be compatible with VATSIM upon launch. However, VATSIM does not and likely never will support the Xbox version of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

=== VATSIM Velocity ===
On March 13, 2021, VATSIM announced a closed-beta initiative to test low latency position updates on the network, named VATSIM Velocity. With this update, position updates increased from 0.2 Hz (5 seconds) to 5 Hz (0.2 seconds) within a 10-mile range.

The SquawkBox and FSInn pilot clients were retired for use on the network on April 1, 2021, due to them not being in active development, which made them incompatible with the fast position updates that were brought with VATSIM Velocity.

VATSIM announced that the long-awaited update would be released on January 31, 2022, at 22:00 UTC. Preparations for its launch included major updates to pilot clients, as well as the retirement of Squawkbox, which became incompatible with the network. However, Velocity had no effect on the functionality of controller clients.

===VATSIM Inc.===
On January 16, 2023, VATSIM announced the creation of a new 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, VATSIM Inc. and said it would start accepting donations. VATSIM also stated that it would be transferring ownership to a new board of directors.

==Reception==

Considered the largest online flight simulation network in the world, VATSIM has attracted mainstream media attention. Commentators have praised VATSIM for its realism and quality, describing the network as giving flight simulation an interest and depth it would otherwise lack and lauding its friendly atmosphere.

Coverage, although mostly positive, has focused on what is perceived to be the peculiar nature of a hobby so complex that it can closely approximate work and cost thousands of dollars. The experience has been described as more strict, for both air traffic controllers and pilots, than some participants might like.

==Membership and training==
VATSIM has over 176,000 registered users as of July 2024. Joining is free, and there are no usage fees associated with connecting to the network.

Pilots must successfully complete a new user orientation program, including a simple exam that helps reinforce the material about basic piloting skills and the rules of the network as of September 1, 2020. They may also undertake optional training to learn how to fly certain procedures on the network. Pilots may also transfer their real world license into a VATSIM rating as many real world pilots fly on the VATSIM network.

The current pilot ratings are:

* P0 - Basic VATSIM User (awarded after completion of the New User Orientation Program since September 1, 2020)
* P1 - Private Pilot License (PPL)
* P2 - Instrument Rating (IR)
* P3 - Commercial Multi-Engine Licence (CMEL)
* P4 - Airline Transport License (ATPL)
Pilots are able to file their own flight plans either through their flight plan dialog in their pilot client or &quot;pre-filing&quot; by using the myVATSIM ICAO flight planning form, also used by flight planning sites and flight tracking tools such as projectFLY, SimBrief, SimToolkitPro, and Volanta.

Air Traffic Controllers are required to undertake mandatory training before they are permitted to direct traffic. Global Controller Administration Policy defines the requirements for each ATC rating, preceding local division restrictions. The ratings are as follows:

* S1 - Tower Trainee - no particular competencies, validated to control some aerodrome positions (defined locally)
* S2 - Tower Controller - validated to control Delivery (DEL), Ground (GND) and Tower (TWR) facilities except procedural tower (subject to training)
* S3 - TMA Controller - validated to control all facilities up to Approach (APP/DEP) level
* C1 - Enroute Controller - validated to control all available facilities, including Center (CTR)
* C3 - Senior Controller - a special rating awarded to users at the discretion of their local region/division for seniority/recognition, giving unrestricted access to all ATC in their division
* I1 - Instructor - validated to train and instruct all virtual Air Traffic Controllers, they have the ability to control the same positions as an enroute controller
* I3 - Senior Instructor - a special rating awarded to instructors at the discretion of their local region/division for seniority/recognition, it is also used for Chief Instructors within a region/division 

==Events==
The network creates and sponsors regular events to encourage interaction between pilots and controllers, during which traffic can approximate real-life levels.

===Worldflight===
Worldflight Australia is an annual virtual round-the-world charity event that has been run continuously since 2001, where 11 teams from different countries in their own fixed-base aircraft simulators fly to over 40 destinations around the world on VATSIM to raise money for the Australian Royal Flying Doctor Service. VATSIM air traffic controllers provide service throughout this event. In 2006, fifteen enthusiasts conducted a 130-hour flight in a full-sized Boeing 747-400 simulator, for which Qantas provided food.

===Cross the Pond===
Cross the Pond is a biannual event during which pilots complete transatlantic flights across &quot;The Pond&quot; between Europe and Northern America. The event alternates between westbound and eastbound every 6 months. Certain airports are selected a few months prior for which pilots can book slots to fly for, and VATSIM air traffic controllers provide full service for each of these airports throughout the event. The event is meticulously planned and coordinated by all major VATSIM staff members, to make sure that pilots enjoy their service. During the Autumn 2024 event, VATSIM surpassed its record of most unique connections to the network with 3,208, also making it the biggest online flight simulation network to date.

===Regional events===
In addition to the global/international events that VATSIM sponsors and advertises, regional events can be found daily throughout the network. These events can range from small in size, including only a few airports or facilities, to very large in size, spanning across multiple regions and facilities. Although they don&#x27;t typically attract record-breaking traffic, these events have been known to draw enough pilots to simulate, (and often surpass) real-world operations at the selected facilities.

<doc id="1025958" wikidata="Q983971" url="?curid=1025958" title="Tom Thabane">
<text>Thomas Motsoahae Thabane (born 28 May 1939) is a Mosotho politician who was the fifth Prime Minister of Lesotho from 2012 to 2015 and from 2017 to 2020. He founded the All Basotho Convention (ABC) in 2006 and led the party until 2022.

Thabane served in the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili from 1998 to 2006 as a member of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), but in 2006 he split from the LCD and launched the All Basotho Convention (ABC). After more than five years in opposition, he built a coalition of 12 parties in the wake of the 2012 Lesotho parliamentary election and was appointed prime minister.

In the 2015 Lesotho parliamentary election, the ABC was democratically removed from power by a seven-party coalition led by Mosisili, though the ABC did win the most constituencies. Two months later, Thabane fled to South Africa with two other opposition leaders, claiming that their lives were in danger. They returned to Lesotho on 12 February 2017 to participate in a parliamentary vote of no confidence that unseated Mosisili. Thabane went on to win a plurality of seats in the subsequent parliamentary election and returned as prime minister.

In 2020, Thabane faced pressure to resign as prime minister due to his alleged involvement in his ex-spouse&#x27;s murder. He announced on 18 May that he would resign the following day.

==Political career==

Thabane served as Principal Secretary for Health under Leabua Jonathan, the second prime minister of Lesotho, until the military overthrew Jonathan in 1986. Thabane then served with the military regime under General Justin Lekhanya until 1991. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1991.

Thabane became an advisor to Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle in early 1995. He subsequently served again as Foreign Minister in Mosisili&#x27;s LCD government from June 1998 to June 2002, when he was appointed as Minister of Home Affairs and Public Safety. In November 2004 he was appointed Minister of Communications, Science and Technology.

===In opposition===

Thabane resigned from the government on 9 October 2006, and formed a new party, the All Basotho Convention (ABC). He claimed that his goal was to unite all Basotho, not only those from the Congress party or National Party. Some believed the ABC could lead Lesotho to economic development.

18 MPs crossed the floor to join the ABC in opposition on 13 October 2006; 17 of these (including Thabane) had been LCD members, and one had been an independent. Thabane&#x27;s party thus became the third-largest party in Parliament. The ruling party was left with 61 of the 120 parliamentary seats; with such a precarious majority, Mosisili requested the dissolution of Parliament, and an early election was called for February 2007. In the election, the ABC took 17 out of 80 constituency seats, while the LCD took 61. Thabane said that the vote was free but not fair.

An extended dispute followed the 2007 election regarding the allocation of seats based on proportional representation. Five opposition parties called for the Speaker of Parliament to designate Thabane as Leader of the Opposition in March 2007, but the Speaker rejected this on the grounds that the agreement made by the opposition parties was not legitimate. National Independent Party leader Dominic Motikoe was instead designated the Leader of the Opposition, despite leading a party that was allied with the LCD.

On 14 June 2007, an assassination attempt on Thabane allegedly occurred, with gunmen firing outside his home. Several other incidents of political violence occurred around the same time, and an indefinite curfew was imposed; it was lifted later in the month. Thabane was critical of the curfew and accused the police of excessively harsh enforcement of it.

The LCD&#x27;s reluctance to engage in talks regarding the political situation prompted Thabane on 18 October 2007 to threaten street protests to pressure the government into holding a new election &quot;if they continue to fail to cooperate&quot;.

After a 22 April 2009 assault on Mosisili&#x27;s residence, which was believed to have been a failed attempt to kill him, police said that retired officer Makotoko Lerotholi, a bodyguard of Thabane, was suspected of involvement in the attack. Thabane condemned the government for placing blame on the opposition, describing it as &quot;treachery&quot;.

===Prime minister===

After more than five years in opposition, Thabane formed a coalition with other parties in the wake of the 2012 Lesotho parliamentary election and was appointed prime minister.

Thabane fled to South Africa on 30 August 2014, alleging that the military was attempting to take power and wanted to kill him. He said that he would go back to Lesotho only if he felt his life was not in danger. The military denied the allegations. He returned to Lesotho on 3 September 2014 under the protection of South African police.

===Post-premiership===

Thabane&#x27;s party failed to attain a majority in the 2015 snap election and was unsuccessful in forming a coalition government. In an interview on the South African Broadcasting Corporation, Thabane said this would be his last term in parliament. He cited Nelson Mandela as an example of a leader who voluntarily left office.

Following the opposition&#x27;s June 2015 boycott of parliament to protest the government&#x27;s alleged disinterest in investigating circumstances surrounding Brigadier-General Maaparankoe Mahao&#x27;s death, Thabane and two other opposition party leaders left for South Africa and did not attend any parliamentary sittings, citing security issues and instability in the country. On 12 February 2017, they returned to Lesotho, declaring that Mosisili no longer commanded a parliamentary majority and vowing to oust him in a vote of no confidence. Thabane claimed that he was risking his life by returning.

===Prime Minister (2017–2020)===

Mosisili was defeated in the vote of no confidence, leading to a new election in June 2017. The ABC won the most seats, and with its allies was able to command a majority. Thabane was sworn in as prime minister on 16 June 2017.

In October 2017 rumours that Thabane had been hospitalised in South Africa were dismissed by a spokesperson as propaganda intended to destabilise Lesotho.

In 2020, Thabane faced pressure to resign due to allegations of murdering his ex-wife. On 11 May 2020, his coalition government collapsed after his coalition partners withdrew their support. National Assembly Speaker Sephiri Motanyane said that Thabane would have to step down by 22 May as he was now leading a caretaker government. Thabane announced on 18 May that he would effectively resign the following day. Finance minister Moeketsi Majoro was designated as his successor.

Thabane initially resisted calls from ABC members to step down as leader. He announced his intention to relinquish the party leadership in January 2022, citing poor health and his advanced age. The party then elected Nkaku Kabi to succeed Thabane.
==Personal life==

Thabane&#x27;s first wife was Matoka Judith Thabane (maiden name Mamotapanyane Yayi Fobo), with whom he had four children. She retained her married name after they divorced and died of natural causes on 26 August 2017 at the age of 79.

Thabane was next married to Lipolelo Thabane, who filed for divorce from him in 2012. On 14 June 2017, Lipolelo Thabane was shot dead in Ha-&#x27;Masana, outside Maseru.

On 27 August 2017, Thabane married Maesiah Thabane at a Catholic ceremony in Setsoto Stadium in Maseru. In the first week of January 2020, the ruling All Basotho Convention (ABC) party asked him to resign over his suspension of the police commissioner Holomo Molibeli, who had linked him to Lipolelo&#x27;s murder.

== Murder allegations ==

On 10 January 2020, an arrest warrant was issued for Maesiah Thabane, who is wanted in connection with the 2017 murder of Lipolelo Thabane. Maesiah Thabane went into hiding and Prime Minister Thabane announced his intent to resign from office shortly after her arrest warrant was issued.

On 20 February 2020, police announced that Thabane would also be charged with murder in the case. On 21 February 2020, Thabane failed to appear in court for the case, with his son saying he had traveled to South Africa to see a doctor. Police warned that if he does not return to the country, an arrest warrant will be issued. Both his son and press secretary said that he had &quot;not fled the country&quot; and that he would return to the country as soon as his doctor in Johannesburg releases him. They also said that &quot;he is willing to appear before the court of a law and hear the charges against him.&quot; The murder charges levied against him made him to be the first prime minister of Lesotho to announce his resignation.

On 22 February 2020, Thabane was granted a sick leave until 27 February when he is due to appear in court to hear the charges, the country&#x27;s deputy police commissioner said. Members of his party, also, have urged him to step down sooner than the end of July as he has planned.

On 24 February 2020, while on sick leave, Thabane appeared in a Maseru court for a pre-trial hearing. The charges against him were not read as his lawyers requested the case be referred to the high court to answer for a possible immunity.

On 30 November 2021, he was charged with the murder of his wife.

<text>In Persian, Turkic, and Urdu ghazals, the radīf (from Arabic ; ; ; ; ; ) is the word which must end each line of the first couplet and the second line of all the following couplets. It is preceded by a &quot;qafiya&quot;, which is the actual rhyme of the ghazal.

The following is an example of an Urdu ghazal by Daagh Dehlvi, where the radif is &quot;mein&quot; while the qafiya is in &quot;-aah&quot;: , , , , and .

<text>Mirpur Khas (Sindhi and ; &quot;meaning &quot;Town of the most-high Mirs&quot;&quot;) is a city in Sindh province, Pakistan. The city was built by Talpur rulers of Mankani branch. According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, its population was 205,913. Mirpur Khas is known for its mango cultivation, with hundreds of varieties of the fruit produced each year - it is also called the “City of Mangoes,” and has been home to an annual mango festival since 1955. After the completion of Hyderabad-Mirpurkhas dual carriage way, the city has become hub of commercial activities.

== History ==

=== Early ===
The Mirpur Khas region has been inhabited for millennia, as evidenced by the excavation of the Buddhist-era settlement of Kahoo Jo Daro and various hindu temples.The remnants of them still remain. The famous 
Bronze of hindu believed god brahma from gupta dynasty (5th or 6th century bronze) has been excavated from here It is the earliest known metallic image of Brahma, and the only known representative of the school it represents. It has been described as &quot;an immense artistic creation&quot; of the Gupta period. 
In 712 CE, the region was conquered by the armies of Muhammad Bin Qasim.

=== Founding ===

The Talpur dynasty conquered Sindh in 1784, and under Mir Fath Ali Khan, Sindh was divided into three smaller regions to be ruled by members of the Talpur family. The three regions were centred around Hyderabad, Khairpur, and Mirpur Khas. The Mankani branch of the family under Mir Ali Murad Talpur inherited the region around Mirpur Khas in 1801, and founded the new city of Mirpur Khas in 1806 to serve as the new capital.

=== Mirpur Khas State ===

Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur (1829-1843) succeeded Mir Ali Murad, and built a fort in the city when he declared the ruler of the state, and ran a kutchery from within the fort. Elaborate graves for the local rulers were built at Chitorri, and feature a syncretic architectural style that combines elements of Islamic and Rajasthani architecture.

Mirpur Khas remained the capital of the Talpur Mirs of Mirpurkhas until 1843, when Sindh was annexed to British India under the East India Company following the conquest of Sindh by Charles James Napier and defeat of Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur on 24 March 1843 at the battleground of Dubbo. His battle for the Sindh state earned him the moniker &quot;Lion of Sindh.&quot;

=== British ===
Later Sindh was made part of the colonial Bombay Presidency and Mirpurkhas was a part of it. Umerkot was made the district&#x27;s headquarters of town of Thar and Parkar district and Mirpur Khas was ignored until the advent of the Luni-Hyderabad branch of the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway, a subsidiary of the Scinde Railway to the town. The opening of the Jamrao Canal in 1900 made Mirpur Khas stand out of the rest of the towns in the district. It was constituted a municipality in 1901 and the district headquarters was shifted from Umerkot to Mirpurkhas in 1906.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the population of the town was 2,787 persons with a density of 82 persons per square mile, howev Hall rahy is famous Dailouge 

After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, because of its proximity with the Indian border, Mirpur Khas became the first city to welcome refugees to Pakistan. It served as a primary railway junction for the first trains to rail across the Rajasthan to the Sindh province. The Partition of British India resulted in the large-scale exodus of much of the city&#x27;s Hindu population, though like much of Sindh, Mirpur Khas did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal. In all, less than 500 Hindu were killed in 
all of Sindh between 1947-48 as Sindhi Muslims largely resisted calls to turn against their Hindu neighbours. Hindus did not flee Sindh &quot;en masse&quot; until riots erupted in Karachi on 6 January 1948, which sowed fear in Sindh&#x27;s Hindus despite the fact that the riots were local and regarded Sikh refugees from Punjab seeking refuge in Karachi. Despite the loss of much of the city&#x27;s Hindu population, Mirpur Khas District is estimated as 35% populated by Hindus.

Large numbers of refugees from India began arriving in the city following the Partition of British India - leading to rapid population rises and a shift in demography. In 1951, the population was 40,420, of which 68% were Urdu-speaking refugees that had fled India - the highest percentage of any major urban area in Sindh. The population rose further to 60,861 in the 1961 census. The Mirpur Khas tehsil was upgraded to a district and divide the Thar and Parkar district in 1990.
=== History of Cricket ===

Mirpurakhas is home to some of notable Sindhi Muslim tribes like, Soomras, Khaskhelis, Mallah, Dharejo, Junejo, Rajper, Samejo.

Mirpurkhas has also a small minority of Sindhi Hindus who are mostly in business. Many of them were forced to flee Sindh during the Sindhi Hindu Exodus.

In late 18th century, many Muslim families were shifted from east Punjab to the area. The biggest Muslim community who settled here was the Arain community. The Arains from various districts of eastern Punjab such as Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozpur, Ambala, Patiala and Jalandhar moved here and permanently settled.

The city&#x27;s economy has been adversely effected by a poor law and order situation, with violent conflict between rival families.

=== Agriculture ===

The district&#x27;s very fertile land produces wheat, onion, sugarcane, cotton, chillies, and mangoes. Irrigation and farming was revitalised after the Jamrao Canal was built in the 1900s. Afterwards, the city was able to produce and cycle crops to supply mainly grain, cotton products like fabrics, and sugar from the sugarcane cultivation. For a certain period in history, Mirpurkhas enjoyed being the best cotton producer in the country and much of the income of the town came from cotton farming in its heyday.

Nowadays, however, the area is much known its mango produce. The city claims to have 252 different varieties of mangoes, of which the most famous variety is the Sindhri Amb, literally &quot;the mango from Sindh&quot;. The city boasts its mango products at an annual harvest festival showcasing its world-renowned produce.

Mirpur Khas is positioned atop a fertile land making conditions apt for farming and irrigation. Being connected to the Indus via irrigation canals like the Let Wah, Mirpur Khas has gained an advantage in horticulture and farming over the years. Bananas are also widely cultivated around the region and also one of the biggest producer of bananas in the country.

<doc id="1026099" wikidata="Q2886598" url="?curid=1026099" title="Daagh Dehlvi">
<text>Nawab Mirza Khan Daagh Dehlvi (, 25 May 1831 – 17 March 1905) was a poet known for his Urdu &quot;ghazals&quot;. He belonged to the old Delhi school of Urdu poetry.

He wrote romantic and sensuous poems and &quot;ghazals&quot; in simple and chaste Urdu, minimising usage of Persian words. He laid great emphasis on the Urdu idiom and its usage. He wrote under the &quot;takhallus&quot; (Urdu word for pen name) &quot;Daagh Dehlvi&quot; (the meanings of &quot;Daagh&quot;, an Urdu noun, include stain, grief and taint while &quot;Dehlvi&quot; means belonging to or from Dehli or Delhi). He belonged to the &quot;Delhi school of thought&quot;.

His honorific &quot;Dabeer ud Dawla, Faseeh ul Mulk, Nawab Nizam Jang Bahadur, Sipah Salar, Yar-e-Wafadar, Muqrib-us-Sultan, Bulbul-e-Hindustan, Jahan Ustad, Nazim Yar Jung&quot;, were the titles bestowed upon him by the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Mahbub Ali Khan.

Daagh was considered one of the best romantic poets of his time by some commentators.

==Life==

===Early life===
Dehlvi was born in &quot;Kucha Ustad Dagh&quot;, Chandni Chowk in Delhi to Nawab Shamsuddin Ahmed Khan, the ruler of Loharu and Ferozepur Jhirka and Wazir Khanum, daughter of a Delhi jeweller. Dehlvi&#x27;s father was hanged under charges of conspiracy in the murder of William Fraser. Dehlvi at the age of four and his mother at age thirty four, the most sought after lady, wooed and remarried the Mughal crown prince, Mirza Muhammad Fakhroo, an heir to the last Mughal Bahadur Shah Zafar. Hence, Dehlvi had the privileged education at the Delhi Red Fort, There he received best of education and was later under tutelage of poet laureate, Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq. Later, he also took advice from Ghalib on finer nuances of Urdu literature and poetry. He was also trained in calligraphy and horse riding.

===Literary life===
Dehlvi belonged to the &quot;Dabistan-e-Dehli&quot; (Dehli school of thought) and never allowed western influences on his poetry. He started reciting poetry at the age of ten and his forte was the romantic version, the &quot;ghazal&quot;. He became popular for his poetry. Unlike the elitist style by the poets of the time, his style was simple and was well received by both, the common man and the elite.

After Fakhroo&#x27;s death in 1856, Dehlvi along with his mother left Delhi after facing turbulent times, for Rampur State and came under the aegis of Nawab of Rampur, Yusuf Ali Khan Bahadur. He went into government service there and lived well for 24 years.

===Later life in Hyderabad Deccan===

Dehlvi stayed in Hyderabad in 1888 for several months. He left Hyderabad after not being invited to the court by the Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI&#x27;s court, as access to his court was very limited. He then was invited immediately and was appointed as the court poet and mentor, in 1891, to the Sixth Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI, at the age of 60.

Contrary to the impression one gets from his poetry, he did not drink wine and shunned it.

His couplet on Urdu language was:
===Death===
He died in 1905 at the age of 74 in Hyderabad Deccan after a paralytic stroke. He was buried at Dargah Yousufain in Hyderabad.

===Disciples===
Dehlvi&#x27;s students included Allama Iqbal, Hassan Raza Khan (1859-1908), Jigar Moradabadi (1890 – 1960), Seemab Akbarabadi and Ahasan Marharavi, though a widely quoted anecdote relates that when asked to designate his successor as the leading Urdu poet of his age, he replied &quot;Bekhudain [the two Bekhuds]&quot;, referring to Bekhud Badayuni and Bekhud Dehlvi.

===Popular ghazal songs===
His selected &quot;ghazals&quot; are rendered by contemporary &quot;ghazal&quot; singers, Jagjit Singh, Noor Jahan, Iqbal Bano, Ghulam Ali, Adithya Srinivasan, Malika Pukhraj, Mehdi Hassan, Abida Parveen, Begum Akhtar, Pankaj Udhas and Farida Khanum.

==Bibliography==
His work consists of four volumes, consisting of 16,000 couplets and a &quot;Masnavi&quot;. The last two volumes he wrote when he was in Hyderabad.

* &quot;Gulzar-e-Daagh&quot; (1878)
* &quot;Masnavi Fariyad-e-Daagh&quot; (1882)

<text>Boeing Rotorcraft Systems (formerly Boeing Helicopters and before that Boeing Vertol) is the former name of an American aircraft manufacturer, now known as Vertical Lift division of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security. 

The headquarters and main rotorcraft factory is in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Production of Apache attack helicopters in Mesa, Arizona, formerly part of Rotorcraft Systems, is now under the Global Strike Division of Boeing Military Aircraft.

==History==

===Background===
Boeing Helicopters was created as Boeing Vertol when the Vertol Aircraft Corporation (formerly Piasecki Helicopter) company of Morton, Pennsylvania was acquired by Boeing in 1960; the Vertol name was an abbreviation for Vertical Take Off and Landing. Other names by which the division sometimes referred to itself in correspondence over the years were &quot;Boeing Aircraft Company, Vertol Division&quot; and &quot;Boeing Philadelphia&quot;. The company was responsible for the design and production of the CH-46 Sea Knight and the CH-47 Chinook. The name became Boeing Helicopters in 1987, and the current name was adopted in 2002.

When Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the former Hughes Helicopters operations in Mesa, Arizona were placed under Boeing Helicopters. A year and a half later Boeing sold the civilian line of helicopters to MD Helicopter Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of the Dutch company, RDM Holding Inc.

By December 2006 Columbia Helicopters of Aurora, Oregon had purchased the Type certificate of the Boeing Vertol 107-II and Boeing Model 234 Commercial Chinook from Boeing. The Columbia Helicopters is seeking FAA issuance of a Production Certificate to produce parts with eventual issuance of a PC to produce aircraft.

===Mass transit===
For much of the 1970s, Boeing Vertol entered the railroad rolling stock market in an attempt to keep government-funded contracts in the wake of the Vietnam War. During this period, Boeing Vertol manufactured the Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit system for West Virginia University, the 2400 series Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; cars for the Chicago Transit Authority, and the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle (marketed as the &quot;Boeing LRV&quot;). It was the last vehicle, an attempt at a standardized light rail vehicle promoted by the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration, that led to the company&#x27;s ending rail production due to myriad problems. This cost Boeing and the vehicle&#x27;s two buyers, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and San Francisco Municipal Railway millions and led to premature retirement of the vehicles.

While the company&#x27;s subway cars performed better, they did not continue in the railcar business, as competitors may have underbid on a key contract and the post-Vietnam War military build-up provided far more lucrative military contracts.

<text>The first day on the Somme (1 July 1916) was the beginning of the Battle of Albert the name given by the British to the first two weeks of the Battle of the Somme () in the First World War. Nine corps of the French Sixth Army and the British Fourth and Third armies attacked the German 2nd Army (General Fritz von Below). The attack was from Foucaucourt south of the Somme, northwards across the Somme and the Ancre to Serre and Gommecourt, beyond, in the Third Army area. The objective of the attack was to capture the German first and second defensive positions from Serre south to the Albert–Bapaume road and the first position from the road south to Foucaucourt.

The German defence south of the road mostly collapsed and the French had &quot;complete success&quot; on both banks of the Somme, as did the British from Maricourt on the army boundary with the French northwards. XIII Corps took Montauban and reached all its objectives, XV Corps captured Mametz and isolated Fricourt. The III Corps attack on both sides of the Albert–Bapaume road was a disaster, making only a short advance south of La Boisselle, where the 34th Division suffered the most casualties of any Allied division on 1 July. Further north, X Corps captured part of the Redoubt (an earthwork fortification), failed opposite Thiepval and had a great but temporary success on the left flank, where the German front line was overrun and and Stuff redoubts captured by the 36th (Ulster) Division.

German counter-attacks during the afternoon recaptured most of the lost ground north of the Albert–Bapaume road and more British attacks against Thiepval were costly failures. On the north bank of the Ancre, the attack of VIII Corps was a costly failure, with large numbers of British troops being shot down in no man&#x27;s land. The VII Corps diversion at Gommecourt was also costly, with only a partial and temporary advance south of the village. The German defeats, from Foucaucourt to the Albert–Bapaume road, left the German defence on the south bank incapable of resisting another attack; a substantial German retreat began from the Flaucourt plateau to the west bank of the Somme close to Péronne. North of the Somme in the British area, Fricourt was abandoned by the Germans overnight.

Several truces were observed to recover wounded from no man&#x27;s land on the British front; the Third Army diversion at Gommecourt cost against and the combined casualty count with the Fourth Army reached (19,240 of which had been fatal). The French Sixth Army suffered and the German 2nd Army suffered Orders were issued to the Anglo-French armies to continue the offensive on 2 July; a German counter-attack on the north bank of the Somme by the 12th Division, intended for the night of took until dawn on 2 July to begin and was destroyed by the French and British troops opposite. Since 1 July 1916, the British casualties on the First Day and the &quot;meagre gains&quot; have been a source of grief and controversy in Britain.

==Background==

===Strategic developments===

In July 1915, the French Commander in Chief Joseph Joffre held the first inter-Allied conference at Chantilly. In December, a second conference agreed a strategy of simultaneous attacks by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies. The British theatre of operations was in northern France and Flanders but in February 1916, Haig accepted Joffre&#x27;s plan for a combined attack astride the Somme river, around 1 July; in April, the British Cabinet agreed to an offensive in France. The nature of a joint offensive on the Somme began to change almost immediately, when the German army attacked Verdun on 21 February. In March, Foch proposed a Somme offensive on a front, between Lassigny and the Somme with divisions and a British attack on a front from the Somme to Thiepval with French divisions intended for the joint offensive were soon diverted to Verdun and the offensive was eventually reduced to a main effort by the British and a supporting attack by the French Sixth Army.
The Somme was to be the first mass offensive mounted by the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the first battle to involve a large number of New Army divisions, many composed of Pals battalions that had formed after Kitchener&#x27;s call for volunteers in August 1914. By the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, twelve British divisions were in Egypt and from 4 February to 20 June, nine were transferred to France. From Britain and Egypt the 34th and 35th divisions arrived in January, the 31st and 46th (North Midland) divisions in February, the 29th, 39th, 1st Australian and 2nd Australian divisions in March, the New Zealand Division in April, the 41st, 61st (2nd South Midland) and 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) divisions in May, the 40th, 60th (2/2nd London), 4th Australian and 5th Australian divisions in June and the 11th (Northern) Division on 3 July. The 55th (West Lancashire) and 56th (1/1st London) divisions were reassembled, a battalion of the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade joined in April, followed by a contingent of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps in July.

Despite considerable debate among German staff officers, General Erich von Falkenhayn, the head of (&quot;OHL&quot;, the supreme command of the German Army) insisted on a tactic of rigid defence of the front line in 1916 and implied after the war that the psychology of German soldiers, shortage of manpower and lack of reserves made the policy inescapable, since the troops necessary to seal off breakthroughs did not exist. High losses incurred in holding ground by a policy of no retreat were preferable to higher losses, voluntary withdrawals and the effect of a belief that soldiers had discretion to avoid battle. When a more flexible policy was substituted later, discretion was still reserved to army commanders. Despite the certainty by mid-June of an Anglo-French attack on the Somme against the 2nd Army, Falkenhayn sent only four divisions, keeping eight in the western strategic reserve. No divisions were moved from the 6th Army, despite it holding a shorter line with divisions and three of the divisions in reserve being in the 6th Army area. The maintenance of the strength of the 6th Army at the expense of the 2nd Army on the Somme, indicated that Falkenhayn intended a counter-offensive against the British to be made closer to Arras north of the Somme front, once the British offensive had been shattered.

===Tactical developments===

====French====
The offensives of 1915 showed that attacks would inevitably be slow and costly; on 8 January 1916, GQG issued &quot;&quot; (&quot;Instructions on Small Unit Offensive Operations&quot;) and &quot;&quot; on 26 January (&quot;Instructions on large Unit Offensive Operations&quot;). On 20 April, General Ferdinand Foch, commander of (GAN, Northern Army Group) issued &quot;&quot; (&quot;The GAN Commander&#x27;s Instruction on Offensive Battle&quot;) an pamphlet on the stages and processes of an attack on enemy positions prepared in depth. The pamphlet was a substantial revision of , derived from &quot; (&quot;Purpose and Conditions of Comprehensive Offensive Action&quot; 16 April 1915), a manual compiled from analysis of the fighting in 1914 and the basis of French offensive planning in 1915. Battle would now be methodical until the power of resistance of the defender was broken by &quot;moral, material and physical degradation&quot;, while the attacker retained the ability to continue the offensive; a breakthrough was unlikely but not ruled out. Co-ordination of artillery and infantry was fundamental to the process, in which artillery would destroy defences and then infantry would occupy them, infantry objectives being determined by the capacity of artillery to prepare the way and limit casualties.

Artillery bombardments were to be co-ordinated with infantry attacks, various types of artillery being given targets suitable for their characteristics, for the cumulative destruction of field defences and the killing of German infantry. Heavy artillery and mortars were to be used for the destruction of field fortifications, howitzers and light mortars for the destruction of trenches, machine-gun and observation posts; heavy guns and mortars to destroy fortified villages and concrete strong points. Longer-range guns were to engage German artillery with counter-battery fire, to deprive German infantry of artillery support during the attack, when French infantry were at their most vulnerable. Wire cutting was to be performed by field artillery, firing high-explosive (HE) shells and supported by specialist wire-cutting sections of infantry, which would go out the night before an attack. During the attack, the field artillery would fire a linear barrage on trenches and the edges of woods and villages. Infantry tactics were to be based on reconnaissance, clear objectives, liaison with flanking units and the avoidance of disorganisation within attacking units. General attacks would need to be followed by the systematic capture of remaining defences to obtain jumping-off positions for the next general attack.

====British====

In 1915, British tactical thinking had been based on the experience of its Western Front battles, particularly the Battle of Loos in September and the study of French and German experience in translated manuals and pamphlets. British planners knew the importance of organised artillery firepower and the integration of types of weapons and equipment. Creeping barrages, smoke screens and cloud gas discharges were to be used along with aircraft, Stokes mortars (a light trench mortar), Lewis guns (a light machine-gun) and elaborate signals systems to counter the chronic lack of communication, once infantry advanced beyond their telephone system as soon as they attacked. Troops were to advance in a succession of lines grouped into waves, followed by parties to consolidate captured ground or pass through the leading troops and continue the advance.

The 9th (Scottish) Division had attacked at Loos with four battalions on a front wide, each battalion in three waves. A second battalion followed each of the leading battalions in the same formation, ready to leapfrog beyond and a second brigade followed the first as a reserve. Six lines of infantry, with the soldiers apart had confronted the German defence. Lines and waves had been made thinner and shallower after 1915. On 14 July 1916, in the attack on Longueval, the 9th (Scottish) Division advanced with four battalions. Companies were arranged in columns of platoons, creating four platoon waves apart. One of the attacking brigades advanced with each battalion on a two-company front with two companies behind and a second battalion following on. Each section of the front was attacked by sixteen platoon waves. Six platoons had attacked on a front of about , roughly one soldier every .

====German====
On the Somme front, the construction plan ordered by Falkenhayn in January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt deep to two belts deep and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one trench to three, dug apart, to create a front position, the first trench (, fighting or battle trench) occupied by sentry groups, the second (, accommodation trench) for the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for An intermediate line of strongpoints () about behind the front position, wired for all-round defence, had also been built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve lines, renamed the second position, which was as well built and wired as the first position. The second position was beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop an advance for long enough to move artillery forward.

==Prelude==

===Anglo-French preparations===

====Aircraft====
For long-distance reconnaissance, bombing and attacks on (the Imperial German Flying Corps up to October, then , [German Air Force]), the 9th (Headquarters) Wing of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was moved to the Somme front, with 21, 27, 60 squadrons and part of 70 Squadron. The Fourth Army had the support of IV Brigade RFC, with two squadrons of the 14th (Army) Wing, four squadrons of the 3rd Wing and 1 Kite Balloon Squadron, with a section for each corps. Corps squadrons, 3, 4, 9 and 15 had for counter-battery work, for contact patrol, trench reconnaissance, destructive bombardment and other duties and nine aircraft in reserve. VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Snow) was given 8 Squadron with and 5 Kite Balloon Section. On the Somme the RFC had against the German 2nd Army aircraft establishment, which also had to face the French on either side of the Somme (The Anglo-French air effort considerably outnumbered the Germans until mid-July). Protection for corps aircraft was to be provided by standing patrols of pairs of aircraft and offensive sweeps by the two army squadrons. Bombing attacks were to be made on the railways behind the German front, with the main effort beginning on 1 July, to ensure that damage could not be repaired before the offensive. Troops, transport columns, supply dumps and headquarters behind the battlefront were to be attacked and the ammunition depots at Mons, Namur and Lille were to be specially attacked. The French Sixth Army (General Émile Fayolle), had 

====Artillery====

The British had substantially increased the amount of artillery on the Western Front after the Battle of Loos in late 1915 but the length of front to be bombarded on the Somme led to the preparatory bombardment being planned to last for five days. There had been a debate about the merits of a short hurricane bombardment but there were insufficient guns quickly to destroy German field defences and be certain that barbed wire was cut, given the dependence of the artillery on air observation and the uncertain weather. The artillery had to cut barbed wire and neutralise German artillery with counter-battery fire. The British artillery fired more than shells during the preliminary bombardment, more than in the first year of the war. On 1 July, another were fired; the guns could be heard on Hampstead Heath, away. While this weight of bombardment was new for the British, it was common on the Western Front; at the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915, there had been a six-day preparatory bombardment with over shells. British shell production had increased since the shell scandal of 1915 but quality had been sacrificed for quantity. Shrapnel shells were virtually useless against entrenched positions and required accurate fuze settings to cut wire; very little high-explosive ammunition had been manufactured for field artillery. The French Sixth Army had guns and howitzers, with a much larger supply of high-explosive ammunition for field artillery and far more experienced personnel.

====Cavalry====
In March, the two British cavalry corps were disbanded and the divisions distributed to the armies and the new Reserve Corps (General Hubert Gough). In June, the Reserve Corps was reinforced and became the Reserve Army. The Reserve Army cavalry was to operate combined with infantry and artillery, ready to act as a &quot;conveyor belt&quot;, to exploit a success by the Fourth Army, with the 25th Division in the lead followed by two cavalry divisions and then II Corps. In mid-June, II Corps was transferred to the Fourth Army; the French Sixth Army contained four cavalry divisions. In late June, favourable intelligence reports and the reduction of the French commitment for the Somme offensive led to a change of plan by the British. Should the German army collapse, the cavalry was to follow up, capture Bapaume and take post on the right flank, to provide a flank guard of all-arms detachments facing east, as the main body of cavalry and the infantry advanced northwards. The 1st, 2nd (Indian) and 3rd Cavalry divisions were to assemble by zero hour west of Albert around Buire, Bresle, Bonny and La Neuville, ready to move forward or remain and then return to billets behind Amiens depending on events.

====Infantry====
A BEF manual published on 8 May 1916 (SS 109, &quot;Training of Divisions For Offensive Action&quot;), described successions of lines to add driving power to the attack, to reach the objective with the capacity to consolidate the captured ground against counter-attack. In the Fourth Army Tactical Notes of May 1916, battalions were allowed to attack on a front of in about apart. Supporting lines were to pass through the leading ones, to avoid excessive demands on the energy and ability of individual soldiers. Weight of numbers was rejected as a tactic; each platoon was to carry half the burden of a brigade attack for a few minutes, before being relieved by a fresh wave. Platoons were divided into functions, fighting, mopping-up, support and carrying; the fighting platoons were to press on as the moppers-up secured the ground behind them. Support and carrying platoons could pick their way through artillery barrages with the tools and weapons needed to consolidate and defeat German counter-attacks.

Some troops in carrying platoons had about of equipment and tools, whereas troops in the advanced platoons carried a rifle, bayonet, of ammunition, iron ration (an emergency ration of preserved food, tea, sugar and salt), two grenades, pick, shovel or entrenching tool, four empty sandbags, two gas helmets, wire cutters, a smoke candle and a water-bottle. In the French army, the experience of 1915 showed that despite the power of French bombardments, infantry would enter a chaotic environment, full of German pockets of resistance and individuals who had been by-passed. By mid-1916 much of the French infantry in the Sixth Army were specialist rifle-and-bayonet men, bombers, rifle grenadiers or light machine-gun crews. Attacking waves were spread wider and companies trained to manoeuvre in small groups, to get behind surviving German defences, as (trench cleaners) armed with hand-grenades and revolvers, searched captured ground for stray Germans and hidden machine-gunners, although such methods did not come into general use until later in the year.

====Mining====

The chalk soil of the Somme was ideal for tunnelling and the British inherited a number of mine workings from the French army. The British tunnelling companies placed 19 mines beneath the German front positions and prepared Russian saps from the British front line into no man&#x27;s land, to be opened at zero hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. The mines on the Somme were the largest yet in the war. The mines were to destroy the German defences and to provide shelter in no man&#x27;s land for the advancing infantry. Eight large and eleven small mines were prepared for the first day of the battle; three large mines of up to and seven mines around .

When the mines were blown, infantry were to rush forward to seize the craters; the largest mines, each containing of ammonal, were on either side of the Albert–Bapaume road near La Boisselle, Y Sap mine north of the road and Lochnagar mine to the south. H3, the other large mine was planted under Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt near Beaumont Hamel, containing of explosive. The mines were to be detonated at two minutes before zero hour, except for the Hawthorn Ridge mine, which was to be sprung at (The small mine at Kasino Point was mistimed and blown after the infantry attack had commenced.)

====Supply====

From 1 January to 3 July 1916 the BEF was reinforced by and the number of heavy guns increased from The new divisions needed supply trains a week to meet daily needs and a large number of extra trains to transport heavy artillery ammunition. Until mid-June, ammunition supply for the BEF needed per week, then rose to 45 to 90 trains a week, to deliver of munitions. Ammunition expenditure became a concern by 12 July but deliveries to the area behind the Fourth Army kept pace, although transport from railheads to the guns was not always maintained. In the weeks before 1 July, an extra seven trains a day were sufficient to deliver ammunition. In the rear of the Fourth Army, huge encampments were built for troops, horses, artillery and workshops, dumps were filled with equipment, reservoirs and pipelines.

Power stations, light railways roads and telephone networks were constructed and more than of petrol per month was delivered for the lorry fleet, moving supplies up to from railheads to the front line. A million Brodie helmets were delivered between January and June. In the 37th Division area, were needed to dig of trenches, jumping-off points, command-posts, dug-outs, machine-gun emplacements and ammunition stores, for wiring and for maintenance. In the French Sixth Army sector, one railway line from Amiens led to Bray-sur-Somme on the north bank but on the south bank there were no rail lines; road convoys carried supplies from Amiens to Foucaucourt-en-Santerre.

====Intelligence====

In March and April, eight German divisions were believed to be in reserve opposite the British from the Somme to the North Sea coast. Divisions in reserve behind the 4th Army were then moved south to Artois in the 6th Army area. From 4 to 14 June, the success of the Brusilov Offensive became apparent and agent reports showed increased railway movement from Belgium to Germany. The final BEF military intelligence estimate before 1 July had battalions opposite the Fourth Army and in reserve or close enough to reach the battlefield in the first week. Five of the seven German divisions in reserve had been engaged at Verdun and some divisions had been transferred from France to the Eastern Front. Men of the 1916 conscription class were appearing among German prisoners of war, suggesting that the German army had been weakened and that the British could break down the German front line and force a battle of manoeuvre on the defenders. In late June, the British part of the Somme plan was amended, rapidly to capture Bapaume and envelop the German defences northwards to Arras, rather than southwards to Péronne. An increase in the number of trains moving from Germany to Belgium was discovered but the quality of German troops opposite the British was thought to have been much reduced. The true number of German divisions in reserve in France was ten, with six opposite the British, double the number the British knew about. Reports of work continuing on the German defences opposite the Fourth Army in March and April led the planners to adopt a less optimistic view, particularly due to the news about very deep shell-proof shelters being dug under German front trenches, which were far less vulnerable to bombardment.

===Plan===

British planning for the offensive had begun in April, with a Fourth Army proposal for a methodical advance to the high ground around Thiepval and thence to the Bapaume–Péronne road. Haig had exhaustive negotiations with Joffre and rejected the concept in favour of the capture of the ridge north of Péronne to assist a French crossing of the Somme further south. Diversion of French divisions to Verdun and the assumption by the British of the main role in the offensive, led to revisions of the plan towards an ambitious attempt at strategic attrition, through a breakthrough and a battle of manoeuvre with distant objectives. The French Sixth Army, in &quot;GAN&quot;, was the last of the three French armies originally intended for the Somme, the Tenth Army and Second Army having been sent to Verdun. Joffre placed XX Corps north of the river, next to the British XIII Corps, the southernmost Fourth Army formation. British plans were made by a process of negotiation between Haig and General Henry Rawlinson, the Fourth Army commander. Haig became more optimistic at what could be achieved early in an offensive, given the examples of Gorlice-Tarnów in 1915 and at Verdun early in 1916. Rawlinson favoured a methodical attack from the beginning of the offensive, in which belts of the German defences about deep, would be pulverised by artillery and then occupied by infantry. An attempt to reach deeper objectives towards the German second position, risked infantry being counter-attacked beyond the cover of field artillery but had the advantage of exploiting a period when German artillery was being withdrawn.
On 16 April, Rawlinson announced the objectives to the corps commanders, in which III, X and VIII corps would capture Pozières, Grandcourt and Serre on the first day and XIII and XV corps would have objectives to be agreed later. On 19 April, Rawlinson wrote that an attempt to reach the German second line on the first day was doubtful, an extension of the attack in the south on Montauban required another division and the inclusion of Gommecourt to the north, was beyond the resources of the Fourth Army. Rawlinson also wrote that long bombardment was dependent on the French, the availability of ammunition and the endurance of gun-crews; the exploitation of a successful attack would need a substantial number of fresh divisions.

The process of discussion and negotiation also took place between Rawlinson and the corps commanders and between corps and divisional commanders. For the first time daily objectives were set, rather than an unlimited advance and discretion was granted in the means to achieve them. When the frontage of attack had been decided, corps headquarters settled the details and arranged the building of the infrastructure of attack: dugouts, magazines, observation posts, telephone lines, roads, light railways, tramways and liaison with neighbouring corps and the RFC. For the first time, the army headquarters co-ordinated the artillery arrangements with an Army Artillery Operation Order, in which tasks and timetable were laid down and corps artillery officers left to decide the means to achieve them.

On 16 June, Haig discussed the Anglo-French intentions for the campaign, which were to relieve pressure on the French at Verdun, assist Italy and Russia by preventing the transfer of divisions from the Western Front and to inflict losses on the (German army in the west), through the capture of Pozières Ridge from Montauban to the Ancre, the area from the Ancre to Serre to protect the flank, then exploit the position gained according to circumstances. If German resistance collapsed, an advance east would be pressed far enough to pass through the German defences and the attack would turn north, to envelop the German defences as far as Monchy le Preux near Arras, with cavalry on the outer flank to defend against a counter-attack. Should a continuation of the advance beyond the first objective not be possible, the main effort could be transferred elsewhere, while the Fourth Army continued to mount local attacks.

On 28 June, the Fourth Army headquarters instructed that if the Germans collapsed, the closest infantry would exploit without waiting for cavalry; the 19th (Western) and 49th (West Riding) divisions (in local reserve) would be committed along the Albert–Bapaume road and parallel to it to the north. The cavalry, which had assembled west of Albert, was not to move until roads had been cleared for their advance. Haig had formulated a plan in which success of any magnitude could be exploited but Rawlinson had a much more modest intention of small advances onto high ground and pauses to consolidate, to repulse German counter-attacks, which led to an &quot;unhappy compromise&quot;.

===German preparations===

Many of the German units on the Somme had arrived in 1914 and made great efforts to fortify the defensive line, particularly with barbed-wire entanglements beyond the front trench, with fewer troops. Railways, roads and waterways connected the battlefront to the Ruhr, the source of material for , dug-outs underground, big enough for each, excavated every . In February 1916, following the (Autumn Battle, Second Battle of Champagne) in 1915, a third defensive position another back from the was begun and was nearly complete on the Somme front when the battle began. The German artillery was organised in (barrage sectors); each infantry officer was expected to know the batteries covering his section of the front line and the batteries had to be ready to engage fleeting targets. A telephone system with lines deep back from the front line linked the artillery.

The Somme defences had two inherent weaknesses that the rebuilding had not remedied. The front trenches were on a forward slope, lined by white chalk from the subsoil and easily seen by observers on the British side of no man&#x27;s land. The defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front-trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second position, all within of the front line; most troops were within of the front line, in the new deep dugouts. The concentration of troops forward guaranteed that they would face the bulk of an artillery bombardment, directed by ground observers on clearly marked lines. Digging and wiring of a new third position had begun in May; civilians were moved away and stocks of ammunition and hand-grenades were increased in the front-line.

By mid-June, General Fritz von Below (commander of the 2nd Army) and Crown Prince Rupprecht (commander of the 6th Army) expected an attack on the 2nd Army, which held the front from north of Gommecourt to Noyon south of the Somme. Falkenhayn was more concerned about an offensive in Alsace-Lorraine and an attack on the 6th Army that held the front north of the 2nd Army, from Gommecourt to St Eloi near Ypres. In April, Falkenhayn had suggested a spoiling attack by the 6th Army but the demands of the offensive at Verdun made it impossible. In May, Below proposed a preventive attack (a suggestion latter reduced, in June, to an operation from Ovillers to St Pierre Divion) but was only assigned one more artillery regiment, some labour battalions and captured Russian heavy artillery. On 6 June, Below reported that air reconnaissance showed that attacks at Fricourt and Gommecourt were possible and that the French troops south of the Somme had been reinforced. XVII Corps held the ground opposite the French but it was overstretched, with twelve regiments holding of front line with no reserves.

In mid-June, Falkenhayn remained sceptical of an offensive on the Somme, as a great success would lead to operations in Belgium; an offensive in Alsace-Lorraine would take the war and its devastation into Germany. More railway activity, fresh digging and camp extensions around Albert opposite the 2nd Army was seen by German air observers on spies reported an imminent offensive. On 24 June, a British prisoner spoke of a five-day bombardment to begin on 26 June and local units expected an attack within days. On 27 June, 14 observation balloons were visible, one for each British division. No German reinforcements were sent to the area until 1 July and only then to the 6th Army, that had also been given control of the three divisions in &quot;OHL&quot; reserve behind it. At Verdun, on 24 June, Crown Prince Wilhelm was ordered to conserve troops, ammunition and equipment and further restrictions were imposed on 1 July when two divisions were taken under &quot;OHL&quot; command. By 30 June, the German air strength on the 2nd Army front was six (reconnaissance flights) with four (artillery flights) with (Bomber-Fighter Squadron 1) with (Bomber-Fighter Flight 32) with and a (single-seat fighter detachment) with , a total of .

==Battle==

===French Sixth Army===

====XXXV Corps====

South of the river, the XXXV Corps (the 51st, 61st and 121st Divisions, backed by of heavy artillery) attacked two hours after the offensive began on the north bank. The 61st Division was right-flank guard for the I Colonial Corps near the river. A French attack of any great size on the south bank had been considered impossible by the German command and after the 10th Bavarian Division was transferred north of the river to reinforce the XIV Reserve Corps, divisional frontages were made even wider on the south side of the river, the three remaining divisions of XVII Corps using their third regiment to fill the gap at the cost of having no reserve. The French preliminary bombardment caused the Germans many casualties and destroyed many machine-guns and mortars. When the attack began, concealed by mist, the German defenders were surprised and overrun. The French artillery had batteries per of front, balloons were opposite the German 11th Division alone and French artillery observation aircraft were flown so low by their pilots over Estrées that German soldiers could see the faces of the crews. The division had only two field artillery regiments and part of one regiment sent as reinforcement, with no heavy guns for counter-battery fire, except for periodic support from a small number of heavy guns covering all of the south side of the river.

The German artillery group around Estrées, Soyécourt and Fay attempted a systematic bombardment of the French front line on 30 June. The French replied with shells on one German field regiment alone, which knocked out three guns. By the time of the attack of 1 July, German artillery on the south bank had been hit by and had almost been silenced by Only eight heavy batteries were available to the Germans on the south bank; at the French barrage lifted off the German front line and three mines were blown under a redoubt at the village of Fay. A measure of surprise was gained, despite losses to German flanking fire from beyond the southern flank of the attack. Grenadier Regiment 10 had been subjected to a &quot;torrent&quot; of fire overnight, which had forced the German infantry to shelter in mine galleries. A gas bombardment was synchronised with the French infantry attack and the mine explosions at killed many of the sheltering troops. By the German defences had been overwhelmed and the garrisons killed or captured; such reinforcements as existed were moved forward to occupy the second position south of Assevillers.

====I Colonial Corps====
On the south bank, the I Colonial Corps (2nd, 3rd, 16th Colonial and the 99th Territorial divisions along with ) also attacked two hours after the main assault. The 2nd and 3rd Colonial divisions, advanced between XXXV Corps and the river and overran the first line of the German 121st Division, holding the line south from the Somme, in fifteen minutes, taking Dompierre-Bequincourt. On the French left flank, Frise held out until the village was re-bombarded and then taken by a second attack at The 2nd and 3rd Colonial divisions began probing of the German second position held by the III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 60 around Assevillers and Herbécourt. Assevillers was captured at Herbécourt was attacked from the north-west at and captured, then lost to a German counter-attack. The colonial divisions took for very few casualties. The attack on the south bank had advanced .

====XX Corps====

North of the Somme, the French XX Corps consisted of the 11th, 39th, 72nd and 153rd divisions, with of heavy artillery. The 11th and 39th divisions attacked at the commanders of the 1st Liverpool Pals (part of the 30th Division (XIII Corps) and the French 153rd Infantry Regiment advancing together. At , north-west of Curlu, which contained many machine-guns and was protected by Menuisiers Trench further forward, the attack went &quot;like clockwork&quot;. The 79th Regiment, whose final objective was beyond the start line, found that the French bombardment had destroyed much of the German fortifications and that the creeping barrage kept the Germans under cover. Only at (in the 39th Division area, where part of the wood was held by the Germans for several days) and at Curlu (in the 11th Division area on the north bank) were the Germans able to conduct an organised defence.

The 37th Regiment (11th Division) attacked Curlu and received massed small-arms fire; the regiment was repulsed from the western fringe of the village before attacks were suspended for a re-bombardment, by which time the village was outflanked on both sides. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 6 (BRIR 6) recorded the first attack at after drumfire (so many shells exploding that the reports merged into a rumble) which began at followed by two more until drumfire fell again at and the remaining garrison was ordered to retire. Most of BRIR 6 was thrown in piecemeal from the river Somme to Montauban and destroyed, suffering The French did not exploit their success, because the British did not advance to their second objective beyond Montauban. Four counter-attacks from Hardecourt were repulsed and by mid-morning had been taken and an advance of had been achieved.

===British Fourth Army===

====XIII Corps====
The southern flank of the British line was held by XIII Corps, which attacked Montauban with the New Army 18th (Eastern) and 30th divisions. The 30th Division took its objectives by and the 18th (Eastern) Division completed its advance by German defences south of the Albert–Bapaume road were far less developed than to the north and were visible from territory held by the British and French. The infantry advanced behind a creeping barrage and had the benefit of the heavy artillery of French XX Corps to the south. Much of the German artillery in the area had been put out of action during the preliminary bombardment; the German second and third lines were incomplete and had no deep dugouts, except in the first trench.

On the right of the British attack, most of the German infantry and machine-guns were destroyed before the British advance; a river mist hampered the remaining defenders. In the chaos, alarmist reports were received that Bernafay and Trônes woods had been captured and before noon, every available man, including clerks and cooks was ordered forward to the second position. The 12th Reserve Division was ordered to prepare a counter-attack from Montauban to Mametz overnight but by midnight the division had only reached the second position. The 30th Division suffered the 18th (Eastern) Division RIR 109 and BRIR 6 

====XV Corps====
=====Mametz=====
Mametz village was attacked by the 7th Division, which on the right flank had only of no man&#x27;s land to cross. The infantry advanced behind a creeping field artillery barrage that lifted slowly according to a timetable and moved towards a standing barrage fired by the heavy artillery, that lifted to the next objective at set times. The right and central brigades attacked on a front, from support trenches behind the British front line. Crossing no man&#x27;s land led to few casualties but far more were suffered as the battalions advanced uphill to the village. The east end was captured but several attempts on the north and west ends were repulsed. After a series of bombardments and when British troops further south began to menace the supply routes of the garrison, resistance collapsed and the village was occupied.

The west side of the village was attacked by the 20th Brigade, which had to fight forward for most of the day. The infantry pushed on to ground facing Mametz Wood and Willow Stream, outflanking Fricourt further north, though the objectives beyond Mametz were not reached. Much of the front of the 7th Division was opposite Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 (RIR 109), of the 28th Reserve Division, which should have been relieved on the night of 30 June and which received a warning of the attack from a listening station at La Boisselle. Most of the regiment was caught in their deep shelters under the front trench and cut off from telephone communication. Most of the supporting machine-guns and artillery was put out of action early on. Reinforcements were sent to the second position but not ordered to counter-attack, due to uncertainty about the situation at Montauban and the need to secure Mametz Wood. The 7th Division suffered 

=====Fricourt=====
Fricourt lay in a bend in the front line, which turned eastwards for before running south to the Somme River. XV Corps was to attack either side of the village, to isolate the defenders. The 20th Brigade, 7th Division, was to capture the west end of Mametz and swing left, creating a defensive flank along Willow Stream, facing Fricourt from the south, as the 22nd Brigade waited in the British front line, ready to exploit a German retirement from the village. The 21st Division advance was to pass north of Fricourt, to reach the north bank of Willow Stream beyond Fricourt and Fricourt Wood. To limit enfilade fire from the village, the three Tambour mines were blown beneath the Tambour salient on the west edge of the village, to raise a &quot;lip&quot; of earth, to block the view from the village. The 21st Division made some progress and penetrated to the rear of Fricourt and the 50th Brigade of the 17th (Northern) Division, held the front line opposite the village.

The 10th West Yorkshire Regiment, was required to advance close by Fricourt and suffered the worst battalion losses of the day. A company from the 7th Green Howards made an unplanned attack directly against the village and was annihilated. Reserve Infantry Regiment 111, opposite the 21st Division, were severely affected by the bombardment and many dug-outs were blocked by shell explosions. One company was reduced to before the British attack and a reinforcement party failed to get through the British artillery-fire, taking post in Round Wood, where it was able to repulse the 64th Brigade. The rest of the regimental reserves were used to block the route to Contalmaison. The loss of Mametz and the advance of the 21st Division made Fricourt untenable and the garrison was withdrawn during the night. The 17th Division occupied the village virtually unopposed early on 2 July and took several prisoners. The 21st Division suffered and the 50th Brigade of the 17th Division 

====III Corps====
=====La Boisselle=====
The 34th Division (New Army) was to attack along the Albert–Bapaume road, aided by the blowing of Lochnagar mine and Y Sap mine (the largest mine explosions of the day) either side of La Boisselle. The mine at Y Sap, north of the village, caused no casualties as the Germans had evacuated the area in time but the springing of the Lochnagar mine, south of the village, temporarily trapped German troops in shelters nearby and the position was lost. Parties of the Grimsby Chums got into the Lochnagar mine crater before being pinned down by German small-arms fire. The Tyneside Scottish Brigade was to attack up Mash Valley and against La Boisselle at the Glory Hole ( to the French and to the Germans). The Tyneside Irish were in reserve, ready to advance and capture the second objective from Contalmaison to Pozières.

At zero hour, the Tyneside Scottish Brigade started its advance from the Tara–Usna Line (a British reserve position behind the front line) to cross of open ground before they reached no man&#x27;s land. Despite machine-gun fire, a party of around survived to advance up Sausage Valley, south of La Boisselle, almost to the edge of Contalmaison. The survivors were captured after making the furthest British advance of the day, about . The positions of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 had been severely damaged in the bombardment but the regiment was forewarned of the British attack by a device, which eavesdropped on British telephone signals and allowed the Germans to withdraw before the Y Sap mine exploded. The 34th Division suffered the worst casualties of the day, 

=====Ovillers=====

The 8th Division attacked the Ovillers spur, north of the Albert–Bapaume road. The division had to cross of no man&#x27;s land and advance towards German trenches sited to exploit spurs running down from the ridge. The only approach to the German lines was up Mash Valley, under the guns in La Boisselle to the south, Ovillers to the front and the Thiepval spur to the north. All three brigades attacked, the 23rd Brigade up Mash Valley, where reached the German second trench and then held about of the front trench, until The centre brigade reached the second line, before being forced back to the British front line and the left-hand brigade managed to reach the third trench, while German counter-bombardments cut off the leading troops from reinforcements. Co-ordination by the British artillery and infantry failed, the field artillery lifting to the final objective and the heavy artillery lifting an hour before the attack, leaving the German defenders unmolested as they repulsed the infantry. Ovillers was defended by Infantry Regiment 180, which had suffered in the bombardment. Many of the German defences were smashed, except on their right at The Nab. The British advance was met by massed small-arms fire at , which cut down many men, after which a bombing fight began. British penetrations were contained by German troops in communication trenches on the flanks. The two battalions of the regiment in the area suffered and the 8th Division 

====X Corps====
=====Leipzig salient and Thiepval=====

The salient and Thiepval village were attacked by the New Army 32nd Division. The Glasgow Commercials advanced into no man&#x27;s land at until they were from the German front line. At zero hour, the British rushed the trench before the garrison could react and captured the Redoubt. Attempts to exploit the success were met by machine-gun fire from the (Wonderwork to the British) and the British were not able to advance further. The capture of the redoubt was the only permanent success in the northern sector. The 49th (West Riding) Division, in reserve, went forward mid-morning in support of the 32nd Division, although the commander, Major-General William Rycroft, had suggested that it would have more effect by reinforcing the success of the 36th (Ulster) Division. The 146th Brigade attacked Thiepval through the 32nd Division area and then the 49th (West Riding) Division was ordered to send any uncommitted battalions direct to the 36th (Ulster) Division. The area was defended by two battalions of Reserve Infantry Regiment 99, whose machine-gun posts survived the bombardment, which opened fire as soon as the British attacked. The 3rd Company, Infantry Regiment 180 was annihilated in hand-to-hand fighting at Redoubt. The garrison of Thiepval emerged from the shelters and cellars of the village before the British arrived and cut them down with small-arms fire, leaving a &quot;wall of dead&quot; in front of the position. The 32nd Division suffered and the 49th (West Riding) Division 

=====Schwaben and Stuff redoubts=====
The 36th (Ulster) Division attacked between Thiepval and the Ancre River against Redoubt and gained a &quot;spectacular victory&quot;. The preliminary artillery bombardment, which included support from French batteries firing gas-shell and a smoke screen from trench mortars, was more successful than on other parts of the front north of the Albert–Bapaume road. The infantry crept into no man&#x27;s land before the attack, rushed the German front trench and then pressed on. The defeat of the neighbouring divisions left the 36th (Ulster) Division flanks unsupported and the German defenders on either side were free to rake the division from three sides. German artillery began a barrage () along no man&#x27;s land which isolated the most advanced Irish troops, who briefly reached the German second line, captured Redoubt and closed on Stuff redoubt.

Opposite the 36th (Ulster) Division was III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 (RIR 99) and I and III battalions of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 8 (BRIR 8). The German units suffered severe casualties due to the British bombardment, which destroyed much of the front position, particularly west of Redoubt. The positions were so quickly overrun by the Irish that they received little return fire. II Battalion, BRIR 8 was ordered to recapture the redoubt but the order was delayed and all the troops that could be spared were sent to attack from Goat Redoubt and Grandcourt. In the confusion, few of the German troops were able to assemble; the counter-attack began piecemeal and was repulsed several times, until a bombardment and another attack by two fresh battalions at about forced the Irish out of the redoubt. The 36th (Ulster) Division suffered 

====VIII Corps====

The northern flank of the Fourth Army was held by VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). Three divisions were to attack on the first day, with the 48th (South Midland) Division in reserve, except for two battalions that held a stretch between the Third and Fourth armies and two battalions that were attached to the 4th Division.

=====Beaumont-Hamel=====


The 29th Division attacked towards Beaumont-Hamel. Part of the attack was filmed and showed the detonation of a mine beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt at ten minutes before the infantry attack. The detonation of the mine alerted the Germans and British troops failed to occupy all of the mine crater before German troops could take over the far lip. Many troops of both brigades were shot down in no man&#x27;s land, which was dominated by Redan Ridge and then caught by German artillery barrages. White German signal rockets were seen and taken for British success flares, which led the divisional commander, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle, to order the 88th Brigade from reserve to exploit the success. The brigade included the Newfoundland Regiment, which advanced on open ground from reserve trenches back from the British front line.

The Newfoundland advance avoided the congestion of dead and wounded in communication trenches but many of the troops became casualties to German small-arms fire while still behind their front line. Some Newfoundland troops got across no man&#x27;s land near Y Ravine but were held up by uncut wire. Most of the German shelters and Beaumont-Hamel were derelict and shell-craters overlapped. Reserve Infantry Regiment 119, who had been sheltering under the village in survived and with other units at (Y Ravine) and the and dugouts, engaged the British troops from the wreckage of their trenches. The Newfoundlanders suffered a loss, second only to that of the 10th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, which suffered at Fricourt, south of the Albert–Bapaume road. The 29th Division suffered 

=====Serre=====


The 4th Division attacked between Serre and Beaumont-Hamel, capturing the Quadrilateral () but could not exploit the success, because the Germans repulsed the attacks by the flanking divisions. Crossfire from Beaumont Hamel and Serre and determined counter-attacks held up the 4th Division. Parties of Lancashire Fusiliers, Seaforth Highlanders and troops from the 11th Brigade entered the Quadrilateral, where they were reinforced by a company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers during the night. Except at the Quadrilateral, the 4th Division ended the day back at its start line. No other gains were made and German counter-attacks overnight pushed the parties in the Quadrilateral back until only the Irish Fusiliers remained in the German front line, not having received an order to retreat early on 2 July. The Irish eventually withdrew at with their wounded and three prisoners; the 4th Division suffered In 2006, Grahame Kingston recorded in the division during July.

The 31st Division, a New Army division made up of Pals battalions, was to capture Serre and then turn north to form the northern defensive flank of the Fourth Army. The 31st Division attacked uphill from several copses and the two attacking brigades were engaged by the Germans with small-arms fire, expending against the attack. Small groups of the Accrington Pals and the Sheffield City Battalion managed to cross no man&#x27;s land and reach Serre and a party advanced to Pendant Copse, before being cut off and killed or captured. Reserve Infantry Regiment 121 was confronted by the British attack before all the troops had emerged from their dugouts. More than three infantry sections were blown up in the mine explosion at Hawthorn Redoubt, the rest of the garrison being trapped until the end of the attack. A counter-attack towards the redoubt by two platoons gradually bombed the British back; after an hour only the troops in the remained and it was re-captured during the night. Reserve Infantry Regiment 119 suffered Reserve Infantry Regiment 121 Infantry Regiment 169 the 31st Division suffered 

===British Third Army===
The Third Army (General Edmund Allenby), was to mount a diversion north of the Fourth Army area, with VII Corps. At the Gommecourt Salient, the German trenches curved around a château and its parkland and a gap of separated the Gommecourt diversion from the northern edge of the main attack. Preparations for a pincer movement to catch the garrison in a pocket, were made as obvious as possible to attract German attention. The 56th (1/1st London) Division had prepared jumping-off trenches in no man&#x27;s land and when the attack commenced at swift progress was made. The first three German trenches were captured and a party pushed on towards the rendezvous with the 46th (North Midland) Division. A German barrage descended on no man&#x27;s land, which made it impossible for reinforcements to move forward or for a trench to be dug as a defensive flank to the south and the survivors were forced to withdraw after dark. The 46th (North Midland) Division attack found that the German wire was uncut and the ground littered with unexploded mortar bombs. A smoke screen intended to mask the infantry obscured their view and left the Germans with observation over the attack. The ground was particularly wet and muddy and few troops reached the German trenches; the remaining British troops overran the front line, where German troops were able to emerge from shelters not mopped-up by the supporting battalions pinned down in no man&#x27;s land by the German barrage and engage the British troops from behind.

The British bombardment cut much of the wire at Gommecourt and demolished many trenches, particularly in the area of Infantry Regiment 170 opposite the 56th (1/1st London) Division. The smoke screen obstructed the beginning of the attack and the damage caused by the bombardment blocked many dugout entrances; a counter-attack was swiftly mounted from Redoubt (the Maze), which was not under attack. The counter-attack failed to stop the 56th (1/1st London) Division reaching the third line of trenches, before a converging attack by Infantry Regiment 170 and Reserve Infantry began. The British had consolidated and the counter-attack made little progress, until co-ordinated bombing attacks in the afternoon gradually recovered the position. Opposite the 46th (North Midland) Division, Reserve Infantry took post in time, engaged the attackers while they were crossing no man&#x27;s land but failed to stop the loss of the front trench until a counter-attack from the third trench &quot;annihilated&quot; the leading British troops; the German regiments suffered The 46th (North Midland) Division suffered which was the lowest divisional loss on 1 July. The commander, Major-General Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, was dismissed for the failure. The 56th (1/1st London) Division suffered 

===Air operations===
British Photographic reconnaissance began in October 1915 and in March 1916 intensive British preparations commenced. The IV Brigade of the RFC was formed on 1 April 1916, with six squadrons of aeroplanes and a Kite Balloon squadron; the IV Brigade squadrons were the first to be increased from twelve to eighteen aircraft. On 25 April photographs were taken which revealed the German construction of a third position from Flers northwards to Le Sars, Pys, Irles, Achiet-le-Petit and Ablainzevelle. In mid-May and late June, the German defences opposite the Fourth Army were photographed again. (Imperial German Flying Service) had six reconnaissance flights () with , four artillery flights () with , a bomber-fighter squadron () with a bomber-fighter flight () with and a single-seater fighter detachment () with a strength of 

The IV Brigade corps aircraft were to be protected with line patrols, comprising pairs of aircraft from the army squadrons and offensive sweeps by formations of DH 2 fighters. The concentration of aircraft for the offensive was completed by the arrival on 19 June of the Ninth (headquarters) Wing with three squadrons and one flight, which brought the number of aircraft on the Fourth Army front to eighteen at Gommecourt. The bombing offensive by the RFC was intended to cut railway links behind the Somme front, south of the Valenciennes–Arras railway and west of the lines around Douai, Busigny and Tergnier. Trains were to be attacked in cuttings, railway bridges were to be bombed and the stations at Cambrai, Busigny, St Quentin and Tergnier were to be raided along with the German ammunition depots at Mons, Namur; the station at Lille was also to be attacked. British aircraft and kite balloons were to be used to observe the intermittent bombardment, which began in mid-June and the preliminary bombardment, which commenced on 24 June. Low cloud and rain obstructed air observation of the bombardment, which soon fell behind schedule. On 25 June, aircraft of the four British Armies on the Western Front attacked the German kite balloons opposite; fifteen were attacked, four were shot down by rockets and one bombed, three of the balloons being in the Fourth Army area. Next day three more balloons were shot down opposite the Fourth Army and during German artillery reply to the Anglo-French bombardment, artillery positions were plotted and a Fokker was shot down near Courcelette.

Accurate observation was not possible at dawn on 1 July due to patches of mist but by the general effect of the Anglo-French bombardment could be seen. Observers in contact-patrol aircraft could see lines of British infantry crawling into no man&#x27;s land, ready to attack the German front trench at Each corps and division had a wireless receiving-station for messages from airborne artillery-observers and ground observers were stationed at various points, to receive messages and maps dropped from aircraft. As contact observers reported the progress of the infantry attack, artillery-observers sent many messages to the British artillery and reported the effect of counter-battery fire on German guns. Balloon observers used their telephones to report changes in the German counter-barrage and to direct British artillery on fleeting targets, reporting during the night by flash spotting. Air reconnaissance during the day found little movement on the roads and railways behind the German front; the railways at Bapaume were bombed from Flights to Cambrai, Busigny and Etreux later in the day saw no unusual movement, although German aircraft attacked the observation aircraft all the way to the targets and back, two Rolands being shot down by the escorts. Bombing began the evening before with a raid on the station at St Saveur by six R.E. 7s of 21 Squadron, whose pilots claimed hits on sheds and a second raid around on 1 July hit the station and railway lines; both attacks were escorted and two Fokkers were shot down on the second raid.

Railway bombing was conducted by each with two bombs, at intervals after midday; Cambrai station was hit with seven bombs, for the loss of one aircraft. In the early evening an ammunition train was hit on the line between Aubigny-au-Bac and Cambrai and set on fire, the cargo burning and exploding for several hours. Raids on St Quentin and Busigny were reported to be failures by the crews and three aircraft were lost. All corps aircraft carried bombs to attack billets, transport, trenches and artillery-batteries. Offensive sweeps were flown by 27 and 60 squadrons from but found few German aircraft and only an LVG was forced down. Two sets of line patrols were flown, one by 24 Squadron DH.2s from Péronne to Pys and Gommecourt from nightfall, which met six German aircraft during the day and forced two down. The second set of patrols by pairs of F.E.2bs were made by 22 Squadron between and dusk, from Longueval to Cléry and Douchy to Miraumont. for a loss of two aircraft and one damaged but prevented attacks on the corps aircraft.

XIII Corps was watched by most of 9 Squadron, which saw the 30th Division troops take the line Dublin Trench–Glatz Redoubt by and the 18th (Eastern) Division take Pommiers Trench and Pommiers Redoubt. At an observer saw a line of flashes on the ground from mirrors carried by 30th Division soldiers on their packs as the British troops moved along Train Alley towards Montauban. A German artillery battery began to fire from Bernafay Wood and the pilot machine-gunned the crews from , putting the battery out of action. On return towards the British lines, the crew saw Montauban being occupied and 18th (Eastern) Division troops advancing up the ridge to the west of the village ,the pilot flew low along the ridge and gave the troops a wave. By mirrors were seen flashing along the north edge of Montauban.

The XV Corps attack on either side of Fricourt was observed by parts of 3 and 9 squadrons, which were able to report by evening that the 21st Division and the 34th Division to the north had advanced deeply into the German defensive positions above Fricourt. The 7th Division had advanced beyond Mametz, forming a defensive flank on the left and linking on the right with XIII Corps. Troops from III Corps and XV Corps lit red flares, which were quickly reported by observers in contact-patrol aircraft. A balloon observer from 3 Kite Balloon Section was able to get the artillery to re-bombard Alley, after British troops were forced out by a German counter-attack, a second British attack in the afternoon took the trench easily. Most of 3 Squadron watched over the disastrous III Corps attack at La Boisselle and Ovillers and saw some 34th Division troops reach Peake Wood north of Fricourt.

The attacks by X Corps and VIII Corps, from Thiepval to Serre were observed by crews from 4 and 15 squadrons. Ground observers could see much of the battle and communications were better than on other parts of the front. Some of the deeper British infantry advances could only be seen from the air, particularly those at Redoubt and Pendant Copse. 4 Squadron reported the hurried withdrawal of German artillery between Courcelette and Grandcourt during the afternoon and spotted the massing of German troops at A special flight was sent to Thiepval and the pilot flew by at to examine the ground and report that the British attacks had failed. With 15 Squadron observing the disaster occurring to VIII Corps around Beaumont Hamel, the defeat of the British attacks and the repulse of the troops from the few areas where break-ins had occurred were reported by the aircraft observers.

The VII Corps attack was observed by 8 Squadron, which had photographed during clear weather the day before. The attack of the 46th (North Midland) and 56th (1/1st London) divisions, had a standing patrol of one aircraft each from and then one aircraft for both divisions. No red infantry flares were seen and aircraft flew through the barrage to make visual identifications at low level; by the end of the day German ground fire had made three aircraft unserviceable. One aeroplane flew into a balloon cable near St Amand, damaging the aircraft; the crew escaping unhurt. Reports from the observation crews related the fate of the leading troops of the 46th (North Midland) Division, who were cut off after over-running the German first line by German troops emerging from underground shelters. Following waves intended to mop-up the German front line were seen pinned down in no man&#x27;s land by artillery and machine-gun barrages. On the 56th (1/1st London) Division front, observers watched the leading British troops capture the first, second and third lines before being cut off by another German barrage in no man&#x27;s land. German infantry were seen to mass and then counter-attack, regaining the third line by midday, the second line by afternoon and the first line late in the evening.

===German 2nd Army===
By May 1916, eight German divisions held the front from Roye northwards to Arras with three in reserve. The German defence of the south bank of the Somme was the responsibility of XVII Corps (General Günther von Pannewitz), with three divisions. On the north bank the XIV Reserve Corps ( Hermann von Stein) with two divisions held the line from the Somme to the Ancre and the Guard Corps (General Karl von Plettenberg) with three divisions held the ground north of the Ancre opposite Serre and Gommecourt. On 20 June, British heavy artillery bombarded German communications behind the front line as far back as Bapaume and then continued intermittently until the evening of 22 June. At dawn on 24 June, a shrapnel barrage began on the German front position and villages nearby. At noon, more accurate fire began before increasing in intensity around Thiepval as heavy batteries commenced firing and in the evening, a light rain turned the German positions to mud.

On 25 June, heavy artillery-fire predominated, smashing trenches and blocking dugouts. Variations in the intensity of fire indicated likely areas to be attacked; the greatest weight of fire occurring at Mametz, Fricourt and Ovillers; during the night the German commanders prepared their defences around the villages and ordered the second line to be manned. After an overnight lull, the bombardment increased again on 26 June, gas being discharged at towards Beaumont Hamel and Serre, before the bombardment increased in intensity near Thiepval, then suddenly stopped. The German garrison took post and fired red rockets to call for artillery support, which placed a barrage in no man&#x27;s land. Later in the afternoon huge mortar bombs began to fall, destroying shallower dug-outs, a super-heavy gun began to bombard the main German strong-points, as smaller guns pulverised the villages close to the front line, from which civilians were hurriedly removed.

German troops billeted in the villages moved into the open to avoid the shelling and on heavy rain added to the devastation, as the bombardment varied from steady accurate shelling to shell-storms and periods of quiet. At night British patrols moved into no man&#x27;s land; prisoners taken by the Germans said that they were checking on the damage and searching for German survivors. German interrogators gleaned information suggesting that an offensive would come either side of the Somme and Ancre rivers at on 29 June. All of the German infantry stood to with reinforcements but the bombardment resumed in the afternoon, rising to drumfire several times. Artillery-fire concentrated on small parts of the front, then lines of shells moved forward into the depth of the German defences. Periodic gas discharges and infantry probes continued but German sentries watching through periscopes were often able to warn the garrisons in time to react. The bombardment on 30 June repeated the pattern of the earlier days, by when, much of the German surface defences had been swept away, look-out shelters and observation posts were in ruins and many communication trenches had disappeared.

On the night of the bombardment fell on rear defences and communication trenches; at dawn British aircraft &quot;filled the sky&quot;, captive balloons rose into the air at and an unprecedented barrage began all along the German front, until when the bombardment abruptly stopped. The remaining German trench garrisons began to leave their shelters and set up machine-guns in the remains of trenches and shell-holes, which proved difficult to spot and allowed the occupants to change direction, easily to face threats from all directions. Where the British infantry advanced close behind the barrage the German defenders were often overrun and at Montauban, Mametz and around Fricourt, the Germans were rushed while most were still underground. Further north, the Germans had time to emerge and stopped most attacks in no man&#x27;s land.

The 26th Reserve Division held a front of , from Ovillers to Serre, four regiments occupied the first line with two battalions each, one in the support line and one in reserve. The Germans emerged to see lines of British infantry in no man&#x27;s land and opened rapid fire on them, lines and waves falling down, reforming and moving forward. Some German infantry stood on trench parapets to aim better and red rockets were fired to call for artillery barrages on no man&#x27;s land, which shattered the British infantry formations. The survivors kept going and began a bombing fight close to the German line, which was defeated, except at the Redoubt, which was quickly sealed off by German flanking parties and between Thiepval and the Ancre, where the Irish advanced towards Grandcourt away. Counter-attacks forced the British back to the German front trench after dark.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson wrote that the conventional account of the day has soldiers burdened by of equipment, obeying &quot;doltish&quot; orders to walk shoulder-to-shoulder towards the German lines and being mown down by German machine-gunners, who had time to climb out of shelters and man the parapet. Prior and Wilson ascribed the origin of this narrative to John Buchan in &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot; (1917) in which the bravery of soldiers is extolled, rather than faulty infantry tactics being criticised. Prior and Wilson traced the narrative through the writing of B. H. Liddell Hart, J. E. Edmonds the official historian, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, Martin Middlebrook, Correlli Barnett and Paul Kennedy. In 1970, Anthony Farrar-Hockley questioned the narrative but reverted to the orthodox view soon after. Prior and Wilson did not dispute the facts of and but wrote that the Tactical Notes issued by Rawlinson did not dictate the way that advances were to be made but were &quot;ambiguous&quot;, referring to &quot;celerity of movement&quot;, &quot;a steady pace&quot; and &quot;a rapid advance of some lightly-equipped men&quot; and did not prescribe a formation to be adopted for the advance.

At the northern end of the British front, the leading brigade of the 31st Division advanced into no man&#x27;s land before zero hour, to rush the German front trench when the barrage lifted. Some units of the 4th Division advanced from the British front line in formations led by snipers and skirmishers. In the 29th Division some battalions &quot;marched&quot; to the German wire and others rushed forward from assembly-trenches dug in no man&#x27;s land. In the 36th (Ulster), 32nd and 8th division areas, some battalions assembled in front of the German wire, ready to rush forward at zero hour and many of the battalions of XV Corps and XIII Corps walked slowly forward in lines behind a creeping barrage. Of in the initial attack, into no man&#x27;s land, ten rushed from the British front trench and twelve advanced at a steady pace behind a creeping barrage. Prior and Wilson found that the behaviour of the British infantry had less effect than the behaviour of the German infantry, which was determined by the fire of the British guns. Where the German defences and garrisons had been destroyed, the British infantry succeeded. When significant numbers of German machine-gunners survived, especially when supported by artillery, the British attack failed. On the French front, the artillery preparation was almost wholly effective in destroying German defences and killing German infantry in their underground shelters. The prevalence and effectiveness of killing-machines determined the result and in such an environment, a soldier with a bayonet was obsolete and infantry formations irrelevant.

In 2009, J. P. Harris described the success of the French, XIII Corps and XV Corps, the extent of British casualties for ground gained and Haig&#x27;s responsibility for the British casualties. Harris wrote of the inferior German defences on the French front, surprise, superior French artillery and better infantry tactics than those of the British. The French attacked in the south, as did the two most successful British corps, in this area only the first line was an objective. Harris wrote that the German 2nd Army was often ignored in analyses of the First Day and that the main defensive effort was made in the north, the area of greatest German success. Terrain in the south, Anglo-French air superiority and closer objectives, tended to concentrate Allied artillery-fire, which was better-observed and more accurate than on the hillier ground to the north.

In the south, barbed wire was cut, the German fortifications were &quot;exceptionally&quot; damaged and a crude form of creeping barrage preceded the infantry to their objectives. Harris held Haig responsible for the extension of the objectives in the north to the German second position, which diluted the density of British artillery-fire, although no study had been made of the details of the preliminary bombardment and caution must accompany a conclusion that bombardment of the closer objectives was unduly dissipated. Harris concluded that the attack front was too broad and that Rawlinson should be held responsible with Haig for attempting to advance on a front. Despite being under no diplomatic pressure from the French or political pressure from London to obtain swift success, the British tried to do too much too quickly, unlike the French Sixth Army which made short advances with the support of massive amounts of artillery-fire.

In 2009, William Philpott wrote that the post-war French Official History gave five pages to 1 July, with one paragraph on the British attack and that the German official history covered the day in The British Official History described the day in with one page on the French success. In Joffre&#x27;s memoirs the French victory was ascribed to &quot;the excellent work of the artillery&quot; and German underestimation of French offensive power due to the Battle of Verdun, leading them to make their principal defensive effort in the north. Many British infantry had been attacked from behind, after failing to mop up captured German positions. This military explanation was insufficient for many British commentators, who blamed &quot;anachronistic&quot; &quot;sword wavers&quot; for leading volunteers to an unnecessary slaughter. The French success, based on the experience of 1915 was overlooked, as was the French expectation of more quick victories being disappointed, as the battle became a counterpart to the long attrition campaign at Verdun. Philpott also described the Germans being written out of the British narrative of useless sacrifice. The Anglo-French armies had gained an advantage on 1 July by forcing the collapse of the German defences for , either side of the Somme.. In the early afternoon a broad breach existed north of the river but the &quot;break in&quot; was in an unexpected place and exploitation had to be improvised.

===Casualties===
Philpott wrote that the &quot;gory scene&quot; behind the British front showed that something had gone wrong. In the evening of 1 July, Haig wrote in his diary,

VIII Corps &quot;had&quot; left their trenches and over became casualties. Edmonds wrote that for the loss of Britain and Ireland&#x27;s &quot;finest manhood&quot; there was only a small gain of ground, although an advance of on a front and minor advances elsewhere, was the furthest achieved by the British since trench warfare began. Only prisoners had been taken and none of the captured ground north of the Albert–Bapaume road, except at the Leipzig Redoubt, had been held. Before the battle, Rawlinson had requested 18 ambulance trains but only three were provided and these departed part-filled, before many of the wounded had been brought to casualty clearing stations, which had capacity for only Casualties were left untended in the open and it was not until 4 July that the Fourth Army medical services had treated all the wounded (some casualties reached hospitals in England still wearing field dressings). As night fell, survivors began to make their way back to the British trenches and stretcher-bearers went into no man&#x27;s land. Major-General Ingouville-Williams, commander of the 34th Division, participated in the search and some medical orderlies continued after dawn broke. At Beaumont-Hamel, two British medical officers arranged a truce and in other places movement in no man&#x27;s land was fired on. Victoria Crosses were awarded to Robert Quigg and Geoffrey Cather (posthumous) for rescuing wounded.

Some casualties survived for up to a week in no man&#x27;s land, scavenging rations from the dead before being rescued. At the Fourth Army headquarters believed that there had been by 3 July the staff thought that there had been and by 6 July the count had risen to The Third Army diversion at Gommecourt cost VII Corps 6,758 casualties against 1,212 German. The final total of casualties, whom had been killed, was not calculated for some time; the French Sixth Army suffered and the German 2nd Army suffered In 1971 Martin Middlebrook wrote that whereas German units normally submitted a casualty return every ten days, many submitted a special daily return for 1 July. It is possible to estimate that German forces on the British sector (including Gommecourt) suffered 6,000 killed or wounded and 2,200 taken prisoner. In 2013, Ralph Whitehead wrote that from 1 to 10 July, the 2nd Army commanded 21 divisions, the original divisions present on 1 July and reinforcements, with a ration strength of 469,585 men. In the ten-day reporting period (10 ) from 1 to 10 July 7,539 men reported sick, 22,095 were recorded as wounded and 24,244 men were listed as killed or missing, leaving 5,786 men recorded as killed; during the same period 5,273 men returned to duty. For 1 July 1916,

===Subsequent operations===
Haig visited the Fourth Army headquarters and discussed the continuation of the attack on 2 July, although in the confused situation the original plan was not changed. Pressure was to be maintained on the Germans to inflict losses and reach ground from which to attack the German second position, with particular emphasis on the capture of Fricourt. Gough, with the Reserve Army ready to exploit a gap was not called on and at Rawlinson requested that he take over X Corps and VIII Corps, to reorganise the front astride the Ancre. The 12th (Eastern) Division was sent to relieve the 8th Division and the 25th Division was moved closer to X Corps. Haig ordered the 23rd and 38th (Welsh) divisions to move towards the Somme front and at the Fourth Army headquarters ordered all corps to continue the attack. Local conditions south of the Albert–Bapaume road led many officers to urge that the German defeat in the area to be exploited with fresh divisions but XIII Corps was ordered to consolidate and prepare to attack Mametz Wood with XV Corps, which was to capture Fricourt and advance towards Contalmaison, still thought to have been captured. III Corps was ordered to attack La Boisselle and Ovillers again and reach Contalmaison and X Corps and VIII Corps were ordered to capture all of the German first position and reach the intermediate line.

In the afternoon of 1 July, the German survivors of the 28th Reserve Division and 12th Division and part of the 10th Bavarian Division at Montauban Ridge, had been driven back to the (second position) from Ginchy to Longueval and Bazentin le Grand. The 12th Division arrived in the evening from Bapaume, was sent towards Combles and Ginchy and at a counter-attack was ordered to regain Montauban Ridge, between Favières Wood and Montauban. One regiment was to advance past the north end of Combles to Guillemont and re-capture the north end of Montauban, a regiment in the centre was to retake Favières Wood and the left regiment was to advance along the north bank of the Somme between Curlu and Maurepas, troops joining in from the second position. Dawn broke at on 2 July, well before the advance reached Bernafay Wood and a British barrage quickly forced back the Germans into Caterpillar Valley. At La Briqueterie the German infantry were quickly repulsed, as was their attack along the river by French infantry south of Favières Wood. The 12th Division suffered many casualties and was withdrawn to the (Green Position) around Maltz Horn Farm, an intermediate position in front of the .

==Commemoration==
For Newfoundland, the first day of battle changed the course of the island&#x27;s history, ending any hope of independence. After the war the Newfoundland government bought at the site of the battalion&#x27;s attack and created the Newfoundland Memorial Park to commemorate the dead, which was opened by Haig on 7 June 1925. Although the rest of Canada celebrates Canada Day on 1 July, it remains Memorial Day in Newfoundland and Labrador.

<text>Scott Andrew Caan (born August 23, 1976) is an American actor, director, photographer, writer, and former rapper. He received his breakthrough role in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; as Turk Malloy, whom he played in the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s trilogy&quot;, and starred as Detective Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams in the CBS television series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2010–2020), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Caan had a recurring role as manager Scott Lavin in the HBO television series &quot;Entourage&quot; (2009–2011). In the 1990s, he was a rapper and was a part of hip hop group The Whooliganz with The Alchemist, under the pseudonym Mad Skillz.

==Early life==
Caan was born on August 23, 1976, in Los Angeles, California, the son of actor James Caan (March 26, 1940 – July 6, 2022) and Sheila Marie Ryan (September 17, 1952 – September 18, 2012), an actress and former model. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Germany. He has an older half-sister and three younger half-brothers.

==Career==
Caan was a roadie for the hip hop groups Cypress Hill and House of Pain. Caan was also a member of the hip hop group The Whooliganz as Mad Skillz (with producer and fellow MC The Alchemist as Mudfoot). The Whooliganz signed a record deal with Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. records and recorded the album &quot;Make Way for the W&quot;, but after their first single &quot;Put Your Handz Up&quot; was released the album was shelved and the duo was dropped by Tommy Boy. In 1995, the Whooliganz&#x27; song &quot;Whooliganz&quot; was released as a single in the UK, but Caan and the Alchemist had already parted ways. Caan reunited with his former partner The Alchemist in 2014 on the Step Brothers project &quot;Lord Steppington&quot;, performing on the song &quot;Byron G&quot; with musician Evidence.

After enrolling at the Playhouse West acting school in Los Angeles, Caan began acting in the late 1990s, appearing in a number of independent films and low-budget films. His first role in a major motion picture was that of Charlie Tweeder, a reckless philandering Texas high school football wide receiver in the teen movie &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1999), alongside James Van Der Beek and Paul Walker. In the same year, he played the role of Drew in the film &quot;Saturn&quot; (also known as &quot;Speed of Life&quot;). Caan subsequently appeared in several studio films, including &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; (2000) co-starring David Arquette, &quot;Boiler Room&quot; (2000) co-starring Vin Diesel, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (2000) as Tumbler, and &quot;American Outlaws&quot; (2001) co-starring Colin Farrell, in which Caan played 19th-century outlaw Cole Younger. In 2003, Caan made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Dallas 362&quot;, which won a prize at the 2003 Las Vegas Film Festival.

Caan appeared in the feature film trilogy &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;, and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;. In 2005, he co-starred with Paul Walker (with whom he had appeared in &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;) in the action film &quot;Into the Blue&quot;. Caan wrote and directed the 2006 comedy &quot;The Dog Problem,&quot; and appeared as a supporting character in the film as well. He appeared on the television series &quot;Entourage&quot; in a recurring role as talent manager Scott Lavin from seasons six to eight.

Caan played Detective Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams in &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (a re-imagining of the 1968 &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; television series). The new series premiered on September 20, 2010, and in 2011 he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his performance. 

BuddyTV ranked him 95th on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Sexiest Men of 2011&quot;.

In addition to acting, Caan has also pursued a career in photography. Inspired and trained by cinematographer Phil Parmet while working together on the 2003 film &quot;Dallas 362&quot;, Caan has been shooting ever since. &quot;In preparing for the film,&quot; Caan said, &quot;Phil inspired me to learn about lenses, lights, frames, and the operation of a 250 millimeter camera. By the time the film was over, I wanted to shoot the next one.&quot; In 2009, he published his first collection of photographs in a 256-page book titled &quot;Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1&quot;. The book was edited and designed by Howard Nourmand, and includes an introduction by Steve Olson.

==Personal life==
Caan has a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In July 2014, Caan&#x27;s girlfriend Kacy Byxbee gave birth to their daughter.

As of 2012, Caan was an active volunteer with several organizations that introduce children with autism to surfing.

<text>Jovan M. Žujović (Serbian Cyrillic: Јован M. Жујовић; 18 October 1856 – 19 July 1936) was a Serbian geologist and anthropologist, known as a pioneer in geology, paleontology and craniometry in Serbia. He was a professor at Belgrade University, president of the Serbian Royal Academy and the first president of the Serbian Geological Society.

==Biography==
He was born in Brusnica as the son of Mladen Žujović, head of the Rudnik district (1811-1894) and Jelena, née Danić. He completed elementary school in Nemenikuće and Belgrade, high school in Belgrade, and then the department of natural sciences of the Great School (1877).

After studying in Paris, he returned to Serbia and became the first Serb to scientifically research geology of Serbia and at the time neighbouring countries. Before Žujović, only two other scientists showed any interest in geology of Serbia, Johann Gottfried Herder and Ami Boué.

As the first educated geologist in Serbia, he was elected in 1880 as a substitute at the Department of Mineralogy with Geology at the Great School in Belgrade. This was the beginning of the modern geological school in Serbia. In addition to mineralogy and geology, he also started teaching paleontology. He brought the first polarizing microscope from Paris and introduced microscopic examinations of our soil. He became a full professor at the Great School in 1883. In a relatively short time (1880-1900), he produced a geological map of Serbia and wrote basic geology textbooks. 

He founded the Geological Institute of the Great School (1889), launched the first geological journal in Serbia, &quot;Geological Annals of the Balkan Peninsula&quot; (1889), founded the Serbian Geological Society (1891). And everything that Žujović founded back then still exists today. He is one of the founders of the Museum of Serbian Land (today&#x27;s Museum of Natural History, Belgrade). He introduced agrogeology at the Faculty of Agriculture, for the establishment of which he is also very responsible. He was also professor of applied geology at the Technical Faculty after the First World War. He published his scientific works in many foreign and domestic publications. He was one of the founding members and a member of the first Board of the Serbian Archaeological Society in 1883.

During the founding of the Serbian Royal Academy, King Milan I of Serbia appointed the first 16 members of the academy by decree on April 5, 1887. Among them was Jovan Žujović, as the youngest. According to the customs of the time, he became the secretary of the academy. After the death of Stojan Novaković, he became the president of the Serbian Royal Academy on April 2, 1915. He held this position for six years, until 1921. When the University of Belgrade was founded in 1905, he was chosen as a full professor, one of the eight who then chose the entire teaching staff of the university. Also, during the ceremonial opening of the university, he gave a speech on behalf of the Serbian Royal Academy.

On top of geology Žujović is known for his work in anthropology. In his book, &quot;Stone Age&quot;, published in 1893, relying mostly on French scientists, he reviewed the contemporary state of knowledge in paleoanthropology. Later, between 1927, and 1929, in the book &quot;Genesis of the Earth and Our Country&quot;, he wrote about the biological past of the Earth starting from the beginning of mankind. The work takes particular interest in the history of the Balkan peninsula.

Žujović&#x27;s life&#x27;s work &quot;Geology of Serbia&quot; was printed in 1893. With this work, Žujović covered everything that was necessary for the territory of Serbia to be considered a geologically explored area. Serbia then became one of the few European countries that were completely geologically explored in the 19th century.

Beside Serbian Royal Academy, Žujović was also a member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and Hungarian Academy of Sciences as well as geological society in Kiev, Ukraine.

In Serbian politics, he was a devoted democrat, Senator in 1901 and the member of the People&#x27;s Radical Party of Nikola Pašić. After 1905, Žujović joined the Independent Radical Party of Ljubomir Stojanović. In the government of Independent Radicals, Žujović was a Minister of Foreign Affairs from 12 August to 15 December 1905. Also, Žujović held the post of Minister of Education and Religious Affairs on two occasions, from 16 May to 30 July 1905, and from 11 October 1909 to 12 September 1910.

Žujović had two brothers, Milenko Žujović, who authored books on jurisprudence, and Dr. Jevrem Žujović, whose mentor was Jean Alfred Fournier.

Jovan Žujović, geologist, researcher, politician, diplomat, erudite, scientist who marked the golden age of Serbian geology, died on July 19, 1936 in Belgrade.

<text>The rainbow has been a favorite component of mythology throughout history among many cultures around the world. Abrahamic traditions see it as a covenant with God to preserve the world from a second flood. Whether as a bridge to the heavens, messenger, archer&#x27;s bow, or serpent, the rainbow has served as a symbol for millennia. There are myriad beliefs in a complex diversity with several repeated themes.

== Rainbow deities ==
*In Mesopotamian and Elamite mythology, the goddess Manzat was a personification of the rainbow.
*In Greek mythology, the goddess Iris personifies the rainbow. In many stories, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, she carries messages from the gods to the human world, thus forming a link between heaven and earth. Iris&#x27;s messages often concerned war and retribution. In some myths, the rainbow merely represents the path made by Iris as she flies.
*Many Aboriginal Australian mythologies include a Rainbow Serpent deity, the name and characteristics of which vary according to cultural traditions. It is often seen as a creator god, and also as a force of destruction. It is generally considered to control the rain, and conceals itself in waterholes during the dry season. Rock paintings of the Being are scattered across the continent, mostly found in western Arnhem Land.
*In Chinese mythology, Hong is a two-headed dragon that represents the rainbow.
*In Mesoamerican cultures, Ix Chel is a maternal jaguar goddess associated with rain. Chel means rainbow in the Yucatán Poqomchi&#x27; language. Ix Chel wears a serpent headdress and presides principally over birth and healing.
*Anuenue, the rainbow maiden, appears in Hawaiian legends as the messenger for her brothers, the gods Tane and Kanaloa.
*Several West African religions incorporate personified rainbow spirits. Examples include Oxumare in the Yoruban religion Ifá; Ayida-Weddo in Haitian Vodou, as practiced in Benin; and the pythons Dagbe Dre and Dagbe Kpohoun in West African Vodun, as practiced by the Ewe people of Benin.
*In Māori mythology there are several personifications for the rainbow, depending on its form, who usually appear representing omens and are appealed to during times of war. The most widespread of these are Uenuku and Kahukura.
*For the Karen people of Burma, the rainbow is considered as a painted and dangerous demon that eats children.
*In Muisca religion, Cuchavira or Cuhuzabiba, who was called &quot;shining air&quot; is the rainbow deity, which in the Andes rain and sun were both very important for their agriculture.
*Amitolane is a rainbow spirit from the mythology of the Zuni, a Native American tribe.
*In Albanian folk beliefs the rainbow is regarded as the belt of the goddess Prende, and oral legend has it that anyone who jumps over the rainbow changes their sex.
*In pre-Hispanic Andean cosmology, the rainbow was related with both the sacred serpent or amaru and the thunder god Illapa.

==Rainbow bridges==

*In Norse religion, a burning rainbow bridge called the Bifrost connects Midgard (earth) with Asgard, home of the gods. Bifrost can be used only by gods and those who are killed in battle. It is eventually shattered under the weight of war – the Ragnarok (German Götterdämmerung). The notion that the rainbow bridge to heaven is attainable by only the good or virtuous, such as warriors and royalty, is a theme repeated often in world myths.
*In Japanese mythology, the Floating Bridge of Heaven may have been inspired by the rainbow. The creator deities Izanami and Izanagi stood upon this bridge as they brought the Japanese archipelago into existence.
*In Navajo tradition, the rainbow is the path of the holy spirits, and is frequently depicted in sacred sandpaintings.
*Māori mythology tells a tale of Hina, the moon, who caused a rainbow to span the heavens even down to the earth, for her mortal husband to return to earth to end his days, since death may not enter her celestial home.
*Shamans among Siberia&#x27;s Buryats speak of ascending to the sky-spirit world by way of the rainbow.
*In Philippine mythology, there are various legends about the rainbow and its origins. The Bagobo credit Pamulak Manobo as the creator of the rainbow; in Tagalog folklore, &quot;bahaghari&quot;, the local word for rainbow comes from the name of Bighari, Bathala&#x27;s tardy daughter who created the rainbow out of colorful flowers to ask him to forgive her for missing important family meetings; the Tausug have the Biraddali, seven angelic sisters who use the rainbow as a bridge to earth, but cannot fly if someone steals their detachable wings. In a variant of the Biraddali and swan maiden myths, the rainbow is said to symbolize a family&#x27;s love for each other. The story starts with a farmer&#x27;s plans to sow getting delayed by unidentified parties tearing down his stone wall. The farmer spends the first and second days rebuilding his wall before returning home at sunset. The third time this happens, the farmer decides to hide and identify the vandal(s). That night, three identical sister star maidens fly down from the heavens. Taking off their wings, the sisters proceed to play on the farmer&#x27;s wall, knocking it down. While the star maidens are having fun, the farmer secretly swipes the youngest one&#x27;s wings, hiding them beneath his hut. After playing, the star maidens decide to go home before the sun melts their wings; only two of them fly back to the heavens as the youngest cannot find her own wings. The farmer returns to his field and brings the lone star maiden home. The two fall in love, marry, have a son, and live a contented life on the farm. But while the farmer is out working one day, his wife rediscovers her wings. Feeling that her husband had tricked her into staying on Earth, the star maiden dons her wings and flies back to the heavens, bringing their son with her. A sky deity takes pity on the farmer, sending down a rope for him to climb up and visit his family. Upon arriving in the heavens, the farmer discovers his wife is the youngest of identical octuplet sisters, but he is able to identify her due to the calluses she had sustained from doing chores. The farmer climbs up the rope every day to visit his family. One day, he gets trapped in a storm, hanging on to the rope for dear life; his wife tries to rescue him but she ends up hanging on too. To save their sister and brother-in-law, the other star maidens sacrifice their wings, combining them with sunlight and moonlight to create the first rainbow. Having forgiven her husband, the youngest star maiden returns to earth with him and their son, leaving her wings in the heavens for her sisters to remember her by. The legend ends by saying that whenever a rainbow appears, the farmer and his wife&#x27;s family would climb it to visit each other.

==Rainbows and archery==
*The rainbow is depicted as an archer&#x27;s bow in Hindu mythology. Indra, the god of thunder and war, uses the rainbow to shoot arrows of lightning.
*In pre-Islamic Arabian mythology, the rainbow is the bow of a weather god, Quzaḥ, whose name survives in the Arabic word for rainbow, &quot;qaws Quzaḥ&quot;, &quot;the bow of Quzaḥ&quot;.
*The Sumerian farmer god Ninurta defended Sumer with a bow and arrow, and wore a crown described as a rainbow.

==Rainbow taboos==
*The Sumu of Honduras and Nicaragua refer to the rainbow as &quot;walasa aniwe&quot;, &quot;the devil is vexed&quot;. These people hide their children in their huts to keep them from looking or pointing at the rainbow. Similar taboos against pointing at rainbows can be found throughout the world, in over a hundred cultural traditions.
*In Amazonian cultures, rainbows have long been associated with malign spirits that cause harm, such as miscarriages and (especially) skin problems. In the Amuesha language of central Peru, certain diseases are called &quot;ayona&#x27;achartan&quot;, meaning &quot;the rainbow hurt my skin&quot;. A tradition of closing one&#x27;s mouth at the sight of a rainbow in order to avoid disease appears to pre-date the Incan empire.
*In the mythology of ancient Slavs, a man touched by the rainbow is drawn to heaven, and becomes a &quot;Planetnik&quot; – half-demonic creature – which is under the power of the thunder and lightning god Perun.
*In Latvian legends it was believed that the rainbow drank from river or lake like a living creature and thus released rain from its body. It was forbidden to approach the water source if there was a rainbow, or they would risk being accidentally swallowed by the rainbow, and later fall down during rainfall as nothing but bones.
==Other legends==
*In the Hebrew Book of Genesis, after the flood had almost wiped out the entire human race, Yahweh told Noah that he will set the rainbow as a token of his promise that he would never send another flood large enough to destroy all life. It is said that no rainbows appeared during the lifetime of 2nd-century rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, as his own righteousness was sufficient to guarantee God&#x27;s mercy.
* In Ireland, a common legend asserts that a pot of gold is to be found at the end of a rainbow, guarded by a leprechaun.
* In a Chinese folktale, Hsienpo and Yingt&#x27;ai are star-crossed lovers who must wait until the rainbow appears to be alone together. Hsienpo is the red in the rainbow, and Yingt&#x27;ai is the blue.
* The Fang of Gabon (Africa) are initiated into the religion by a &quot;transcendent experience when they arrive at the rainbow&#x27;s center, for there they can see both the entire circle of the rainbow and of the earth, signaling the success of their vision&quot;. The Fang also prohibit their children from looking at the rainbow.
* For Buddhists, the rainbow is &quot;the highest state achievable before attaining Nirvana, where individual desire and consciousness are extinguished.&quot; Accordingly, there is mention of a rainbow body.
* According to syncretic Malay shamanism and folklore, the rainbow is said to have been formed from the sword of the earth serpent Sakatimuna who was defeated by the archangel Gabriel.
* Rainbows are widely seen in Native American stories and prophecies. The Cherokee believe the rainbow forms the hem of the Sun&#x27;s coat.

<doc id="1026223" wikidata="Q7729102" url="?curid=1026223" title="The Dave Thomas Comedy Show">
<text>The Dave Thomas Comedy Show (later simply Dave Thomas) was a sketch-based, half-hour, five-week summer replacement series, which aired on CBS in the summer of 1990. The show starred Canadian comedian Dave Thomas, who is best known for an earlier sketch comedy series, &quot;SCTV&quot;. Thomas himself served as head writer, while the writing staff included Hollywood scriptwriter Ed Solomon and Mike Myers. The series debuted May 28, 1990.

==Cast and guest stars==
Anson Downes, Teresa Ganzel, Don Lake, Julie Fulton and David Wiley made up the supporting cast of various characters in the sketches, while veteran character actress Fran Ryan had a recurring role as a wise-cracking waitress also named Fran Ryan. In addition, the series usually featured big-name guest stars (John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Martin Short and Catherine O&#x27;Hara) Thomas knew from The Second City and other previous projects—although the musical guest for the series finale was actually a fictionalized version of Johnny Cash played by Dave himself. John Roarke, Valri Bromfield, and Rick Overton were also occasionally featured in supporting roles.

== Format ==
Dave introduced every episode with a monologue that typically segued into the first sketch. Despite the often larger celebrity status of his guest stars, Thomas himself usually played the lead in the sketches, with his celebrity guests in co-starring roles. In addition to sketches, the show featured semi-scripted interview segments on the set of &quot;Fran&#x27;s Diner,&quot; where Dave and his guests would chat over coffee or a meal. Fran&#x27;s Diner was also the setting for a running gag which appeared in every episode, in which Dave, as a customer, would chat with Fran and experience vivid daydreams which invariably spoofed stereotypical male sexual fantasies filled with beautiful women—only to be disappointed that the reality was Fran and her diner. In these segments, the punchline would typically involve Fran somehow knowing the content of Dave&#x27;s daydream, or breaking the fourth wall with references to the fact that they were on a television series.

== Notable sketches ==
Critics from such publications as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and TV Guide applauded a trio of sketches in which Thomas impersonated notable personalities in absurdist situations -- Edward Woodward as his &quot;Equalizer&quot; character reimagined as &quot;the Humiliator&quot; (who uses insults rather than guns to incapacitate criminals), Jack Palance miscast as a creepy sitcom star (who still uses his catch-phrase from &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not!&quot;), and Max von Sydow as a depressed barber who inadvertently terrorizes his customers by chatting casually about his obsession with death.

== List of episodes ==
== Production ==
As Thomas explained in an interview with Kenneth Plume on IGN.com, Thomas had originally conceived of the show as more experimental, especially in terms of interaction with the studio audience, but CBS executives told him to tone down the experimental aspects of the series—a decision which, Thomas believes, ultimately contributed to the show&#x27;s short life span.

<text>The True Law of Free Monarchies: Or, The Reciprocal and Mutual Duty Between a Free King and His Natural Subjects (original Scots title: The Trve Lawe of free Monarchies: Or, The Reciprock and Mvtvall Dvtie Betwixt a free King, and his naturall Subiectes) is a treatise or essay of political theory and kingship by James VI of Scotland (later to be crowned James I of England too).

It is believed James VI wrote the tract to set forth his idea of kingship, rather absolutist, in clear contrast to the contractarian views espoused by, among others, James&#x27;s childhood tutor George Buchanan (in &quot;De Jure Regni apud Scotos&quot;, 1579 ), that held the idea that monarchs rule in accordance of some sort of contract with their people. James saw the divine right of kings as an extension of the apostolic succession, as both not being subjected by humanly laws.

James VI had this work published in 1598 in Edinburgh in the form of a small octavo pamphlet. It is considered remarkable for setting out the doctrine of the divine right of kings in Scotland, for the first time. Another octavo edition was published in London in 1603, the same year of James&#x27; coronation as King of England.

<text>Travancore–Cochin, officially the United State of Travancore and Cochin and later the State of Travancore–Cochin, was a short-lived state of India. It was formed through the merger of two former kingdoms, Travancore and Cochin on 1 July 1949. Its original capital was Trivandrum.

The five Tamil-majority Taluks of Vilavancode, Kalkulam, Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, and Sengottai were transferred from Travancore-Cochin to Madras State in 1956. The Malayalam-speaking regions of the Travancore–Cochin merged with the Malabar District (excluding Laccadive &amp; Minicoy Islands) and the Kasaragod Taluk of South Canara district in Madras State to form the modern Malayalam-state of Kerala on 1 November 1956, according to the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 passed by the Government of India.

==History==
Paravur T. K. Narayana Pillai, the Congress Prime Minister of Travancore, became the Chief Minister of Travancore–Cochin. First elections were held in 1951 and A. J. John, Anaparambil from Congress party was elected as the Chief Minister, ruling until 1954.

The ruler of Travancore was appointed as the governor (known as &quot;Rajpramukh&quot;) of Travancore–Cochin. The Maharajah of Cochin was offered to be addressed as Uparaja Pramukh, but he did not want any title after handing over the power. The Maharaja politely said that the eldest member of Cochin Royal Family should be called Valiya Thampuran and gave up royal powers unconditionally for the good of the people. While Pattom A. Thanu Pillai was the Praja Socialist Party Chief minister in 1954, Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress launched a campaign for the merger of the Tamil-speaking regions of Southern Travancore with the neighbouring area of Madras State. The agitation took a violent turn and civilians and local police were killed at Marthandam and Puthukkada, irreparably alienating the entire Tamil-speaking population from merger into Travancore–Cochin.

Under State Reorganisation Act of 1956, the four southern taluks of Travancore, namely Thovalai, Agasteeswaram, Kalkulam and Vilavancode and a part of the Chencotta, Tenkasi Taluk was merged with Madras State. On 1 November 1956 Travancore–Cochin was joined with Malabar District of Madras State to form the new state of Kerala, with a governor, appointed by the President of India, as the head of the state instead of &#x27;Rajapramukh&#x27;.
===Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State===

Tamils lived in large numbers in the Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, Sengottai, Eraniel, Vilavancode, Kalkulam, Devikulam,Peerumedu Neyyattinkara, Thiruvananthapuram South and Thiruvananthapuram North taluks of erstwhile Travancore State. In the Tamil regions, Malayalam was the official language and there were only a few Tamil-medium schools. So the Tamils met many hardships. Travancore State Government continued rejecting the requests of Tamils. During that period, the Travancore State Congress favoured the idea of uniting all the Malayalam speaking regions and the formation of a &quot;Unified Kerala&quot;. In protest against this idea, many Tamil leaders vacated the party. Tamils gathered together at Nagercoil on 16 December 1945 under the leadership of Sam Nathaniel and formed the new political party All Travancore Tamilian Congress. That party was continuously compelling for the merger of Tamil regions in Travancore with Tamil Nadu.

In the working committee meeting of Tamilian congress at Eraviputhur on 30 June 1946, the name of the political party was changed to Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress (T.T.N.C). T.T.N.C was popular among the Tamils living in Thovalai and Agateeswaram Taluks. Mr. Ma. Po. Sivagnanam (Ma.Po.Si) was the only leader from Tamil Nadu who functioned in favour of T.T.N.C. After the independence of India, State Assembly Elections were announced in Travancore. As a consequence, T.T.N.C improved its popularity among Tamils. A popular and leading advocate from Vilavancode Mr. A. Nesamony organised a meeting of his supporters at Allan Memorial Hall, Nagercoil on 8 September 1947. In that meeting it was declared that they must achieve their objective through their political organisation, the T.T.N.C. And T.T.N.C started gaining strength and momentum in Kalkulam - Vilavancode Taluks. During the election propaganda campaign, clashes occurred between the Tamil Nadar community and the Malayali Nair community at various places in Kalkulam - Vilavancode Taluks. police force suppressed the agitating Nadars. In February 1948 the police opened fire and two Tamil speaking Nadars were killed. 
T.T.N.C won in 14 constituencies in the election to the State Legislative Assembly. Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the legislative leader of the party. Then under his leadership, the awakened Tamil population was prepared to undergo any sacrifice to achieve their goal.

In 1950, a meeting was held at Palayamkottai to make compromises between state congress and T.T.N.C. The meeting met with failure and Mr. Sam Nathaniel resigned from the post of president of T.T.N.C Mr. P. Ramasamy Pillai, a strong follower of Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as the New President. The first general election of Independent India was held on 1952. T.T.N.C won 8 legislative assembly seats. Mr. A. Chidambaranathan became the minister on behalf of T.T.N.C in the coalition state government formed by the Congress. In the parliamentary Constituency Mr. A. Nesamony was elected as M.P. and in the Rajyasabha seat. Mr. A. Abdul Razak was elected as M.P. on behalf of T.T.N.C. In due course, accusing the Congress government for not showing enough care the struggle of the Tamils, T.T.N.C had broken away from the coalition and the Congress government lost the majority. So fresh elections were announced. In 1954 elections, T.T.N.C gained victory in 12 constituencies. 
Pattom Thanu Pillai was the chief minister for Thiru - Kochi legislative assembly. He engaged hard measures against the agitations of Tamils. Especially the Tamils at Devikulam -Peermade regions went through the atrocities of Travancore Police force. Condemning the attitude of the police, T.T.N.C leaders from Nagercoil went to Munnar and participated in agitations against the prohibitive orders. The leaders were arrested and an uncalm atmosphere prevailed in South Travancore.

On 11 August, Liberation Day celebrations were held at many places in South Travancore. Public meetings and processions were organised. Communists also collaborated with the agitation programmes. Police opened fire at the processions in Thoduvetty (Martandam) and Puthukadai. Nine Tamil volunteers were killed and thousands of T.T.N.C and communist sympathizers were arrested in various parts of Tamil main land. At the end, Pattom Thanu Pillai&#x27;s ministry was toppled and normalcy returned to the Tamil regions. The central government had appointed Fazal Ali Commission (December 1953) for the states reorganisation based on language. It submitted its report on 10 August 1955. Based on this report, Devikulam - Peermade and Neyyattinkara Taluks were merged with Kerala state. On 1 November 1956 - four Taluks Thovalai, Agastheeswaram, Kalkulam, Vilavancode were recognised to form the New Kanyakumari District and merged with Tamil Nadu State. Half of Sengottai Taluk was merged with Tirunelveli District. The main demand of T.T.N.C was to merger the Tamil regions with Tamil Nadu and major part of its demand was realised. So T.T.N.C was dissolved thereafter.

===Retainment of Devikulam and Peerumedu Taluks in Kerala===

Apart from Kanyakumari district, the Taluks of Devikulam and Peermade in present-day Idukki district also had a Tamil-majority until the late 1940s. The T.T.N.C had also requested to merge these Taluks with Madras State. However it was due to some decisions of Pattom Thanu Pillai, who was the first prime minister of Travancore, that they retained in the modern-state of Kerala. Pattom came up with a colonisation project to re-engineer the demography of Cardamom Hills. His colonisation project was to relocate 8,000 Malayalam-speaking families into the Taluks of Devikulam and Peermade. About 50,000 acres in these Taluks, which were Tamil-majority area, were chosen for the colonisation project. As a victory of the Colonisation project done by post-independence Travancore, these two Taluks and a larger portion of Cardamom Hills retained in the state of Kerala, after States Reorganisation Act, 1956.

<text>Islamia College Peshawar (ICP) () is a public university located in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

==Degrees awarded==
Both Undergraduate and Postgraduate degrees are awarded at this university in the fields of Arts &amp; Humanities, Business &amp; Social Sciences, Language &amp; Cultural, Engineering and Science &amp; Technology.

This university is ranked no. 24 on the List of Top Universities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2022.

==Recognized university==
This university is recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.

== History ==
Founded by Sir S.A. Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel in 1913, it is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Pakistan, and its historical roots are traced from the culminating point of the Aligarh Movement. The university provides higher learning in arts, languages, humanities, social sciences and modern sciences. In 1950, the University of Peshawar was founded as an offshoot of Islamia College Peshawar, with the later being associated to the university as a constituent college. Initially established as Islamia College, it was granted university status by the Government of Pakistan in 2008; the word college is retained in its title for preserving its historical roots.

=== Cash Donations by Nawabs ===
On June 2, 1911, a delegation headed by Sahibzaba Abdul Qayyum Khan visited Tangi Charsadda and set up his camp at the Hujra of Khan Bahadur Ghulam Haider Khan of Tangi for collection of donations. Khans of Tangi donated a handsome amount of Rs.25000 and the delegation stayed for 3 days at Tangi and them moved Umarzai village when donation of Rs.12000 was collected and then to Turangzai where Rs.20000 and from Rajar Rs.3000 and finally to village Charsadda. I total Rs 150,000 was collected from Hashtnagar. Subsequently, a large plot of land was purchased for the college building from the Khalil (Arbabs) of Tehkal and Sufaid Dheri Rs. 150,000/- from Nizam of Hyderabad and the construction cost building Paid by Nawab of Amb Rs 100,000/- was sent by the prime minister of Amb Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah to Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum as donation for the college. 
=== Conception ===
When the new province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (previously known as N.W.F.P) was formed in 1901 after its separation from the Punjab, there was only one college (Edwardes College) in whole province. This scarcity of quality educational institutions forced local youth to travel to faraway regions of the country (British India) in pursuit of higher education. This same lack of educational opportunities in the region motivated Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel to establish an institution that would not only cater to the academic needs of the region but also produce leaders from the region.

=== Tribal Hostel ICP ===
Founded by Iskander Mirza (former president of Pakistan) on 7 July 1956. The hostel system of Islamia College University, Peshawar exists since 1913. Tribal Hostel is located in the center of Islamia College University, Peshawar.

=== Foundation ===
By 1909, as the idea of a college in the province was taking shape in the minds of both Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel, it was further strengthened by their visit to the Aligarh Muslim University the same year. Nawab Sahib asked the students, especially those from the N.W.F.P. who were studying there as to what were the problems they were facing there and how he could help them. The students told him that they needed a hostel. Nawab Sahib informed them that rather than building them a hostel at Aligarh, he would build them a college at Peshawar. Maulana Qutabshah was the first dean of the college.

Consequently, on April 12, 1911, Nawab Sahib arranged a meeting of like minded people in Peshawar at the residence of Abdul Karim, contractor at Peshawar city, which was attended by Ghulam Haider Khan of Tangi Charsadda, Habibullah Khan, Khushal Khan, Sethi Karim Bakhsh, Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, Khan Sahib Abdul Majid Khan and others. Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum moved the motion for collection of contributions, which was instantly responded to by cash donations by all present. Subsequently, a large plot of land was purchased for the college building from the Khalil (Arbabs) of Tehkal Rs. 150,000/- from Nizam of Hyderabad and the construction cost building Paid by Nawab of Amb Rs 100,000/- was sent by the prime minister of Amb Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah to Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum as donation for the college. Other chiefs and nobles of the North-West Frontier and Punjab, also made various donations. 

Haji Sahib of Turangzai, the most famous Pukhtun religious leader of the time was requested by Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum to lay the foundation stone of Islamia College. Haji Sahib agreed to the request, however, he had been declared a proclaimed offender by the British for his anti-British activities and his entry was banned into British controlled territory. He was residing in tribal territory, which was outside British control, so Nawab Sahib prevailed upon Sir George Roos-Keppel and the British to permit Haji Sahib to enter British controlled territory for one day so he could lay the foundation stone of Islamia College. The British agreed to this request with the understanding that Haji Sahib would return to tribal territory once he had laid the foundation stone. Haji Sahib was permitted to enter British controlled territory for the ceremony and spent the night in the &#x27;Pokh&#x27; Mosque of Tehkal. At the foundation stone laying ceremony, Sir Roos Keppel and other British officials were present, so Haji Sahib hid his face in his sheet (Chadar) from them and was led by Sheikh Muhammad Ibrahim to the place where he was to lay the foundation stone. After laying the stone Haji Sahib went to Tehkal and then returned to the tribal territory.

=== Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s will ===
Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah visited this College in 1936, 1945 and 1948. Quaid-e-Azam, who became lifelong honorary member of the Khyber Union ICP in 1936, made the college one of the heirs of his property in 1939:

&quot;All my residuary estate including the corpus that may fall after the lapse of life interest or otherwise to be divided into three parts - and I bequeath one part to Aligarh University - one part to Islamia College Peshawar and one part to Sindh Madrassa of Karachi...&quot; - &quot;Quaid-e-Azam&#x27;s Will, Bombay, May 30, 1939&quot;

Addressing the students of the college on April 12, 1948, he said: “Let me tell you that nothing is nearer to my heart than to have a great center of culture and learning in a place like Peshawar, a place from where the rays of knowledge and culture can spread throughout the Middle East and Central Asia.”

== Endowment ==
According to the board of trustees, the college, which is spread over 300 acres of land, has 1089 Jaribs cultivable land in Harichand, Rai Killi and Tarnab, (District Charsadda). In addition to this, there are 395 shops and flats in the Khyber Bazaar Peshawar and main bazaar Charsadda.

<text>The British Rail Class 83 electric locomotives were built by English Electric at Vulcan Foundry, Newton-le-Willows as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification.

== History ==
===Construction===
Fifteen locomotives of British Rail Class 83 were built between 1960 and 1962 by English Electric at Vulcan Foundry, as part of British Rail&#x27;s policy to develop a standard electric locomotive. Five prototype classes (81-85) were built and evaluated, which eventually led to the development of the Class 86 locomotive.

Three of these locomotives were to have been built as Type B, geared for freight trains, but as it was only two were so built, becoming E3303 and E3304. The third Type B, E3305, was never built as such. Instead it was used as a test bed with silicon rectifiers and transductors, this being the first step towards thyristor control. It became a Type A, geared for passenger trains, and numbered E3100.

The other two Type B locomotives were eventually rebuilt as Type A, being renumbered E3098 (ex E3303) and E3099 (ex E3304). Power was provided by overhead catenary energized at 25,000 V AC.

Under the pre-TOPS British Rail classification, the first fourteen locomotives, E3024 - E3035 and E3303, E3304 (later E3098 and E3099) were Class AL3 (meaning the 3rd design of AC Locomotive). The fifteenth engine, E3100 became Class AL3/1. All fifteen were included in the TOPS numbering system, being renumbered 83001-015.

The Polish EU06 class was produced by English Electric at the same time as the Class 83s and externally they are quite similar.

===In service===
The class was used to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line, from Birmingham, to , Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool and later . By 1965, electrification had spread south to London Euston.

===Storage and refurbishment===
As with the Class 84, the Class 83 suffered with problems due to the mercury-arc rectifiers. After spending several years in storage (1967 to 1971), they were rebuilt with silicon rectifiers, as were already fitted to E3100, and dual braking between July 1970 and October 1973.

The decision to reinstate the fifteen engines of Class 83 was the result of the extension of the electrification from Weaver Junction to Glasgow, which required more electric locomotives. With both Class 83 and Class 84 being returned to traffic only thirty-six Class 87 were required to be built.

===Later use===
Electrification finally reached Glasgow in the early 1970s, allowing this class to operate the full length of the West Coast Main Line.

The last three in service (83009, 83012 and 83015) were retained for use on empty coaching stock workings from London Euston Station to Willesden. 83009 had previously been used at Longsight in Manchester, to convert the 25 kV AC supply to 1500 V DC, to allow testing of the Class 506 units following the closure of Reddish Depot.

===Withdrawal===

Two engines were withdrawn early as a result of accidents. The first was 83003, withdrawn in May 1975, which was severely damaged in an accident on 23 January 1975 at Watford with a Class 86 (86209).

The second engine was 83004 which, on 24 December 1977, was severely damaged in a collision with a Class 47 at Willesden. In 1983, ten of the remaining thirteen engines were withdrawn, all being sent to the Vic Berry Scrapyard in Leicester. The final three were withdrawn in 1989, with two of the three being scrapped at MC Metals of Glasgow in 1993.

== Power supply ==
The locomotives always worked on power provided by overhead catenary energised at 25,000 V AC. However, the main transformer, normally operated with the four windings in series, could be operated at 6250 V AC with the transformer windings in parallel. This voltage was initially to be used where limited clearances gave concern over use of the higher voltage. Since the clearances were found to be adequate, the lower voltage connections were locked out of use.

== Preservation ==

One locomotive has been preserved by the AC Locomotive Group.
*83012 / E3035 - Barrow Hill Engine Shed

The locomotive was originally preserved by Pete Waterman in 1992, and then purchased by the AC Locomotive Group in 1997.

<doc id="1026281" wikidata="Q3547109" url="?curid=1026281" title="The San Diego Union-Tribune">
<text>The San Diego Union-Tribune is a metropolitan daily newspaper published in San Diego, California, that has run since 1868. Its name derives from a 1992 merger between the two major daily newspapers at the time, &quot;The San Diego Union&quot; and the &quot;San Diego Evening Tribune&quot;. The name changed to U-T San Diego in 2012 but was changed again to &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; in 2015.

In 2015, the newspaper was acquired by Tribune Publishing. In February 2018, it was announced to be sold, along with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, to Patrick Soon-Shiong&#x27;s investment firm Nant Capital LLC for $500 million plus $90 million in pension liabilities. The sale was completed on June 18, 2018. In July 2023, Soon-Shiong sold the paper to Digital First Media, a company owned by Alden Global Capital.

==History==

===Predecessors===
The predecessor newspapers of the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; were:
* &quot;San Diego Herald&quot;, founded 1851 and closed April 7, 1860; John Judson Ames was its first editor and proprietor.
* &quot;San Diego Sun&quot;, founded 1861 and merged with the &quot;Evening Tribune&quot; in 1939.
* &quot;San Diego Union&quot;, founded October 3, 1868. 
* &quot;San Diego Evening Tribune&quot;, founded December 2, 1895.

In addition, the &quot;San Diego Union&quot; purchased the &quot;San Diego Daily Bee&quot; in 1888, and for a brief time the combined newspaper was named the &quot;San Diego Union and Daily Bee&quot;.

===Copley Press===
Both the &quot;Union&quot; and the &quot;Tribune&quot; were acquired by Copley Press in 1928 and were merged on February 2, 1992. The merged newspaper was sold to the private investment group Platinum Equity of Beverly Hills, California, on March 18, 2009.

===Platinum Equity===
On August 17, 2010, the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; changed its design to improve &quot;clarity, legibility, and ease of use&quot;. Changes included being printed on thinner, 100 percent recycled paper, moving the comics to the back of the business section, and abbreviating the title &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; on the front page to &quot;U-T San Diego&quot;. The &quot;U-T&quot; nameplate was created by Jim Parkinson, a type designer who also created nameplates for &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

===MLIM Holdings===
In November 2011, Platinum Equity sold the newspaper to MLIM Holdings, a company led by Doug Manchester, a San Diego real estate developer and &quot;an outspoken supporter of conservative causes&quot;. The purchase price was reportedly in excess of $110 million. Manchester built two landmark downtown hotels, the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel and the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. His group also owns the Grand Del Mar luxury resort in San Diego.

===U-T San Diego===
On January 3, 2012, the newspaper announced that it would use the name &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; &quot;on all of our media products and communications&quot;; the newspaper&#x27;s website (formerly called &quot;SignOn San Diego&quot; and available under SignOnSanDiego.com) would use the name UTSanDiego.com. The official announcement explained the change as being intended to &quot;unify our print and digital products under a single brand with a clear and consistent expectation of quality&quot;.

&quot;U-T San Diego&quot; bought the &quot;North County Times&quot; in September 2012. On October 15, 2012, the &quot;North County Times&quot; ceased publication and became the &quot;U-T North County Times&quot;, which was an edition of the &quot;U-T&quot; with some North County–specific content. Six months later the &quot;U-T North County Times&quot; name was dropped and the newspaper became a North County edition of the &quot;U-T&quot;. In November 2013, the newspaper bought eight more local weekly newspapers (La Jolla Light, Del Mar Times, Rancho Santa Fe Review, Poway News Chieftain, Rancho Bernardo &amp; 4S Ranch News Journal, the Solana Beach Sun, the Carmel Valley News and the Ramona Sentinel) in the San Diego area, which continued publication under their own names. In 2014, &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; launched a ninth paper, the &quot;Encinitas Advocate&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; launched U-T TV, a television news channel. The network featured news, lifestyle, and editorial content produced by the newspaper&#x27;s staff, and was created as part of the newspaper&#x27;s growing emphasis on multi-platform content under Manchester. On February 20, 2014, U-T TV was dropped from cable, and lacked crucial carriage from Time Warner Cable. The channel remaining staff was retained to produce video content for the newspaper&#x27;s digital properties.

===Tribune Publishing ownership===
On May 7, 2015, it was announced that the Tribune Publishing Company, publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and other newspapers, had reached a deal to acquire &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; and its associated properties for $85 million. The sale ended the newspaper&#x27;s 146 years of private ownership. The transaction was completed on May 21, 2015. On the same date, the newspaper reintroduced its previous branding as &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;.

The &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, with both newspapers led by &quot;Times&quot; publisher and chief executive officer Austin Beutner. The two newspapers reportedly would retain distinct operations, but there would be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them.

The acquisition did not include the newspaper&#x27;s headquarters, which was retained by Manchester and would be leased by the newspaper.

On May 26, 2015, the newspaper announced it would lay off 178 employees, representing about thirty percent of the total staff, as it consolidated its printing operations with the &quot;Times&quot; in Los Angeles. In 2016, &quot;The San Diego Union Tribune&quot; acquired the monthly entertainment magazine &quot;Pacific San Diego&quot;. On June 13, 2015, at 10:02 p.m. PDT the final run of &quot;The San Diego Union Tribune&quot; was printed at the San Diego headquarters in Mission Valley began. It was to print the Sunday edition newspaper for June 14, 2015. The following Monday&#x27;s newspaper would be printed at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; location. The dismantling of the printing presses in Mission Valley began in mid-September 2015.

===Purchase by Patrick Soon-Shiong===
In February 2018, a deal was reached to sell the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a medical doctor who has made billions as a biotech entrepreneur. The deal also included the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and multiple community newspapers. The sale closed on June 18, 2018.

===Sale to Alden Global Capital===
On July 10, 2023, it was announced that the U-T was sold to the MediaNews Group, owned by Alden Global Capital, for an undisclosed sum. Soon-Shiong retained ownership of the Los Angeles Times. MediaNews Group already owns about 100 newspapers and is the parent company of the Southern California News Group. MediaNews Group immediately announced that employees will be offered buyouts to resign, and that if not enough employees take up the offer, additional layoffs will be necessary.

In December 2023, the newspaper announced the last issue of &quot;U-T en Español&quot;, its Spanish-language tabloid, will be published on Dec. 30.

On June 13, 2024, a newly redesigned website was launched, similar to other newspapers in the Alden Global Capital group, replacing a design that was used for the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot;

==Headquarters==
The newspaper was originally located in Old Town San Diego, and was moved to downtown San Diego in 1871. In 1973, it moved to a custom-built, brick and stone office and printing plant complex in Mission Valley.

The newspaper moved back downtown in May 2016, to offices on the 9th through 12th floors of a tower at 600 B Street. The Union-Tribune was to be the named tenant of the building, replacing Bridgepoint Education and, before that, Comerica.

==Awards==

===Pulitzer Prizes===
* 1979, Breaking News Reporting: San Diego &quot;Evening Tribune&quot; for its coverage of the PSA Flight 182 jetliner collision with a small plane over North Park.
* 1987, Editorial Writing: San Diego &quot;Evening Tribune&quot; editorial writer Jonathan Freedman for his editorials urging passage of the first major immigration reform act in 34 years.
* 2006, National Reporting: The San Diego &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; and Copley News Service (with notable work by Marcus Stern and Jerry Kammer), for their disclosure of bribe-taking that sent former Rep. Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham to prison &quot;in disgrace&quot;. They also received the George Polk Award for these stories.
* 2009, Editorial Cartooning: Steve Breen &quot;for his agile use of a classic style to produce wide ranging cartoons that engage readers with power, clarity and humor&quot;.

==Criticisms==

===Copleys and Platinum Equity===
Under the Copleys&#x27; ownership, the newspaper had a reliably conservative editorial position, endorsing almost exclusively Republicans for elective office, and sometimes refusing to interview or cover Democratic candidates.

Under Platinum Equity, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial position &quot;skewed closer to the middle&quot; and showcased multiple viewpoints.

===Manchester and Lynch===
When Manchester and business partner John Lynch took ownership in 2011, Lynch stated on KPBS radio that he and Manchester &quot;wanted to be cheerleaders for all that is good in San Diego&quot;. Lynch expanded on this position in 2012, saying &quot;We make no apologies. We are doing what a newspaper ought to do, which is to take positions. We are very consistent—pro-conservative, pro-business, pro-military—and we are trying to make a newspaper that gets people excited about this city and its future.&quot;

This open promotion of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about topics such as the military and business might not be covered. Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University, argued, &quot;Now if you&#x27;re saying we&#x27;re going to be the cheerleaders of the military, why would you report on this guy that&#x27;s taking bribes?... Where&#x27;s the cheerleading there?&quot; a reference to the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the Duke Cunningham bribery scandal. A &quot;New York Times&quot; writer added, &quot;There is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many American newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda. That future appears to have arrived in San Diego.&quot;

Lynch said, &quot;We totally respect the journalistic integrity of our paper and there is a clear line of demarcation between our editorials and our news. Our editor, Jeff Light, calls the shots.&quot; However, in November 2011 Lynch told the sports editor that the sports pages should advocate for a new football stadium; when a longtime sportswriter wrote skeptically about the idea, he was fired.

====Downtown redevelopment====
In January 2012, two months after Manchester bought the &quot;U-T&quot;, the newspaper featured a front-page proposal for downtown redevelopment, to include a downtown football stadium and an expansion of the San Diego Convention Center. Both properties are adjacent to hotels that Manchester owns.

In September 2012, &quot;Investigative Newsource&quot; reporter Brooke Williams obtained articles that claimed Lynch &quot;threatened&quot; Port Commissioner Scott Peters, who was running for Congress, &quot;with a newspaper campaign to dismantle the Unified Port of San Diego&quot;. In e-mails obtained by Williams, Lynch was quoted as indicating that if the Dole Food Company obtained a long-term contract, that the Port&#x27;s independence governance would be questioned in editorial coverage. Williams said the effort showed &quot;the extent to which the newspaper&#x27;s new owners will go to push their vision for a football stadium on the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal&quot;,

====Endorsements and polling====
During the 2012 mayoral election the owners of the &quot;U-T&quot; donated to Republican City Council Member Carl DeMaio&#x27;s campaign, and the newspaper ran several prominent editorials favoring DeMaio. Those endorsements were wrapped around the front section of the newspaper on a separate page, &quot;as though they were even more important&quot; than the front page.

In October 2012, a poll was taken by the &quot;U-T&quot; asking respondents to choose between DeMaio and Democratic Congressman Bob Filner in the mayoral election to be held in November. A rival news outlet noted that &quot;Employees of a newspaper, television / radio station, marketing / public opinion research company or the city of San Diego—or who live with someone employed in one of those fields&quot; were excluded from the poll results, which showed the Republican leading the Democrat, 46 percent to 36 percent. Reporter Kelly Davis of SDCityBeat.com wrote: &quot;Common sense dictates that those votes [by city employees or those living with them] would swing in Filner&#x27;s favor due to DeMaio&#x27;s long-running feud with city-employee unions.&quot; But &quot;U-T&quot; assignment editor Michael Smolens replied that &quot;city employees were excluded to avoid political entanglements&quot; in other parts of the ballot as well as in the mayor&#x27;s race. Despite the newspaper&#x27;s efforts, DeMaio lost to Filner.

Lynch handed day-to-day operations to another executive in February 2014, and editor Jeff Light became company president in January 2015. In 2016, Light was named publisher.

<text>The Pakistan Movement emerged in the early 20th century as part of a campaign that advocated the creation of an Islamic state in parts of what was then British India. It was rooted in the two-nation theory, which asserted that Indian Muslims were fundamentally and irreconcilably distinct from Indian Hindus (who formed the demographic majority) and would therefore require separate self-determination upon the decolonization of India. The idea was largely realized when the All-India Muslim League ratified the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940, calling for the Muslim-majority regions of the Indian subcontinent to be &quot;grouped to constitute independent states&quot; that would be &quot;autonomous and sovereign&quot; with the aim of securing Muslim socio-political interests vis-à-vis the Hindu majority. It was in the aftermath of the Lahore Resolution that, under the aegis of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the cause of &quot;Pakistan&quot; (though the name was not used in the text itself) became widely popular among the Muslims of the Indian independence movement.

Instrumental in establishing a base for the Pakistan Movement was the Aligarh Movement, which consisted of several reforms by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan that ultimately promoted a system of Western-style scientific education among the subcontinent&#x27;s Muslims, seeking to enrich and vitalize their society, culture, and religious thought. Khan&#x27;s efforts fostered Indian Muslim nationalism and went on to provide both the Pakistan Movement and the nascent country that it would yield with its ruling elite. 

Several prominent Urdu poets, such as Muhammad Iqbal and Faiz Ahmad Faiz used speech, literature, and poetry as a powerful tool for Muslim political awareness; Iqbal, in particular, is often called the spiritual father of Muslim nationalist thought in his era. The role of India&#x27;s &quot;ulama&quot;, however, was divided into two groups: the first group, denoted by the ideals of Hussain Ahmed Madani, was convinced by the concept of composite nationalism, which argued against religious nationalism on the basis of India&#x27;s historic identity as a nation of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity; while the second group, denoted by the ideals of Ashraf Ali Thanwi, was a proponent of the perceived uniqueness of the Muslim way of life and accordingly played a significant role in the Pakistan Movement. Likewise, a number of Indian Muslim political parties were split over their support, or lack thereof, for an independent Muslim state. Among the most prominent of these parties was Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, which was opposed to Muslim separatism, and from which a pro-separatist group of Islamic scholars, led by Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, founded the breakaway Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam to support the Pakistan Movement.

The ultimate objective of the Pakistan Movement, led by the All-India Muslim League, was achieved with the partition of India on 14 August 1947, when the Radcliffe Line officially demarcated the Dominion of Pakistan over two non-contiguous swaths of territory, which would later be organized as East Pakistan and West Pakistan, with the former comprising East Bengal and the latter comprising West Punjab and Sind and inheriting British India&#x27;s borders with Afghanistan and Iran. In 1971, however, the Bangladesh Liberation War resulted in the dissolution of East Pakistan, which seceded from West Pakistan to become present-day Bangladesh.

== History of the movement ==

===Background===

During the early 19th century, Lord Macaulay&#x27;s radical and influential educational reforms led to numerous changes to the introduction and teaching of Western languages (e.g. English and Latin), history, and philosophy. Religious studies and the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages were completely barred from the state universities. In a short span of time, the English language had become not only the medium of instruction but also the official language in 1835 in place of Persian, disadvantaging those who had built their careers around the latter language.
Traditional Hindu and Islamic studies were no longer supported by the British Crown, and nearly all of the &quot;madrasah&quot;s lost their &quot;waqf&quot; (lit. financial endowment).

===Renaissance vision===

Very few Muslim families had their children sent to English universities. On the other hand, the effects of the Bengali Renaissance made the Hindu population more educated and enabled them to gain lucrative positions at the Indian Civil Service; many ascended to the influential posts in the British government. In 1930, Muhammad Iqbal delivered his famous speech in the Allahabad annual session which is commonly regarded as sowing the seeds for the creation of a separate state, later known as Pakistan.

Class conflict was coloured in a religious shade, as the Muslims were generally agriculturists and soldiers, while Hindus were increasingly seen as successful financiers and businessmen. Therefore, according to the historian Spear, &quot;an industrialised India meant a Hindu India&quot; to the Muslims. Syed Ahmed Khan converted the existing cultural and religious entity among Indian Muslims into a separatist political force, throwing a Western cloak of nationalism over the Islamic concept of culture. The distinct sense of value, culture and tradition among Indian Muslims originated from the nature of Islamization of the Indian populace during the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent.

=== Rise of organised movement ===

The success of the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference as a part of the Aligarh Movement, the All-India Muslim League, was established with the support provided by Syed Ahmad Khan in 1906. It was founded in Dhaka in a response to the reintegration of Bengal after a mass Hindu protest took place in the subcontinent. Earlier in 1905, viceroy Lord Curzon partitioned Bengal, which was favoured by the Muslims, since it gave them a Muslim majority in the eastern half.

In 1909 Lord Minto promulgated the Council Act and met with a Muslim delegation led by Aga Khan III, a deal to which Minto agreed. The delegation consisted of 35 members, who each represented their respective region proportionately, mentioned hereunder.

Until 1937 the Muslim League had remained an organisation of elite Indian Muslims. The Muslim League leadership then began mass mobilisation and the League then became a popular party with the Muslim masses in the 1940s, especially after the Lahore Resolution. Under Jinnah&#x27;s leadership its membership grew to over two million and became more religious and even separatist in its outlook. The Muslim League&#x27;s earliest base was the United Provinces. From 1937 onwards, the Muslim League and Jinnah attracted large crowds throughout India in its processions and strikes.

=== Lahore Resolution ===
The Lahore Resolution marked the beginning of the Pakistan movement. At the 27th annual Muslim League session in 1940 at Lahore&#x27;s Iqbal Park where about 100,000 people gathered to hear Jinnah speak:

Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religions, philosophies, social customs, and literature... It is quite clear that Hindus and Muslims derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes... To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state.

At Lahore the Muslim League formally committed itself to create an independent Muslim state, including Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, the North West Frontier Province and Bengal, that would be &quot;wholly autonomous and sovereign&quot;. The resolution guaranteed protection for non-Muslims. The Lahore Resolution, moved by the sitting Chief Minister of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq, was adopted on 23 March 1940, and its principles formed the foundation for Pakistan&#x27;s first constitution.

In opposition to the Lahore Resolution, the All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for a united India. Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates.

=== C. R. formula and Cabinet Mission ===

Talks were held between Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi in 1944. Jinnah negotiated as the representative of the Muslims. Gandhi rejected and insisted that the Indian National Congress alone represented all of India, including Muslims. Gandhi proposed the C.R Formula, which sought to first achieve independence from the British and then settle the issue of Pakistan through a plebiscite in Muslim majority districts in which the non-Muslims would also vote. Jinnah rejected both postponing decision on partition of British India and the formula in favor of the immediate creation of Pakistan.

In 1945 and 1946 general and provincial elections were held in India respectively. The Muslim League of Jinnah secured most of the Muslim vote in both elections. Jinnah interpreted the results as the entire Muslim nation&#x27;s demand for partition and a separate state of Pakistan. Congress was forced to recognise the Muslim League as the sole representative of the Muslims.

The same year the British sent a delegation to India to determine its constitutional status and to address the Hindu-Muslim differences. The delegation proposed a plan that three groups in India be formed. One would consist of the Muslim majority Northwest zone, another would consist of the Hindu majority center and the third the Eastern zone of India. The proposal further contemplated the independence of Muslim majority provinces after ten years of Indian Independence. An interim government was to be set up until independence.

The Congress Party rejected the separation of the provinces but agreed to the formation of an interim government. The plan stated that whichever party will agree to the whole of the plan will be allowed to form the interim government which would be established after the General elections in 1946.

Jinnah decided to agree to the plan. The British still invited the Congress to form a government with the Muslim League and the Viceroy of India assigned the Office of Prime minister to Nehru of the Indian National Congress.

===World War II===

On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared the commencement of war with Germany. Shortly thereafter, Viceroy Lord Linlithgow followed suit and announced that India too was at war with Germany.

In 1939, the Congress leaders resigned from all British India government positions to which they had elected. The Muslim League celebrated the end of the Congress-led British Indian government, with Jinnah famously declaring it &quot;a day of deliverance and thanksgiving&quot;. In a secret memorandum to the British Prime Minister, the Muslim League agreed to support the United Kingdom&#x27;s war efforts—provided that the British recognise it as the only organisation that spoke for Indian Muslims.

Following the Congress&#x27;s effective protest against the United Kingdom unilaterally involving India in the war without consulting with them, the Muslim League went on to support the British war efforts, which allowed them to actively go against the Congress with the argument of &quot;Islam in Danger&quot;.

The Indian Congress and Muslim League responded differently over the World War II issue. The Indian Congress refused to support the British unless the whole Indian subcontinent was granted independence. The Muslim League, on the other hand, supported Britain both politically and via human contributions. The Muslim League leaders&#x27; British education, training, and philosophical ideas helped bring the British government and the Muslim League closer to each other. Jinnah himself supported the British in World War II when the Congress failed to collaborate. The British government made a pledge to the Muslims in 1940 that it would not transfer power to an Independent India unless its constitution was first approved by the Indian Muslims, a promise it did not subsequently keep.

===The end of the war===

In 1942, Gandhi called for the Quit India Movement against the United Kingdom. On the other hand, the Muslim League advised Prime Minister Winston Churchill that Great Britain should &quot;divide and then Quit&quot;. Negotiations between Gandhi and Viceroy Wavell failed, as did talks between Jinnah and Gandhi in 1944. When World War II ended, the Muslim League&#x27;s push for the Pakistan Movement and Gandhi&#x27;s efforts for Indian independence intensified the pressure on Prime Minister Churchill. Given the rise of American and Russian dominance in world politics and the general unrest in India, Wavell called for general elections to be held in 1945.

In the 1940s, Jinnah emerged as a leader of the Indian Muslims and was popularly known as &quot;Quaid-e-Azam&quot; (‘Great Leader’). The general elections held in 1945 for the Constituent Assembly of British Indian Empire, the Muslim League secured and won 434 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (and about 87.5% of Muslim votes) on a policy of creating an independent state of Pakistan, and with an implied threat of secession if this was not granted. The Congress which was led by Gandhi and Nehru remained adamantly opposed to dividing India. The partition seems to have been inevitable after all, one of the examples being Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s statement on Jinnah: &quot;There was no argument that could move him from his consuming determination to realize the impossible dream of Pakistan.&quot;

American historian Stephen P. Cohen writes in &quot;The Idea of Pakistan&quot; with regards to the influence of South Asian Muslim nationalism on the Pakistan movement:

=== 1946 elections ===
The 1946 elections resulted in the Muslim League winning the majority of Muslim votes and reserved Muslim seats in the Central and provincial assemblies, performing exceptionally well in Muslim minority provinces such as UP and Bihar, relative to the Muslim majority provinces of Punjab and NWFP. The Muslim league captured 429 of the total 492 seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite where the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan; a plebiscite which the Muslim League won.

This victory was assisted by the support given to the Muslim League by the rural agriculturalists of Bengal as well as the support of the landowners of Sindh and Punjab. The Congress, which initially denied the Muslim League&#x27;s claim of being the sole representative of Indian Muslims, was now forced to recognise that the Muslim League represented Indian Muslims. The British had no alternative except to take Jinnah&#x27;s views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson for India&#x27;s Muslims. However, the British did not desire India to be partitioned and in one last effort to avoid it they arranged the Cabinet Mission plan. In 1946, the Cabinet Mission Plan recommended a decentralised but united India, this was accepted by the Muslim League but rejected by the Congress, thus, leading the way for the Partition of India.

==Political campaigns and support==

===Punjab===
In the British Indian province of Punjab, Muslims placed more emphasis on the Punjabi identity they shared with Hindus and Sikhs, rather than on their religion. The Unionist Party, which prevailed in the 1923 Indian general election, 1934 Indian general election and the 1937 Indian provincial elections, had the mass support of the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of the Punjab; its leaders included Muslim Punjabis, such as Fazl-i-Hussain and Hindu Punjabis, such as Chhotu Ram. The Punjab had a slight Muslim majority, and local politics had been dominated by the secular Unionist Party and its longtime leader Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan. The Unionists had built a formidable power base in the Punjabi countryside through policies of patronage allowing them to retain the loyalty of landlords and pirs who exerted significant local influence.

For the Muslim League to claim to represent the Muslim vote, they would need to win over the majority of the seats held by the Unionists. Following the death of Sir Sikander in 1942, and bidding to overcome their dismal showing in the elections of 1937, the Muslim League intensified campaigning throughout rural and urban Punjab. A major thrust of the Muslim&#x27;s League&#x27;s campaign was the promotion of communalism and spreading fear of a supposed &quot;Hindu threat&quot; in a future united India. Muslim League activists were advised to join in communal prayers when visiting villages, and gain permission to hold meetings after the Friday prayers. The Quran became a symbol of the Muslim League at rallies, and pledges to vote were made on it. Students, a key component of the Muslim League&#x27;s activists, were trained to appeal to the electorate on communal lines, and at the peak of student activity during the Christmas holidays of 1945, 250 students from Aligarh were invited to campaign in the province along with 1550 members of the Punjab Muslim Student&#x27;s Federation. A key achievement of these efforts came in enticing Muslim Jats and Gujjars from their intercommunal tribal loyalties. In response, the Unionists attempted to counter the growing religious appeal of the Muslim League by introducing religious symbolism into their own campaign, but with no student activists to rely upon and dwindling support amongst the landlords, their attempts met with little success.
To further their religious appeal, the Muslim League also launched efforts to entice Pirs towards their cause. Pirs dominated the religious landscape, and were individuals who claimed to inherit religious authority from Sufi Saints who had proselytised in the region since the eleventh century. By the twentieth century, most Punjabi Muslims offered allegiance to a Pir as their religious guide, thus providing them considerable political influence. The Unionists had successfully cultivated the support of Pirs to achieve success in the 1937 elections, and the Muslim League now attempted to replicate their method of doing so. To do so, the Muslim League created the Masheikh Committee, used Urs ceremonies and shrines for meetings and rallies and encouraged fatwas urging support for the Muslim League.

Reasons for the pirs switching allegiance varied. For the Gilani Pirs of Multan the overriding factor was local longstanding factional rivalries, whilst for many others a shrine&#x27;s size and relationship with the government dictated its allegiance.

Despite the Muslim League&#x27;s aim to foster a united Muslim loyalty, it also recognised the need to better exploit the biradari network and appeal to primordial tribal loyalties. In 1946 it held a special Gujjar conference intending to appeal to all Muslim Gujjars, and reversed its expulsion of Jahanara Shahnawaz with the hope of appealing to Arain constituencies. Appealing to biradari ties enabled the Muslim League to accelerate support amongst landlords, and in turn use the landlords&#x27;s client-patron economic relationship with their tenants to guarantee votes for the forthcoming election.

A separate strategy of the Muslim League was to exploit the economic slump suffered in the Punjab as a result of the Second World War. The Punjab had supplied 27 per cent of the Indian Army recruits during the war, constituting 800,000 men, and representing a significant part of the electorate. By 1946, less than 20 per cent of those servicemen returning home had found employment. This in part was exacerbated by the speedy end to the war in Asia, which caught the Unionists by surprise, and meant their plans to deploy servicemen to work in canal colonies were not yet ready. The Muslim League took advantage of this weakness and followed Congress&#x27;s example of providing work to servicemen within its organisation. The Muslim League&#x27;s ability to offer an alternative to the Unionist government, namely the promise of Pakistan as an answer to the economic dislocation suffered by Punjabi villagers, was identified as a key issue for the election.

On the eve of the elections, the political landscape in the Punjab was finely poised, and the Muslim League offered a credible alternative to the Unionist Party. The transformation itself had been rapid, as most landlords and pirs had not switched allegiance until after 1944. The breakdown of talks between the Punjab Premier, Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, and Jinnah in late 1944 had meant many Muslims were now forced to choose between the two parties at the forthcoming election. A further blow for the Unionists came with death of its leading statesman Sir Chhotu Ram in early 1945.

The Western Punjab was home to a minority population of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority. In 1947, the Punjab Assembly cast its vote in favour of Pakistan with supermajority rule, which made many minority Hindus and Sikhs migrate to India while Muslim refugees from India settled in the Western Punjab and across Pakistan.

===Sindh===

In the Sind province of British India, the Sind United Party promoted communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims, winning 22 out of 33 seats in the 1937 Indian provincial elections.
Both the Muslim landed elite, &quot;waderas&quot;, and the Hindu commercial elements, &quot;banias&quot;, collaborated in exploiting the predominantly Muslim peasantry of the British Indian province of Sind. In Sind’s first provincial election after its separation from Bombay in 1936, economic interests were an essential factor of politics, informed by religious and cultural issues. Due to British policies, much land in Sind was transferred from Muslim to Hindu hands over the decades. In Sind, &quot;the dispute over the Sukkur Manzilgah had been fabricated by provincial Leaguers to unsettle Allah Bakhsh Soomro&#x27;s ministry which was dependent on support from the Congress and the Hindu Independent Party.&quot; The Sind Muslim League exploited the issue and agitated for what they said was an abandoned mosque to be given to the Muslim League. Consequentially, a thousand members of the Muslim League were imprisoned. Eventually, due to panic the government restored the mosque to Muslims.

The separation of Sind from the Bombay Presidency triggered Sindhi Muslim nationalists to support the Pakistan Movement. Even while the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province were ruled by parties hostile to the Muslim League, Sindh remained loyal to Jinnah. Although the prominent Sindhi Muslim nationalist G.M. Syed (who admired both Hindu and Muslim rulers of Sindh) left the All India Muslim League in the mid-1940s, the overwhelming majority of Sindhi Muslims supported the creation of Pakistan, seeing in it their deliverance. Sindhi support for the Pakistan Movement arose from the desire of the Sindhi Muslim business class to drive out their Hindu competitors.

The Muslim League’s rise to becoming the party with the strongest support in Sind was in large part linked to its winning over of the religious pir families. Although the Muslim League had previously fared poorly in the 1937 elections in Sind, when local Sindhi Muslim parties won more seats, the Muslim League’s cultivation of support from the pirs and saiyids of Sind in 1946 helped it gain a foothold in the province.

=== North-West Frontier Province ===

The Muslim League had little support in North-West Frontier Province. Here the Congress and Pashtun nationalist leader Abdul Ghaffar Khan had considerable support for the cause of a united India.

During the Independence period there was a Congress-led ministry in the province, which was led by secular Pashtun leaders, including Abdul Ghaffar Khan, who preferred joining India instead of Pakistan. The secular Pashtun leadership was also of the view that if joining India was not an option then they should espouse the cause of an independent ethnic Pashtun state rather than Pakistan. The secular stance of Abdul Ghaffar Khan had driven a wedge between the Jamiyatul Ulama Sarhad (JUS) and the otherwise pro-Congress (and pro-Indian unity) Jamiat Ulema Hind, as well as Abdul Ghaffar Khan&#x27;s Khudai Khidmatgars, who also espoused Hindu-Muslim unity. Unlike the centre JUH, the directives of the JUS in the province began to take on communal tones. The JUS ulama saw the Hindus in the province as a &#x27;threat&#x27; to Muslims. Accusations of molesting Muslim women were leveled at Hindu shopkeepers in Nowshera, a town where anti-Hindu sermons were delivered by mullas. Tensions also rose in 1936 over the abduction of a Hindu girl in Bannu. Such controversies stirred up anti-Hindu sentiments amongst the province&#x27;s Muslim population. By 1947 the majority of the JUS ulama in the province began supporting the Muslim League&#x27;s idea of Pakistan.

Immediately prior to Pakistani independence from Britain in 1947, the British held a referendum in the NWFP to allow voters to choose between joining Pakistan or India. The referendum was held on 2 July 1947 while polling began on 6 July 1947 and the referendum results were made public on 20 July 1947. According to the official results, there were 572,798 registered voters out of which 289,244 (99.02%) votes were cast in favor of Pakistan while only 2874 (0.98%) were cast in favor of India. According to an estimate the total turnout for the referendum was only 15% less than the total turnout in the 1946 elections. At the same time a large number of Khudai Khidmatgar supporters boycotted the referendum and intimidation against Hindu and Sikh voters by supporters of the Pakistan Movement was also reported.

===Baluchistan===
During British rule in India, Baluchistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India. The Muslim League in the period 1927-1947 strived under Jinnah to introduce reforms in Baluchistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India. Apart from the pro-partition Muslim League that was led by Qazi Muhammad Isa, &quot;three pro-Congress parties were still active in Balochistan&#x27;s politics&quot;, such as the Anjuman-i-Watan Baluchistan, which favoured a united India.

In British-ruled Colonial India, Baluchistan contained a Chief Commissioner&#x27;s province and princely states (including Makran, Las Bela and Kharan) that became a part of Pakistan. The instrument of referendum was applied in Chaghi to Zhob (in northern Balochistan), to determine the will of the people which resulted in a victory for the Muslim League. The province&#x27;s Shahi Jirga and the non-official members of the Quetta Municipality, agreed to join Pakistan unanimously on 29 June 1947; however, the Shahi Jirga was stripped of its members from the Kalat State prior to the vote. According to Rafi Sheikh, the then president of the Baluchistan Muslim League, Qazi Muhammad Isa, informed Jinnah that &quot;Shahi Jirga in no way represents the popular wishes of the masses&quot; and that members of the Kalat State were &quot;excluded from voting; only representatives from the British part of the province voted and the British part included the leased areas of Quetta, Nasirabad Tehsil, Nushki and Bolan Agency.&quot; Following the referendum, the Khan of Kalat, on 22 June 1947, received a letter from members of the Shahi Jirga, as well as sardars from the leased areas of Baluchistan, stating that they, &quot;as a part of the Baloch nation, were a part of the Kalat state too&quot; and that if the question of Baluchistan&#x27;s accession to Pakistan arise, &quot;they should be deemed part of the Kalat state rather than (British) Balochistan&quot;. This has brought into question whether a vote took place in the princely Kalat state, the consensus of which remains disputed.

The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province’s inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.

Kalat finally acceded to Pakistan on 27 March 1948 after the help of All India Radio and a period of negotiations and bureaucracy. The signing of the Instrument of Accession by Ahmad Yar Khan, led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against his brother&#x27;s decision in July 1948. Princes Agha Abdul Karim Baloch and Muhammad Rahim refused to lay down arms, leading the Dosht-e Jhalawan in unconventional attacks on the army until 1950. Though the Princes fought a lone battle without support from the rest of Baluchistan.

=== Bengal ===
Dhaka was the birthplace of the All India Muslim League in 1906. The Pakistan Movement was highly popular in the Muslim population of Bengal. Many of the Muslim League&#x27;s notable statesmen and activists hailed from East Bengal, including Khabeeruddin Ahmed, Sir Abdul Halim Ghuznavi, Anwar-ul Azim, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Jogendra Nath Mandal, Khawaja Nazimuddin, and Nurul Amin, many among whom later became Prime ministers of Pakistan. Following the partition of Bengal, violence erupted in the region, which was mainly contained to Kolkata and Noakhali.

It is documented by Pakistani historians that Suhrawardy wanted Bengal to be an independent state that would neither join Pakistan or India but would remain unpartitioned. Despite the heavy criticism from the Muslim League, Jinnah realised the validity of Suhrawardy&#x27;s argument and gave his tacit support to the idea of an Independent Bengal. Nevertheless, the Indian National Congress decided for partition of Bengal in 1947, which was additionally ratified in the subsequent years.

=== Rohingya Muslims ===
During the Pakistan Movement in the 1940s, Rohingya Muslims in western Burma had an ambition to annex and merge their region into East-Pakistan. Before the independence of Burma in January 1948, Muslim leaders from Arakan addressed themselves to Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and asked his assistance in annexing of the Mayu region to Pakistan which was about to be formed. Two months later, the North Arakan Muslim League was founded in Akyab (modern: Sittwe, capital of Arakan State), it, too demanding annexation to Pakistan. However, it is noted that the proposal never materialised after it was reportedly turned down by Jinnah.

=== Role of Ulama ===

The Ulama support for the Pakistan Movement came in the form of the New Medina construct, which was formulated by the Barelvis and a section of the Deobandi clergy. In its election campaign in 1946 the Muslim League drew upon the support of Islamic scholars and Sufis with the rallying cry of &#x27;Islam in danger&#x27;. The majority of Barelvis supported the creation of Pakistan and Barelvi ulama issued fatwas in support of the Muslim League. In contrast, most Deobandi ulama (led by Hussain Ahmed Madani) opposed the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. Husain Ahmad Madani and the Deobandis advocated composite nationalism, according to which Muslims and Hindus were one nation (cf. &quot;Composite Nationalism and Islam&quot;). Madani differentiated between &quot;qaum&quot; -which meant a multi-religious nation - and &quot;millat&quot; - which was exclusively the social unity of Muslims.

However, a few highly influential Deobandi clerics did support the creation of Pakistan. Such Deobandi ulama included Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Muhammad Shafi Deobandi, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, and Zafar Ahmad Usmani. Thanwi was one of the chief proponent of this Movement. He also sent groups of Muslim scholars to give religious advice and reminders to Jinnah, he dismissed the criticism that most Muslim League members were not practising Muslims. Thanwi was of the view that the Muslim League should be supported and also be advised at the same time to become religiously observant. Thanwi&#x27;s disciples Shabbir Ahmad Usmani and Zafar Ahmad Usmani were key players in religious support for the creation of Pakistan.

Acknowledging the services of these ulema, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani was honoured to raise the flag of Pakistan in Karachi and Zafar Ahamd Usmani in Dhaka. Once, the Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was asked whether there was any Islamic cleric who authenticated the division of India on religious bases. Jinnah replied that there was Arshraf Ali Thanwi, and his support to the cause of Muslim League was enough. The Barelvis had no representation in the constitutent assemblies of Pakistan, whereas the Deobandis had their representatives even in the first Constitutent Assembly.

===Muslim minority provinces of British India===

The idea of Pakistan received overwhelming support from Muslim minority provinces of British India, specially the Muslim cultural heartland of U.P. The Muslim League was known to gain its first foothold in the United Provinces, from where it derived a substantial portion of its leadership.

== Conclusion ==
Sir Syed Ahmad Khan&#x27;s (1817–1898) philosophical ideas played a direct role in the Pakistan Movement. His Two-Nation Theory became more and more obvious during the Congress rule (1937-1939) in India. In 1946 it was seen that Muslim majorities in the North-west and North-east India had agreed to the idea of Pakistan, as a response to Congress&#x27;s policies, which were also the result of leaders such as Jinnah leaving the party in favour of the Muslim League, Congress had won in seven of the eleven provinces in 1937 but the Muslim League failed to achieve majority in any province.

But the main motivating and integrating factor was that the Muslims&#x27; intellectual class wanted representation; the masses needed a platform on which to unite. It was the dissemination of western thought by John Locke, Milton and Thomas Paine, at the Aligarh Muslim University that initiated the emergence of Pakistan Movement. According to Pakistan Studies curriculum, Muhammad bin Qasim is often referred to as &#x27;the first Pakistani&#x27;. Muhammad Ali Jinnah also acclaimed the Pakistan movement to have started when the first Muslim put foot in the Gateway of Islam.

After the independence in 1947, violence and upheavals continued to be faced by Pakistan, as Liaquat Ali Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1947. The issue involving the equal status of Urdu and Bengali languages created divergence in the country&#x27;s political ideology. The military take over in 1958 was followed by rapid industrialisation in the 1960s. Economic grievances, unbalanced financial payments, provincialism and ethnic nationalism led to a bloody armed struggle in East Pakistan in the early 1970s, which eventually resulted with East Pakistan becoming Bangladesh in 1971.

In the successive periods of the tragedy of East-Pakistan, the country continued to rebuild and reconstruct itself constitutionally and embarked on its path to be transformed into republicanism in its full measure. The XIII amendment (1997) and XVIII amendment (2010) transformed the country into becoming a parliamentary republic as well as also becoming a nuclear power in the subcontinent.

=== Non-Muslims contribution and efforts ===
Jinnah&#x27;s vision was supported by a few of the Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jews and Christians who lived in Muslim-dominated regions of undivided India.
The most notable and influential Hindu figure in the Pakistan Movement was Jogendra Nath Mandal from Bengal. Jagannath Azad was from the Urdu-speaking belt. Mandal represented the Hindu contingent calling for an independent Pakistan, and was one of the founding fathers of Pakistan. After independence, Mandal was given ministries of Law, Justice, and Work-Force by Jinnah in Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s government. Ironically, despite all his good contributions, Mandal was badly ignored in the emerging political scenario. He returned to India and submitted his resignation to Liaquat Ali Khan, the then-Prime Minister of Pakistan. He mentioned incidents related to social injustice and a biased attitude towards non-Muslim minorities in his resignation letter.

Although the All India Conference of Indian Christians opposed the partition of India and creation of Pakistan, a minority of Christians dissented from this position and played a pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan. The notable Christians included Sir Victor Turner and Alvin Robert Cornelius. Turner was responsible for the economic, financial planning of the country after independence. Turner was one of the founding fathers of Pakistan, and guided Jinnah and Ali Khan on economic affairs, taxation and handling of the administrative units. Alvin Robert Cornelius was elevated as Chief Justice of Lahore High Court bench by Jinnah and served as Law Secretary in Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s government.

===As an example or inspiration===
The Pakistan Movement became an inspiration in different countries of the world. Protection of one&#x27;s beliefs, equal rights, and liberty were incorporated in the state&#x27;s constitution. Arguments presented by Ali Mazrui pointed out that the South Sudan&#x27;s movement led to the partition of the Sudan into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and South Sudan, which is primarily Christian and animistic.

In Europe, Alija Izetbegović, the first President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, began to embrace the &quot;Pakistan model&quot; in the 1960s, alienating Serbs who would use this ideology to attack Bosniaks later on, while in his &quot;Islamic Declaration&quot; he &quot;designated Pakistan as a model country to be emulated by Muslim revolutionaries worldwide.&quot;

===Memory and legacy===

The Pakistan Movement has a central place in Pakistan&#x27;s memory. The founding story of the Pakistan Movement is not only covered in school and university textbooks but also in innumerable monuments. Almost all key events are covered in Pakistan&#x27;s textbooks, literature, and novels as well. Thus, the Fourteenth of August is one of major and most celebrated national days in Pakistan. To many authors and historians, Jinnah&#x27;s legacy is Pakistan.

The &quot;Minar-e-Pakistan&quot; is a monument which has attracted ten thousand visitors. The &quot;Minar-e-Pakistan&quot; still continues to project the memory to the people to remember the birth of Pakistan. Jinnah&#x27;s estates in Karachi and Ziarat has attracted thousands visitors.

Historian of Pakistan, Vali Nasr, argues that the Islamic universalism had become a main source of the Pakistan Movement that shaped patriotism, meaning, and nation&#x27;s birth. To many Pakistanis, Jinnah&#x27;s role is viewed as a modern Moses-like leader; whilst many other founding fathers of the nation-state also occupy extremely respected places in the hearts of the people of Pakistan.

<doc id="1026313" wikidata="Q1151808" url="?curid=1026313" title="Umeda Sky Building">
<text>The is a two-tower mixed-use skyscraper in Osaka, Japan. Located on the outskirts of the Umeda business district in Kita-ku, Osaka, the Umeda Sky Building consists of two 40-story towers interconnected at their two uppermost stories via glass bridges with escalators and elevators that cross an open atrium space. It is currently the fifteenth-tallest building in the prefecture.

The towers reach a total height of while the overall height of the tower including the spires is . The towers were designed by Hiroshi Hara, and were constructed by Takenaka Corporation&lt;ref name=&quot;Shin Umeda City/Umeda Sky Building&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were completed in 1993.

==History, Design Concept &amp; Construction==
The building was conceived in 1988 as the &quot;City of Air&quot; project for a mixed-use skyscraper with four interconnected towers in the Umeda central business district, in close proximity to the Yodo River. The third tower of the complex was initially planned to be constructed within the current site of the Vegetable Garden, while the fourth tower was to be located on the eastern side of the third tower. Eventually, the Japan economic bubble of the 1980s caused widespread damage to the Japanese economy and brought the total number of towers down to two.

During the architectural planning of the complex, Hiroshi Hara created two overall concepts for the towers. The first concept was to create a modern landmark in the city featuring modern architecture, and drew inspiration from the Grande Arche in Paris, France, which features a hypercube-like design. The second concept was to emphasize a vision of a &quot;floating city&quot;, which can be reflected from the city&#x27;s urban landscape and is contrasted with the opaque ceramic atrium at the ground floor. The concept also included open-air amenities and viewing decks over the Umeda district and the entire Osaka skyline.

Construction started with the construction of the twin towers using reinforced concrete, while the construction of the sky deck began afterwards. As the structural works of the towers were completed, the sky deck was raised to the ground using a set of hydraulic elevators to raise the section upwards, the first time this was done in a construction project. The installation of the glass-layered escalators and elevators also followed the same system. The tower was fully completed and began opening its doors to the public on March 25, 1993.

==Location==
The two-tower skyscrapers sits within the Shin-Umeda City, a mixed-use area that includes The Westin Osaka, and the Shin Umeda City General Information Center. It is also located near key transport hubs such as the Ōsaka Station and the Umeda Station, both of which are among the busiest railway stations in the world.

==Features==
The building primarily highlights the rooftop Kuchu Teien Observatory, also known as the Floating Garden Observatory. The two-floor observatory features Café Sky 40 and the Fence of Vows. The tower also has an underground market that attempts to recreate the atmosphere of Osaka in the early 20th century. The base of the towers contains the Island Garden, and the Vegetable Garden, with walking trails and water features.

==Ownership==
The building was mainly owned by Toshiba Corporation through Toshiba Building Co., but in July 2008, Toshiba sold a majority stake (65%) in Toshiba Building to Nomura Real Estate Co. Toshiba retains 35% ownership.

==Tenants==
Sekisui House is the owner and developer of the complex, and the main tenant of the tower, which contains the company&#x27;s headquarters. Mazda has an office in the Umeda Sky Building Tower East. The German consulate-general is located on the thirty-fifth floor of the Umeda Sky Building Tower East. AstraZeneca have their Japanese and Asia-Pacific headquarters in the East Tower. PlatinumGames is also located in the building.

<text>James Clive Adams OD (born 9 January 1968) is a former Jamaican cricketer, who represented the West Indies as player and captain during his career. He was a left-handed batsman, left-arm orthodox spin bowler and fielder, especially in the gully position. He was also an occasional wicketkeeper when required. He was the head coach of Kent County Cricket Club for five seasons between 2012 and October 2016.

He retired from all cricket in 2004 after a twenty-year career, ending with a Test batting average of 41.26 with a highest score of 208 not out against New Zealand at St. John&#x27;s, Antigua and Barbuda in 1995.

In addition to his playing and coaching credentials, Adams was appointed chairman of FICA in May 2009, replacing the South African great Barry Richards. Adams held this role until March 2017 when he was replaced by Vikram Solanki, Surrey CCC&#x27;s head coach.

==Domestic career==
Adams was called into the Jamaican squad for the 1984/85 season as a teenager and enjoyed a good if unspectacular start to his first-class career. He continued his cricket career for a couple of years after the year 2000, captaining South African provincial team Free State and making guest appearances for Lashings World XI in England. 

==International career==
===Making his mark===
Although it wasn&#x27;t until the 1991/92 season that he was called into the West Indies Test squad for the first time, making his debut against South Africa at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. He went on to pick up 4/43 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings and score a vital 79 not out in the Caribbean side&#x27;s second innings to help the Windies win this one off encounter. 

During the first test against New Zealand of the 1995/96 season, Adams claimed 5 for 17, his only five wicket haul in test match cricket at Barbados&#x27; Kensington Oval. Within the subsequent and final test of that series he scored a career best 208 not out in a drawn encounter at the Antigua Recreation Ground in St John&#x27;s, Antigua. West Indies won the series by a 1-0 margin.

===Captaincy===
Adams was appointed as West Indies captain in 2000, in replacing Brian Lara. He started off with test series victories against Zimbabwe and Pakistan in the Caribbean. Though Windies went on to falter in an away test series against England. After a 5–0 test series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia, Adams thereafter lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and his place in the regional side. News of Adams&#x27; impending dismissal was divulged by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. He simply responded, &quot;Have you heard something I haven&#x27;t?&quot; He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened it had all been a blessing – both the good and bad.

With an average of 41.26 from 54 tests, Adams&#x27; Test career thus came to a close.
He later joined up as the new skipper of South African club side Free State.

==Coaching career==
He was head coach at Kent County Cricket Club for five seasons between 2012 and 2016.

==Personal life==
During August 2021 Adams was bestowed with Jamaica&#x27;s Order of Distinction for his contribution to the sphere of sport.

<text>Martin Paul Bicknell (born 14 January 1969) is a former English cricketer. He played in four Test matches, with the last two, against South Africa in 2003, coming ten years after the first two in the 1993 Ashes series. England had played 114 matches between his appearances, a record. He was considered most unlucky to be constantly overlooked for selection in home Test matches when constantly proving himself a prolific wicket taker in county cricket.

He was a very effective medium-fast swing and seam bowler who reached one thousand first-class wickets for his county, Surrey, in 2005, having achieved the milestone in all first-class matches the previous year. In 2000 he had match figures of 16-119 for Surrey against Leicestershire at Guildford, the second best match figures ever returned for the county. His figures in the second innings were 9-47. His best innings figures were 9-45, against Cambridge University at The Oval in 1988.

He was also an increasingly useful tail-end batsman, verging on all-rounder status, with three first-class centuries to his name and an average of 24.87.

His brother Darren Bicknell was a sound county batsman formerly with Surrey and finishing his career with Nottinghamshire.

Bicknell lives in Churt, Farnham, He is married to Sarah, and has four children: Ellie, Charlotte, Mia-May and Millie-Coco.

Bicknell was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2001.

He made his first-class debut in 1986. Having initially intended to cease playing at the end of the 2006 season, he was struck by a series of niggling injuries which forced him to announce an earlier retirement from first-class cricket on 9 August 2006, moving on to take up a post at Charterhouse School as the Master in Charge of Cricket.

His autobiography, &quot;Bickers&quot;. was published in 2008.

<text>The Boeing Chinook is a large, tandem rotor helicopter operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). A series of variants based on the United States Army&#x27;s Boeing CH-47 Chinook, the RAF Chinook fleet is the largest outside the United States. RAF Chinooks have seen extensive service in the Falklands War, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

The Chinook, normally based at RAF Odiham in England, provides heavy-lift support and transport across all branches of the British armed forces since the early 1980s. The RAF has a total of sixty Chinooks in active inventory as of 2015. In 2018, the UK issued a request to the United States to purchase sixteen additional rotorcraft. The Chinook is expected to remain in RAF service until the 2040s.

==Design and development==

===Chinook HC1===

In March 1967, the United Kingdom placed an order for fifteen Boeing Vertol CH-47B Chinook to replace the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Bristol Belvedere HC.1 fleet. In British service the new aircraft was to be designated as the Chinook HC Mk 1 (also formatted as HC.1 or HC1) standing for &quot;Helicopter, Cargo Mark 1&quot;. However in November of that year, the order was cancelled in a review of defence spending.

UK Chinook procurement ambitions were revived in 1978 with an announced requirement for a new heavy-lift helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex. Thirty Chinooks were ordered at a price of US$200 million. These helicopters, comparable to the CH-47C with Lycoming T55-L-11E engines, were again designated Chinook HC1, and entered service in December 1980. Eight more HC1 were delivered from 1984 to 1986, with the CH-47D&#x27;s Lycoming T55-L-712 turboshaft engines.

The replacement of the HC1s metal rotor blades with aluminium and glass fibre composite rotor blades saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC1B. All surviving aircraft were later returned to Boeing and updated to the Chinook HC2 standard for further service within the RAF.

===Chinook HC2===
The US Army&#x27;s next generation Chinook, the CH-47D, entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, redundant and improved electrical systems, an advanced flight control system (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF returned their original HC1 fleet to Boeing for upgrading to CH-47D standard, the first of which returned to the UK in 1993.

Three additional HC2 Chinooks were ordered with delivery beginning in 1995. Another six were ordered in 1995 under the Chinook HC2A designation; the main difference between these and the standard HC2 was the strengthening of the front fuselage to allow the fitting of an aerial refuelling probe in future.

One Argentine CH-47C was captured during the Falklands War, and used by the RAF as a training aid. The rear fuselage was later used to repair a crashed RAF Chinook in 2003.

In 2006, the retirement dates for the HC2 and HC2A fleets were scheduled for 2015 and 2025 respectively, but if planned upgrades are made both types could expect to be flying until 2040.

===Chinook HC3===

Eight Chinook HC3 were ordered in 1995 as dedicated special forces helicopters, which were intended to be low-cost variants of the US Army&#x27;s MH-47E. The HC3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259 million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the HC3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it was not possible to certify the avionics software.

The programme was widely judged to be &quot;a profoundly inept piece of procurement&quot;: Sir Peter Spencer, who as head of the Defence Procurement Agency inherited the project, said that the &quot;original requirement was ... actually impossible. I mean, there were 100 essential requirements. I read all of them. One of them said to give protection against any missile coming from any direction.&quot; Spencer later commented: &quot;it is always hard to imagine why people think you would be able cost effectively to buy a bespoke requirement for a very small production run.&quot;

The avionics were unsuitable due to poor risk analysis and necessary requirements omitted from the procurement contract. &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) planned to perform software integration itself, without Boeing&#x27;s involvement, in order to reduce costs. While lacking certification, the helicopters were only permitted to fly in visual meteorological conditions and subsequently stored in climate controlled hangars. In 2004, Edward Leigh, then Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee described it as &quot;One of the most incompetent procurements of all time.&quot;

&quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot; reported in November 2006 that after protracted negotiations to allow them to enter service, the Defence Aviation Repair Agency would likely receive a contract to install the Thales &quot;TopDeck&quot; avionics system on the Chinook HC3s. However, the MOD announced in March 2007 that this so-called &quot;Fix to Field&quot; programme would be cancelled, and instead it would revert the helicopters&#x27; avionics to Chinook HC2/2A specification. The programme was estimated to cost £50–60 million. In June 2008, the National Audit Office issued a scathing report on the MOD&#x27;s handling of the affair, stating that the whole programme was likely to cost £500 million by the time the helicopters enter service. On 6 July 2009, the first of the eight modified Chinook HC3s made its first test flight at MOD Boscombe Down as part of the flight testing and evaluation phase of the HC3 &quot;reversion&quot; programme.

===Chinook HC4===

A programme to upgrade forty-six Chinook HC2/2A and HC3 helicopters was initiated in December 2008. Known as &quot;Project Julius&quot;, it included new digital flight deck avionics based on the Thales TopDeck avionics suite, comprising new multifunction displays, a digital moving map display and an electronic flight bag, installation of a nose-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) detector, and upgrading the engines to the more powerful T55-714 standard. Upgraded HC2/2A and HC3 aircraft were redesignated HC4 and HC5 respectively. Deliveries were expected to commence in 2011. The first conversion, a Chinook HC4, first flew on 9 December 2010. Initial operating capability status was reached in June 2012 with seven aircraft delivered. In July 2017, it was announced that the thirty-eight Chinook HC4s were to be upgraded to a HC6A standard including the replacement of the analogue flight control systems with the Boeing Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS). By February 2022, no HC4 variants remained, with the fleet comprising HC5, HC6 and HC6A variants.

===Chinook HC5, HC6 and HC6A===
The Chinook HC6 designation has been assigned to the twenty-four (later reduced to fourteen) CH-47F-derived Chinooks ordered in 2009. In December 2015, the fourteenth and final HC6 was delivered to the RAF.

By February 2022 the fleet consisted of HC5, HC6 and HC6A variants.

=== Chinook ER ===
In March 2024, the MoD announced its intention to purchase 14 Chinook Extended Range (ER) models which have twice the range of the 14 oldest RAF Chinooks they will replace.

==Operational history==
RAF Chinooks have been widely deployed in support of British military engagements, serving their first wartime role in Operation Corporate, the Falklands War, in 1982.

Chinooks were used in Operation Granby in the 1991 Gulf War. The Chinook became a vital transit tool during the war. They were used for moving troops into the region at the start of the conflict; a Chinook was used on 22 January 1991 to transport a Special Air Service (SAS) patrol on the famous Bravo Two Zero mission. In the aftermath of the conflict as many as nine British Chinooks delivered food and supplies to thousands of Kurdish refugees from Iraq.

On 10 August 1999, hundreds of Chinooks around the world, including those used by the British armed forces, were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during routine inspection.

One Chinook in particular, known by its original squadron code &quot;Bravo November&quot;, is a well recognised and decorated aircraft due to its service record; it has seen action in every major operation involving the RAF in the helicopter&#x27;s almost 40-year service life, including the Falkland Islands, Lebanon, Germany, Northern Ireland, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

===Falklands War===
During the Falklands War, Chinooks were deployed by both the British and Argentinian forces. In April 1982, four Chinooks were loaded aboard the container ship MV &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; bound for the Falkland Islands, to support the British operations. On 25 May 1982, the Chinook &quot;Bravo November&quot; was sent to pick up freight from HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot;. While the helicopter was airborne, &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was attacked by an Argentine Navy Dassault Super Étendard with an Exocet sea-skimming missile. &quot;Bravo November&quot; avoided the ship&#x27;s destruction, assisted in the evacuation of the ship, and later landed on the aircraft carrier , gaining the nickname &quot;The Survivor&quot;. Owing to the rapid spread of fire and smoke aboard &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; after the Exocet strike, it was not possible to fly any of the helicopters that remained on the ship&#x27;s deck.

One Argentine Army Chinook was captured intact by British Army after the surrender. RAF Chinooks were part of an estimated force of forty helicopters in the British task force, alongside Westland Sea King and Westland Wessex helicopters.

Post-war, four Chinooks were operated by &quot;ChinDet&quot; (Chinook Detachment) which became No.1310 Flight in 1983. Subsequently, No. 78 Squadron was re-formed in 1986 from the merger of No. 1310 Flight and No.1564 Flight (Sea Kings) and operated two Chinooks as part of the Falklands Garrison. This was reduced to a single helicopter in the mid-1990s and the type was eventually withdrawn from the Falklands in 2006, in order to free up resources and aircraft for operations in Afghanistan.

===Afghanistan===
Chinook helicopters were relied upon heavily to support the British forces in Afghanistan continuously from the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeastern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006, six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.
The continued operation of the fleet was made more cost effective when maintenance and support regimes were altered in 2006 and 2007. On 15 December 2009, the British government announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of twenty-four new build Chinooks, twenty-two to expand the force and two to replace losses in Afghanistan, to be delivered to the RAF from 2012. The number of additional Chinooks was cut by twelve in the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010. This brought the total fleet size to sixty aircraft; as of 2009, the RAF had forty-eight Chinooks in inventory.

===Other deployments===
On 6 June 1999, two Chinooks of No. 7 Squadron left RAF Odiham in Hampshire, carrying paratroopers to join NATO forces serving in the Balkans; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies. On 12 June 1999, waves of Chinooks, escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo as a part of NATO&#x27;s first phase of deployment.

In May 2000, several Chinook helicopters airlifted British and European Union citizens out of Freetown in Sierra Leone in an evacuation due to regional instability. In September 2000, Chinooks were being used to evacuate casualties from fighting in Freetown to RFA &quot;Sir Percivale&quot;, a support ship docked there.

In July 2006, three Chinook helicopters of No. 27 Squadron deployed to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to evacuate British citizens from Lebanon; the squadron also flew the EU foreign affairs representative Javier Solana to Beirut at the start of the crisis.

In July 2018, three RAF Chinook helicopters were deployed under Operation Newcombe to assist French forces in the Northern Mali conflict with logistics and troop movement.

==Notable incidents and accidents==

;13 May 1986: Chinook HC1 &quot;ZA715&quot; crashed in bad weather in the Falkland Islands. The helicopter, with four crew and twelve troops, crashed into a hill four miles from its destination. With rescuers hampered by blizzards, the personnel were recovered but one crew member had died shortly after the crash, and the co-pilot and a soldier died on the way to hospital. The board of inquiry concluded that the crew had become disorientated due to &quot;white-out&quot; conditions.
;27 February 1987: Chinook HC1 &quot;ZA721&quot; crashed in the Falkland Islands on a test flight following servicing. After leaving RAF Mount Pleasant, the helicopter was at a normal cruising speed and an altitude of between 300 and 700 feet when it nosed down and crashed into the ground about six kilometres south-east of the airfield; it was destroyed by a subsequent fire. The board of inquiry was unable to determine the exact cause but it may have been the forward-swivelling upper boost actuator jamming. All seven on board, three crew and four technicians, were killed.
;6 May 1988: Chinook HC1 &quot;ZA672&quot; hit a pier at Hannover Airport while taxiing into position in a confined space. Its front rotor struck the underside of Pier 10, causing the helicopter to rear up vertically and then fall on its side. A fire started at the rear of the fuselage and soon spread. Three crew members were killed and one had major injuries; the Chinook was destroyed.
;2 June 1994:

:Chinook HC2 &quot;ZD576&quot; crashed on the Mull of Kintyre, Scotland, killing all 25 passengers and all four crew members; the cause is disputed. It is widely regarded as the RAF&#x27;s fourth-worst peacetime disaster.
;19 August 2009: Chinook HC2 &quot;ZA709&quot; made an emergency landing following a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) strike and subsequent engine fire after a cargo drop-off just north of Sangin in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The Chinook flew two kilometres to a safe area before landing. None of the crew sustained any injuries and all evacuated the aircraft before they were rescued by a second Chinook on the same sortie. The damaged aircraft was then destroyed by coalition air strikes to prevent it falling into the hands of the Taliban.
;30 August 2009: Chinook HC2 &quot;ZA673&quot; made a hard landing while on operations near Sangin, Helmand province. It suffered damage to the undercarriage, nose and front rotor, but the crew and fifteen soldiers on board were unharmed. According to the Ministry of Defence it was not possible to safely recover the aircraft due to the location of the crash and it was destroyed with explosives deliberately. The cause of the hard landing was investigated, although it was not thought to have been shot down.

<doc id="1026330" wikidata="Q7786165" url="?curid=1026330" title="This Morning with Richard Not Judy">
<text>This Morning With Richard Not Judy or TMWRNJ is a BBC comedy television programme, written by and starring Lee and Herring. Two series were broadcast in 1998 and 1999 on BBC Two. The name was a satirical reference to ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; which was at the time popularly referred to as &quot;This Morning with Richard and Judy&quot;.

The show was a reworking of old material from their previous work together (radio and TV) along with new characters. Presented in a daytime chat show format in front of a live studio audience, the programme also featured a number of recorded location sketches. It was structured by the often strange obsessions of Richard Herring; examples include his rating of the milk of all creatures and attempting to popularise the acronym of the show (&quot;TMWRNJ&quot;) (in the style of &quot;Tiswas&quot;). The show featured (and acknowledged its use of) repetition, with regular and vigilant viewers being rewarded by jokes that would make no sense to casual viewers. The show seemed to oscillate between the intellectual and puerile. Irony was often used, even though the citing of irony as an excuse was mocked by the show&#x27;s stars in one of many self-referential jokes.

The actor Kevin Eldon also reprised two of his characters from the earlier Lee &amp; Herring series &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;, Simon Quinlank (the &quot;King of Hobbies&quot;) and his portrayal of &quot;the false Rod Hull&quot; as a jelly fanatic with a false arm and giant chin. A run of sketches featuring Eldon as the false Rod Hull was filmed for the second series, but dropped when the real Rod Hull died just prior to the start of the series. A new sketch was filmed as a tribute and featured as the closing item of the last programme in the series. (Rod Hull had taken this in good humour and had featured in one episode of &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; as a guest, pouring scorn on the false Rod Hull.)

&quot;TMWRNJ&quot; was the subject of many complaints on &quot;Points of View&quot;, largely due to the surprisingly adult content for a programme shown on Sunday lunchtime. The Jesus sketches were much remarked upon on &quot;Points of View&quot; due to the time of broadcast and uncertainty as to whether they were making fun of Jesus or people&#x27;s take on the scriptures. Like &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; it remains a cult series fondly remembered by fans.

==Regular features: Series 1 and 2==

===The Curious Orange===
Questions about life from a gigantic talking orange, played by Paul Putner. The name is derived from the album &quot;I Am Kurious Oranj&quot; by The Fall (itself a reference to the film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;), which was used to introduce each Curious Orange segment. At the end of the first series, having been revealed to be Richard Herring&#x27;s illegitimate son, he was crushed to death and &quot;juiced&quot;, but he was later reconstituted by a mad scientist. Throughout the second series his behaviour became increasingly sinister, and for a while he was replaced by The Curious Alien (in truth due to Putner&#x27;s commitments elsewhere). By the final episode, he had mutated into a tyrannical character reminiscent of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s Davros (though &quot;just different enough not to infringe any copyright laws&quot;).

===Histor&#x27;s Eye===
Ostensibly an extremely low-budget Sky TV children&#x27;s television programme featuring two pirate crows: the titular Histor (who concealed a multicoloured spinning eye beneath his eyepatch) and his hapless first mate Pliny Harris. Histor&#x27;s ability to transport himself and Pliny through time (&quot;as the crow flies&quot;) to view past events would be used to satirise current affairs, and the script would be peppered with deliberately weak but dense nautical- and bird-related multiple puns, which would increase in volume and weakness as the series progressed. (For example, Pliny would say &#x27;Egg feather bird &quot;oeuf&quot; tit&#x27; in place of &#x27;I&#x27;ve never heard of it&#x27;, or &#x27;Feather me wingers&#x27; in place of &#x27;Shiver me timbers&#x27;.) Pliny&#x27;s idiocy drives Histor to insanity and, eventually, he murders him by stuffing him with eggs until he bursts, as he keeps using the word &quot;egg&quot; so it has no connection or relation to the context of what Histor was saying, (only for Histor to be subsequently haunted by Pliny&#x27;s equally pun-obsessed ghost). A running joke in this segment was that despite Pliny&#x27;s apparent idiocy, he would occasionally counter Histor&#x27;s right-wing views with extraordinarily eloquent and well constructed left-wing arguments. This would often result in Pliny being physically attacked by Histor or a third party (e.g. having a broken glass shoved into his face by a &quot;lager lout&quot; Saint George).

Another running gag not featured in the fictional show, but would be part of its introduction, would be a sketch in which Herring naively complains about a recent report in the media, only for Lee to try to correct him before realising the best way to make him understand better is showing him &quot;An educational film for the under fives&quot; he taped from cable TV. After the segment Lee would ask Herring if that cleared the matter up for him, with Herring praising the crows for this saying he now understands. Indeed, Herring once points out that the same joke is always told every week before showing the latest episode, shortly after Lee told him that telling the same jokes soon wears off, with the episode of &quot;Histor&#x27;s Eye&quot; being focused on that topic. The gag was less frequent in the second series. During the segment, an indent reading &quot;KIDZ CHANNEL&quot; would be displayed in the top left of the screen, a reference to many Sky Television channels at the time during broadcast.

===Musical Interludes===
Richard Thomas played keyboards every week on the show and in series 1 would play a hymn at the end of the show.

===Pause for Thought for the Day===
The Unusual Priest, played by Kevin Eldon, would present ethical dilemmas, dealing with them in increasingly ridiculous fashion. Based on a character called Monsignor Treeb-Lopez originally created by Lee and Herring for the satirical radio news show &quot;On The Hour&quot;.

===When Insects Attack===
A parody of the show &quot;When Animals Attack!&quot;, with a voice-over supposedly by actor Greg Evigan (actually Mark Gatiss). The last episode of this segment, in the first series, saw &quot;The Lettuce Family&quot; attacked by a slug, which Evigan points out is a mollusc and not an insect. In the second series this was replaced by &quot;When Things Get Knocked Over, Spill, or Fall Out of Cupboards&quot;.

===King (or Queen) of the Show===
In each edition, a member of the audience would be crowned &quot;King (or Queen) of the Show&quot;, either at random or as a reward for sending in an especially entertaining letter. After being crowned, they would be offered various items from a trolley; these items would all be linked by the current theme of the show. The crown and trolley would be brought on by the normally mute (&quot;We can&#x27;t afford to pay you to speak&quot;) Trevor and Nathalie (Trevor Lock and Nathalie Brandon) who would sometimes be dressed in outlandish costumes. At this point Trevor would invariably be mocked by Stew for having &quot;a small face&quot;.

Richard Herring would use this segment of the show as an opportunity to swear live on Sunday morning TV. Each week it would be varied. For example, he would chant &quot;There&#x27;s only one King. One King. Wan King. Wanking!&quot; On another week, imitating a trumpet, &quot;Fa fa fa fa, King! Fa fa fa fucking!&quot;

===Trevor and Nathalie===
A man with &#x27;an extremely small face&#x27;, called Trevor (comedian Trevor Lock), and a woman called Nathalie, played by Nathalie Brandon, would appear on each show in non-speaking roles as slaves, often to bring in props or to usher in guests or other performers.

===The Five Aims===
Every week, Rich and Stew discussed five aims they wanted to implement before the end of the series, a parody of New Labour&#x27;s pledge cards from the 1997 General Election. (The aims were different every week).

==Regular features: Series 1==

===The Profit Making Phone Opinion Poll===
Each week the show staged a phone-in which was purely designed to make money for Lee and Herring. The phone-in was hosted by &#x27;Jo Unwin and the actor Kevin Eldon&#x27; and tackled issues which dominated the week&#x27;s news. The phone-in would present viewers with three options to the topical question, of which one would be phrased in a style similar to &quot;I agree, but trivial phone opinion polls about such important issues are morally offensive.&quot;

===The Ironic Review===
A fly-on-the-wall documentary about a so-called cutting edge magazine. The item was ostensibly a satire of &quot;The Modern Review&quot;, with the journalists being in bitter competition to see who could write the most &quot;ironic&quot; article.

===Men of Achievement 1974===
A short item in which the details of an entry in the book of the same name would be read out. At one point, it was noted as the least popular part of the show, but to be kept in &#x27;until it becomes so popular, it gets its own series&#x27;. Men whose entries were read included Harold Warner Munn, Robin Dudding, and Moritz Jagendorf.
Men of Achievement 1974 was first mentioned in the TV version of &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; as an item Richard Herring had shoplifted from a charity shop.

===The School===
A fly on the wall documentary focussing on two teachers and their attempts to teach English at a secondary school. Mr Keith Harris (Herring) is an old fashioned teacher described as a &#x27;good man&#x27; by the head master who is abused by his students and enjoys nothing more than marking. Mr Ian Kennedy (Lee) is a rogue teacher who constantly attempts to rock the establishment. He is described as &#x27;a fuckwit&#x27; by the head teacher.

===Roger Crowley===
The self-styled most evil man alive, played by Roger Mann. During the first series he would regularly break into the programme to outline his latest absurd plan for world domination. Based on Aleister Crowley (evident in the costume&#x27;s triangular hat). And fish.

===The Organ Gang===
Also known as &quot;TOG&quot;, in keeping with Richard&#x27;s unhealthy abbreviation obsession – A spoof children&#x27;s series, drawn by Joseph Champniss and narrated by Brian Cant, in which the characters were all organs of the human body, they would have some adventure and end up &quot;laughing for a whole five minutes.&quot; It bore some resemblance to the real children&#x27;s series &quot;The Garden Gang&quot; in which all the characters were fruit and vegetables. The final episode saw Brian Cant ranting at his duty of being the narrator saying &quot;I&#x27;m Brian Cant!&quot;.

===Special Guests===
The first series featured guests who were interviewed in a talk show fashion including Mel &amp; Sue, Jenny Eclair, Peter Baynham and Jack Docherty (who claimed to have had sex with Morwenna Banks while she was dressed as her &#x27;little girl&#x27; character from &quot;Absolutely&quot;).

==Regular features: Series 2==

===Sunday Heroes===
A series of sketches featuring Jesus and his disciples as the main characters, parodying a schoolteacher and his class. In one sketch per week a disciple would pose a question to Jesus (Lee), usually on a topic of importance that would split Christianity (e.g. Transubstantiation vs Transignification). Instead of answering directly He would make a vague comment (such as instructing them to &quot;consider the lily&quot;), pause, then say &quot;ahh&quot; in a mysterious manner, causing all but Matthew (Herring) to &quot;ahh&quot; along with Him, leading the disciple to become frustrated with the evasion (&quot;This isn&#x27;t an &#x27;ahh&#x27; situation&quot;; &quot;Ahh!&quot;; &quot;No, not &#x27;ahh&#x27; – you can&#x27;t just say &#x27;consider the lily&#x27;&quot;; &quot;Ahh!&quot;; &quot;No Jesus: Not &#x27;ahh&#x27;.&quot;) Peter (Carlton Dixon) would insult Matthew for not understanding, insisting in a smug &quot;class swot&quot; manner that he &quot;got it right away&quot;, and Judas (Eldon) would also laugh at double entendres, only to be admonished. The other Apostles were played by Paul Putner (&quot;Doubting Thomas&quot;), Trevor Lock (Thaddaeus) and TV&#x27;s Emma Kennedy (the fictional Ian, who only started following Jesus as he misunderstood the phrase &quot;fishers of men&quot;). These sketches tended to cause some controversy given the time of the show and the day of its broadcast.

===The Corrs Shrine===
A shrine to the Corrs or more correctly &#x27;The Corrs Shrine&#x27;. Essentially Herring&#x27;s infatuation with Andrea Corr. The rest of them (particularly the &quot;Man Corr&quot;) he didn&#x27;t care for, a joke based on the similar looks of the Corr sisters.

===Extra Final Scene===
This would take the form of a tacked-on ending for a different film each week, for example as extra final scene for &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; which saw Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman laughing and urinating on the grave of John Belushi before driving off in the Bluesmobile. Another was made for &quot;Titanic&quot;, in which Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character swims to the surface after Kate Winslet is rescued to celebrate finally escaping her clutches.

===Angus Deayton&#x27;s Authorised History Of Alternative Comedy (with Angus Deayton)===
A satirical version of a BBC series that explored the boom in alternative comedy in the 1970s and early 1980s. The item would involve a comedian (either the portrayal of a real life person or a generic stand-up) reminisce about the &quot;amazing times&quot; they had, while shamelessly exaggerating their trailblazing influence. The characters would always be seen drinking from an SDP mug, a reference to the political party famously supported by John Cleese (whose picture appeared on the title screen) during the 1980s. Angus Deayton himself did not appear.

===Curious Alien===
In series 2 the Curious Orange was replaced by the Curious Alien as Stew became increasingly frustrated with the Orange&#x27;s behaviour.

===Rich&#x27;s Robbie Williams Tattoo===
Rich becomes obsessed with Robbie Williams as a result of his alleged relationship with Andrea Corr. To display his love for the former Take That member Rich draws a felt tip pen tattoo on his stomach in the shape of Robbie Williams.

===Nostradamus and his horse David Collins===
A regular feature in the second series, medieval seer Nostradamus (played by TV&#x27;s Emma Kennedy with a false beard, a &quot;flighty&quot; horse called David Collins and, for no adequately explored reason, a Welsh accent) would give his predictions for the week ahead, which would often be either predetermined, extremely vague or completely absurd. The start of the segment would look at the previous week&#x27;s predictions: if they were not correct, Nostradamus would be punished by a nipple cripple, or something similarly pseudo-sexual, by Richard. During one episode Richard obsessed about cress for a whole show, as a spoof of product placement deals. When Nostradamus only got one out of three predictions correct, a barbecue of cress was burnt with a blowlamp.

As the series progressed, it became clear that there was sexual tension between Herring and Nostradamus, the latter openly enjoying the physical punishments handed out by the former. Herring believed their love to be forbidden since both were &quot;men&quot;.

===Richard Herring&#x27;s Food and Milk===
A weekly segment in which Richard Herring would taste a different milk (shrew, tapir, blue whale, Jesus milk, American beaver milk, the milk of human kindness) and give a rating out of ten. Despite the name no solid food was ever featured in this piece (although Golden Grahams also featured elsewhere on the show several times, apparently to ensure this unloved cereal did not go unnoticed in the UK). He would end with the line &quot;Remember, there&#x27;ll always be milk&quot;. According to Stewart Lee, the five-second opening jingle that plays when the milk of the week is announced comes from a piece by avant-garde composer Harrison Birtwistle. The producers doctored the frequencies to make the already abrasive noise sound much louder than anything else, to be jarring to hungover viewers.

===Lazy Comedy Slags===
Lee and Herring would discuss lazy comedy clichés, such as jokes that end by revealing an incongruous fact and jokes designed to play on the audience&#x27;s sense of nostalgia for the 1970s.
During one episode they also brainstormed lazy comedy ideas for the BBC. Their ideas would usually include characters called Ian – a running joke which also featured in Sunday Heroes, with one of the disciples being called Ian. Proposed programmes included:
* Roll Reversall
Ian Roll is a driving instructor, Ian Reversall is a baker. Due to some kind of accident they are forced to swap jobs. With hilarious consequences.
* Pie In The Sky
Ian Pie is the landlord of the Sky pub. In an attempt to attract custom each week he buys a different giant pie which goes wrong and ironically scares the public away. With hilarious consequences.
* Myy Cup Upstairs
Ian Myy lives in a flat. His upstairs neighbour borrows one of his cups and then doesn&#x27;t return it. The series details Ian Myy&#x27;s contrived and failed attempts to get back the cup that is rightfully his.
* Babes In The Wood
Two babies live in a piece of wood. Simple but brilliant.

===Lazy TV Executive Twits===
Lee and Herring discussed the laziness of TV executives after Rich received an offer from Channel 5 to make a programme about fishing due to his surname. They decided to submit some ideas to Channel 5 themselves, which included:
* Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s Huge Furry Wishing Stall
Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall tours the country in a gigantic mink lined stall granting peoples&#x27; wishes.
* Fox watch with Dr Fox
Dr Fox hides a secret camera in the toilet of small American actor Michael J. Fox and watches him go about his daily ablutions.
* Jeremy Paxman&#x27;s Pacman
Jeremy Paxman goes round the country on a moped playing the early arcade game Pac-Man. He is not allowed to leave any town until he has clocked up the highest score for that machine.
* Van Outen&#x27;s Van Outings
Denise Van Outen goes out in a van and meets other people with &#x27;Van&#x27; in their name and outs them as homosexual. Whether they are or not.

==Quotes==
&quot;Curse you, God, for making me this way!&quot; – A feature of a recurring theme in the series, where someone would be laughed at (in a surreal fashion) due to a misfortune. The victim of the ridicule would always say this, while shaking his or her fists at the sky.

&quot;My expectations were confounded and from thence the humour arose.&quot;

&quot;Who is the real sick man in this so called society?&quot; A question posed by Herring throughout the first series to justify his outrageously inappropriate and perverse personal anecdotes such as:
&quot;Wanting to make love to an animal with the body of Natalie Imbruglia and the head of an ant.&quot;
He would compare his activities to those of
&quot;the businessman, in his suit and tie, having sex with the same woman, his wife, every day of his life for 40 years.&quot;
It was always concluded by Lee that Herring was clearly the more sick.

&quot;Look at his little face, it&#x27;s almost as if he understands.&quot;

&quot;Saying it in a staccato fashion doesn&#x27;t make it any more true.&quot;

&quot;No, listen to the question and the words in it...&quot;

==Reunions==

===Lee &amp; Herring at Tedstock (Bloomsbury Theatre), 5 February 2007===
Stewart Lee and Richard Herring reformed their act after a period of eight years to perform a brief selection of their old material at Tedstock 2007, at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London. Self-mocking and sarcastic as ever, the pair opened with a pastiche of the Mitchell and Webb PC vs. Mac adverts shown that year, which then led on to a rant by Rich that &quot;It should have been us Stew!&quot;

===TMWRNJ Reunion Show at The Lyric, Hammersmith Nov 2008===
Lee and Herring performed a 40-minute selection of their TMWRNJ material at a &#x27;reunion gig&#x27; at the Lyric Hammersmith in November 2008. Their approach to the material was characteristically sarcastic and self-referential, with both comedians ruthlessly deriding their own classic routines even down to points of language and grammar – despite Herring insisting that &quot;You can&#x27;t question the text! This is like Shakespeare!&quot;

Both comedians fell into their old double act with relative comfort. Much humour was drawn both from the passage of time since TMWRNJ came to an end (Rich opens the set with &quot;Old Mr Lee! Old Mr Lee! Can Stewart come out to play?&quot;) and the effective lack of a television career for either comedian since. (Stewart Lee has since returned to the screen on &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; on BBC Two).

Highlights of the reunion show included a performance of the TMWRNJ theme song by TV&#x27;s Emma Kennedy&#x27;s band Vaginal Tap and the return of Paul Putner as The Curious Orange.

==DVD release==

In 2014 Richard Herring wrote that he was attempting to acquire the rights of TMWRNJ from the BBC to release the two series on DVD. However, in February 2015 he announced that the release would now not be happening, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not happening and I doubt it ever will, Nothing you or I can do about it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Mustard&quot; magazine, Stewart Lee explained that the DVD&#x27;s cancellation was due to a financial decision and his reluctance to fund what he considers a vanity project at this time. Lee does not however, rule out its future release.

<text>Courtney Oswald Browne (born 7 December 1970) is a former English-born cricketer. He is a right-handed wicketkeeping batsman. He is the only West Indian Test cricketer to have been born in England. He was a member of the West Indies team that won the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, and had a major role in winning the final.

Browne was captaining Barbados when he got his first call up to the West Indies side in April 1995. He struggled to hold his place in the side and after 13 Tests he was dropped and didn&#x27;t return until 3 years later for the ICC Knockout tournament in Kenya. He was soon dropped again, replaced by Ridley Jacobs. His career seemed over but he got a surprise recall for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England. He was the hero in the final, his partnership with Ian Bradshaw saw them home at The Oval. After a year as first choice keeper he decided this time to leave on his own terms, retiring for &#x27;personal reasons&#x27;.

He is a former captain of LIME Sports Club, and competed in the Barbados Cricket Association Division 1 championship.

<text>Peter Jeffrey Leroy Dujon (born 28 May 1956) is a retired West Indian cricketer and current commentator. He was a part of the West Indian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1983 Cricket World Cup.

He was the wicket-keeper for the West Indies cricket team of the 1980s, an athletic presence behind the stumps as well as a competent middle order batsman.

Dujon attended Wolmer&#x27;s Schools. Dujon made his first-class debut in 1974, and Test debut in 1981. During his nineteen-year career, Dujon played 200 first-class matches for Jamaica and the West Indies. He scored nearly 10,000 runs at an average approaching 40 runs per innings, an impressive statistic when compared with other specialist wicket-keepers over time, as well as completing 447 catches and 22 stumpings. In total, he won 81 Test caps for the West Indies and was never a part of any losing series.

Dujon was one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1989 and since retiring as a player in 1992, has worked as assistant coach to the West Indies national team and in development of young cricket players in his native Jamaica.

<text>Neighbourhood Threat is the first album by American rock band Johnny Crash, released in 1990. It was recorded at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles, and mixed at Battery Studios, London. The album features guest appearances by Kingdom Come members Danny Stag and Johnny B. Frank.

After this album, August Worchell was replaced by J.J. Bolt and Stephen Adamo was replaced by Matt Sorum. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed also joined. All three played on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, which was released in 2008.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; noted that &quot;their forte is the straightforward paint-blisterer, like &#x27;Axe to the Wax&#x27;; they have an accomplished screecher in Mr. Wright, who never backs off... And together the band writes simple but melodic songs.&quot;

<doc id="1026339" wikidata="Q3526853" url="?curid=1026339" title="Devon Malcolm">
<text>Devon Eugene Malcolm (born 22 February 1963) is a Jamaican-born English former cricketer. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Malcolm played in 40 Test matches and 10 One Day Internationals for the England cricket team.

Malcolm was one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket, with his career best performance of nine wickets for 57 runs against South Africa being one of the best innings performances in Test history. However, his playing style was also notable for his short-sightedness and poor catching, his powerful throwing arm, his perceived profligacy with the ball and his undoubted ineptitude with the bat, with his batting and fielding being described as of &quot;court-jester standard&quot;.

His under-average ability as a batsman, however, seemed to add to his popularity. He was often cheered when he went out to bat, more often than not at number eleven, a position for which he was often in competition with Phil Tufnell. He hit some huge sixes for both England and Derbyshire and was a particular favorite of commentator Brian Johnston.

As the cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, &quot;Malcolm, incredibly wholehearted with an easy charm off the field, became a national hero.&quot;

==Domestic career==
Malcolm was one of England&#x27;s very few genuinely fast bowlers of the 1990s. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, he emigrated to Sheffield in 1979 and studied there at Richmond College.

Malcolm first played with Derbyshire in 1984, and was with the county until 1997. Highlights of his time with Derbyshire included the county&#x27;s victories in the Refuge Assurance League in 1990 and the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1993, Malcolm taking 3–23 in the semi-final of the latter against Northamptonshire. Malcolm remained a highly effective bowler in county cricket thereafter, and in 1998 moved to play for Northamptonshire. Two years later he moved again, this time to Leicestershire, for whom he played his final first-class match in 2003. In his final season Malcolm claimed over 60 wickets and achieved one 10-wicket haul. He was still one of quickest bowlers in the country towards the end of his career, winning aged 38 the challenge for bowling the fastest delivery in the 2001 C&amp;G Trophy at a speed of 89.5 mph (144 km/h). He passed 1,000 first-class wickets while with Leicestershire.

==International career==
Malcolm&#x27;s chance to play for England came when several members of the Test team announced their intention to take part in a rebel tour to South Africa during the 1989 Ashes series, thereby disqualifying themselves from selection for the rest of the series. He made his international debut in the Fifth Test against an Australia national cricket team already 3–0 up in the series. His first day in international cricket ended wicketless, as did all his team-mates&#x27;, for this was the occasion on which Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh batted together unbeaten throughout the first day. On the second day, Malcolm managed his first scalp, dismissing Steve Waugh for a duck – although it made little difference to the outcome: Australia crushed England by an innings. Malcolm scored 14 runs in his two innings at the bottom of the order, including a four and a six, which perhaps raised false hopes as to his batting ability. His top Test score of 29 off only 18 balls was scored in the 1994–1995 tour of Australia. It included three fours and two successive sixes off Shane Warne.

On the West Indies tour in 1989/90, Malcolm made a major impact, taking five wickets and running out Gordon Greenidge at Sabina Park in Jamaica as England won the First Test, their first victory against the West Indies in a test match for sixteen years. After an abandoned Second Test he then took ten wickets in the Third Test, and, with a total of nineteen scalps in four Tests, returned as England&#x27;s leading wicket-taker of the trip. Although England narrowly lost that series, Malcolm was top wicket-taker again as he
helped England to win their next series against New Zealand, taking two five-wicket hauls. Malcolm was man of the match as England secured a home Test series victory for the first time in five years.

That winter Malcolm joined England&#x27;s tour of Australia and New Zealand. Although England lost the Ashes series heavily, Malcolm won some praise, the &quot;Wisden&quot; review of the tour observing: &quot;Of the established players, other than Russell... surprisingly it was Malcolm who made the biggest advance, despite his costly wickets ... he came back full of running for every spell, bowling with pace and heart, and he might well have won the Sydney Test if Gooch had given him an early chance to attack Rackemann&quot;. Malcolm also played as England won at Leeds the following summer in their first Test victory over the West Indies in England in 22 years, but his wickets had dried up and he was replaced by David Lawrence. After a horrific injury to Lawrence, Malcolm was recalled to the England side in 1992.

Malcolm continued to have intermittent success for England thereafter but struggled with inconsistency. For instance, after taking a five-wicket haul for England against Pakistan at The Oval in 1992, he was selected for a winter tour of India and Sri Lanka and included in the team for three of the four Tests. He struggled in spin-friendly conditions, and although he did take his best one-day international figures on this tour, England lost all of the Tests heavily, and he was dropped. Recalled for the final Test the following summer he took six wickets as England won their first Test against Australia since 1986. Steve Waugh, one of Malcolm&#x27;s victims again on this occasion, and one of Australia&#x27;s greatest Test cricketers, said in retrospect: &quot;We were always amazed every time we played England and Devon Malcolm&#x27;s name wasn&#x27;t on the team sheet … He could bowl the quickest over you ever faced and then the worst over the next over, but as a batsman, that&#x27;s not what you want – you want consistency when someone&#x27;s bowling at you, so you could prepare for what&#x27;s happening&quot;. However, the England selectors disagreed and Malcolm was soon dropped again.

On 20 August 1994, recalled to play for England against South Africa also at The Oval, Malcolm was hit on the helmet by a bouncer while batting at number 11 against bowler Fanie de Villiers. He was incensed by this, turning to the South African slip cordon and exclaiming the now famous words &quot;You guys are history&quot;. South Africa&#x27;s second innings was then destroyed by Malcolm in an outstanding and extremely hostile display of accurate fast bowling, taking nine wickets for only 57 runs, the ninth-best bowling figures in an innings in the entire history of Test cricket as of May 2022.

That winter Malcom participated in the 1994-5 Ashes series, helping England to victory in the fourth test at Adelaide, taking seven wickets in the match and dismissing Waugh again. England however lost the series. Like most England players of his generation, Malcolm would never finish on the winning side in an Ashes series.

Malcolm sought and in October 1995 obtained legal redress when a July 1995 article appearing in the &quot;Wisden Cricket Monthly&quot; questioned the commitment of players of foreign origin to the England cricket team. According to subsequent recollection this recalled typecasting of Malcolm and Gladstone Small by politician Norman Tebbit after the 1990 victory at Sabina Park. Malcolm, along with an England and then Derbyshire colleague Phillip DeFreitas, issued writs for defamation; Malcolm accepted libel damages through the High Court while DeFreitas settled outside of court.

Malcolm&#x27;s relationship with the then England team manager Ray Illingworth became strained and culminated in a row during the following series against South Africa in 1995–96. He was also reported to have had disagreements with England&#x27;s then bowling coach, Peter Lever. Malcolm bowled poorly with the second new ball in the final Test, which allowed Dave Richardson and Paul Adams to add 73 for the last wicket. An insinuation that Malcolm had &quot;no cricketing brain&quot; has been cited as an instance of institutional racism in cricket.

Malcolm played his last Test for England against Australia in 1997, also at the Oval, the ground at which he achieved the all time best bowling figures in a Test innings.

==Beyond cricket==
Malcolm runs DEM Sports, a company that sells cricket equipment to schools and clubs around the world. 

He is Black Communities Events Organiser for the ECB, and was awarded his Freedom of the City of London in April 2023 in honour of his sporting achievements.

<doc id="1026344" wikidata="Q6313384" url="?curid=1026344" title="Junior Murray">
<text>Junior Randalph Murray MBE (born January 20, 1968) is a former West Indian cricketer. He was the first Grenadian to play Test cricket for the West Indies.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1994 New Year Honours for services to sport.

==Domestic career==
Murray started his domestic career as a football goal keeper and was very good at it. He was also just as good behind the stumps as well as a batsman. He represented his school Grenada Boy&#x27;s Secondary School (GBSS) both in football and cricket. Influenced by his school master to focus on cricket rather than football for a better sporting career in the region, he played his domestic cricket for the Windward Islands, making his first class debut in the 1986/87 season and playing on into 2006/07. In 148 first class matches up to the end of 2006 he scored 6,813 runs at a handy 31.1 with a best of 218 against Guyana. In 122 list A one-day matches he scored 1,895 runs at 23.1 with one unbeaten hundred against Bermuda in the Red Stripe Bowl.

==International career==
He played 33 Tests for the West Indies and scored his only Test century, in the lower order against New Zealand. He finished his international career, on the disastrous tour of South Africa of 1998–99, with more than 100 Test dismissals. Murray often opened in One Day Internationals with varying degrees of success.

==Accolades==
A stand at the Grenada National Cricket Stadium was jointly renamed in both Murray and Rawl Lewis&#x27; honour.

<doc id="1026345" wikidata="Q3219919" url="?curid=1026345" title="Lawrence Rowe">
<text>Lawrence George Rowe (born 8 January 1949) is a former West Indian cricketer. A stylish top order batsman, he also played for Jamaica and Derbyshire in his cricketing career. Rowe was later named as one of Jamaica&#x27;s top five cricketers of the 20th century.

==Playing career==
Rowe made his debut for Jamaica in the 1968–69 cricketing season. He then made history on his Test match debut against New Zealand at Sabina Park, Kingston in 1972, scoring 214 and 100 not out, the first time that a cricketer had scored a double and single century on Test debut. It also gave him a batting average of 314 after his first Test match.

During 1974 Rowe scored 302 versus England at Barbados&#x27; Kensington Oval. This was and still remains the highest score by a West Indian at Kensington Oval. He also became one of only four West Indians to have scored a triple century, with the others being Garfield Sobers, Chris Gayle and Brian Lara.

On his arrival in Australia for the 1975–76 tour Rowe was being hailed as the best batsman in the world. A century in his second Test innings in Australia maintained his average at over 70 runs per innings and it seemed to confirm his reputation. The team was humiliated by the Australian side over the rest of the series and Rowe never regained his previously devastating form.

Rowe was a West Indies batting &quot;hero&quot; in the days before Viv Richards. He was known to whistle while he batted though he seemed to be a bit injury prone. During 1974 he started to suffer from astigmatism along with an allergy to grass. As well he dislocated his shoulder while playing against England in 1980.

Playing between 1972 and 1980, Rowe scored a total of 2,047 runs at an average of 43 in his test match career. He also featured for the Windies in 11 One Day Internationals. Rowe played for Derbyshire in the English County Championship and also joined World Series Cricket, where he scored 175 in one match for the WSC West Indies XI.

Rowe later captained two rebel tours to South Africa. This came during apartheid when the country was isolated from world sport. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) thereafter banned the side&#x27;s players for life, though this ban was eventually lifted in 1989. The Windies rebels twice toured South Africa in both the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons. While they lost the 50 over and drew the first class contests in their first tour, the Windies rebels went on to win both series in their subsequent tour. Soon after such Rowe migrated and permanently settled in Miami, US where he eventually became a successful businessman.

During the lunch break of the first Test between West Indies and India on 20 June 2011, Rowe was honoured when the Sabina Park pavilion was named after him, in a ceremony that also honoured Michael Holding and Courtney Walsh. He took the opportunity to apologise on behalf of the rebel West Indian team, saying:

 &quot;...Today I sincerely apologise to the cricketing fraternity of Jamaica, the Caribbean and the rest of the world.&quot;

However, after much protest Lyndel Wright, the Jamaica Cricket Association president, stated their decision was revoked, after Rowe stated publicly that he saw nothing wrong with his decision to tour apartheid South Africa.

===Playing style===

As an elegant right-handed batsman Rowe, also known as &quot;Yagga&quot;, was described by Michael Holding, his teammate, as &quot;the best batsman I ever saw&quot;. It was felt that his ability was so extraordinary that Gary Sobers believed he could have been the greatest of all West Indian batsmen. At one game Rowe hit a ball so cleanly that it followed a level trajectory like a guided missile over the boundary for six. Gideon Haigh describes the incident:

Early in his innings against England at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados, in March 1974, he received a bouncer from Bob Willis. He smashed it flat into the stand at square leg; it travelled most of the way at head height. His 302 took only 430 hectic deliveries, with 36 further boundaries.
==Personal life==
Rowe is the founder of the Lawrence Rowe Foundation, which aims to assist at-risk kids.

<text>Johnny Crash was an American hard rock band formed in 1985. Members originally included former Tokyo Blade singer Vick Wright (Vicki James Wright), former Champaign guitarists Christopher Stewart and August Worchell, bassist Andy Rogers, and former Rock City Angels drummer Stephen &quot;Punkee&quot; Adamo. Their sound was likened to that of AC/DC, and contemporaries Junkyard, Rhino Bucket and The Four Horsemen.

== History ==
In 1990, the band released their first album, &quot;Neighbourhood Threat&quot;, featuring Vicki James Wright (vocals), August Worchell (guitar and backing vocals), Christopher Stewart (guitar and backing vocals), Stephen &quot;Punky&quot; Adamo (drums) and Terry Nails (bass). The band, with Andy Rogers on bass, toured for a short time with bands such as Mötley Crüe and Pretty Maids. The single &quot;Hey Kid&quot; became a minor hit and its video received some rotation on MTV.

Guitarist J.J. Bolt and then-future Guns N&#x27; Roses members Dizzy Reed and Matt Sorum joined the band to replace Worchell and Adamo. However, before the second album could be released Johnny Crash were dropped by their record label, and Stewart suggested moving to Europe. James Wright disagreed and the band split up.

In 1992, bassist Andy Rogers died of a heroin overdose.

In 2007, an interview with Vicki James Wright stated that the then unreleased album, now titled &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, will come out on Suncity Records sometime &quot;soon&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; was released on Suncity Records.

Vicki James Wright has since gone back to his original name, Vick Wright.

<doc id="1026360" wikidata="Q3518489" url="?curid=1026360" title="Jaswant Singh">
<text>Major Jaswant Singh (3 January 193827 September 2020) was an Indian Army officer and Politician who served as Minister of External Affairs and as Minister of Finance in Vajpayee Government and is considered as one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Singh was one of India&#x27;s longest serving parliamentarians, having been a member of both Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha almost continuously between 1980 and 2014. He was NDA&#x27;s Vice-presidential candidate in the 2012 Indian vice-presidential election. Singh was the only leader from Rajasthan who had the distinction of becoming the Minister Of External Affairs, Finance and Defence.

He was elected on a BJP ticket to the Rajya Sabha five times (1980, 1986, 1998, 1999, 2004) and to the Lok Sabha four times (1990, 1991, 1996, 2009). During the Vajpayee administration between 1998 and 2004, he held multiple cabinet portfolios including Finance, External Affairs and Defence. He also served as the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission between 1998 and 1999. In the aftermath of India&#x27;s nuclear tests of 1998, he was deputed by Prime Minister Vajpayee to act as India&#x27;s representative to hold repeated, long-term dialogue with the United States (represented by Strobe Talbott) on matters related to nuclear policy and strategy; the outcome of the sustained engagement was positive for both countries. After his party lost power in 2004, he served as Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha from 2004 to 2009.

Singh incurred the displeasure of his party colleagues when, after the party suffered its second successive defeat in 2009, he circulated a note demanding a thorough discussion on the debacle. Weeks later, a book authored by him was released, in which he was found to have written sympathetically about Jinnah. Post the event, Singh found himself marginalised within the party. In the elections of 2014, his party decided not to field him from any constituency. He decided to contest anyway as an independent from his native constituency of Barmer (against Col. Sonaram Chaudhary) in Rajasthan. He was expelled from the BJP on 29 March 2014 when he did not withdraw his independent candidature, and went on to lose the election.

On 7 August 2014, he suffered a fall in the bathroom of residence and suffered a serious head injury. In June 2020 he was admitted to Army&#x27;s Research and Referral hospital in Delhi for treatment. He remained in a state of coma for six years till his death in 2020.

==Early life==
Singh was born on 3 January 1938 in the village of Jasol in Rajputana Agency of British India (now Balotra district) of Rajasthan, India in a Rajput family. His father was Sardar Singh Rathore of Jasol and mother was Kunwar Baisa. Singh was married to Sheetal Kanwar. They had two sons. His elder son, Manvendra Singh, is a former Member of Parliament from Barmer. He was an officer in the Indian Army in the 1960s and was an alumnus of Mayo College and the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla.

After his education from the National Defence Academy, he was enrolled in the Indian Army in the year 1957 and was designated to the position of the Captain in the Central India Horse unit. And he was also a participant of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and was the commander of his unit. He was a Major at the time of Sino-Indian border dispute of the year 1965 after which he retired from the Indian Army in the next year to join politics after serving in the Armed forces for 10 years. He was a close accompany of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and made his links with Bharatiya Jana Sangh. He was a member and associate of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh from the 1960s.

==Career events==

In the government of Vajpayee, Singh was External Affairs Minister, and later went on to become the Finance Minister. He was also the Defence Minister when George Fernandes was forced to resign after the Tehelka exposure.

Singh is widely regarded for his handling of relations with the United States which were strained after the 1998 Indian nuclear tests but which ameliorated soon after culminating in the 2000 visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to India. His skill as a negotiator and diplomat during talks with the United States has been well acknowledged by his U.S. counterpart Strobe Talbott.

Singh has been frequently criticised by political parties for escorting terrorists to Kandhahar, Afghanistan. They were released by the Government of India in exchange for passengers from the hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC 814.

Singh was denied a Member of Parliament ticket for Barmer by BJP for the 2014 Indian general election over Col. Sonaram Choudhary. Unhappy, Singh filed his nomination as an independent candidate from Barmer constituency. Subsequently, he was expelled from BJP for six years and lost the election.

==Political life==
Singh entered politics in the 1960s, with the first few years of his political life seeing limited recognition, until he was initiated in the Jan Sangh. He tasted success in his political career in 1980 when he was first selected for the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian parliament. He served as Finance minister in the short-lived government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which lasted just from 16 May 1996, to 1 June 1996. After Vajpayee became Prime Minister again two years later, he became Minister for External Affairs of India, serving from 5 December 1998 until 1 July 2002. Responsible for foreign policy, he dealt with high tensions between India and Pakistan. In July 2002 he became Finance Minister again, switching posts with Yashwant Sinha. He served as Finance Minister until the defeat of the Vajpayee government in May 2004 and was instrumental in defining and pushing through the market-friendly reforms of the government. He was conferred the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award for the year 2001. On 19 August 2009, he was expelled from BJP after criticism over his remarks in his book which allegedly praised the founder of Pakistan in his book &quot;&quot;. His last major position was as Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha from 2004 to 2009.

He was denied a ticket by the party to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha Parliamentary Elections from the Barmer-Jaisalmer constituency in Rajasthan. He was subsequently expelled from the BJP after deciding to contest the elections as an independent candidate and lost to his former party&#x27;s candidate Col. Sonaram Choudhary. Jaswant Singh was elected from Darjeeling Seat from the year 2009 to 2014.

==Ministries and Work==
Jaswant Singh held many ministries under the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, including several important such as Defence, External Affairs and Finance. He has also held many important positions including that of Electronics and Science and Technology.

===Minister of Finance (First time)===
Singh remained as the Minister of Finance in the short-lived government of First Vajpayee government from 16 May 1996 to 1 June 1996. In the short-lived government where he was Minister for just 24 days and there was also economic difficulty, a crisis due to the political instability, and there was a loss of employment similar to the 1991 Indian economic crisis which lead to the decline in the value of Indian currency. It was followed by the instability after the fall of Narsimha Rao government. After this there was a 1996 Bank Scam after this the fall of Atal Bihari Government automatically Singh was removed from the position and succeeded to P. Chidambaram for the position.

===Minister of External Affairs===
After Atal Bihari Vajpayee becomes the Prime Minister of India for the second time in the year 1998, then Singh was appointed as the Minister of External Affairs and succeeded Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself for the position. He was at that time first Rajasthani to be a Minister of External Affairs of India at Union level in the Central Government. Singh has been one of the most trusted man of Vajpayee and was given task of making good international relation with other nations. He has been represented nation at international level in the times of Kargil War and India&#x27;s nuclear test. He was one of the Indian crisis management team who went to Kandahar after the IC 814 plane hijack. He remained Minister till 5 December 2002 after the removal of George Fernandes due to the Tehelka conspirancy. As the Minister of External Affairs he launched the first free-trade agreement (with Sri Lanka) in South Asia&#x27;s history, initiated India&#x27;s most daring diplomatic opening to Pakistan, revitalised relations with the US, and reoriented the Indian military, abandoning its Soviet-inspired doctrines and weaponry for close ties with the West.

====Pokhran-II Pressure====

 BJP, came to power in 1998 general elections with an exclusive public mandate. BJP&#x27;s political might had been growing steadily in strength over the past decade over several issues. At that time after the successful test of the Second Nuclear Bomb it was considered a masterstroke by the government, it was said that Singh along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and George Fernandes were the one who played the important role in the functioning. He was one of the members of &quot;Operation Shakti&quot; and among the 12 people who knew about the secret mission. His most essential role came into existence after there were made international pressure on the nation due to the secrecy of the mission when Atal Bihari Vajpayee made a public announcement for the mission. At that time strong criticism was drawn from Canada on India&#x27;s actions and its High Commissioner. Sanctions were also imposed by Japan on India and consisted of freezing all new loans and grants except for humanitarian aid to India. Some other nations also imposed sanctions on India, primarily in the form of suspension of foreign aid to India and government-to-government credit lines. However, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia refrained from condemning India. The biggest affect was on the relations of India with United States and there were made many restrictions on India and at that time Singh managed to control America at United Nations.

====Kargil War====
After the Kargil War and the win of Indian Armed forces in July 1999 the use of WMD led to a serious pressure of the world on India and this was led by the anger of United States against India due to Pokhran-II Nuclear test series and supported in the favour of Pakistan. At that time Singh was the one who represented India at the international level and had made many interviews with news channels and also made diplomatic talks with leaders and representatives of the United States], China, France, and many other nations. After that Singh made an interview with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in which to strengthening the position of Indian Government there was a release of a leaked conversation of Pervez Musharraf in which he admitted that he was involved in the attack on India in Kargil district in 1999 and that he also planned an attack to kill Nawaz Sharif and become the President of Pakistan. This was known to be a masterpiece and led to a very strong point resulting in the India&#x27;s diplomatic relations and proving the burden of war on General Musharraf. After that India was freed from allegations of the Kargil War.

====Kandahar Hijack====
The terrorists of Taliban hijacked the Indian Airlines Flight 814 on 24 December 1999 on the Tribhuvan International Airport of Kathmandu, Nepal. The motive for the hijacking apparently was to secure the release of Islamist figures held in prison in India. The hostage crisis lasted for seven days and ended after India agreed to release three militants – Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, and Mulana Masood Azhar. This hijack was also helped by Dawood Ibrahim and Al-Qaeda linked Jihadis. Then after too much suggestions and pressure then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee agrees on the demand of the hijackers of Taliban and sends Ajit Doval in Kandahar and after that Vajpayee decided to send Singh as he was the one of the most trusted man. He was sent to Kandahar of Afghanistan to escort the terrorists and take back the crew members. It was also said that Singh has made a secret talks with Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil and made an agreement of 3 terrorists in exchange of 170 crew members including men, women and children. Later terrorists also demanded 900 crores rupees and 36 other terrorists, but somehow it was denied. On 31 December 1999 on New Year of 2000 all 176 were released and they all landed to Indira Gandhi International Airport.

The incident is seen as a failure of the BJP government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and IB chief Ajit Doval said that India would have had a stronger negotiating hand if the aircraft had not been allowed to leave Indian territory. Doval, the IB chief, who led the four-member negotiating team to Kandahar, described the whole incident as a &quot;diplomatic failure&quot; of the government in their inability to make the US and UAE use their influence to help secure a quick release of the passengers. Singh also received criticism for praising the Taliban for their co-operation after the hostages had been returned.
===Minister of Defence===
Singh was appointed as the Minister of Defence of India in the year 2000 after minister before him, George Fernandes was convicted in the Tehelka case and was forced to resign from his position. He remained as the Minister from 2000 to 2001 after which Fernandes was re-appointed as the Minister of Defence after getting cleanchit in the conspiracy. After that in the year 2002 he was re-appointed as the Minister of Finance of India in the Vajpayee Government.

===Finance Minister (Second term)===

After returning of George Fernandes as the Defence Minister for the second time after getting cleanchit in Tehelka case, Singh was appointed as the Union Minister of Finance in 2002 and remained till 2004 after the Vajpayee Government lost the 2004 General Election and passed the position to P. Chidambaram. In his reign of 2 years for the second time he has been known to make market-friendly reforms in the Economy of India and due to his good diplomatic skills and good relations with other nations from the times when he was the Minister of External Affairs.

In late 2002 and 2003 the government pushed through economic reforms. Due to the good administration of Jaswant Singh the country&#x27;s GDP growth exceeded 7% every year from 2003 to 2007, following three years of sub-5% growth. Increasing foreign investment, modernisation of public and industrial infrastructure, the creation of jobs, a rising high-tech and IT industry and urban modernisation and expansion improved the nation&#x27;s international image. Good crop harvests and strong industrial expansion also helped the economy. The rate of stock growth under him as the Finance Ministry was also at the one of the highest point in the Indian Economic Growth groth history under the period of two years of his ministry and the Inflation rate was also very much good in the period of the two years. From 2002 to 2004, the economy of India was one of the fastest growing in the world and one of the leading agricultural nations and second most output after China.

==Positions and offices==

===Leader of Rajya Sabha===
Jaswant Singh was appointed as the Member of Parliament of Rajya Sabha for the fourth time in the year 1999 and after the formation of the Vajpayee Government he was appointed as the Leader of Rajya Sabha on 13 October 1999 and remained till the time of fall of the Vajpayee Government on 22 May 2004 and succeeded the position to then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. In the time period Jaswant Singh held many crucial positions and ministries and before that he was previously serving in the position of Minister of External Affairs of India at Union Government and in this period he served as Minister of Defence and Finance.

===Leader of Opposition (Rajya Sabha)===
After the Vajpayee&#x27;s government fell down and after that Singh who was earlier a Member of Parliament from Rajya Sabha from the state of Rajasthan was appointed as the Leader of Opposition of Rajya Sabha and hold the position for a time period of 5 years from 2004 to 2009. The mastermind of Rajasthan, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat when was appointed as the Vice-President of India and at that time Singh took the responsibility of strengthening the party in Central level and main focus in the state of Rajasthan. After the fall of National Democratic Alliance in the year 2004 and the weakening of senior-BJP leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Murli Manohar Joshi, Lal Krishna Advani and the politics of other big leaders like Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in central level, Singh as the leader of Opposition shifted his politics for the strengthening of the party in ground roots and in state levels in states of Western India such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and specially Rajasthan. Under this period Singh also served many non political position in the Indian government remaining as the leader of Opposition including: &quot;Member of Committee for General purposes (from 2005-2006)&quot;, &quot;Member, Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests (from August 2004 to August 2004)&quot; and &quot;Member of Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Installation of Portraits/Statues of National Leaders and Parliamentarians in Parliament House Complex (August 2004May 2009)&quot;. After that then he was expelled from the party.

==Vice-president nominee==

He was the candidate for the post of Vice-president for the NDA in 2012. Singh had filed his nomination papers on 20 July in the presence of National Democratic Alliance coalition leaders.

His candidature was announced by the NDA on 16 July. He meet All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik of Biju Janata Dal on 6 August asking them to support his candidature. He lost to Hamid Ansari who was the UPA&#x27;s Vice-presidential candidate. In the Election he got 238 seats and received 32.69% of the votes, while Hamid Ansari got 490 seats and received 67.31% of the votes.

==Controversy==

* A controversy erupted immediately after the release of his book, &quot;A Call to Honour,&quot; in which Singh insinuated that a mole had existed in the Prime Ministerial Office during the tenure of P. V. Narasimha Rao, who had leaked information to U.S. sources about India&#x27;s nuclear tests. Soon after, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh challenged him to name the mole. In response, Singh sent a letter to him. The letter, Manmohan Singh said later, had no signature, and no name of any mole. Jaswant Singh then backed off, saying his views on the subject were based on a &quot;hunch&quot;.
* Controversy hovered around him again when on 17 August 2009 another book authored by him, entitled &quot;&quot;, was released. In this he praised Mohammad Ali Jinnah and claimed that the centralised policy of Jawaharlal Nehru was responsible for Partition. He was later expelled from the primary membership of BJP as a result of the ensuing controversy. In interviews with media he quoted BJP as narrow-minded and to have limited thought. In 2010, he was readmitted to BJP.

==Death==

In June 2020, Singh was admitted to the Delhi&#x27;s Army Hospital and was being treated for sepsis with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and effects of a severe head injury he suffered as a result of a fall in 2014. On 27 September he suffered cardiac arrest. Singh died at the age of 82 years. His death was triggered as a sign of honour and was mourned with full esteem and with state funeral. His last rites were done by his son Manvendra Singh and was cremated in Jodhpur, Rajasthan with full Hindu rituals. Due to COVID-19 pandemic only family members were present and very few relatives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted on his death stated that &quot;Jaswant Singh Ji served our nation diligently, first as a soldier and later during his long association with politics. During Atal Ji&#x27;s Government, he handled crucial portfolios and left a strong mark in the worlds of Finance, Defence and External affairs. Saddened by his demise&quot;

<text>are hair ornaments used in traditional Japanese hairstyles. The term refers to a wide variety of accessories, including long, rigid hairpins, barrettes, fabric flowers and fabric hair ties. 

In the English-speaking world, the term is typically used to refer to hair ornaments made from layers of folded cloth used to form flowers (), or the technique of folding used to make the flowers.

==History==
 were first used in Japan during the Jōmon period. During that time, the wearing of a single thin rod or stick was considered to hold powers to ward off evil spirits, with people wearing them in their hair for protective purposes. The Jōmon period also saw the introduction of hair combs.

During the Nara period, a variety of Chinese cultural aspects and items were brought to Japan through mutual trade and envoys. The items brought back from China included Chinese hairpins (, ; written with the same Chinese character as ), amongst other hair ornaments such as Chinese combs.

During the Heian period, hairstyles shifted from being worn up to being worn long, and tied back relatively low. During this time period, the term began to be used as a general term for any hair ornament, including combs and hairpins. 

During the Azuchi-Momoyama period, hairstyles changed from the style, to the wider variety of styles worn up – predecessors of modern styles, which made more use of hair ornaments.

 came into wider use during the Edo period, when hairstyles became larger and more complicated, using a larger number of ornaments. Artisans began to produce more finely crafted products, including some hair ornaments that could be used as defensive weapons. During the latter part of the Edo period, the craftsmanship of is considered to have reached a high point, with a number of styles and designs created, many of which persist to the modern day.

===Modern day===
In the present day, traditional Japanese hairstyles are not commonly worn, typically being worn only by geisha, , sumo wrestlers, brides, modern and re-enactors, with both geisha, brides, and , and some apprentice geisha in some regions of Japan, using pre-styled wigs instead of their own hair.

As such, few people wear with traditional hairstyles. However, can be, and still are, worn with everyday hairstyles as simple hair accessories; there are a number of varieties and styles of wearing , with modern varieties worn as hairclips both common and popular. In 1982, were officially designated as a traditional Japanese handcraft in the Tokyo region.

==Craftsmanship==
Professional craftspeople typically undergo a five- to 10-year traditional apprenticeship to learn the trade. Similarly to the combs used to create hairstyles, only a small number of traditionally-trained craftspeople are left practising the trade within Japan; from 2002 to 2010, their estimated number in the country decreased from 15 to five. 

However, the technique of petal-folded fabric has become a popular craft amongst hobbyists, with a number of books, kits and lessons available on the subject, from sources such as the Tsumami Kanzashi Museum in Shinjuku. Some hobbyists have bypassed the traditional apprenticeship system to establish themselves as independent artisans of in Japan.

==Types==
 are fabricated from a wide range of materials, such as lacquered wood, gold and silver plated metal, tortoiseshell, silk, and recently, plastic. Early plastic made out of materials such as bakelite are considered to be highly valued as collectables.

There are a number of basic styles, with the wear of each typically and traditionally following seasonal arrangements; however, in the present day, the use of seasonal is observed only by geisha, their apprentices, , re-enactors and in the costumes for kabuki plays. The use of to finely indicate age and status is a tradition also only held by geisha and . 

For , the size, shape, variety and number of can indicate seniority and the stage of apprenticeship, used in tangent with a number of different hairstyles throughout the apprenticeship. Though geisha also wear seasonal , this is typically confined to a change in the colour of .

===Basic styles===
Despite seasonal and (in the instance of bridalwear) occasional variation, most that are not considered to be fall into one of a number of basic shapes and appearances.

===Other styles===

A number of other styles of also exist, though these are typically only worn for specific, uncommon hairstyles, such as by in certain geisha districts or by characters in some kabuki plays.



 – literally meaning &quot;pinched &quot; – are traditional made of squares of dyed or printed silk, folded into a number of shapes to represent flowers, plants and animals. 

Each square is folded multiple times with the aid of tweezers and glued onto a base using rice glue. A finished piece may contain anything from five to 75 squares of silk or more. pieces are intended to closely represent the plant or animal they depict; depicting flowers are known as (literally meaning &quot;flower &quot;).

 are usually made from a cluster of flowers, and may include -style strips of metal or long streamers of petals dangling from the main piece. are well-known for wearing that are typically larger than average.

Generally, are worn in pairs, one on either side of the head, often with a complementary . The flowers are glued to backings of metal or cardboard that are attached to a wire and are bunched together to make bouquets and other arrangements. Additional detailing of stamens is created by the use of , a strong, thin twine made from paper, often coloured and used for decorative works. 

Geisha, and especially , wear different for each month of the year.

===Seasonal motifs===
 are highly seasonal, though typically the only people in Japan who follow the seasons closely enough to register seasonal changes are geisha and their apprentices. Since wear more elaborate than their senior geisha, seasonal changes are even more important for them.

*January – The design of January usually has an auspicious New Years&#x27; theme. is a popular choice – a combination of pine (), bamboo () and plum blossoms () in green, red and white. Other popular motifs are sparrows (), spinning tops and battledore paddles ().

*May – Trailing purple wisteria () and flag irises (), usually in blue or pink. Irises denote the height of spring while wisteria is a flower often associated with the Imperial Court (wisteria viewing parties have been celebrated by Japanese nobles since the Heian period).
*June – Trailing green willow () leaves with carnations/pinks (), or less commonly hydrangea () flowers. This month is the rainy season in Japan, and therefore willow (a water-loving tree) and blue hydrangeas are appropriate.
*July – featuring a display of fans (usually round fans, but occasionally folding fans) are featured. The fans refer to the Gion Festival which takes place at this time. The motifs featured on a &#x27;s fan vary each year, in line with the festival. There are common themes such as dragonflies and lines denoting swirling water. Other worn during July are fireworks and dewdrops on grass ().

*November – Trailing autumnal leaves that are usually composed of the very popular Japanese maple. Maple viewing is the autumnal equivalent of cherry blossom viewing in Japan. Ginkgo and liquidambar leaves are also seen.
*December – The Japanese make at this time of year, and often decorate trees with them to represent white flowers. It is thought to be good luck to wear featuring , or rice-cake flowers.

<text>Joan Bates ( Collins; 2 September 1929 – 10 March 2016), also self-styled as Princess Joan of Sealand, was the wife of Paddy Roy Bates, a British entrepreneur who founded the self-proclaimed micronation known as the Principality of Sealand.

==Early life==
Bates was born Joan Collins in 2 September 1929 at Aldershot Barracks in England, the daughter of RSM Albert Collins of the Royal Horse Artillery, and his wife, Elizabeth. The family were later stationed at Shoebury Barracks.

As a young woman, Joan was a carnival queen and model who, according to her son Michael, &quot;modelled for all sorts of companies&quot;.

==Marriage==
Joan met British Army major Paddy Roy Bates at the Kursaal dance hall in Southend-on-Sea. At the time he was recuperating from serious burns suffered during World War II. They married three months later in 1949 at the Caxton Hall Registry Office in London. They had two children, Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; and Michael.

==Sealand==
In the 1960s, Roy and Joan launched a pirate radio station and on Joan&#x27;s birthday on 2 September 1967, they declared the Principality of Sealand independent, appointing themselves Prince Roy and Princess Joan, thus making Joan the &quot;self-proclaimed ruler of the world&#x27;s smallest kingdom&quot;.

==Death==
Bates died on 10 March 2016 at a Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, nursing home, following a long illness. Her funeral was held on 17 March, with her coffin draped with the flag of Sealand. She was survived by her two children, four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren.

Bates featured on at least one postage stamp issued by the Principality, as well as coins inscribed &quot;Princess Joan&quot;.

<doc id="1026397" wikidata="Q7307005" url="?curid=1026397" title="Reese Roper">
<text>Michael Reese Roper (born June 30, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter, best known as lead singer for the Denver, Colorado-based Christian ska punk band Five Iron Frenzy, as well as fronting the rock bands Brave Saint Saturn and Roper.

== Personal information==

Reese Roper is known for his quirky and satirical sense of humor, but his work is also marked with a deep interest in history, politics, and self-awareness. He has been the primary lyricist and vocalist, as well as a key musical contributor, in several bands. He is a graduate of East High School. He attended the University of Colorado at Denver throughout his time in FIF and graduated with a degree in Biology/ Pre-Medicine. He is a licensed pastor from the Alliance for Renewal Churches, Mansfield, Ohio, and is also a co-founder of the Scum of the Earth Church in Denver, Colorado.

In 2021, he was a Registered Nurse, living in Staunton, VA. As of 2011, he was a married father.

== Musical career ==
Before his ska and rock projects, Reese Roper was in the short-lived, Colorado-based, industrial metal group Exhumator. Members of that band joined with a larger cast of musicians to form the ska ensemble Five Iron Frenzy, who in 1996 signed with 5 Minute Walk recording studio. During this time Roper became known for his &quot;vocal finesse&quot; and, the ability to write lyrics with both a &quot;tradition of ridiculousness&quot; and a reverence for serious issues. The band was together until November 22, 2003, which is when they played their final show at the sold out Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado. Roper was both the lead vocalist and primary lyricist.

The concept of Brave Saint Saturn (or BS2) began in 1995, but it was only during the final years of Five Iron Frenzy that Reese formalized the band with FIF bandmates Dennis Culp and Keith Hoerig. BS2 is primarily a studio project and has been described by Roper as an outlet for songs that didn&#x27;t fit Five Iron Frenzy&#x27;s musical style. The band and some fans put forth a new term, &quot;astro-rock&quot;, to describe the music of Brave Saint Saturn, which is fundamentally rooted in synthesizer-bathed post-punk and haunting ballads. The band also describes themselves as being the &quot;supersonic-philharmonic&quot;, in reference to their blending of rock music, classical instruments, synthesizers, and beat loops. The third album of the &quot;BS2 trilogy,&quot; &quot;Anti-Meridian&quot;, was released on September 15, 2008. During an interview on October 15, Roper indicated that this may not be the last album from BS2.

After Five Iron Frenzy broke up, he was initially slated to lend his vocals and synthesizer skills to Guerilla Rodeo, which had been engineered by Roper, along with another FIF alum, Sonnie Johnston; Ethan Luck from the OC Supertones; and John Warne and Josh Abbott, both from the band Ace Troubleshooter. However, after recording three songs and releasing a self-titled EP with the band, he decided not to join for organizational reasons. Roper instead, at the behest of his former label, formed another band of his own. He eventually settled on naming the band &quot;Roper&quot; in an attempt to gain favor with the band&#x27;s record label, who encouraged the moniker in an attempt to lessen advertising costs. The band Roper released their first album, &quot;Brace Yourself for the Mediocre&quot; in late 2004, with a team of studio musicians working with Roper to create a high energy blend of post-pop-punk closer in sound to Five Iron Frenzy than Brave Saint Saturn. After putting together a band consisting of Nick White (Divot) on drums, Jonathan Byrnside- lead guitar, Stephen Till(Nathan and Stephen, Black Black Ocean, Hearts of Palm)- Rhythm guitar, and his brother Johnathan Till- on bass; the band toured for two years before going into an indefinite hiatus.

Reese Roper has also published various poetry volumes in small circulation and participated in two poetry tours- one initiated by Skeleton Key Publishing, and an earlier one initiated by Mike Lewis of the band Puller. Copies of his volume &quot;More Than Paper Thin&quot; sold during the tour included a home-burned CD of spoken poetry and cover songs, entitled &quot;Where Dreams May Spark and Flicker&quot;.

Additionally, Roper has been featured in three tracks by Showbread; their 2004 release &quot;No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical&quot; on the songs &quot;Matthias Replaces Judas&quot; and &quot;Stabbing Art to Death&quot;, and their 2008 release &quot;Nervosa&quot; on the song &quot;The Beginning&quot;. He has also worked with the band Trash Oven, mastering their EP.

== Politics ==
Roper is known not only for his faith-based lyrics, but for a social justice approach to Christianity based on his Biblical perspective on Jesus Christ and his apostles. Although his personal blog promotes such notable Evangelical left figures as Jimmy Carter and Tony Campolo as &quot;people I love and support&quot;, Roper has never publicly affirmed a political viewpoint, but has said in a &quot;HM Magazine&quot; editorial that Christians need to abandon blind nationalism and pursue Christ instead. In a 2014 blog post explaining the lyrics behind the Five Iron Frenzy song &quot;Zen and the Art of Xenophobia&quot; from their 2013 album &quot;Engine of a Million Plots&quot;, Roper elaborated on the subject:

Additionally, the historical abuses of the United States of America (particularly against Native Americans) and the Christian Church appear frequently in Roper&#x27;s lyrical work, as well as self-searching for topics of personal depravity. He has also composed many songs that present scathing critiques of unbridled capitalism. The BS2 album &quot;Anti-Meridian&quot; uses a sound clip of Pat Robertson from &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, in which Robertson says that the United States should assassinate Hugo Chavez, to show a counterpoint to what he believes most Christians actually believe, but isn&#x27;t seen in the media, about war and violence.

Regarding Roper&#x27;s stance on LGBTQ+ rights: when Trey Pearson, another Christian musician, came out as gay, his band, Everyday Sunday, was kicked from the lineup of the Christian Music Festival Joshua Fest in 2016, due to nearly three-quarters of the stage crew threatening to drop out should his band be allowed to perform; Pearson did, however, decide to attend the festival as a solo audience member in spite of this. Roper was not happy about the decision made by the organizers of Joshua Fest, nor were the rest of Five Iron Frenzy, and they talked about potentially dropping out in protest. Instead, when they heard that Pearson would be attending as an audience member, they reached out, and asked if he&#x27;d like to join them to sing their final number, &quot;Every New Day.&quot; Pearson eagerly accepted, and despite some uncomfortable stares from a handful of people backstage, he performed the track with Five Iron Frenzy. Regarding the decision by the Joshua Fest stage crew to drop Everyday Sunday, Roper said:

<text>Petroc is a further education (FE) and higher education (HE) college in Devon, England, with a catchment area covering more than . It has the largest A-level sixth form in North Devon. The college serves up to 11,000 students each year, on a wide range of full and part-time courses (from entry level to higher education in partnership with Plymouth University), including distance learning and work-based training.

Petroc was formerly North Devon College and East Devon College. The institutions merged on 1 August 2008. North Devon College was the nominal survivor of the merger, however that name was deemed unsuitable for the merged college due to its expanded catchment area. The merged college was renamed Petroc in 2009. The college is named after St Petroc, a saint with numerous dedications throughout Devon and the patron saint of the Devon flag.

In 2015 the college was graded ‘good’ by Ofsted. In 2017 it was rated as Silver within the Teaching Excellence Framework.

Petroc has three campuses. The North Devon Campus is located in Barnstaple. The Brannams Campus is also located in Barnstaple, in the Roundswell area, and takes its name from Brannam Pottery, the company which formerly occupied the site. The Mid Devon Campus is in Tiverton.

<text>The Opel Monza is an executive fastback coupe produced by the German automaker Opel from 1977 to 1986. It was marketed in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Royale Coupé by Vauxhall.

== Monza A1 (1977–1982) ==

The Monza was planned as a successor for the Commodore Coupé. In the late 1970s the Commodore C model was made as a two-door version (as was the Rekord E1), but still as a sedan type car. The first model of the Commodore the &quot;A&quot; series had a regular coupé in the production line and Opel desired to make a newer version of their large luxury coupé. Work began in 1976 and in 1978 the first Monzas were available to buy. The cars to compete with would be the Mercedes-Benz C123 and later the Mercedes-Benz C124 and the BMW 6 Series (E24) models (coupe models), and any other large luxury coupe. There was plenty of space inside for the class, and the seats were upmarket.

The internals consisted of parts mainly borrowed from the Rekord E1 and later the E2, which meant cloth seats, and much plastic on the dashboard and inner doors. Even the rev counter and the tachometer was taken directly from the Rekord E models. The model experienced some gearbox problems. The engine range for the Monza A1 was the 3.0S, the 2.8S, the newly developed 3.0E and later the 2.5E (the 3.0 had 180 bhp and 248 Nm with fuel injection), gave a wide range. The three-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission from the Commodore range needed to be modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs. Opel&#x27;s own four-speed manual gearboxes were not up to the job and, instead of putting in a more modern five-speed manual gearbox, Opel turned to gearbox and transmission producer Getrag, and installed the Getrag 264 four-speed manual gearbox in the early Monzas. But when people bought a big, luxurious coupé they wanted modern products as well, and Opel obliged, as soon the Getrag 240 (for the 2.5 engines) and the Getrag 265 (for the 3.0E), both 5-speed manual gearboxes, replaced the old 4-speed gearbox.

The Monza, however, sharing the same layout as the Senator A1, had very good driving abilities. It handled well, thanks to the newly developed MacPherson strut system for the front of the car, as used on the Rekord E1 and E2, and the new independent rear suspension gave the car soft, yet firm, driving characteristics and excellent stability for such a big car. The engine range, however non-economical, was also very good, and few problems with the extremely reliable engines. The six-cylinder engines were all overhead camshaft. Many parts on the engine, such as the water pump and drive train were the same parts as used on the four-cylinder version. This meant that this was an engine not only tested for many years in the Commodore, Admiral and Diplomat range, but also very reliable. Although the first generation of 3.0E engines in the Monza A1 had overheating problems when standing still, this could easily be fixed by fitting an oil-cooler.

Opel introduced the &quot;C&quot; package. The &quot;C&quot; cars were fitted with extra instruments (oil pressure, voltmeter etc.) and the interior was either red, dark blue, green, or brown.

The A1 also came with a sports package or &quot;S&quot; package. The cars all were marked as &quot;S&quot; models on the front wings, and came with 15-inch Ronal alloy wheels and a 45% limited slip differential

Four well-sized adults had plenty of space. Even the boot was large, and the rear seats flipped down to make even more space. The A1 was not a great hit at the customers even though it was relatively cheap.

With the 3.0-litre engine, the Monza was at that time the fastest car Opel had ever built. Being capable of speeds as high as 215 km/h, and the 0–100 km/h mark went in just 8.2 seconds.

== Monza A2 (1982–1986) ==
In 1982, the Monza, Rekord and Senator all got a face-lift and were named the A2 (E2 for the Rekord). The A2 looked similar to the A1 overall but with some small changes to the front end. The headlights noticeably increased in size, and the front was more streamlined than the A1. The car was much more slippery, with drag resistance down by around ten percent (from 0.40 to 0.35 formula_1). Also the chrome parts like bumpers etc. were changed to a matt black finish, or with plastic parts. The bumpers were now made of plastic and gave the Monza the look of a sports car in appearance, and actually did look similar to the Opel Manta, despite the ample size difference. The rear lights were the same and the orange front indicators were now clear glass, giving a much more modern look to the car. Overall the update was regarded as successful although retrospectively some of the purity of the lines of the early car were lost.

At a time of rising fuel prices, the need for fuel efficiency was becoming paramount, and Opel decided to change the engine specifications of the Monza. This meant introducing both the inline four-cylinder CIH 2.0E engine from the Rekord E2 (replaced by the torquier 2.2 in October 1984). However, as the Monza weighs almost 1400 kg, given the 115 PS of the two engines, the cars were underpowered and thus unpopular. The 2.5E was given a new Bosch injection system so between 136 and 140 PS was available. The 2.8S was taken out of production. The 3.0E engine stayed the top of the range. The 3.0E was given an upgraded Bosch fuel injection and fuel consumption improved somewhat.

The cars now came with more luxurious interior, electrically controlled side mirrors and even an on-board computer, recording fuel consumption, speed and range.

The launch of the A2 in the UK saw the demise of the Vauxhall Royale Coupe, which had been sold alongside the Monza, resulting in only the Opel model being available on the market. The Royale was disparagingly described by &quot;Autocar&quot; as &quot;an effeminate, frilly, titivated version of the [Monza] with fussy wheels and an unpleasant (often pastel-shaded) velour-smothered interior&quot;. 

=== Monza GSE ===
The last incarnation of the Monza was the GSE edition in mid-1983; basically the A2 car, but a high-specification model which had Recaro sports seats, digital LCD instruments, firmer suspension, the Getrag five-speed manual transmission, an enhanced all-black interior, and a small boot spoiler. Also GSE models are equipped with a 40% limited slip differential, an addition that had to be ordered separately on earlier 3.0E cars when purchasing.

By the time the Senator was updated to the new Senator B and the Monza cancelled, 43,812 Monzas had been built. There was no direct Monza replacement, although the idea of a large Opel/Vauxhall sporting car was carried on in the Lotus Carlton/Lotus Omega saloon. Bitter Cars put a 4.0 engine under the hood as a prototype. Three were built; two left hand drive and one right hand drive, one left hand drive burned out on a motorway in Germany and the other is in a museum, but the right hand drive one is in Somerset, UK.

==Holden Monza==
In Australia, local racing legend Peter Brock had plans to import, modify and market the Opel Monza Coupé as the Holden Monza with the Holden 5 Litre V8 fitted, through his own HDT (Holden Dealer Team) business, but the plans eventually fell through. This was due to the expense of adapting the car to Australian Design Rules. One model was built with modifications, including a 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine.
== Other uses of the Monza name ==
In South Africa, a saloon version of the smaller Opel Kadett E was also sold as the Opel Monza. In Brazil and Venezuela, a version of the Opel Ascona C was sold as the Chevrolet Monza, which featured a three-door fastback body unique to Latin America. There was also an unrelated Chevrolet Monza in the United States.

Since 2019, Chinese buyers have been offered another Chevrolet Monza, this time a four-door sedan.

==2013 Monza Concept==
The Opel Monza Concept is a three-door 2+2 fastback coupé plug-in hybrid concept car with 2 gullwing doors for easy access to the rear seats unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2013. The concept was also shown under the British Vauxhall marque.

The concept shares the same basic plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera called &quot;VOLTEC&quot;, but using a turbocharged 1-liter 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4-liter gasoline Voltec engine. The Monza Concept is the first car to feature cutting-edge LED projection infotainment.

Dr. Karl-Thomas Neumann, the CEO of Opel has been quoted as saying &quot;The Monza Concept is nothing less than our vision of the automotive future&quot;. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model for the next generation of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.

Chief designer Ed Welburn of General Motors said &quot;The gullwing doors will go into production and concept&quot;.

<text>George Selden Thompson (May 14, 1929 – December 5, 1989) was an American author. Known professionally as George Selden, he also wrote under the pseudonym Terry Andrews. He is best known for his 1961 book &quot;The Cricket in Times Square&quot;, which received a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1963 and a Newbery Honor.

==Biography==
He was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Dr. Hartwell Greene Thompson, Sr., an obstetrician at Hartford Hospital, and Sigrid Marie (Johnson). He had an older brother, Hartwell Greene Thompson, Jr. Selden was educated at the Loomis School, and graduated from there in 1947. He attended Yale University, where he joined the Elizabethan Club and the literary magazine, and graduated with a B.A. in 1951. He also attended Columbia University for three summers. After Yale, he studied for a year in Rome on a Fulbright Scholarship from 1951 and 1952

Selden is best known as the author of several books about the character Chester Cricket and his friends, Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat. The first book, &quot;The Cricket in Times Square&quot;, was a Newbery Honor Book in 1961. Selden explained the inspiration for that book as follows:

One night I was coming home on the subway, and I did hear a cricket chirp in the Times Square subway station. The story formed in my mind within minutes. An author is very thankful for minutes like those, although they happen all too infrequently.

In 1974, under the pseudonym of Terry Andrews, Selden wrote the adult novel &quot;The Story of Harold&quot;, the story of a bisexual children&#x27;s book author&#x27;s various affairs, friendships, and mentoring of a lonely child, using the fairy tale of Rumplestilskin as an allegory. The book is very descriptive of the 1970s, including the sexual revolution. Moderately graphic scenes of sadomasochism, orgies and other sexual acts are narrated by Terry, the book&#x27;s protagonist. It could be construed as somewhat autobiographical in the sense the author writes of a character who writes children&#x27;s books. The relationship to the boy and also the author&#x27;s own feelings regarding his own existence are the main keys in this novel.

Selden remained unmarried; a resident of Greenwich Village in New York City, he died there at age 60 from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

<doc id="1026417" wikidata="Q4674687" url="?curid=1026417" title="Acoustic homing">
<text>Acoustic homing is the process in which a system uses the sound or acoustic signals of a target or destination to guide a moving object. There are two types of acoustic homing: passive acoustic homing and active acoustic homing. Objects using passive acoustic homing rely on detecting acoustic emissions produced by the target. Conversely, objects using active acoustic homing make use of sonar to emit a signal and detect its reflection off the target. The signal detected is then processed by the system to determine the proper response for the object. Acoustic homing is useful for applications where other forms of navigation and tracking can be ineffective. It is commonly used in environments where radio or GPS signals can not be detected, such as underwater.

== History ==
The idea of using sound for navigation and homing dates back centuries and has been developed over time, so the concept of acoustic homing can not be attributed to a single individual.

Certain animals have always used sound-based navigation to survive. Bats and dolphins both use echolocation to locate prey. These animals emit sound signals and listen to the echoes for navigation and hunting purposes.

One of the earliest recorded human instances of using sound for underwater navigation was the use of a sounding lead. Sailors would lower a weighted line with a lead weight attached to the end of it. By listening to the sound it made when it hit the seafloor, they were able to estimate the water&#x27;s depth and the nature of the seabed.

In the 18th century, foghorns were developed to aid navigation for ships in low visibility conditions caused by fog. Foghorns produced loud and low frequency sounds that traveled over long distances. The sounds helped boats identify lighthouses and other locations as well as avoid hazards.

In the early 19th century, scientists and inventors such as Charles Babbage and Samuel Morse experimented with underwater signaling systems. These experiments involved using bells and other sound signals to communicate with objects submerged under the water. Through these efforts, the foundation for modern underwater acoustics and sonar technology was laid out.

In the early 20th century, a Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden developed what many believe to be the first practical underwater acoustic communication system. He used sound waves to transmit messages underwater.

In World War II, acoustic homing was used by both the United States Navy and the Germans to develop acoustic torpedoes to counter enemy submarines. Early versions used hydrophones to detect and navigate the torpedo to the noise of the submarine.

In the mid 20th century, sonobuoys were developed for antisubmarine warfare. Sonobuoys were small floating devices dropped by aircraft which detected underwater sounds and transmitted information back to the sender.

==Method==

An object can be equipped with two or more acoustic transducers, which function as speakers and microphones. If a transducer receives a sound louder than that received by the other transducer, the object turns in the transducer&#x27;s direction. If the object is to maneuver in three-dimensional space, more than two transducers are needed. Typically, more than three transducers are used, and arrays of over 100 are not unknown. A large number of transducers allows for more accurate steering.

== Principles ==
Below is a simplified method of the process of acoustic homing:

# Source of sound: An object that emits acoustic signals such as a beacon or transmitter generates sound waves. The sound waves propagate through the surrounding medium, such as air or water.
# Receiver: A device or system is equipped with acoustic receivers such as microphones or hydrophones designed to detect acoustic signals in the environment.
# Detection: The acoustic receivers pick up or &quot;home in&quot; on the source of sound. The sound signals are converted into electrical signals for processing.
# Signal Processing: Signal processing techniques are used to analyze the converted electrical signals. This includes:
## Time delay analysis: used to calculate direction and angle relative to source.
## Signal strength analysis: used to define proximity of source. Stronger signals suggest closer proximity, while weaker signals suggest farther proximity.
## Frequency analysis: used to identify the source.
## Direction analysis: Based on the time delay analysis and other characteristics of the sound signals, the system determines the direction of the source of sound.
# Control mechanism: The device using the acoustic homing system is often equipped with control mechanisms to help it steer towards or away from the source of sound.
# Navigation: The system determines determines the proper response and navigates the device towards or away from the sound source.

== Active vs. Passive Acoustic Homing ==

=== Active Acoustic Homing ===
Definition: Active acoustic homing is a guidance method where the system emits its own acoustic signals and receives return echoes to locate and track a specified target. The system actively transmits sound waves and receives echoes from the target which it then processed.

Sensing method: Active acoustic homing systems use transducers or hydrophones which function as both sound transmitters and receivers. The transducers/hydrophones emit sound waves, and the sensors in the transducers/hydrophones detect the echoes from the target.

Strengths: Active acoustic homing is effective at identifying and tracking targets when the target responds to active acoustic signals. It provides precision in tracking and locating targets.

Limitations: Active acoustic signals can be detected by the target, potentially giving away the position of the homing system. It is also susceptible to countermeasures such as noisemakers and decoys.

Uses: Active acoustic homing is commonly used in anti-submarine warfare, where it is used to locate and engage submarines by pinging them with sound signals.

=== Passive Acoustic Homing ===
Definition: Passive acoustic homing is a guidance method that does not actively emit acoustic signals but rather relies on detecting acoustic emissions of the target. It listens for acoustic sounds that are naturally generated by the target.

Sensing method: Passive acoustic homing systems use hydrophones or microphones to detect and analyze sounds emitted from the target. It may be designed to listen for certain types of sounds to the exclusion of others.

Strengths: Passive acoustic homing does not emit signals of its own and is therefore less detectable by the target. It is effective in tracking acoustic targets that produce sound, even in noisy environments.

Limitations: Passive acoustic homing may have difficulties detecting silent targets or targets using stealth technology to reduce acoustic emissions. It also may have reduced accuracy in challenging conditions.

Uses: Passive acoustic homing is commonly used in underwater surveillance and marine research.

== Applications ==
Acoustic homing can be used in:

Sonar Systems: Acoustic homing is used in many underwater sonar systems such as on submarines, ships, and fish finders. These systems use sound waves to detect underwater objects, as well as measuring the object&#x27;s distance and determining the object&#x27;s relative position.

Guided Missiles: Some guided missiles, such as acoustic torpedoes, use acoustic homing to detect and home in on the sound generated by a specified target, such as an aircraft engine or ship&#x27;s propellers.

Search and Rescue: Acoustic homing is sometimes used in search and rescue operations to locate distress signals. Some examples of these

distress signals include emergency beacons and devices carried by people stranded at sea or in remote areas.

Vehicle Navigation: Many autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs) and underwater drones use acoustic homing to navigate as well as locate underwater features or waypoints. Autonomous surface vehicles(ASVs) can also use acoustic homing to navigate.

Wildlife Tracking: Scientists use acoustic homing to monitor and study wildlife in natural habitats. This is done by attaching acoustic transmitters to animals and then using receivers to monitor it&#x27;s movements and behavior.

Mines Detection: Acoustic homing can be used to detect and avoid buried antitank mines during warfare.

Mines: Some underwater mines also make use of acoustic homing, where the mines would be triggered and detonate after detecting passing ships or submarines.

<text>The , or was a powerful military alliance between the southwestern feudal domains of Satsuma and Chōshū formed in 1866 to combine their efforts to restore Imperial rule and overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan.

==History==
The name &quot;Satchō&quot; () is an abbreviation combining the names of the provinces Satsuma (present day Kagoshima Prefecture) and Chōshū (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture), two of the strongest Imperialist &quot;tozama&quot; domains in Edo-period Japan.

In the 1860s, Satsuma tended to take a moderate position towards maintenance of the status quo, whereas Chōshū had become the center of an uprising aimed at overthrowing the government. Through the mediation of Sakamoto Ryōma of Tosa Domain (present day Kōchi Prefecture), Satsuma military leaders Saigō Takamori and Ōkubo Toshimichi were brought together with Katsura Kogorō of Chōshū Domain. Although the two domains were traditionally fierce enemies, their leaders agreed that the time was right for a change, and agreed in principle to assist one another in the event that either would be attacked by a third party. Also, Chōshū desperately needed modern weapons, but had very limited contacts with the western powers. Satsuma, on the other hand, had developed a substantial arms trade with Great Britain via Thomas Glover, a Scottish merchant affiliated with Jardine Matheson. At the suggestion of Sakamoto, Saigo helped broker an agreement to supply Chōshū with the weapons it needed to fight the Tokugawa shogunate.

Despite this assistance, there was still considerable distrust between the two domains. On March 1, 1866, the Shogunate demanded the retirement and confinement of Chōshū &quot;daimyō&quot; Mōri Takachika and the reduction of domain revenues by 100,000 &quot;koku&quot;. This enraged the Chōshū leadership, and led to a formal, six-point agreement with Satsuma. The scope of the agreement was fairly limited. Satsuma agreed to assist Chōshū in obtaining a pardon from the Imperial Court. If this failed and the Shogunate attacked, Satsuma would send 2000 troops to Kyoto; however, Satsuma would engage the Shogunate in combat only if Kuwana, Aizu or shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu&#x27;s personal guard attempted to block Satsuma&#x27;s access to the Emperor.

The Alliance was crucial in enabling Chōshū to withstand a punitive expedition mounted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the summer of 1866, which led to a stunning defeat for the Tokugawa armies. During the subsequent Boshin War of 1868–1869, the imperial armies which finally overthrew the Shogunate were primarily samurai from the Satchō alliance. With the establishment of the Meiji Restoration, men from these two domains dominated the new Meiji government into the 20th century.

<doc id="1026430" wikidata="Q7409156" url="?curid=1026430" title="Same-sex marriage in New Brunswick">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in New Brunswick since June 23, 2005 in accordance with a ruling from the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of New Brunswick. This decision followed similar cases in eight other provinces and territories, and pre-dated by only one month the federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; of 2005, which legalised same-sex marriage throughout Canada. New Brunswick was the ninth jurisdiction in Canada and the twelfth in the world to recognise same-sex marriage.

==Background==
Following a number of court rulings in other provinces and territories recognizing the right of same-sex couples to marry, Attorney General Brad Green announced in September 2004 that New Brunswick would not follow in the footsteps of Nova Scotia in issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. He argued that the definition was a federal matter and that the province would recognize only marriages between &quot;a man and a woman&quot; until the Government of Canada came up with a new definition, which it eventually did with the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in 2005. In December 2004, Premier Bernard Lord indicated that if and when the federal government passes such legislation, his government would comply with it. He also indicated he would comply with a court ruling, even though he was personally opposed to same-sex marriage, and promised to push for the passage of a provincial law protecting religious groups from being sued if they refuse to marry same-sex couples. The leader of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party, Elizabeth Weir, welcomed the Supreme Court&#x27;s findings in &quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot;.

==Court ruling==
In April 2005, four same-sex couples filed a court challenge, &quot;Harrison v. AG of Canada&quot;, against the government&#x27;s policy of denying marriage licences to same-sex couples. The couples included prominent New Brunswick gay rights advocate Art Vautour-Toole and his husband Wayne Toole (who had married in Ontario), as well as Catherine Sidney and Bridget McGale, who were denied a licence in Saint John, Wayne Harrison and Ross Leavitt, and James Crooks and Carl Trickey. Their lawyer, Allison Menard, agreed to represent the couples in court free of charge. The case named both the provincial and federal attorneys general as defendants, Brad Green and Irwin Cotler. Menard told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;: &quot;Because Parliament is not doing its job, these couples are being forced to make their challenge in court.&quot; A spokesman for Canadians for Equal Marriage confirmed that the couples were &quot;frustrated&quot; with the parliamentary delay in passing the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, &quot;It is clear that this court action is a last resort taken by gay and lesbian couples in New Brunswick who want to join the other nearly 90 percent of Canadians who live in jurisdictions where same-sex couples have the right to marry, They don&#x27;t have that right in New Brunswick, even though they are Canadian citizens, taxpayers and contributing members of their community.&quot;

On June 23 of that year, Judge Judith Clendening of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of New Brunswick in Moncton ruled that the province&#x27;s failure to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples was a violation of their &quot;Charter&quot; rights, in accordance with court rulings in other provinces. She allowed a ten-day grace period to the government to make the necessary administrative adjustments, after which it had to begin issuing marriage licences. This was less than a month before the Parliament of Canada made same-sex marriage legal throughout the country. The new licences became available on July 4. This decision meant that about 90% of the Canadian population were living in provinces and territories where same-sex marriage is legal. The federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; which received royal assent on July 20, 2005, expanded this number to cover the entire country.

==Provincial legislation==
In March 2007, the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick amended the provincial &quot;Family Services Act&quot; () to allow same-sex couples to adopt. The amendments took effect on 1 February 2008. In December 2008, the Assembly made numerous amendments to the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; () and other acts regarding family law, replacing references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with the gender-neutral term &quot;spouses&quot;. The legislation received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Herménégilde Chiasson on 19 December 2008.

New Brunswick legislation recognises cohabitation agreements () which can be entered into by unmarried couples living together. These written agreements, recognized by the provincial &quot;Family Services Act&quot;, outline the rights and responsibilities of common-law partners. The agreement provides partners with several, but not all, of the rights and benefits of marriage. Common-law partners are allowed to make medical decisions for each other in the case one partner is unable to (e.g. accident), enjoy the same tax benefits as married spouses, are required to support one another, and may be entitled to share pension credits if the partners have lived together continuously for two years. However, common-law partners lack some of the rights and benefits afforded to married couples, particularly regarding property and inheritance rights in the event of a breakdown of the relationship or the death of a partner. Goods that were purposely intended and acquired for common use by the couple will generally be divided upon separation, but goods acquired by one partner only will generally not be divided and only the partner that purchased the goods will be entitled to them. This is not the case for married couples as the &quot;Marital Property Act&quot; provides an equal division of marital property to married spouses. A common-law partner is also not recognised as an heir upon the death of the partner and may not inherit the partner&#x27;s property, unless explicitly mentioned in a will. However, the &quot;Provision for Dependants Act&quot; allows a surviving common-law partner to ask a court to order the deceased partner&#x27;s estate to provide support based on a &quot;dependant&quot; status if the deceased partner did not provide for the surviving partner through a will.

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 1,435 same-sex couples living in New Brunswick.

==Religious performance==
Bishop David Edwards of the Diocese of Fredericton voted against a motion to authorise same-sex marriage in the Anglican Church of Canada in July 2019. The motion to permit same-sex marriage was narrowed rejected, and instead the church synod passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. Edwards supported the resolution, later saying that &quot;during the Fall, discussions will take place in dioceses across the country, including ours, as to how to respond to the outcome of General Synod&quot;.

The Unitarian Fellowship of Fredericton, a congregation of the Canadian Unitarian Council, has been performing same-sex marriage ceremonies since the 1960s. Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. In 1996, Jim Crooks and Carl Trickey were married at the Centenary Queen Square United Church in Saint John, marking the first same-sex wedding in a United church in the Maritime provinces. The church was later vandalized by opponents of same-sex marriage.

==Public opinion==
A 2017 CROP poll showed that 78% of respondents in Atlantic Canada supported same-sex marriage, but did not give a figure for each Atlantic province individually. Nationwide, 74% of Canadians were of the same view, while 26% disagreed.

<text>Jason Jamar Allen (born July 5, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Miami Dolphins 16th overall of the 2006 NFL draft. He played college football at Tennessee. Allen also played for the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals.

==Early life==
Allen earned various honors while playing football at Muscle Shoals High School in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was named an All-American from SuperPrep, PrepStar and Borderwars.com. He was twice a 5A All-State running back and was once selected as the Alabama Gatorade Player of the Year. As a senior, he ran for 1,740 yards and 21 touchdowns while adding 378 yards and three scores receiving. His performance earned him the honor of being the No. 1 player in Alabama by Birmingham News and Mobile Register.

Allen also lettered in track and basketball at Muscle Shoals. He graduated early in January 2001.

==College career==
Allen was a four-year letterman and three-year starter for the Tennessee Volunteers. He appeared in 43 games with 26 starting, including 12 starts at safety and 14 at cornerback.

===2002===
By graduating in January, Allen was able to attend spring practices at the University of Tennessee. He went on to play in 13 games as a true freshman in 2002, finishing with five tackles.

===2003===
As a starting cornerback in 2003, Allen started 8 of the 13 games in which he appeared, amassing 57 tackles (43 solo), a forced fumble, 2 interceptions, 11 passes defensed, and a blocked kick. His first career interception sealed the win against Marshall. His breakout came against the University of Alabama, in which he had 12 tackles, a blocked field goal and 2 pass breakups; including the game-sealing one on fourth-and-two in the fifth overtime.

===2004===
Allen started the first game of the season at cornerback before moving to safety for the final 12 contests. He finished with 123 tackles, which led the SEC while also becoming the first non-linebacker to lead the team in tackles since individual records began being recorded in 1970. His 88 solo stops were third in the nation (among Division I-A schools). Along with his tackles, he totaled 2 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, 2 interceptions and 7 passes defensed during the year.

For his performance during the season, Allen was a third-team Associated Press All-America selection, second-team All-SEC Coaches and Associated Press selection, and a Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist. He also earned Walter Camp Division I-A Defensive Player of the Week honors on October 23.

===2005===
Allen suffered a season-ending dislocated hip in the fifth game of the season in 2005 while tackling University of Georgia tight end Leonard Pope. Prior to the injury, he recorded 35 tackles (28 solo) with a 10-yard sack, 3 stops for losses, a forced fumble, and deflected 2 passes.

==Professional career==
===Miami Dolphins===
Allen was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the first round with the 16th overall pick in the 2006 NFL draft.

<doc id="1026446" wikidata="Q138882" url="?curid=1026446" title="Patricia Grace">
<text>Patricia Frances Grace (; born 17 August 1937) is a New Zealand writer of novels, short stories, and children&#x27;s books. She began writing as a young adult, while working as a teacher. Her early short stories were published in magazines, leading to her becoming the first female Māori writer to publish a collection of short stories, &quot;Waiariki&quot;, in 1975. Her first novel, &quot;Mutuwhenua: The Moon Sleeps&quot;, followed in 1978.

Since becoming a full-time writer in the 1980s, Grace has written seven novels, seven short-story collections, a non-fiction biography and an autobiography. Her works explore Māori life and culture, including the impact of Pākehā (New Zealand European) and other cultures on Māori, with use of the Māori language throughout. Her most well-known novel, &quot;Potiki&quot; (1986) features a Māori community opposing the private development of their ancestral land. She has also written a number of children&#x27;s books, seeking to write books in which Māori children can see their own lives.

Grace is a pioneering and influential figure in New Zealand literature, and over her career has won a number of awards, including the Kiriyama Prize, the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, two honorary doctorates of literature, a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement, and an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand for extraordinary lifetime achievement. Her books have twice won the top award for fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards. She was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DCNZM) in 2007, for services to literature.

==Early life and career==
Patricia Grace is of Ngāti Toa, Ngāti Raukawa and Te Āti Awa descent. She was born on 17 August 1937 in Wellington, New Zealand. Her father was Māori and her mother was European and Irish Catholic. On her father&#x27;s side she is descended from politician Wi Parata. She grew up in the suburb of Melrose, where her father had built the family home, and also spent time with her father&#x27;s family at Hongoeka, on their ancestral land. In 1944, when she was seven, her father enlisted in the Māori Battalion to fight in the Second World War.

She attended St Anne&#x27;s School in Wellington, where she later described experiencing racism: &quot;I found that being different meant that I could be blamed – for a toy gun being stolen, for writing being chalked on a garage wall, for neighbourhood children swearing, for a grassy hillside being set alight&quot;. Grace has said that as a child she did not learn to speak Māori, because it was only spoken at formal events such as tangi (traditional Māori funeral ceremonies). She began to make efforts to learn as an adult, but found it difficult. She subsequently attended St Mary&#x27;s College, where she excelled at basketball, and subsequently Wellington Teachers&#x27; Training College. It was not until she had left high school that she began to read works by New Zealand authors; she said that until this time, &quot;I didn&#x27;t kind of know that a writer was something one could aspire to be and that was partly because I&#x27;d never read writing by New Zealand writers&quot;. She began writing at age 25, while working full-time as a teacher in North Auckland.

Her first published short story was &quot;The Dream&quot;, in bilingual magazine &quot;Te Ao Hou / The New World&quot; in 1966. In 1979, South Pacific Television produced a television version of this story for the show &quot;Pacific Viewpoint&quot;. She also had early stories published in the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot;. These early works led to a publisher approaching Grace to ask her to work on a collection of short stories. In 1974 she received the first Māori Purposes Fund Board grant for Māori writers.

==Literary career==

===1975–1990===
Grace&#x27;s first published book, &quot;Waiariki&quot; (1975), was the first collection of short stories to be published by a female Māori writer, and its ten stories show the diversity of Māori life and culture. Writer Rachel Nunns said these early stories &quot;inform readers at an emotional, imaginative level with the sense of what it means to be a Maori&quot;. Grace&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Mutuwhenua: The Moon Sleeps&quot; (1978), was about the relationship of a Māori woman and Pākehā man and their experiences coming from different cultures. It was inspired by the experiences of Grace&#x27;s parents, and marked the first time a relationship of this kind had been described by a Māori writer. It was followed by her second collection of short stories &quot;The Dream Sleepers and Other Stories&quot; (1980). This collection featured a three-page story told by a mother speaking to her new baby, called &quot;Between Earth and Sky&quot;, which is one of the best-known and most anthologised New Zealand short stories. These early works were critically acclaimed. In 1984 she collaborated with painter Robyn Kahukiwa to produce &quot;Wahine Toa&quot;, a book about women from Māori legends. Although she continued working as a full-time teacher until 1985, her income in this period was supplemented by grants from the New Zealand Literary Fund in 1975 and 1983.

In the early 1980s, Grace began writing for children, and sought to write books in which Māori children could see their own lives. &quot;The Kuia and the Spider / Te Kuia me te Pungawerewere&quot; (1981), illustrated by Kahukiwa, told the story of a spinning contest between a kuia (elderly Māori woman) and a spider, and was published by a group of women from the Spiral Collective in both English and Māori. Grace subsequently published &quot;Watercress Tuna and the Children of Champion Street / Te Tuna Watakirihi me Nga Tamariki o te Tiriti o Toa&quot; (1984), also illustrated by Kahukiwa (and published in English, Māori and Samoan) and several Māori language readers. &quot;The Trolley&quot; (1993), illustrated by Kerry Gemmill, told the story of a single mother making a trolley for her children for Christmas.

In 1985, Grace received a writing fellowship at Victoria University of Wellington, which enabled her to give up teaching, become a full-time writer, and complete the novel &quot;Potiki&quot; (1986), which became her most successful novel. The plot of the novel featured a Māori community opposing the private development of their ancestral land, and the attempts of the developer to buy them out. The name &quot;potiki&quot; can mean &quot;youngest child&quot; or &quot;last-born&quot; in Māori, and refers to the central character of Toko, a child who foresees and is impacted by the conflict over the land. Grace intentionally did not include a glossary for Māori language terms in the book or italicise these terms, on the basis that she &quot;didn&#x27;t want the Māori language to be treated as a foreign language in its own country&quot;. The novel was viewed by some critics as political; John Beston, writing for &quot;Landfall&quot;, suggested that &quot;having sought previously to soothe her Pakeha readers and to suppress her anger, [Grace] is now ready to charge them, not with past and irremediable injustices, but with continuing injustices&quot;. Grace said that she was endeavouring to write about &quot;ordinary lives of ordinary people&quot; and did not expect it to be seen as political. The novel has been translated into seven languages, and in 2020 was republished in Britain by the Penguin Classics imprint.

Grace was also active in the promotion of Māori arts during the 1980s. In 1983 she was a founding member of Haeata, a Māori women artists&#x27; collective, through which she guided young Māori women artists and participated in group exhibitions such as &quot;Karanga Karanga&quot; (1986), which was the first exhibition of collaborative work by Māori women artists in a public museum. In the late 1980s, she was a founding member of Te Hā, a collective of Māori writers. Her third short story collection, &quot;Electric City and Other Stories&quot; was published in 1987.

===1990–2015===

Grace&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Cousins&quot;, was published in 1992. It is the story of three cousins across different parts of their lives. Like Māori culture as a whole it is concerned with whakapapa (family history) and family ties, rather than the success of the individual, and it reflects troubling parts of New Zealand&#x27;s history such as the removal of Māori children from their families by the state. Academic Roger Robinson said that while the book sometimes seems like a polemic, &quot;Grace&#x27;s descriptive and impressionistic skills, her insight into the consciousness of women and children, and the sustained inwardness of the Māori perspective, make &quot;Cousins&quot; a significant and uniquely Māori version of the genre of family saga&quot;. Grace has used &quot;Cousins&quot; as an example of her approach to writing, which is to develop characters before developing plot: &quot;I had an idea in mind that I was going to base the novel around two cousins, two women who shared the same ancestry, and during the course of the story the third cousin became important to the plot.&quot;

Her fourth novel, &quot;Baby No-Eyes&quot;, was published in 1998, having taken her five years to write. The book is narrated by an unborn child who was killed together with her father in a car accident, along with other members of her family, and weaves together family drama with contemporary Māori problems. Pauline Swain, reviewing the book for &quot;The Dominion&quot;, praised Grace&#x27;s &quot;deceptively light touch with material that in other hands could be bombastic or preachy&quot;, and noted &quot;her portrayal of contemporary issues such as land claims and the right to use genetic information for research loses nothing in impact for all its delicately oblique handling&quot;. Nelson Wattie, writing in the &quot;New Zealand Review of Books&quot;, called it &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot; and lacking in coherence, but acknowledged that &quot;the doubts expressed here run counter to the warmth with which this book, like others of its author, has been greeted elsewhere&quot;. It was soon followed by her fifth novel &quot;Dogside Story&quot; (2001) centred on a small seaside Māori community. Reviewer Simone Drichel observed that although the book shared some similarities in setting and characters with &quot;Potiki&quot;, the &quot;nature of the challenges&quot; faced by Maori had changed in the intervening years: &quot;For the first time ... it is not primarily the interaction with Pakeha that poses a challenge for Maori, but Maoridom itself.&quot;

By this time, Grace had become an established and well-known writer. Elspeth Sandys observed in 2001 that the release of a new novel by Grace was &quot;one of the more significant events in [New Zealand&#x27;s] literary calendar&quot;. Her sixth novel, &quot;Tu&quot; (2004), was based on the experiences of the Māori Battalion in Italy during the Second World War, and in particular the experiences of Grace&#x27;s father and other family members who were part of the Battalion. She described the experience of writing a book about &quot;men and especially men at war&quot; as a &quot;wonderful challenge&quot;. Reviewer Iain Sharp praised Grace&#x27;s compassionate treatment of the subject, concluding: &quot;The crowning achievement of this fine writer&#x27;s career, &quot;Tu&quot; will surely become one of the classics of our literature&quot;. In 2013 it was adapted for the theatre by New Zealand playwright Hone Kouka.

&quot;Small Holes in the Silence&quot;, published in 2006, was Grace&#x27;s first collection of short stories since 1987. Lawrence Jones in the &quot;New Zealand Review of Books&quot; praised the variety of stories but felt it did not meet the &quot;sheer sustained emotional engagement of the earlier collections&quot;, and James O&#x27;Sullivan for the &quot;Taranaki Daily News&quot; equally found the stories &quot;less than memorable&quot;. Both reviewers felt that the short story &quot;Eben&quot;, about a mentally disabled homeless man, was the strongest story in the collection. In 2008 she published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Maraea and the Albatrosses / Ko Maraea Me Nga Toroa&quot;, illustrated by her brother Brian Gunson. Grace was approached around this time by the family of Ned Nathan, a Māori Battalion soldier who was wounded in Crete, and his wife Katina, a Cretan woman who nursed him back to health, and asked to write the story of their relationship. The resulting non-fiction biography, &quot;Ned &amp; Katina: a true love story&quot;, was published in 2009. At this time Grace put aside her draft novel (later to be published as &quot;Chappy&quot; in 2015) in order to concentrate on family responsibilities, including caring for her mother and husband.

===2015–present===
Grace&#x27;s seventh novel &quot;Chappy&quot; was published in 2015, and topped New Zealand&#x27;s bestseller list. It was her first novel in over ten years, and was dedicated to her husband who had died in 2013. It is a family saga about a relationship between a Japanese man and a Māori woman, and is structured with multiple narrators and events related in a non-linear way. Simone Oettli, in her review for &quot;Landfall&quot;, noted that the themes of the book include &quot;acceptance of cultural differences ... disappearance and loss, love and belonging, as well as the craft of storytelling&quot;. Lawrence Jones called it &quot;well worth the decade-long wait&quot;. In the same year she published children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Haka&quot;, which told the story of the &quot;Ka Mate&quot; haka. It was illustrated by Andrew Burdan and translated into Māori as &quot;Whiti Te Rā!&quot; by Kawata Teepa.

Grace continues to be recognised for her &quot;pioneering role&quot; in New Zealand literature. In a review of &quot;Chappy&quot;, Paula Morris described Grace as &quot;a quiet and persistent presence in New Zealand literature, a groundbreaker who is, at the same time, old-fashioned in the calmness of her tone, the particularity of her focus, and her abiding interest in the particularities of Māori customs and stories&quot;. In July 2016 a sculpture in her honour was unveiled on the Porirua Writers&#x27; Walk, featuring a quote from &quot;Potiki&quot; (Grace also features on the Wellington Writers Walk, established in 2002). In 2017 her children&#x27;s book &quot;Watercress Tuna and the Children of Champion Street&quot; was adapted for the stage by Tupe Lualua and performed by 70 students from Cannon&#x27;s Creek School at the Measina Festival, a showcase of Pasifika art and theatre. In 2018, a bilingual edition of &quot;Wāhine Toa&quot;, translated by Hēni Jacob, was published by Te Tākupu (the publishing house of Te Wānanga o Raukawa).

Her autobiography &quot;From the Centre: a writer&#x27;s life&quot; was published by Penguin Books in May 2021. Reviewer Emma Espiner said of the book that it &quot;relays a lifetime of doing things her own way&quot;; &quot;The picture that emerges is of a quietly determined, subversive and nuanced thinker&quot;. In the same year, her novel &quot;Cousins&quot; (1992) was adapted into the feature film of the same name, directed by Ainsley Gardiner and Briar Grace-Smith. Grace-Smith was previously married to Grace&#x27;s son, and had attended the launch of the novel 19 years earlier at Takapūwāhia Marae. In 2021, Grace was the chief judge for the Sargeson Prize (named after Frank Sargeson), New Zealand&#x27;s most valuable short-story prize.

In 2024, a new collection of short stories by Grace was published, titled &quot;Bird Child and Other Stories&quot;. Her granddaughter Miriama Grace-Smith designed the cover artwork. It is her first new short story collection in seventeen years. When readers of &quot;Newsroom&quot; were asked to share their thoughts on Grace to enter a draw for a free copy of the book, Steve Braunias noted that he had previously seen &quot;enthusiastic comments about authors but nothing resembling the depth of feeling – let&#x27;s call it what it is: awe – towards Grace&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Grace has won awards for her writing since the outset of her career, with her first book, &quot;Waiariki&quot; (1975), receiving the Hubert Church Memorial Award for Best First Book of Fiction, awarded by PEN NZ. &quot;Potiki&quot; (1986) came third in the Wattie Book of the Year Awards in 1986, and won the New Zealand Book Award for Fiction in 1987. In 1994 it received the award in Germany. Her children&#x27;s book &quot;The Kuia and the Spider / Te Kuia me te Pungawerewere&quot; (1981) won the Children&#x27;s Picture Book of the Year Award at the New Zealand Government Publishing Awards, and &quot;The Trolley&quot; received the Russell Clark Award for children&#x27;s book illustration in 1994. &quot;Baby No-Eyes&quot; (1988) was shortlisted for the Tasmania Pacific Region Prize. In the 1988 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Grace was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order (QSO) for community service. She also received Scholarships in Letters in 1988 and 1992–1993. In 1989, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (LitD) by Victoria University of Wellington.

&quot;Dogside Story&quot; (2001) won the 2001 Kiriyama Prize for Fiction, was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2001 and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2003, and was shortlisted in the Montana New Zealand Book Awards in 2002 and for the Tasmania Pacific Region Prize in 2004. &quot;Tu&quot; (2004) was awarded the Deutz Medal for Fiction and the Montana Award for Fiction at the 2005 Montana New Zealand Book Awards, and the 2005 Nielsen Book Data New Zealand Booksellers&#x27; Choice Award. &quot;Chappy&quot; (2015) was a finalist in the fiction category at the 2016 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. In the same year, her children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Haka&quot;, translated into Māori as &quot;Whiti te Rā!&quot; by Kawata Teepa, was the recipient of the Te Kura Pounamu Award for the best Māori language work at the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults.

In 2005 Grace received an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, an award bestowed on twenty of New Zealand&#x27;s most significant living artists for extraordinary lifetime achievement. In 2006, she was one of three honourees awarded a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement, recognising her significant contribution to New Zealand&#x27;s literature. Helen Clark, then the prime minister of New Zealand, said her work &quot;played a key role in the emergence of Maori fiction in English&quot;.

Grace was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DCNZM), for services to literature, in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 2009, she declined redesignation as a Dame Companion following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government. At the time, she expressed the opinion that the restoration of titles was a retrograde step and that she &quot;thought that we were getting away from the colonial past&quot;.

In 2008, Grace was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Joy Harjo, who nominated Grace for the Neustadt Prize, has said of her writing:

Grace received an honorary Doctorate of Letters (DLit) from the World Indigenous Nations University in 2016, conferred at Te Wānanga o Raukawa, Ōtaki, for her literary accomplishments and her writing around Māori themes. In the same year, she was awarded the Te Tohu Aroha mō Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu (Exemplary/Supreme Award) at the Te Waka Toi Awards, which she described as a &quot;great honour&quot;.

==Personal life==
Grace was married to children&#x27;s author Kerehi Waiariki Grace, having met him at teachers&#x27; college. They had seven children together, and he died in 2013. Grace has described their marriage as one of shared contributions: &quot;My husband and I worked together on everything that needed to be done. It wasn&#x27;t as though I had to do the housework and look after the children, because we shared all this.&quot; Her novel &quot;Chappy&quot; (2015) was dedicated to him. Their daughter Kohai is an acclaimed weaver, and their sons Wiremu and Himonia are filmmakers.

Grace does voluntary work, such as managing iwi work schemes for unemployed people. In 2014, she won a legal battle against the New Zealand Government, which had tried to compulsorily acquire land at Hongoeka Bay under the Public Works Act in order to build an expressway. The court decided that the land, which was the last remaining part of Wi Parata&#x27;s landholdings held by his descendants, should be protected as a Māori reservation. , Grace was still living in Hongoeka, on her ancestral land and close to her home marae (meeting place).

<doc id="1026452" wikidata="Q1219171" url="?curid=1026452" title="Fantastic Voyage">
<text>Fantastic Voyage is a 1966 American science fiction adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer and written by Harry Kleiner, based on a story by Otto Klement and Jerome Bixby. The film is about a submarine crew who is shrunk to microscopic size and venture into the body of an injured scientist to repair damage to his brain. In adapting the story for his script, Kleiner abandoned all but the concept of miniaturization and added a Cold War element. The film starred Stephen Boyd, Raquel Welch, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Donald Pleasence, and Arthur Kennedy.

Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it.
Because the novelization was released six months before the movie, many people mistakenly believed that the film was based on Asimov&#x27;s book. Its modern and imaginative production design received five nominations at the 39th Academy Awards mostly in technical departments, winning for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction in Color.

The movie used the concept of miniaturization in science fiction along with &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; and inspired an animated television series of the same name.

==Plot==
The United States and the Soviet Union have both developed technology that can miniaturize matter by shrinking individual atoms, but only for one hour. A scientist, Dr. Jan Benes, working behind the Iron Curtain, has figured out how to make the process work indefinitely. With the help of American intelligence agents, including agent Charles Grant, he escapes to the Western world and arrives in New York City, but an attempted assassination leaves him comatose with a blood clot in his brain that no surgery can remove from the outside.

To save his life, Grant, United States Navy pilot Captain Bill Owens, medical chief and circulatory specialist Dr. Michaels, surgeon Dr. Peter Duval, and his assistant Cora Peterson are placed aboard a Navy ichthyology submarine at the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces (CMDF) facilities. The submarine, named &quot;Proteus&quot;, is then miniaturized to &quot;about the size of a microbe&quot;, and injected into Benes&#x27; body. The team has 60 minutes to get to the clot, remove it, and exit Benes&#x27; body; if they do not get out in time, &quot;Proteus&quot; and its crew will begin reverting to their normal size and kill Benes.

The crew faces many obstacles during the mission. An undetected arteriovenous fistula forces them to detour through the heart, where cardiac arrest must be induced to, at best, reduce turbulence that would be strong enough to destroy &quot;Proteus&quot;. The crew faces an unexplained loss of oxygen and must replenish their supply in the lungs. They notice &quot;rocks&quot; that are actually carbon particles from smoke. Grant finds the surgical laser needed to destroy the clot was damaged from the turbulence in the heart, as it was not fastened down as it had been before: this and his safety line snapping loose while the crew was refilling their air supply lead Grant to suspect a saboteur is on the mission. The crew must cannibalize their wireless radio to repair the laser, cutting off all communication and guidance from the outside, although because the submarine is nuclear-powered, surgeons and technicians outside Benes&#x27;s body are still able to track their movements via a radioactive tracer, allowing General Alan Carter and Colonel Donald Reid, the officers in charge of CMDF, to figure out the crew&#x27;s strategies as they make their way through the body.

The sub enters the lymphatic system, but the reticular fibres start to interfere. The crew is then forced to pass through the inner ear, requiring all outside personnel to make no noise to prevent destructive shocks, but while the crew is removing reticular fibers clogging the submarine&#x27;s vents and making the engines overheat, a fallen surgical tool causes the crew to be thrown about and Peterson is nearly killed by antibodies, but they are able to reboard the submarine in time. By the time they finally reach the clot, the crew has only six minutes remaining to operate and then exit the body.

Before the mission, Grant had been briefed that Duval was the prime suspect as a potential surgical assassin, but as the mission progresses, he instead begins to suspect Michaels. During the surgery, Michaels knocks out Owens and takes control of &quot;Proteus&quot; while the rest of the crew is outside for the operation. As Duval finishes removing the clot with the laser, Michaels tries to crash the submarine into the same area of Benes&#x27; brain to kill him. Grant fires the laser at the ship, causing it to veer away and crash, and Michaels to get trapped in the wreckage with the controls pinning him to the seat, which attracts the attention of white blood cells. While Grant saves Owens from the &quot;Proteus&quot;, Michaels is killed when a white blood cell consumes the ship. The remaining crew quickly swim to one of Benes&#x27; eyes and escape through a tear duct seconds before returning to normal size.

==Production==
The film was the original idea of Otto Klement and Jerome Bixby. They sold it to Fox, which announced the film would be &quot;the most expensive science-fiction film ever made.&quot; Richard Fleischer was assigned to direct and Saul David to produce; both men had worked at the studio before. Fleischer had originally studied medicine and human anatomy in college before choosing to be a movie director. Harry Kleiner was brought in to work on the script.

The budget was set at $5 million. The budget went up to $6 million, $3 million of which went on the sets and $1 million on test footage.

The Proteus submarine was constructed as a full-size set piece 42 feet long, first seen in the &quot;miniaturizer&quot; room and later in scenes set outside the lung and inside the inner ear, when the cast was to be seen &quot;swimming&quot; (actually suspended by wires) outside the submarine. The full-size Proteus mockup contained all the interior sets that the actors are seen in to represent the interior of the submarine, with sections that could be pulled out to allow for cameras and crew to film the interior. The submarine was also constructed in miniature, including a large miniature around five feet in length that could be flown on wires in the abstract sets representing the inside of the human body. The heart and brain sets built to accommodate the five-foot miniature filled a soundstage on the Fox lot—these were filmed &quot;dry for wet,&quot; with floating, blob-shaped elements meant to be blood cells filmed separately and composited over the footage. A smaller, 18-inch miniature of the Proteus was constructed to operate in liquid for a shot of the submarine bursting through an arterial wall early in the movie. A tiny Proteus miniature just a few inches in length was made for the miniaturization sequence to show the ship being picked up by a &quot;precision handling device&quot; and dropped into a large glass cylinder which was then miniaturized to become part of a syringe that would inject the Proteus into the brain-injured scientist.

The film starred Stephen Boyd, making his first Hollywood movie in five years. It was the first role at Fox for Raquel Welch, who was put under contract to the studio after being spotted in a beauty contest by Saul David&#x27;s wife.

For the technical and artistic elaboration of the subject, Fleischer asked for the collaboration of two people of the crew that he had worked with on the production of &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, the film he directed for Walt Disney in 1954. The designer of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; from the Jules Verne adaptation, Harper Goff, also designed the &quot;Proteus;&quot; the same technical advisor, Fred Zendar, collaborated on both productions.

At one point in the movie&#x27;s preproduction it was positioned as one of the Derek Flint spy spoof movies starring James Coburn, which were produced by 20th Century Fox and Saul David. Several script pages sampled in the bonus features of the 2012 DVD release of Fantastic Voyage show Stephen Boyd&#x27;s Grant character (who, like Flint, is a secret agent) being identified as Flint, and some of Flint&#x27;s wisecracks about not wanting to be miniaturized survive to be uttered by Boyd&#x27;s Grant in Fantastic Voyage. Years later comic actor Mike Myers proposed making an installment of his own Austin Powers spy spoof movies called Shagtastic Voyage, in which Powers would be injected into the body of Dr. Evil.

The military headquarters is and the &quot;Proteus&quot; . The artery, in resin and fiberglass, is long and wide; the heart is and the brain is . The plasma effect was produced by chief operator Ernest Laszlo via the use of multicolored turning lights, placed on the outside of translucent decors.

&quot;There are no precedents so we must proceed by trial and error&quot;, said David.

Frederick Schodt&#x27;s book &quot;The Astro Boy Essays: Osamu Tezuka, Mighty Atom, and the Manga/Anime Revolution&quot; claims that Fox had wanted to use ideas from an episode of Japanese animator Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; in the film, but it never credited him.

Isaac Asimov, asked to write the novelization from the script, declared that the script was full of plot holes, and received permission to write the book the way he wanted. The novel came out first because he wrote quickly and because of delays in filming.

===Music===
The score was composed and conducted by Leonard Rosenman. The composer deliberately wrote no music for the first four reels of the film, before the protagonists enter the human body. Rosenman wrote that &quot;the harmony for the entire score is almost completely atonal except for the very end when our heroes grow to normality&quot;.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews and a few criticisms. The weekly entertainment-trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive pre-release review, stating, &quot;The lavish production, boasting some brilliant special effects and superior creative efforts, is an entertaining, enlightening excursion through inner space—the body of a man.&quot; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Yessir, for straight science-fiction, this is quite a film—the most colorful and imaginative since &quot;Destination Moon&quot;&quot; (1950). Richard Schickel of &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote that the rewards would be &quot;plentiful&quot; to audiences who get over the &quot;real whopper&quot; of suspended disbelief required. He found that though the excellent special effects and sets could distract from the scenery&#x27;s scientific purpose in the story, the &quot;old familiar music of science fiction&quot; in lush new arrangements was a &quot;true delight&quot;, and the seriousness with which screenwriter Kleiner and director Fleischer treated the story made it more believable and fun. Schickel made note of, but dismissed, other critics&#x27; allegations of &quot;camp.&quot;

, the film holds a 92% approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;The special effects may be a bit dated today, but &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; still holds up well as an imaginative journey into the human body.&quot;

===Box office===
According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $9,400,000 in rentals to break even and made $8,880,000, meaning it initially showed a slight loss, but television sales moved it into the black, and subsequent home video sales were almost entirely profit.

===Awards and honors===
The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three more:
* Academy Awards (1966)
:Won: Best Art Direction – Color (Jack Martin Smith, Dale Hennesy, Walter M. Scott, Stuart A. Reiss)
:Won: Best Special Effects (Art Cruickshank)
:Nominated: Best Cinematography (Ernest Laszlo)
:Nominated: Best Film Editing (William B. Murphy)
:Nominated: Best Sound Editing (Walter Rossi)

==Adaptations==
===Novelization===
After acquiring the film&#x27;s paperback novelization rights, Bantam Books approached Isaac Asimov to write the novelization, offering him a flat sum of $5,000 with no royalties involved. In his autobiography &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot;, Asimov writes, &quot;I turned down the proposal out of hand. Hackwork, I said. Beneath my dignity.&quot; However, Bantam Books persisted, and at a meeting with Bantam editorial director Marc Jaffe and 20th Century Fox executive Marcia Nassiter on April 21, 1965, Asimov agreed to read the screenplay.

In the novelization&#x27;s introduction, Asimov states that he was reluctant to write the book because he believed that the miniaturization of matter was physically impossible, but he decided that it was still good fodder for story-telling and that it could still make for some intelligent reading. In addition, 20th Century Fox was known to want someone with some science-fiction clout to help promote the film. Aside from the initial &quot;impossibility&quot; of the shrinking machine, Asimov went to great lengths to portray with great accuracy what it would actually be like to be reduced to infinitesimal scale. He discussed the ability of the lights on the submarine to penetrate normal matter, issues of time distortion, and other side effects that the movie does not address. Asimov was also bothered by the way the wreck of &quot;Proteus&quot; was left in Benes. In a subsequent meeting with Jaffe, he insisted that he would have to change the ending so that the submarine was brought out. Asimov also felt the need to gain permission from his usual science-fiction publisher, Doubleday, to write the novel. Doubleday did not object, and had suggested his name to Bantam in the first place. Asimov began work on the novel on May 31, and completed it on July 23.

In the film, the crew (apart from the saboteur) manage to leave Benes&#x27;s body safely before reverting to normal size, but the &quot;Proteus&quot; remains inside, as do the remains of the saboteur&#x27;s body (albeit digested by a white blood cell), and several gallons (full scale) of a carrier solution (presumably saline) used in the injection syringe. Isaac Asimov pointed out that this was a serious logical flaw in the plot, since the submarine (even if reduced to bits of debris) would also revert to normal size, killing Benes in the process. Therefore, in his novelization Asimov had the crew provoke the white cell into following them, so that it drags the submarine to the tear duct, and its wreckage expands outside Benes&#x27;s body. Asimov solved the problem of the syringe fluid by having the staff inject only a very small amount of miniaturized fluid into Benes, minimizing its effect on him when it expands.

Asimov did not want any of his books, even a film novelization, to appear only in paperback, so in August 1965, he persuaded Austin Olney of Houghton Mifflin to publish a hardcover edition, assuring him that the book would sell at least 8000 copies, which it did. However, since the rights to the story were held by Otto Klement, who had co-written the original story treatment, Asimov would not be entitled to any royalties. By the time the hardcover edition was published in March 1966, Houghton Mifflin had persuaded Klement to allow Asimov to have a quarter of the royalties. Klement also negotiated for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; to serialize an abridged version of the novel, and he agreed to give Asimov half the payment for it. &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (abridged to half its length) appeared in the February 26 and March 12, 1966, issues of the &quot;Post.&quot; Bantam Books released the paperback edition of the novel in September 1966 to coincide with the release of the film. Harry Harrison, reviewing the Asimov novelization, called it a &quot;Jerry-built monstrosity&quot;, praising the descriptions of science-fiction events as &quot;Asimov at his best&quot;, while condemning the narrative framework as &quot;inane drivel&quot;.

===Animated television series===

&quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; is an American animated science fiction TV series based on the film. The series consists of 17 half-hour episodes, airing Saturday mornings on ABC-TV from September 14, 1968, through January 4, 1969, then rebroadcast the following fall season. The series was produced by Filmation Associates in association with 20th Century Fox. A &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; comic book, based on the series, was published by Gold Key and lasted two issues.

===Other adaptations===
A comic book adaptation of the film was released by Gold Key Comics in 1967. Drawn by Wally Wood, the book followed the plot of the movie with general accuracy, but many scenes were depicted differently and/or outright dropped, and the ending was given an epilogue similar as that seen in some of the early draft scripts for the film.

A parody of the film, titled &quot;Fantastecch Voyage&quot;, was published in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. It was illustrated by Mort Drucker and written by Larry Siegel in issue #110, April 1967. The advertising-business-themed spoof has the crew — from L.S./M.F.T. (Laboratory Sector for Making Folks Tiny) — sent to inject decongestant into a severely stuffed-up nose.

The film was adapted into a video game for Atari 2600 in 1982 by Fox Video Games.

&quot;Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain&quot; (1987) was written by Isaac Asimov as an attempt to develop and present his own story apart from the 1966 screenplay. This novel is not a sequel to the original, but instead is a separate story taking place in the Soviet Union with an entirely different set of characters.

&quot;Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm&quot; is a third interpretation, written by Kevin J. Anderson, published in 2001. This version has the crew of the &quot;Proteus&quot; explore the body of a dead alien that crash-lands on earth, and updates the story with such modern concepts as nanotechnology (replacing killer white cells).

==Cancelled sequel/remake==
Plans for a sequel or remake have been in discussion since at least 1984, but as of the beginning of July 2015, the project remained stuck in development hell. In 1984, Isaac Asimov was approached to write &quot;Fantastic Voyage II&quot;, out of which a movie would be made. Asimov &quot;was sent a suggested outline&quot; that mirrored the movie &quot;Innerspace&quot; and &quot;involved two vessels in the bloodstream, one American and one Soviet, and what followed was a kind of submicroscopic version of World War III.&quot; Asimov was against such an approach. Following a dispute between publishers, the original commissioners of the novel approached Philip José Farmer, who &quot;wrote a novel and sent [in] the manuscript&quot; that was rejected despite &quot;stick[ing] tightly to the outline [that was sent to Asimov].&quot; &quot;It dealt with World War III in the bloodstream, and it was full of action and excitement.&quot; Although Asimov urged the publisher to accept Farmer&#x27;s manuscript, it was insisted that Asimov write the novel. So, Asimov eventually wrote the book in his own way (completely different in plot from what [Farmer] had written), which was eventually published by Doubleday in 1987 as &quot;Fantastic Voyage II&quot; and &quot;dealt not with competing submarines in the bloodstream, but with one submarine, with [an] American hero cooperating (not entirely voluntarily) with four Soviet crew members.&quot; The novel was not made into a movie, however.

James Cameron was also interested in directing a remake (since at least 1997), but decided to devote his efforts to his &quot;Avatar&quot; project. He still remained open to the idea of producing a feature based on his own screenplay, and in 2007, 20th Century Fox announced that pre-production on the project was finally underway. Roland Emmerich agreed to direct, but rejected the script written by Cameron. Marianne and Cormac Wibberley were hired to write a new script, but the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike delayed filming, and Emmerich began working on &quot;2012&quot; instead.

In spring 2010, Paul Greengrass was considering directing the remake from a script written by Shane Salerno and produced by James Cameron, but later dropped out to be replaced by Shawn Levy. It was intended that the film be shot in native stereoscopic 3D.

In January 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Guillermo del Toro was in talks to direct the reboot by reteaming with David S. Goyer, who was writing the film&#x27;s script with Justin Rhodes with Cameron still on the film by his production company Lightstorm Entertainment. In August 2017, it was reported that del Toro had postponed working on the film to completely focus on his film &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;, due to release the same year, and he would start pre-production in spring 2018 and would begin filming in the fall of the same year for a 2020 release.

In April 2024, Cameron offered an update on the project: &quot;we plan to go ahead with it very soon.&quot;

<text>Inky Mark (; born November 17, 1947) is a Canadian politician was Mayor of Dauphin and a former member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Manitoba riding of Dauphin—Swan River—Marquette. Mark was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, although he frequently criticized and took positions opposite the party and its leader, Stephen Harper. Mark ran in the 2015 federal election, noting that he is now a Green Party of Canada member but that he would still run as an independent. He lost significantly.

==Early life==
Mark was born in Taishan, China, and moved to Manitoba as a child. Mark&#x27;s father and grandfather had emigrated from China to Canada some time previously, but were unable to bring their families with them as a result of provisions in the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923. Mark accompanied his mother when she fled China in 1953, and subsequently settled with his family in the Manitoba community of Gilbert Plains.

==Education==
Mark has a Bachelor of Arts from Brandon University and a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Manitoba. Before entering political life, he worked as a high school teacher and small businessman. Mark also has a certificate in broadcasting and started a master&#x27;s degree in education program, although he did not graduate.

==Political career==

===Municipal politics===
Mark&#x27;s political career started when joined the Board of Directors of the Dauphin First United Church. He was subsequently elected to the Dauphin town council in 1991, and became the town&#x27;s mayor in 1994.

===Federal politics===

Mark was first elected to the House of Commons in the federal election of 1997, running as a candidate of the Reform Party in the riding of Dauphin—Swan River. From 1997 to 2000, Mark was one of only three Chinese-Canadian MPs in the House of Commons.

The Reform Party dissolved itself in 2000 in favour of the Canadian Alliance, and Mark ran as a candidate of the new party in the federal election which followed.

On September 12, 2001, Mark left the Canadian Alliance caucus to sit as a member of the Democratic Representative Caucus, in alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party.

The DRC came to an end on April 10, 2002, when Stephen Harper replaced Day as Canadian Alliance leader. Every other member of the DRC requested to be re-admitted to the Alliance; Mark did not join them, but instead decided to sit as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot;, with the intention of rejoining the Progressive Conservatives at their annual party convention later in the year; he had been a Progressive Conservative before the early 1990s. Mark formally joined the Progressive Conservatives on August 27, 2002.

In December 2003, the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative Party formally merged to create the new Conservative Party of Canada. Mark supported the merger, and formally joined the new party&#x27;s caucus on February 2, 2004. Mark was easily re-elected in the Canadian federal election of 2004.

In 2005, Mark alleged that Treasury Board President and Liberal MP Reg Alcock offered him an ambassadorship if he were to resign his seat. Alcock responded by saying, &quot;Frankly, if I was going to recruit somebody, I&#x27;d go a little higher up the gene pool.&quot; Mark called this comment racist and filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. As the CHRC does not publish its investigations, it is not possible to know the outcome of this case.

===Criticism and complaints===
While a sitting MP, Mark gained a reputation as &quot;an outsider&quot; within the Conservative caucus. Mark is and has been an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, and several sitting and former Conservative MPs. He frequently complained that Harper was controlling, and he responded by refusing to attend Conservative events. Mark has called Harper a &quot;fascist&quot; and complained that he runs a &quot;top-down dictatorship&quot;. He says that the Central Intelligence Agency is controlled by the United States&#x27; Republican Party, and that the Republican Party installed Stephen Harper as the Canadian Prime Minister in order to sell out Canada to the United States.

Following the announcement of his resignation, Mark complained that the nomination race for his successor was rigged, and allowed Robert Sopuck to be acclaimed without competition.

Following his resignation as an MP, Mark stepped up his criticisms of the Harper government. He complained that the nomination race for the Conservative candidate following the resignation of Labrador MP Peter Penashue was rigged because Harper &quot;wants a candidate he can control&quot;. He also complained that the nomination race to replace Merv Tweed was rigged, and that the eventual successor, Larry Maguire, was just a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for Harper. Mark was featured prominently in the book &quot;Tragedy in the Commons&quot;, where almost every chapter quoted Mark&#x27;s complaints about the way Harper&#x27;s government was run.

Mark complained that the Conservatives&#x27; Constituent Information Management System (CIMS) was a secretive database used to track and control Canadians&#x27; information and voting preferences, and said that Harper could simply &quot;switch off&quot; this system to punish an MP.

===Parliamentary work===
For his tenure as an MP, Mark was always a &quot;backbencher&quot;.

In 2001, as the Alliance&#x27;s parliamentary critic for Immigration, Mark was responsible for expressing his party&#x27;s position on the Liberal government&#x27;s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which he did during the immigration controversy involving the Sklarzyk family who, as a result of an administrative error, was deported from Canada to Poland in May 2001. He also contributed to the parliamentary committee&#x27;s work in drafting the final version of the bill, and was generally regarded by MPs from all parties as having made several constructive criticisms to the legislation.

However, on June 13, 2001, Mark&#x27;s position on the bill was undercut by Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day, who delivered a speech in parliament supporting tighter restrictions against refugee claimants and reduced opportunities for rejected claimants to appeal to the Refugee Board. Day&#x27;s comments diverged from Mark&#x27;s stated position on several particulars, and his speech was regarded as very surprising by many other MPs in the House of Commons. For example, Liberal MP Steve Mahoney referred to Day&#x27;s comments as &quot;treachery&quot; towards Mark, for which he was ruled out of order by the Speaker.

In 2005, Mark&#x27;s private members&#x27; Bill C-331 (Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act) was passed by the House of Commons and Senate of Canada, eventually resulting in the establishment of the Endowment Council of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund, supporting educational and commemorative projects recalling Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations of 1914–1920.

===Federal resignation and return to municipal politics===
Mark announced in June 2009 that he would be resigning before the next federal election. On August 16, 2010, he announced that he would step down as an MP on September 15 to campaign for another term as mayor of Dauphin. However, he lost to Eric Irwin.

===Return to federal politics and switch to Green Party of Canada===
Mark announced on November 13, 2014, that he would be running as an independent candidate for the 2015 federal election in Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa, which includes nearly all of his old riding. Mark announced that he is now a member of the Green Party of Canada, but would still seek election in 2015 as an independent candidate. Mark finished a distant fourth behind Sopuck, garnering only eight percent of the vote.
