<text>The modern administrative-territorial structure of Russia is a system of territorial organization which is a product of a centuries-long evolution and reforms.

==Early history==

The Kievan Rus&#x27; as it formed in the 10th century remained a more or less unified realm under the rule of Yaroslav the Wise (d. 1054), but in the later part of the 11th century, it disintegrated into a number of &quot;de facto&quot; independent and rivaling principalities, the most important of which were Galicia–Volhynia, the Novgorod Republic, and Vladimir-Suzdal.

Following the advance of the Mongols and the establishment of the Golden Horde in 1240, many parts of the former Kievan Rus&#x27; came under the direct administration of Sarai, while others became its dependencies. The Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later gradually and completely coming under the direct administration of the Crown of Poland. The Novgorod Republic was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The grand duchies of Lithuania and Moscow practically divided the former territories of Kievan Rus&#x27; between each other, both struggling to gain the seat of the Metropolitan of Kiev.

From the 13th century, the Russian principalities used an administrative subdivision into uyezds, with each such uyezd being subdivided into several volosts, some areas used division of pyatina. Voivodes were the officials appointed to administer and defend the uyezds.

By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Moscow was recognized as a direct successor of the Grand Duchy of Vladimir. It gradually incorporated all left out adjacent smaller duchies such as the Principality of Yaroslavl, Principality of Rostov and successfully conquered the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal, the Principality of Tver as well as the Novgorod Republic. Near the end of the 15th century the Golden Horde fell apart into several smaller khanates and Muscovy for the first time became a sovereign state.

At the start of the 16th century, the Grand Duchy of Moscow managed to annex the Pskov Republic and conquer the Grand Duchy of Ryazan as well as secure number of territories that belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania such as the Upper Oka Principalities and Sloboda Ukraine, thus extending its territory far south. In 1708, the Oka principalities and Sloboda Ukraine were incorporated into the first Kiev Governorate. During the second half of the 16th century, the Grand Duchy of Moscow managed to conquer number of West-Siberian and Volga duchies and khanates such as Kazan Khanate, Siberia Khanate, Astrakhan Khanate, Great Nogai Horde and many others. Some of the territorial acquisitions, however, were lost during the Time of Troubles.

Soon after the Time of Troubles (Treaty of Polyanovka), the Grand Duchy of Moscow was able to recover the Duchy of Smolensk (Smolensk Voivodeship) and later annex territory of Left-bank Ukraine (Truce of Andrusovo).

Prior to the 18th century, the Tsardom of Russia was divided into a system of territorial units called &quot;razryads&quot; (literally &quot;order of units&quot;) as part of military reform of 1680.
*Moscow Razryad
*Sevsk Razryad
*Vladimir Razryad
*Novgorod Razryad
*Kazan Razryad
*Smolensk Razryad
*Ryazan Razryad
*Belgorod Razryad, chartered in 1658 out of the Kiev Voivodeship
*Tambov Razryad
*Tula Razryad
*Tobol Razryad, chartered no later than 1587 (first known Voivodeship)
*Tom Razryad
*Yenisei Razryad

During the 1680s, the Tsardom of Russia acquired a substantial expansion in Transbaikal after signing the Treaty of Nerchinsk with China (Qing dynasty). By this time (at the end of the 17th century), an extensive territory from Yenisei to the Sea of Okhotsk was secured through colonization. The discovery of the Bering Strait in 1728 confirmed the eastern borders of modern Russia. The eastward advance through Siberia extended the Tobol Razryad transforming it into overstretched territory that was initially in 1708 included into Siberia Governorate.

==Imperial Russia==


===Administrative reforms by Peter the Great===
Technically, the territorial-administrative reform started out in the Tsardom of Russia before the Imperial period. On , 1708, in order to improve the manageability of the vast territory of the state, Tsar Peter the Great issued an ukase (edict) dividing Russia into eight administrative divisions, called governorates (&quot;guberniyas&quot;), which replaced the 166 uyezds and razryads which existed before the reform:
*Archangelgorod Governorate
*Azov Governorate
*Ingermanland Governorate
*Kazan Governorate
*Kiev Governorate
*Moscow Governorate
*Siberia Governorate
*Smolensk Governorate

The reform of 1708 established neither the borders of the governorates nor their internal divisions. The governorates were defined as the sets of cities and the lands adjacent to those cities. Some older subdivision types also continued to be used. Between 1710 and 1713, all governorates were subdivided into lots (), each governed by a &quot;landrat&quot; (). Every governorate was administered by an appointed governor, who also headed a board of &quot;landrats&quot;. The lots&#x27; primary purpose was fiscal, and each one was supposed to cover 5,536 homesteads.

In 1719, Peter enacted another administrative reform to fix the deficiencies of the original system, as the governorates were too big and unmanageable. This reform abolished the system of lots, dividing most of the governorates into provinces (), which were further divided into districts ().

During this time, territories were frequently reshuffled between the governorates, and new governorates were added to accommodate population growth and territorial expansion.

in 1721 the Russian Empire possessed a multinational population of about 17.5 million population in all administrative districts. Out of the 13.5 million Russians, 5.5 million men were liable to the poll tax; 3 percent of them were townsmen and 97 percent peasants. Of the peasants, 25 percent cultivated church lands, 19 percent state lands, and the remainder worked the estates of some 100,000 families of secular landowners. Russia’s territory of about 4,633,200 square miles (12,000,000 square km) included some recent and valuable acquisitions.
===Subsequent reforms===
In 1727, soon after Peter the Great&#x27;s death, Catherine I enacted another reform, which rolled back many of the previous reform&#x27;s developments. The system of districts was abolished, and the old system of &quot;uyezds&quot; was restored. A total of 166 uyezds was re-established; together with the newly created uyezds, the Russian Empire had approximately 250.

The reform also reshuffled some territories. Narva Province was transferred from Saint Petersburg Governorate to Revel Governorate; Solikamsk and Vyatka Provinces were transferred from Siberia Governorate to Kazan Governorate; and Uglich and Yaroslavl Provinces were transferred from Saint Petersburg Governorate to Moscow Governorate. In addition, Belgorod, Oryol, and Sevsk Provinces of Kiev Governorate were reconstituted as Belgorod Governorate; and Belozersk, Novgorod, Pskov, Tver, and Velikiye Luki Provinces of Saint Petersburg Governorate were reconstituted as Novgorod Governorate.

The following years saw few changes. In 1728, Ufa Province was transferred from Kazan Governorate to Siberia Governorate, and in 1737, Simbirsk Province was created within Kazan Governorate.

===Administrative reforms by Catherine the Great===
By 1775, the existing system of administrative divisions proved inefficient, which was further underlined by Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, and Catherine the Great issued a document known as &quot;Decree on the Governorates&quot; (). The second part of the same decree was issued in 1780, which, however, contained very few significant changes with respect to the first part.

A major administrative territorial restructuring of the Russian Empire after vast land acquisition from the Ottoman Empire and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. The reform saw introduction of the office of viceroy (gosudarev namestnik) which later were transformed into a general governor. Gosudarev namestnik literally means an imperial representative to the land. During the reform several already existing governments (guberniya) were combined under the office of the Russian viceroy and were called namestnichestvo. Those namestnichestvo were introduced onto the expanded territory as well, the only exclusion were the governments of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1796 all namestnichetvo were officially renamed into general governments. General governments exercised a small degree of autonomy as certain laws varied from general government to another.

===Reforms in the 19th century===

After the abolition of Russian serfdom in 1861, volosts became a unit of peasant&#x27;s local self-rule. A number of mirs were united into a typical volost, which had an assembly consisting of elected delegates from the mirs. The self-government of the mirs and volosts was tempered by the authority of the police commissaries (&quot;stanovoy&quot;) and by the power of general oversight given to the nominated &quot;district committees for the affairs of the peasants&quot;.

===Reforms in the 20th century===
By the 1910s, 104 administrative governorate units existed.

==Soviet Russia==
The Russian SFSR comprised 16 autonomous republics, 5 autonomous oblasts, 10 autonomous okrugs, 6 krais, and 40 oblasts.

Uyezds and volosts were abolished by the Soviet administrative reform of 1923–1929. Raions may be roughly called a modern equivalent of the uyezds, and selsoviets may be considered a modern equivalent of the volosts.

==Russian Federation==
The subdivision type of Federal District was created in May 2000 by Vladimir Putin as a part of a wider program designed to reassert federal authority. The original division was into seven federal districts, but in 2010 the North Caucasian Federal District was split off from the Southern Federal District, bringing the number to eight. In 2014, the annexation of Crimea resulted in the creation of a new Crimean Federal District, bringing the number to nine, but it was later merged into the Southern Federal District. Amidst the invasion of Ukraine, four southern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia would later be annexed into Russia in 2022 but were not integrated into the Southern Federal District. All of the six regions that are under Russian occupation are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

<text>Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices. It is used to answer the question &quot;Who is speaking?&quot; The term voice recognition can refer to &quot;speaker recognition&quot; or [[speech recognition]]. Speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from &quot;speaker diarisation&quot; (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).

Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on specific voices or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process. Speaker recognition has a history dating back some four decades as of 2019 and uses the acoustic features of speech that have been found to differ between individuals. These acoustic patterns reflect both anatomy and learned behavioral patterns.

==Verification versus identification==
There are two major applications of speaker recognition technologies and methodologies. If the speaker claims to be of a certain identity and the voice is used to verify this claim, this is called &quot;verification&quot; or &quot;authentication&quot;. On the other hand, identification is the task of determining an unknown speaker&#x27;s identity. In a sense, speaker verification is a 1:1 match where one speaker&#x27;s voice is matched to a particular template whereas speaker identification is a 1:N match where the voice is compared against multiple templates.

From a security perspective, identification is different from verification. Speaker verification is usually employed as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; in order to provide access to a secure system. These systems operate with the users&#x27; knowledge and typically require their cooperation. Speaker identification systems can also be implemented covertly without the user&#x27;s knowledge to identify talkers in a discussion, alert automated systems of speaker changes, check if a user is already enrolled in a system, etc.

In forensic applications, it is common to first perform a speaker identification process to create a list of &quot;best matches&quot; and then perform a series of verification processes to determine a conclusive match. Working to match the samples from the speaker to the list of best matches helps figure out if they are the same person based on the amount of similarities or differences. The prosecution and defense use this as evidence to determine if the suspect is actually the offender.

==Training==
One of the earliest training technologies to commercialize was implemented in Worlds of Wonder&#x27;s 1987 Julie doll. At that point, speaker independence was an intended breakthrough, and systems required a training period. A 1987 ad for the doll carried the tagline &quot;Finally, the doll that understands you.&quot; - despite the fact that it was described as a product &quot;which children could train to respond to their voice.&quot; The term voice recognition, even a decade later, referred to speaker independence.

==Variants of speaker recognition==
Each speaker recognition system has two phases: enrollment and verification. During enrollment, the speaker&#x27;s voice is recorded and typically a number of features are extracted to form a voice print, template, or model. In the verification phase, a speech sample or &quot;utterance&quot; is compared against a previously created voice print. For identification systems, the utterance is compared against multiple voice prints in order to determine the best match(es) while verification systems compare an utterance against a single voice print. Because of the process involved, verification is faster than identification.

Speaker recognition systems fall into two categories: text-dependent and text-independent. Text-dependent recognition requires the text to be the same for both enrollment and verification. In a text-dependent system, prompts can either be common across all speakers (e.g. a common pass phrase) or unique. In addition, the use of shared-secrets (e.g.: passwords and PINs) or knowledge-based information can be employed in order to create a multi-factor authentication scenario. Conversely, text-independent systems do not require the use of a specific text. They are most often used for speaker identification as they require very little if any cooperation by the speaker. In this case the text during enrollment and test is different. In fact, the enrollment may happen without the user&#x27;s knowledge, as in the case for many forensic applications. As text-independent technologies do not compare what was said at enrollment and verification, verification applications tend to also employ speech recognition to determine what the user is saying at the point of authentication. In text independent systems both acoustics and speech analysis techniques are used.

==Technology==
Speaker recognition is a pattern recognition problem. The various technologies used to process and store voice prints include frequency estimation, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, pattern matching algorithms, neural networks, matrix representation, vector quantization and decision trees. For comparing utterances against voice prints, more basic methods like cosine similarity are traditionally used for their simplicity and performance. Some systems also use &quot;anti-speaker&quot; techniques such as cohort models and world models. Spectral features are predominantly used in representing speaker characteristics. Linear predictive coding (LPC) is a speech coding method used in speaker recognition and speech verification.

Ambient noise levels can impede both collections of the initial and subsequent voice samples. Noise reduction algorithms can be employed to improve accuracy, but incorrect application can have the opposite effect. Performance degradation can result from changes in behavioural attributes of the voice and from enrollment using one telephone and verification on another telephone. Integration with two-factor authentication products is expected to increase. Voice changes due to ageing may impact system performance over time. Some systems adapt the speaker models after each successful verification to capture such long-term changes in the voice, though there is debate regarding the overall security impact imposed by automated adaptation

==Legal implications==
Due to the introduction of legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the United States, there has been much discussion about the use of speaker recognition in the work place. In September 2019 Irish speech recognition developer Soapbox Labs warned about the legal implications that may be involved.

==Applications==

The first international patent was filed in 1983, coming from the telecommunication research in CSELT (Italy) by Michele Cavazza and Alberto Ciaramella as a basis for both future telco services to final customers and to improve the noise-reduction techniques across the network.

Between 1996 and 1998, speaker recognition technology was used at the Scobey–Coronach Border Crossing to enable enrolled local residents with nothing to declare to cross the Canada–United States border when the inspection stations were closed for the night. The system was developed for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service by Voice Strategies of Warren, Michigan.

In 2013 Barclays Wealth, the private banking division of Barclays, became the first financial services firm to deploy voice biometrics as the primary means of identifying customers to their call centers. The system used passive speaker recognition to verify the identity of telephone customers within 30 seconds of normal conversation. It was developed by voice recognition company Nuance (that in 2011 acquired the company Loquendo, the spin-off from CSELT itself for speech technology), the company behind Apple&#x27;s Siri technology. 93% of customers gave the system at &quot;9 out of 10&quot; for speed, ease of use and security.

Speaker recognition may also be used in criminal investigations, such as those of the 2014 executions of, amongst others, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

In February 2016 UK high-street bank HSBC and its internet-based retail bank First Direct announced that it would offer 15 million customers its biometric banking software to access online and phone accounts using their fingerprint or voice.

In 2023 Vice News and &quot;The Guardian&quot; separately demonstrated they could defeat standard financial speaker-authentication systems using AI-generated voices generated from about five minutes of the target&#x27;s voice samples.

<text>Mozart and the Whale (released as Crazy in Love in some parts of Europe) is a 2005 romantic comedy drama film directed by Petter Næss and starring Josh Hartnett and Radha Mitchell. The film is loosely based on the lives of Jerry and Mary Newport.

==Plot==

Donald Morton (Josh Hartnett) is a taxi driver with Asperger syndrome and drives two Japanese passengers and his pet cockatiel around Spokane, Washington. Distracted, he bumps into the back of a florist&#x27;s van, damaging his stock. Unfazed, Donald and his budgie take their groceries and leave, abandoning his taxicab and passengers. He takes his groceries to the self-help group for autistic adults. Before they head to the park to meet another autistic group, he tells one member, Gracie (Rusty Schwimmer), to gather the women and he will gather the guys to practice telling personal stories, but keeps getting distracted by performing mathematical sums of the microwaves&#x27; depleting numbers. He notices that Isabelle Sorenson (Radha Mitchell), who also has Asperger&#x27;s, a new name, has signed up and tells Gracie to let her go first.

At the park, Isabelle tells the women of a childhood memory: she saw that her parents were happy an Olympian had broken a record, so in order to please her parents, and taking what she heard literally, she broke their music records. Donald tells his story to the men about his ability to do complex sums, but couldn&#x27;t make friends. Isabelle goes on to tell of when she was raped when she went hitch-hiking. This causes Gracie to laugh manically. Heard by Donald, he tries to calm down an angry Isabelle and they find that they have much in common and take a liking to each other.

After Isabelle talks to Gregory (John Carroll Lynch), a man also in the group who is taking notes on a notepad, he calls Donald over to ask Isabelle if she may escort him to a Halloween party on his behalf. However, before Donald has the chance, Isabelle asks Donald out for lunch. They go to the zoo the following day where Isabelle asks Donald to escort her instead of Gregory. They agree to meet in-costume Halloween night. Donald dresses as a whale but decides against attending, ultimately leaving Isabelle, dressed as Mozart, waiting. She goes to his apartment and they decide to take a walk about town and talk until the final bus is due when they share their first kiss.

Unsure when to call, Donald leaves multiple messages on her phone; she finally answers and they go to the amusement park. During a ring toss, the clanging of the metal rings hitting the bottles and the ringing of a bell cause Isabelle to scream and collapse on the floor. Donald takes her back to his filthy apartment and they agree to sleep together. The following day at the self-help group, Gregory accuses Donald of exploiting his position for sexual favors. Meanwhile, Isabelle occupies herself by waiting with Bronwin (Erica Leerhsen), one of the younger members of the group who recently learned that her father has blood cancer, until her parents pick her up.

Isabelle takes the liberty of cleaning Donald&#x27;s apartment while he goes shopping. When he returns, he is horrified to see that everything is different; the piles of newspaper are stacked neatly, rotting food from the fridge is thrown away and has a new shower curtain and a toilet lid cover. He becomes angry at Isabelle for changing everything, by saying &quot;you stole my life&quot; before leaving again, although Isabelle thought that he would like it. He later leaves a number of apologetic messages on Isabelle&#x27;s phone. The next day, he goes to the hair salon where Isabelle works as a hair stylist to apologize in person, and Isabelle forgives him, while introducing him as her boyfriend to the staff and her co-workers.

Isabelle shows Donald an abandoned rooftop, calling this a place where people who don&#x27;t know where they belong can belong. She suggests that they can buy a house together and her therapist has arranged a job interview for a statistic analyst post at a university. He gets the job and they move into their new house, making it their own.

Donald tells Isabelle that he wants everything to be nice for when his boss, Wallace (Gary Cole) comes for dinner. Believing that he thinks that she doesn&#x27;t keep the house nice, Isabelle spites Donald by keeping the pets uncaged, much to Donald&#x27;s shock when he returns, and she maintains extroverted behavior and tells of her off-the-wall plans for the house. Donald explodes, asking how they&#x27;re going to afford all that, which leads to the two of them arguing over it but when Isabelle says that they are both crazy, he retaliates by telling her that she is crazier, which leads to her throwing him out of the house. He stays with Gregory in his house, and after listening to a tearful answer message that Isabelle&#x27;s rabbit, Bongo, has died, he runs to comfort her. Isabelle suggests that they should just be friends.

Donald invites Isabelle to a restaurant, where he proposes to her, much to Isabelle&#x27;s dismay. She leaves abruptly back home and overdoses on an over the counter drug. Donald returns just in time to take her to the hospital, where Isabelle&#x27;s psychiatrist advises him to leave her alone, testing his willpower to refrain from calling her.

Donald sees Isabelle leaving the university and follows her to the abandoned rooftop, where he says the only nice thing he had left to give her was not to call, to find that Isabelle was waiting for his call and she missed him. They express their true love with an embrace and kiss. The movie ends with the happy couple, now married, in their home, enjoying Thanksgiving dinner with the self-help group members.

==Production==
The screenplay was written by Ron Bass, who also wrote &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988), a film about an individual with autism. The script was based on the real-life story of Jerry and Mary Newport.

==Distribution==
The film struggled to find a theatrical distributor in the United States. The studio tried to distribute it in the United States in April 2004, but it did not go farther than a month in Spokane, Washington, where the film was made. The film is available on DVD in a number of countries. The film became available on DVD in the United States in late 2006.

==Reception==
According to a review in &quot;Variety&quot; by Todd McCarthy, &quot;Material that easily could have been turned into cringe-inducing TV movie sap has been handled with reasonable intelligence and authenticity&quot; and &quot;This low-budget love story between two emotionally stunted young people with Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome doesn&#x27;t have the production sheen or star power of screenwriter Ron Bass&#x27; &quot;Rain Man,&quot; but it&#x27;s less cloying and contrived.&quot; In a review for &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, Dan Webster writes, &quot;Especially poignant are the scenes in which Donald attempts to overcome his nature in an effort to hold on to the love he&#x27;s so long been denied.&quot;

The film was also criticized for perpetuating the media stereotype that people on the autism spectrum typically have savant skills.

<text>The Paraguay River (Ysyry Paraguái in Guarani, Rio Paraguai in Portuguese, Río Paraguay in Spanish) is a major river in south-central South America, running through Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina. It flows about from its headwaters in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso to its confluence with the Paraná River north of Corrientes and Resistencia.

==Course==

The Paraguay&#x27;s source is south of Diamantino in the Mato Grosso state of Brazil. It follows a generally southwesterly course, passing through the Brazilian city of Cáceres. It then turns in a generally southward direction, flowing through the Pantanal wetlands, the city of Corumbá, then running close to the Brazil-Bolivia border for a short distance in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.

From the city of Puerto Bahia Negra, Paraguay, the river forms the border between Paraguay and Brazil, flowing almost due south before the confluence with the Apa River.

The Paraguay makes a long, gentle curve to the south-southeast before resuming a more south-southwesterly course, dividing the country of Paraguay into two distinct halves: the Gran Chaco region to the west, a largely uninhabited semi-arid region; and the eastern forested departments of the country, accounting for some 98% of the country&#x27;s inhabitants. As such the river is considered perhaps the key geographical feature of the country with which it shares its name.

Some after flowing through the middle of Paraguay, at the confluence with the Pilcomayo River and passing the Paraguayan capital city, Asunción, the river forms the border with Argentina, flowing generally south-southwesterly for another before it reaches its end, joining with the Paraná River.

==Uses==

The Paraguay River is the second major river of the Rio de la Plata Basin, after the Paraná River. The Paraguay&#x27;s drainage basin, about , covers a vast area that includes major portions of Argentina, southern Brazil, parts of Bolivia, and most of the country of Paraguay. Unlike many of the other great rivers of the Rio de la Plata Basin, the Paraguay has not been dammed for hydroelectric power generation; for this reason it is navigable for a considerable distance, second only to the Amazon River in terms of navigable length on the continent. This makes it an important shipping and trade corridor, providing a much-needed link to the Atlantic Ocean for the otherwise landlocked nations of Paraguay and Bolivia. It serves such important cities as Asunción and Concepción in Paraguay and Formosa in Argentina.

The river is also a source of commerce in the form of fishing, and provides irrigation for agriculture along its route. As such it provides a way of life for a number of poor fishermen who live along its banks and make the majority of their income selling fish in local markets, as well as supplying a major source of sustenance for their families. This has created issues in large cities such as Asunción, where poverty-stricken farmers from the country&#x27;s interior have populated the river&#x27;s banks in search of an easier lifestyle. Seasonal flooding of the river&#x27;s banks sometimes forces many thousands of displaced residents to seek temporary shelter until the waters recede from their homes. The Paraguayan military has been forced to dedicate land on one of its reserves in the capital to emergency housing for these displaced citizens. The river is a tourist attraction for its beauty.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the upper Paraguay River were the Guarani peoples.

The Paraguay River was explored in the 16th century by Sebastian Cabot, who at that time became the first recorded European to discover both the Paraná and Paraguay rivers. For hundreds of years, this river has served as the main route of Paraguay to the outside world.

Since that time, the river has had its vitality and importance, but is used today for a convoy of barges.

==Wetland controversy==

The Paraguay River is the primary waterway of the Pantanal wetlands of southern Brazil, northern Paraguay and parts of Bolivia. The Pantanal is the world&#x27;s largest tropical wetland and is largely dependent upon waters provided by the Paraguay River.

Owing to its importance as a navigable waterway serving Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, the river has been the focus of commercial and industrial development. In 1997, the governments of the nations of the La Plata Basin proposed a plan under the Hidrovia Inter-Governmental Commission agency to develop the rivers into an industrial waterway system to help reduce the costs of exporting goods from the area, in particular the soybean crop that the area has embraced. The plan entailed constructing more hydroelectric dams along some of the waterways, along with a massive effort to restructure the navigable waterways—most notably the Paraguay River—through dredging of the waterway, rock removal and channel restructuring.

Studies indicated that the proposed river engineering of the Paraguay would have a devastating impact on the Pantanal wetlands. An effort by the Rios Vivos coalition to educate people on the effects of the project was successful in delaying the project, and the nations involved agreed to reformulate their plan. The final plan is still uncertain, along with the effect it will have on the Pantanal and the ecology of the entire Río de la Plata basin. The controversy over whether or not the project will have a disastrous effect on the local ecology, as well as the potential economic gains, continues to this day.

==Water characteristics==

The Paraguay River basin includes several distinctive habitats, ranging from very clear waters such as Rio da Prata () near Bonito in the upper part to the sediment-rich Bermejo River in the lower part. The suspended load of the Paraguay River is about before the inflow of Bermejo, but rises to about after. Directly after the inflow of Bermejo River, the pH of the Paraguay River may reach up to 8.2. The typical pH of the Paraguay River is 5.8—7.4 in the upper part (defined as the section before the inflow of the first non-Pantanal tributary, the Apa River) and 6.3—7.9 in the lower part.

The peak of the flood season in the Paraguay River (measured at Corumbá) is delayed 4–6 months compared to the peak of the rainy season due to the slow passage of water through the Pantanal wetlands. There are significant temperature variations depending on the season. During the low-water season, the water of the Paraguay River is relatively warm (typically above ) and clouded (Secchi depth typically less than ), but in the flood season it is colder (typically ) and clearer (Secchi depth typically ). The upper part of the Paraguay River is warmer than the lower and generally its temperature does not fall below , although some upper Paraguay tributaries may fall below this.

==Fauna==

The Paraguay River ecoregion has high species richness with about 350 fish species, including more than 80 endemics. About 80% of the fish species in the river are characiforms (tetras and allies) and siluriforms (catfish). Several of these migrate up the Paraguay River to spawn, including &quot;Prochilodus lineatus&quot; and &quot;Pseudoplatystoma corruscans&quot;. Unsurprisingly many species in the river are essentially of Paraná River Basin origin, but the fauna also has a connection with two Amazonian rivers, the Guaporé and Mamoré. While flowing in different directions, the Paraguay, Guaporé and Mamoré all have their source in the same region in central South America. Among the species shared between these are the black phantom tetra, an important fish in the aquarium industry, and the golden dorado, which is important in the fishing industry.

<text>At the Abyss: An Insider&#x27;s History of the Cold War () is a 2004 autobiographical book about Thomas C. Reed&#x27;s experience at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory through his time as an advisor to President Ronald Reagan. It reveals new details about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Farewell Dossier, and other facets of the Cold War.

== Trans-Siberian gas pipeline sabotage allegation ==
In the book, Reed stated the United States added a Trojan horse to gas pipeline control software that the Soviet Union obtained from a company in Canada. According to Reed, when the components were deployed on a Trans-Siberian gas pipeline, the Trojan horse led to a huge explosion. He wrote: &quot;The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire, to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space.&quot;

A report in the &quot;Moscow Times&quot; quoted KGB veteran Vasily Pchelintsev as saying that there was a natural gas pipeline explosion in 1982, but it was near Tobolsk on a pipeline connecting the Urengoy gas field to the city of Chelyabinsk, and it was caused by poor construction rather than sabotage; according to Pchelintsev&#x27;s account, no one was killed in the explosion and the damage was repaired within one day. Reed&#x27;s account has also not been corroborated by intelligence agencies in the United States, although in 1996 the CIA did publish that &quot;flawed turbines were installed on a gas pipe line&quot; in their historical recounting of the Farewell Dossier.

Another point of criticism of the sabotage allegations is that, according to Prof. V. D. Zakhmatov, an explosion safety expert who has overseen the safety measures on many of the Soviet oil and gas pipelines built in the 1980s, at the described timeframe Soviet Union simply didn&#x27;t practice digital control of its pipeline system. Most of the control was manual, and whatever automation was used utilized the analog control systems, most of which worked through pneumatics.

==Critical reception==
According to a review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;: &quot;The writing is sometimes discursive if seldom dull, and some areas have already been adequately covered by others. But the book deserves quite high marks for how much it pulls together, as well as offering a viewpoint on the Cold War not nearly sufficiently well-represented in the public literature: that neither the U.S. nor Soviet sciences were dominated by stereotypical, bomb-happy maniacs.&quot;

<text>Howard Kester (1904–1977) was an American preacher, organizer, and activist based in the South. He is noted for his work organizing the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU) beginning in 1934. His work was inspired by a radical version of Christianity called the Social Gospel, influenced by Reinhold Niebuhr among others, as well as a Marxist critique of the Southern economy. A white Southerner, he believed that it was important to end racial strife by uniting poor black and whites around a common cause.

His views on race had been influenced as a college student by a tour of Poland with the YMCA. After visiting a Jewish ghetto, he began to see a parallel between Europe&#x27;s treatment of Jews and America&#x27;s treatment of blacks. Kester worked with numerous organizations throughout his life that sought racial justice in the United States: the NAACP, Fellowship of Reconciliation, Fellowship of Southern Churchmen, and the Committee on Economic and Racial Justice. He investigated the Claude Neal case. 

In 1936, he published &quot;Revolt Among the Sharecroppers&quot;, a short work on behalf of the STFU. It was reprinted by Arno in 1969, and issued in a new edition in 1997 by the University of Tennessee Press.

==Biography==
Howard &quot;Buck&quot; Kester was born in 1904 and spent the first twelve years of his life living in the outskirts of Martinsville, Virginia. His father, a tailor, moved the family to Beckley, West Virginia; a coal mining town. Industrial growth in Beckley intensified the gap between the working and middle class, which benefited more by industry. African Americans were drawn to the area in search of work. In the early 20th century, the Ku Klux Klan had a revival, representing itself as a fraternal organization, and Kester&#x27;s own father joined. This environment gave Kester firsthand knowledge of class and race inequality.

During the 1920s, Kester worked as a Christian activist for the YMCA and the Fellowship of Reconciliation. In the late 1920s, Kester enrolled in the divinity school of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Under the partnership and influence of Alva Taylor, Kester and other Christian socialists, developed what historian Anthony Dunbar calls a &quot;radical gospel&quot; that sought to improve economic conditions in the South.

As the Great Depression took effect, they wanted to help the South&#x27;s dispossessed sharecroppers, textile and mine workers, and unemployed among both blacks and whites. In 1936 Kester published &quot;Revolt Among the Sharecroppers&quot;, a short work prepared on behalf of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. It was republished in 1969 and 1997.

In October 1934, Kester represented the NAACP in investigating the murder of Lola Cannady in Marianna, Florida, for which Claude Neal, a young African-American man, had been arrested. Neal was brutally lynched in a terrorist spectacle a few days after the murder, before any trial could take place. Afterward the aroused mob attacked up to 200 blacks on the streets and in their businesses, rioting, looting and burning in the black part of town. The governor had to call in the National Guard to restore order in Jackson County.

Howard Kester worked as the secretary for the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen from 1934 until 1944, and again from 1952 to 1957.

<text>John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower (August 3, 1922 – December 21, 2013) was a United States Army officer, diplomat, and military historian. He was the second son of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. His military career spanned from before, during, and after his father&#x27;s presidency, and he left active duty in 1963 and then retired in 1974. From 1969 to 1971, Eisenhower served as United States Ambassador to Belgium during the administration of President Richard Nixon, who was previously his father&#x27;s vice president and also father-in-law to Eisenhower&#x27;s son David.

== Early life and education ==
John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower was born on August 3, 1922, at Denver General Hospital in Denver, Colorado, to future U.S. President and United States Army General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie; he was their second child. Their elder son, Doud, known affectionately as &quot;Icky&quot;, died in 1921, at age three, after contracting scarlet fever. Eisenhower, like his father, attended the United States Military Academy, graduating on June 6, 1944, the day of the Normandy landings, which his father was commanding. He later earned an M.A. degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University in 1950, and taught in the English Department at West Point from 1948 to 1951. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College in 1955.

== Military career ==
Eisenhower served in the U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War, remaining on active duty until 1963; then serving in the U.S. Army Reserve until retirement in 1975 – attaining the rank of brigadier general. A decorated soldier, Eisenhower found his World War II military career thwarted by fears for his safety and concern from the top brass that his death or capture would be a distraction to his father, the Supreme Allied Commander. During World War II, he was assigned to intelligence and administrative duties. This issue arose again in 1952 when Major Eisenhower was assigned to fight in a combat unit in Korea while his father ran for president. But unlike World War II, John was able to see combat in Korea. After seeing combat with an infantry battalion, he was reassigned to the 3rd Division headquarters.

== Government career ==
During his father&#x27;s presidency, Eisenhower served as Assistant Staff Secretary in the White House, on the Army&#x27;s General Staff, and in the White House as assistant to General Andrew Goodpaster.

In the administration of President Richard Nixon, who had been his father&#x27;s vice president, he served as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971. In 1972, President Nixon appointed Eisenhower chairman of the Interagency Classification Review Committee. In 1975, he served President Gerald Ford as chairman of the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Refugees.

== Later life and writing ==

As a military historian, Eisenhower wrote several books, including &quot;The Bitter Woods&quot;, a study of the Battle of the Bulge, and &quot;So Far from God&quot;, a history of the Mexican–American War. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the latter, historian Stephen W. Sears remarked that Eisenhower &quot;writes briskly and authoritatively, and his judgments are worth reading.&quot; Eisenhower wrote &quot;Zachary Taylor: The American Presidents Series: The 12th President, 1849–1850&quot; (2008). He also wrote the forewords to &quot;Borrowed Soldiers&quot;, by Mitchell Yockelson of the U.S. National Archives, and to Kenneth W. Rendell&#x27;s &quot;Politics, War and Personality: 50 Iconic Documents of World War II&quot;.

In later years, he had been an opponent of Frank Gehry&#x27;s proposed design for the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, which he said was &quot;too extravagant&quot; and &quot;attempts to do too much.&quot;

=== Presidential elections ===
A lifelong Republican, Eisenhower voted for Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, citing dissatisfaction with Republican incumbent George W. Bush&#x27;s management of U.S. foreign policy.

During the 2008 presidential election, in which presidential candidate John McCain and vice presidential candidates Sarah Palin and Joe Biden all had children serving in the armed forces, Eisenhower wrote about his wartime experience as the son of a sitting president in a cautionary opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;Presidential Children Don&#x27;t Belong in Battle&quot;.

=== Death ===
Eisenhower died in Trappe, Maryland, on December 21, 2013. From the death of Elizabeth Ann Blaesing in 2005 until his own death, Eisenhower was the oldest living presidential child; on his death that distinction passed to Lynda Bird Johnson, who still holds it as of 2023. His burial was at West Point Cemetery on the grounds of the United States Military Academy.

== Marriage and children ==
Eisenhower married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10, 1947, only a few days before her twenty-first birthday. Barbara was born on June 15, 1926, in Fort Knox, Kentucky, into an Army family. She was the daughter of Col. Percy Walter Thompson (1898–1974) and his wife Beatrice (née Birchfield). Col. Thompson was commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. The Eisenhowers had four children:
* Dwight David Eisenhower II (b. 1948, West Point, New York), who married Julie Nixon, herself a presidential daughter;
* Barbara Anne Eisenhower (1949–2022, born in West Point, New York);
* Susan Elaine Eisenhower (b. 1951, Fort Knox, Kentucky);
* Mary Jean Eisenhower (b. 1955, Washington, D.C.).

All of his daughters were presented as debutantes to high society at the prestigious International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.

John and Barbara divorced in 1986 after thirty-nine years of marriage. In 1988, Barbara married widower Edwin J. Foltz, a former vice president at the Campbell Soup Company. She died on September 19, 2014, in Gladwyne, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

In 1988, Eisenhower married Joanne Thompson. He lived in Trappe, Maryland, after moving there from Kimberton, Pennsylvania.

== Military awards and decorations ==
== Other honors ==
The city of Marshfield, Missouri, chose Eisenhower as a 2008 honoree of the Edwin P. Hubble Medal of Initiative. His grandson, Merrill Eisenhower Atwater, spoke on his behalf at Marshfield&#x27;s annual Cherry Blossom Festival. The medal recognizes individuals who demonstrate great initiative in their chosen field.

<doc id="1032304" wikidata="Q1567032" url="?curid=1032304" title="Southern soul">
<text>Southern soul or country soul is a type of soul and country music that emerged from the Southern United States. The music originated from a combination of styles, including blues (both 12 bar and jump), country, early R&amp;B, and a strong gospel influence that emanated from the sounds of Southern black churches. Bass guitar, drums, horn section, and gospel roots vocal are important to soul groove. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of funk music. The terms &quot;deep soul&quot;, &quot;country soul&quot;, &quot;downhome soul&quot; and &quot;hard soul&quot; have been used synonymously with &quot;Southern soul&quot;.p. 18

==History==
===1960s–1980s===

Some soul musicians were from southern states: these included Georgia natives Otis Redding and James Brown, Rufus Thomas and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland (from Tennessee), Eddie Floyd (from Alabama), Johnnie Taylor, Al Green (from Arkansas). 

Southern soul was at its peak through the 1960s, when Memphis soul and the Muscle Shoals sound were popular. In 1963, Stan Lewis founded Jewel Records in Shreveport, Louisiana, along with two subsidiary labels, Paula and Ronn. Lewis signed soul and blues artists such as Toissaint McCall, Bobby Rush, John Lee Hooker, Charles Brown, Buster Benton, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Ted Taylor and Little Johnny Taylor. In 1966, the Shreveport-based Murco Records released &quot;Losin&#x27; Boy&quot; by Eddy Giles, which held a place on &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 for five weeks. Murco Records had soul chart success with its other artist included Reuben Bell.

Other significant contributors were Stax Records with their house band Booker T. &amp; the MGs as well as New York based Label Atlantic Records. Atlantic was Ray Charles&#x27;s home, and became an early exporter of the &quot;Muscle Shoals Sound&quot; by distributing Percy Sledge&#x27;s &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, recorded at Rick Hall&#x27;s FAME Studios. FAME becoming the studio of choice for new and experienced artists alike. Establishing the city of Muscle Shoals, Alabama as a major part of southern soul. Aretha Franklin credits FAME as the place her career turned around, and Etta James recorded hit album &quot;Tell Mama&quot; there. 

The Stax label&#x27;s most successful artist of the 1960s, Otis Redding, was influenced by fellow Georgia native Little Richard and the more cosmopolitan sounds of Mississippi-born Sam Cooke. Other Stax artists of note included Johnnie Taylor, Soul Children, the Dramatics (from Detroit), Eddie Floyd, the Staple Singers, Carla Thomas, and Isaac Hayes. Atlantic Records artists Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s records were released on the Stax label and featured the MGs. Wilson Pickett launched his solo career through his collaboration with the Stax team, and Pickett gained big hit &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; with FAME Studios musicians in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

After Sam &amp; Dave moved from Stax to Atlantic Records, Stax producer David Porter and his songwriting and production partner Isaac Hayes decided to put together a new vocal group of two men and two women. They recruited J. Blackfoot, together with Norman West, Anita Louis, and Shelbra Bennett, to form The Soul Children. Between 1968 and 1978, The Soul Children had 15 hits on the R&amp;B chart, including three that crossed over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and recorded seven albums.

Another Memphis 1960s label Goldwax Records, featured James Carr, Spencer Wiggins, and the Ovations. Al Green, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright, Don Bryant, Ann Peebles and Quiet Elegance recorded for Memphis&#x27;s 70s label Hi Records, where they were produced by Willie Mitchell. 

Also influential was the &quot;Muscle Shoals Sound&quot;, originating from Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section played on hits by many Stax artists during the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, and Atlantic Records artists Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Joe Tex and Aretha Franklin. Producer and session guitarist Chips Moman produced Bobby Womack and Womack wrote R&amp;B song &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; for Wilson Pickett. Bobby Womack gained R&amp;B hit &quot;If You Think You&#x27;re Lonely Now&quot; in 1981.

Malaco Records introduced Dorothy Moore, Bobby Bland, Johnnie Taylor, Denise Lasalle, Little Milton and others.
In 1983, former Soul Children singer J. Blackfoot saw success on soul chart with his single &quot;Taxi&quot;. In 1987, Marvin Sease gained an R&amp;B hit with &quot;Candy Licker&quot;.

===1990s–present===
After 1990, southern soul music was still recorded and performed by singers such as Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley, Peggy Scott-Adams, Trudy Lynn, Roy C, Sir Charles Jones, Barbara Carr, Willie Clayton, Bobby Rush, Denise LaSalle, Gwen McCrae, Johnnie Taylor, Omar Cunningham, and William Bell.

<doc id="1032305" wikidata="Q608289" url="?curid=1032305" title="Kadena Air Base">
<text>(IATA: DNA, ICAO: RODN) is a United States Air Force base in the towns of Kadena and Chatan and the city of Okinawa, in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It is often referred to as the &quot;Keystone of the Pacific&quot; because of its highly strategic location. It is located off the coast of China and at a distance of from Shanghai, a major Chinese economic hub. It is home to the USAF&#x27;s 18th Wing, the 353rd Special Operations Wing, reconnaissance units, 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, and a variety of associated units. Over 20,000 American servicemembers, family members, and Japanese employees live or work at Kadena Air Base. It is the largest and most active U.S. Air Force base in East Asia.

==History==
Kadena Air Base&#x27;s history dates back to just before the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945, when a local construction firm completed a small airfield named Yara Hikojo near the village of Kadena. The airfield, used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, was one of the first targets of the Tenth United States Army 7th Infantry Division. The United States seized it from the Japanese during the battle.

===World War II===

What the Americans captured was a strip of badly-damaged coral runway. &quot;The initial work at Kadena was accomplished by the 1901st Aviation Engineer Battalion 7th U.S. Infantry Division and Naval Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit CBMU 624 on 4 April&quot;, by nightfall the same day, the runway could accept emergency landings. Eight days later, and after some of coral were added, the airfield was declared operational and put into immediate service by artillery spotting aircraft. Additional construction was performed by the 807th Engineering Aviation Battalion to improve the airfield for USAAF fighter and bomber use with fuel tank farms, a new bituminous runway, and a runway for bomber aircraft, by August.

Kadena airfield was initially under the control of Seventh Air Force, however on 16 July 1945, Headquarters Eighth Air Force was transferred, without personnel, equipment, or combat elements to the town of Sakugawa, near Kadena from RAF High Wycombe England. Upon reassignment, its headquarters element absorbed the command staff of the inactivated XX Bomber Command. Kadena was used by the headquarters staff for nationalists&#x27; requirements.

Upon its reassignment to the Pacific Theater, Eighth Air Force was assigned to the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces with a mission to train new B-29 Superfortress bomber groups arriving from the United States for combat missions against Japan. In the planned invasion of Japan, the mission of Eighth Air Force would be to conduct strategic bombing raids from Okinawa. However, the atomic bombings of Japan led to the Japanese surrender before Eighth Air Force saw action in the Pacific theater.

The surrender of Japanese forces in the Ryukyu Islands came on 7 September. General Joseph Stilwell accepted the surrender in an area that would later become Kadena&#x27;s Stearley Heights housing area.

Known World War II units assigned to Kadena were:
* 319th Bombardment Group (Light) (July–November 1945) (A-26 Invader)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Seventh Air Force and flew missions to Japan and China, attacking airdromes, shipping, marshalling yards, industrial centers, and other objectives.
* 317th Troop Carrier Group (August–September 1945) (C-46 Commando, C-47 Skytrain)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Seventh Air Force in the Philippines. Deployed aircraft to Kadena and flew courier and passenger routes to Japan, Guam, Korea, and the Philippines, and transported freight and personnel in the area.
* 333d Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) (August 1945 – May 1946) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Eighth Air Force for planned invasion of Japan. Operations terminated before the group could enter combat. For a time after the war the group ferried Allied prisoners of war from Japan to the Philippines. Inactivated May 1946.
* 346th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) (August 1945 – June 1946) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Eighth Air Force for planned invasion of Japan. Operations terminated before the group could enter combat. After the war the group participated in several show-of-force missions over Japan and for a time ferried Allied prisoners of war from Okinawa to the Philippines. Inactivated June 1946.
* 316th Bombardment Wing (September 1945 – June 1948)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Eighth Air Force for planned invasion of Japan. Operations terminated before the group could enter combat. Reassigned to U.S. Far East Air Forces January 1946. Redesignated as 316th Composite Wing in January 1946, and 316th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) in May 1946. Inactivated June 1948.
* 413th Fighter Group (November 1945 – October 1946) (P-47N)&lt;br&gt;Assigned to Eighth Air Force and served as a part of the air defense and occupation force for the Ryukyu Islands after the war. Inactivated October 1946.

On 7 June 1946, Headquarters Eighth Air Force moved without personnel or equipment to MacDill AAF, Florida. It was replaced by the 1st Air Division which directed fighter reconnaissance, and bomber organizations and provided air defense for the Ryukyu Islands until December 1948.

Twentieth Air Force became the command and control organization for Kadena on 16 May 1949.

===Korean War===
The Korean War emphasized the need for maintaining a naval presence on Okinawa. On 15 February 1951, the U.S. Naval Facility, Naha, was activated and later became commissioned on 18 April. Commander Fleet Activities, Ryukyus was commissioned on 8 March 1957. On 15 May 1972, upon reversion of Okinawa to Japanese administration, the two organizations were combined to form Commander Fleet Activities, Okinawa. With the relocations of Commander Fleet Activities, Okinawa to Kadena Air Base on 7 May 1975, the title then became Commander Fleet Activities, Okinawa/US Naval Air Facility, Kadena.

Twentieth Air Force was inactivated in March 1955. Fifth Air Force became the command and control organization for Kadena. Known major postwar USAAF/USAF units assigned to Kadena have been:
* 6th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) (June 1947 – October 1948) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Participated in show-of-force flights over Japan and dropped food and other relief supplies to newly freed Allied prisoners of war. Inactivated October 1948.
* 71st Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (August 1948 – October 1948) (F-5, F-6, RF-51, RF-61)&lt;br&gt;Equipped with reconnaissance aircraft, flew aerial photographing missions over Japan and southern Korea. Inactivated October 1948. The 71st Air Base Group provided base host unit support for organizations assigned to Kadena.
* 32d Composite Wing (August 1948 – April 1949) (RB/SB-17G, C-46, RB/SB-29)&lt;br&gt;Replaced 71st Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. Provided photographic reconnaissance and search and rescue support. The 32d Air Base Group provided base host unit support for organizations assigned to Kadena.
* 6332d Air Base Group (April 1949 – January 1950) (redesignated 6332d Air Base Wing (January 1950 – May 1955), 6313th Air Base Wing (October 1957 – December 1964))&lt;br&gt;Provided base host unit support for organizations assigned to Kadena.
* 19th Bombardment Group (Medium) (July 1950 – May 1954) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Deployed from Andersen AFB, Guam. Flew combat missions over Korea. Reassigned May 1954 to Pinecastle AFB, Florida.
* 22d Bombardment Group (Medium) (July 1950 – October 1950) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Deployed from March AFB, California. Flew combat missions over Korea
* 307th Bombardment Group (Medium) (September 1950 – February 1951) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;Deployed from MacDill AFB Florida to engage in combat operations during the Korean War. While on Okinawa, the 307th was awarded the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for its air strikes against enemy forces in Korea. It was also awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation and several campaign streamers. The 307th BG returned from deployment during February 1951, however elements of the group remained deployed on Okinawa on a semi-permanent basis until 1954.
* 581st Air Resupply Group (September 1953 – September 1956) (B-29)&lt;br&gt;reassigned from the inactivating 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing at Clark AB, Philippines. Performed unconventional warfare and counterinsurgency psychological operations. Inactivated and mission transferred to U.S. Navy.

At the end of the Eisenhower presidency, around 1,700 nuclear weapons were deployed on shore in the Pacific, 800 of which were at Kadena Air Base.

=== 18th Wing ===
On 1 November 1954, the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing arrived from Osan Air Base, South Korea. Under changing designations, the wing has been the main USAF flying force at Kadena for over 50 years. The wing has maintained assigned aircraft, crews, and supporting personnel in readiness to respond to orders from Fifth Air Force and Pacific Air Forces. The wing initially was flying three squadrons of North American F-86 Sabre: the 12th, 44th and 67th Fighter Squadrons. The wing flew tactical fighter sorties from Okinawa, and made frequent deployments to South Korea, Japan, Formosa, and the Philippines. In 1957, the wing upgraded to the F-100 Super Sabre and the designation was changed to the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing. In 1960, a tactical reconnaissance mission was added to the wing with the arrival of the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo and the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron.

====Vietnam War era====
Beginning in 1961, the 18th TFW was sending its tactical squadrons frequently to South Vietnam and Thailand, initially with its RF-101 reconnaissance jets, and beginning in 1964 with its tactical fighter forces supporting USAF combat missions in the Vietnam War. In 1963, the F-105 Thunderchief replaced the Super Sabres. During the Temporary duty assignment (TDY) deployments to Southeast Asia, the 12th TFS lost four aircraft, the 44th TFS lost one F-105D, and the 67th TFS lost nine aircraft, including three on the first day of Operation Rolling Thunder. The deployments to Southeast Asia continued until the end of United States involvement in the conflict.

The RF-4C Phantom II replaced the RF-101 in the reconnaissance role in 1967. An electronic warfare capability was added to the wing in late 1968 with the attachment of the 19th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron from Shaw AFB South Carolina flying the EB-66 Destroyer. The B-66s remained until 1970, flying daily over the skies of Southeast Asia.

During the 1968 Pueblo crisis, the 18th deployed between January and June to Osan AB, South Korea following the North Korean seizure of the vessel. Frequent deployments to South Korea have been performed ever since to maintain the air defense alert mission there.

In 1972, the 1st Special Operations Squadron was assigned, bringing their specialized C/MC-130 Hercules aircraft to the wing. The squadron was reassigned in 1978. The reconnaissance mission ended in 1989 with the retirement of the RF-4Cs, and the inactivation of the 15th TRS.

====Post-Vietnam====
The F/RF-4C Phantom II replaced the F-105s in 1971, and a further upgrade to the F-15 Eagle was made in 1979.

On 6 November 1972, the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing dispatched the McDonnell Douglas F-4C / D Phantom II fighter jets of the 44th Tactical Fighter Squadron and the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron to the Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan until 31 May 1975. Assist Taiwan ’s air defense against threats from China.

The designation of the wing changed on 1 October 1991 to the 18th Wing with the implementation of the Objective Wing concept. With the objective wing, the mission of the 18th expanded to the Composite Air Wing concept of multiple different wing missions with different aircraft. The mission of the 18th was expanded to include aerial refueling with KC-135 Stratotanker tanker aircraft; and surveillance, warning, command and control E-3 Sentry, and communications. Added airlift mission in June 1992 with the C-12 Huron, transporting mission critical personnel, high-priority cargo and distinguished visitors. In February 1993, the 18th Wing gained responsibility for coordinating rescue operations in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean.

==== Arrival of Patriot unit ====
In November 2006, the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, a Patriot PAC-III unit, deployed to Kadena from Fort Bliss Texas. Originally assigned to 31st ADA Brigade of Fort Bliss, they were reassigned to the 94th AAMDC, USINDOPACOM. The move was part of the BRAC consolidation of U.S. Army bases and security agreements between the U.S. and Japan. The battalion&#x27;s mission is to defend the base against tactical ballistic missiles from North Korea. The deployment was controversial on Okinawa, being greeted with protests.

==== Potential F-15EX deployment ====
In late 2023, &quot;Nikkei Asia&quot; reported that the US Air Force would permanently station Boeing F-15EX Eagle II jets at Kadena Air Base. That total would be down from the 48 F-15C Eagle jets which were previously permanently stationed there.

=== Foreign units ===
Other U.S. allies who had expressed intention with the approval of both the Japanese government and the United States Air Force to host units in the air base to further impose united cooperation against regional threats; North Korea, Russian Siberia, Russian Far East and the growing influence of China in the Asia Pacific.

==== Australia and New Zealand ====

In early September 2018, Australian Defence Minister Christopher Pyne and New Zealand&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters stated that it was in their interest to aid both Japan and the United States against North Korea with patrol aircraft. These units would provide additional capability to prevent North Korean vessels conducting illegal trading out at sea in violation of UN sanctions. The Royal Australian Air Force deployed two AP-3C aircraft, along with a P-3K2 Orion from the RNZAF. RAAF P-8 Poseidons have subsequently been periodically deployed to Kadena as part of Operation Argos. RNZAF Orions also periodically operate from Kadena, with four such deployments having been made as of April 2021.

===Other units===
Other major units assigned to Kadena since 1954 have been:
* 313th Air Division (March 1955 – October 1991)&lt;br&gt;Assumed responsibility for air defense of the Ryukyu Islands and tactical operations in the Far East, maintaining assigned forces at the highest possible degree of combat readiness. In addition, it supported Fifth Air Force in the development, planning, and coordination of requirements for future Air Force operations in the Ryukyu Islands. The division also supported numerous exercises such as Cope Thunder, Cope Diamond, Team Spirit and Cope North. Provided base host unit support for organizations assigned to Kadena (May 1955 – October 1957, December 1964 – October 1974). The newly-considated 18th Wing replaced the 313th Air Division in 1991.
* Kadena Task Force (Provisional) (SAC) (May 1955 – May 1958) (RB/ERB-47H)&lt;br&gt;Performed Electronic Reconnaissance and Countermeasures activities.
* 498th Tactical Missile Group (February 1961 – October 1969) (TM-76B/CGM-13B)&lt;br&gt;Equipped with the TM-76B, renumbered in 1963 to CGM-13B Mace guided cruise missile, four hard site launch sites.
* 4252d Strategic Wing (SAC) (January 1965 – April 1970)&lt;br&gt;376th Strategic Wing (SAC) (April 1970 – August 1973) (B-52, KC-135, EC-135)&lt;br&gt;Activated by SAC at Kadena. Replaced 4252nd Strategic Wing. Conducted B-52 combat operations in Southeast Asia from January 1965 to September 1970, when Arc Light Missions from the base were terminated. The distance to targets in South Vietnam resulted in reduced payload and greater air-refueling demands for Kadena and Guam based B-52s and from April 1967 the USAF began basing B-52s at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, this together with Japanese opposition to the war led to reducing B-52 operations from Kadena. Conducted KC-135 air refueling and RC-135 electronic reconnaissance from April 1970 to 1991. Conducted airborne radio relay operations, April–November 1970, February–June 1971 and March 1972 – August 1973. Until 1991, the wing controlled the 909th Air Refueling Squadron (KC-135A/Q/R) and supported rotational reconnaissance aircraft (TR-1, SR-71) after the inactivation of the 9th SRW in 1974. The Wing was inactivated at Kadena on 30 October 1991 with the drawdown of strategic forces. Its mission was absorbed by the 18th Wing.
* 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (SAC) (1968–1974) (A-12, SR-71)&lt;br&gt;Deployed from Beale Air Force Base, California, Performed strategic reconnaissance over North Vietnam and Laos. In March 1968 SR-71&#x27;s began arriving at Kadena from Beale AFB. On 15 March Det OL-8 was declared Operational Ready for SR-71 sorties. The SR-71s averaged approximately one sortie a week for nearly two years. By 1970, the SR-71s were averaging two sorties per week. By 1972, the SR-71 was flying nearly one sortie every day. While deployed on Okinawa, the SR-71s and their aircrew members gained the nickname Habu (as did the A-12s preceding them) after a southeast Asian pit viper which the Okinawans thought the plane resembled. With the completion of each mission a &quot;Habu&quot; was painted on the bird. The SR 71 mission on Okinawa ended in 1990.
* 18th Combat Support Wing (1985–1991)&lt;br&gt;The 18 CSW was originally the 18th Combat Support Group of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing before being elevated to a Wing in 1985. It acted as the installation management command and controlled all the services required to run the installation. With the consolidation of numerous missions into the 18th Wing in 1991, the 18 CSW was downgraded and redesignated the 18th Support Group. It was redesignated again as the 18th Mission Support Group in 2002.

==Environmental concerns==
In June 2013, the government of Japan discovered 22 barrels buried on former base property that tests showed had previously contained dioxins and herbicides. Tests on the surrounding soils found dioxin levels at 8.4 times and groundwater at 280 times the legal limit. The land in question is a soccer field bordering the base&#x27;s Bob Hope Primary School and Amelia Earhart Intermediate School. Angry parents accused base officials, under base commanders Brigadier General Matt H. Molloy and Brigadier General James B. Hecker, of failing to notify them of the toxins near the school and not investigating into the matter. After the issue was reported in the &quot;Japan Times&quot; and &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, USAF officials tested the soil and water at the schools and said that no excessive toxic substances were found.

Soil on the base tested positive for very high levels of polychlorinated biphenylchemicals (PCBs), in the thousands of parts per million, much higher than most other contamination sites in the world, according to a report issued in 1987 after an investigation prompted by a small unrelated spill of transformer oil.

==Accidents and incidents==
*30 June 1959: an F-100 from the wing crashed on Okinawa during a training flight after suffering an engine fire. The pilot successfully ejected and suffered no harm, but the aircraft crashed into a local elementary school, killing 11 students plus six residents of the nearby neighborhood, and injuring 210.
*19 November 1968: B-52 of the 4252d Strategic Wing broke up and caught fire after the aircraft aborted takeoff on an Arc Light bombing mission to South Vietnam. 2 crewmen died of their injuries.
*20 July 1972: SR-71 &quot;61-7978&quot; ran off the runway on its second landing approach due to high crosswinds ahead of Typhoon Rita, severely damaging the underside of the plane. Both crewmembers were uninjured. The plane was salvaged for usable parts and the rest scrapped in Okinawa.
*2 November 1987: RF-4C 66-0416 (15 TRS / 18 TFW) entered a spin at 16,500 feet in a Whiskey area approximately 95 miles Northeast of Kadena. Both crew members ejected. One crewmember’s body was never recovered. The other crew member survived.
*28 May 2013: F-15C of the 44th Fighter Squadron crashed into the ocean off Okinawa. The pilot ejected and was rescued by the Air Rescue Wing Naha Detachment of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.
*11 June 2018: F-15C from the 44th Fighter Squadron crashed into the sea off Okinawa. The pilot was rescued by the JASDF Air Rescue Wing Naha Detachment.

<text>Whitefish Point is a cape of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, United States, marking the entry point of Whitefish Bay. It is north of the unincorporated community of Paradise, Michigan.

Whitefish Point is known for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, its Lake Superior shoreline, the Whitefish Point Lighthouse and as a prime birding area. Whitefish Point is a designated Important Bird Area. The Whitefish Point Bird Observatory, an affiliate of the Michigan Audubon Society, operates a research and education facility at Whitefish Point.

At 17 miles away, Whitefish Point is the nearest navigation mark to the wreckage of the ore freighter SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, which sank in 1975. Whitefish Point remains one of the most dangerous shipping areas in the Great Lakes, Known as the graveyard of the Great Lakes, more vessels have been lost in the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior.

The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve protects the shipwrecks in a portion of the bay for future generations of sports divers.

The Point is a popular place for rock collectors, ship watchers, and bird watching. Whitefish Point&#x27;s land and water provides a natural corridor for birds that makes it a migratory route of world significance. It is a designated Important Bird Area where the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory conducts important research.

Whitefish Point is the home of a former United States Coast Guard station.

It was released on the album Itku Pitkästä Ilosta and as a single. The song tells about an unspecified man who lives in Finland and has married a woman in Estonia. The woman refuses to move to Finland with his husband and the man doesn&#x27;t like Estonia. The man realizes he will never meet his wife and hangs himself near the end of the song (&quot;The roof is too low and the rope is too thick&quot;)

<text>Suzanne Danielle, Morris (born 14 January 1957) is an English former film and television actress.

==Early life==
Danielle was born Suzanne Morris in 1957, before changing her surname.
She trained as a dancer at the Bush Davies School of Theatre Arts in her home town of Romford in Essex, and also attended Bedfords Park Community School in Straight Road, Harold Hill. At the age of 16, she appeared in the West End musical &quot;Billy&quot; (1974), starring Michael Crawford. As a result of that she was invited to appear as a dancer on a Bruce Forsyth show called &quot;Bruce and More Girls&quot;. An admirer of Cyd Charisse, after leaving school Danielle joined a dance group called &quot;The Younger Generation&quot;.

==Screen career==
Danielle&#x27;s first screen role as an actress was as &quot;Pretty Girl&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Professionals&quot; (&quot;Killer with a Long Arm&quot;), broadcast in January 1978. Her first film role was in &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978), but her first credited part, in the same year, was in &quot;Carry On Emmannuelle&quot;, the last film in the original &quot;Carry On...&quot; series. One reviewer commented &quot;Many of the stalwarts are featured but, apart from Kenneth Williams, they are reduced to support for the eponymous heroine in the athletic and long-legged person of Suzanne Danielle&quot;. Also that year she filmed &quot;The Golden Lady&quot;, playing a leading part alongside Ina Skriver; the movie was released in 1979. In &quot;Arabian Adventure&quot; (also 1979) she plays a dancer and does a belly dance for Christopher Lee&#x27;s Caliph. Her last film was &quot;The Trouble with Spies&quot; (1987, but filmed in 1984), in which she played opposite Donald Sutherland and Michael Hordern.

==Television==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Danielle was reported to have &quot;the monopoly on attractive, promiscuous good-time girls&quot;. She was a regular face on British television between 1979 and 1983. She was a team member on the TV game show &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; and appeared in many other light entertainment shows, including the Christmas 1984 edition of &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. As an actress, she appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (in the story &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;), &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot;, &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; and became a frequent contributor to the Mike Yarwood series on ITV during the early 1980s, portraying Diana, Princess of Wales, opposite Yarwood&#x27;s impersonation of Prince Charles.

==Theatre==
She took to the theatre in 1980, in a touring production of John Murray&#x27;s two-person comedy &quot;The Monkey Walk&quot;, opposite Patrick Mower. This travelled as far afield as Singapore and New Zealand.

In 1983, she starred in an exercise instruction album on vinyl and cassette, in the &quot;Shape Up and Dance&quot; series.

In 1985, Danielle played the lead in a Christmas pantomime of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at Richmond, Surrey, supported by Jimmy Edwards, Kenneth Connor and Joan Sims.

==Personal life==
Danielle was in a relationship with the actor Patrick Mower for seven years. In 1986, she met golfer Sam Torrance, who proposed to her in 1987 on a Concorde flight on the way to play in the Ryder Cup in Columbus, Ohio, US. They were married on 14 February 1995 at Skibo Castle. They have four children.

<doc id="1032325" wikidata="Q459104" url="?curid=1032325" title="Sabiha Gökçen">
<text>Sabiha Gökçen (; 22 March 1913 – 22 March 2001) was a Turkish aviator. During her flight career, she flew around 8,000 hours and participated in 32 different military operations. She became the world&#x27;s first female fighter pilot, at age 23. As an orphan, she was one of the nine children adopted by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. 

She is recognized as the first female combat pilot by &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; and was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of &quot;The 20 Greatest Aviators in History&quot; published by the United States Air Force in 1996. 

Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, the second airport in Istanbul, is named after her.

== Early life ==
According to official Turkish sources and interviews with Sabiha Gökçen, she was the daughter of Mustafa Izzet Bey and Hayriye Hanım, both of whom were of Bosniak ancestry. During Atatürk&#x27;s visit to Bursa in 1925, Sabiha, who was only twelve years old, asked for permission to talk with Atatürk and expressed her wish to study at a boarding school. After hearing her story and about her miserable living conditions, Atatürk decided to adopt her and asked her brother for permission to take her to the Çankaya Presidential Residence in Ankara, where Sabiha would live with Atatürk&#x27;s other adoptive daughters, Zehra, Afet and Rukiye. Gökçen attended the Çankaya Primary School in Ankara and the Üsküdar American Academy in Istanbul.

After the introduction of the Surname Law, Atatürk gave her the family name Gökçen on 19 December 1934. &#x27;Gök&#x27; means sky in Turkish and Gökçen means &#x27;belonging or relating to the sky&#x27;. However, she was not an aviator at that time, and it was only six months later that Sabiha developed a passion for flying.

==Career==

Atatürk attached great importance to aviation and for that purpose oversaw the foundation of the Turkish Aeronautical Association in 1925. He took Sabiha along with him to the opening ceremony of &quot;Türkkuşu&quot; (&quot;Turkish Bird&quot;) &quot;Flight School&quot; on 5 May 1935. During the airshow of gliders and parachutists invited from foreign countries, she got very excited. As Atatürk asked her whether she would also want to become a skydiver, she nodded, &quot;yes indeed, I am ready right now&quot;. Atatürk instructed Fuat Bulca, the head of the school, to enroll her as the first female trainee. She was meant to become a skydiver, but she was much more interested in flying, so she earned her pilot&#x27;s licence. Gökçen, together with seven male students, was sent to Crimea, Soviet Union for an advanced course in glider and powered aircraft piloting. However, when she was in Moscow, she learned the news that her sister Zehra had died, and with collapsed morale, she immediately returned to Turkey, isolating herself from social activities for some time.

After a while, at Atatürk&#x27;s insistence, Gökçen began working again. At Eskişehir Aviation School, she received special flight training from Savmi Uçan and Muhittin Bey. She began flying a motorized aircraft for the first time on February 25, 1936.

Gökçen, due to the success in flight training, Ataturk himself said: &quot;You&#x27;ve made me very happy ... Now I can explain what I have planned for you ... Perhaps you&#x27;ll be the first woman military pilot in the world ... For the world&#x27;s first military woman pilot to be of Turkish descent would be a proud event, you can imagine, right? Now I will act immediately and send you to Tayyare School in Eskişehir. You will receive a special education there&quot;&quot;.&quot;

As girls were not being accepted by the Turkish War Academies in those years, Gökçen was provided, on Atatürk&#x27;s orders, with a personalized uniform, and attended a special education programme of eleven months at the &quot;Tayyare Mektebi&quot; (Aviation School) in Eskişehir in the academic year 1936-1937. After receiving her flight patents (diploma) she trained to become a war pilot at the 1st Airplane Regiment in Eskişehir for six months.

She improved her skills by flying bomber and fighter planes at the 1st Aircraft Regiment in Eskişehir Airbase and gained experience after participating in the Aegean and Thrace exercises in 1937. In that same year, she took part in military operations during the Dersim rebellion and became the first Turkish female air force combat pilot. Turkish planes flew numerous sorties against the rebels during the rebellion. A report of the General Staff mentioned the &quot;serious damage&quot; that had been caused by her 50 kg bomb upon a group of rebels. Nuri Dersimi claimed that the Turkish air force bombed the district with poisonous gas in 1938. In an interview she gave to Halit Kıvanç in 1956, Sabiha Gökçen stated: &quot;They gave us the order &#x27;Shoot every living thing you see&#x27;, we were firebombing even the goats which were the food of the rebels&quot;. She was awarded with a commendation for her actions during the operation. She was also awarded the Turkish Aeronautical Association&#x27;s first &quot;&quot;Murassa&quot; (Jeweled) Medal&quot; for her superior performance in this operation.

In 1938, she carried out a five-day flight around the Balkan countries to great acclaim. In the same year, she was appointed chief trainer of the Türkkuşu Flight School of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, where she served until 1954 as a flight instructor and became a member of the association&#x27;s executive board. She trained four female aviators: Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman, Sahavet Karapas and Nezihe Viranyalı. Gökçen flew around the world for a period of 28 years until 1964. Her book entitled &quot;A Life Along the Path of Atatürk&quot; was published in 1981 by the Turkish Aeronautical Association to commemorate Atatürk&#x27;s 100th birthday.

== Controversies ==
The question of Gökçen&#x27;s ethnic origin made headlines and sparked controversy in 2004, when Hrant Dink, Turkish-Armenian journalist, published an interview with a person identifying as Gökçen&#x27;s niece that claimed that Gökçen was of Armenian origin. Many contested the matter, including her adopted sister, Ülkü Adatepe, who stated that Gökçen was of Bosniak ancestry. The notion that Gökçen could have been Armenian caused controversy in the country; the Turkish General Staff released a statement saying that the debate &quot;mocked national values&quot; and was &quot;not conducive to social peace&quot;. Hrant Dink, the journalist who wrote the article, came under criticism, most notably from newspaper columnists and Turkish nationalist groups. A leaked US consul dispatch penned by an official from the consulate in Istanbul observed that the entire affair &quot;exposed an ugly streak of racism in Turkish society.&quot; It is also believed that the affair was one of the reasons that led to Hrant Dink&#x27;s assassination in Istanbul in January 2007.

== Death and legacy ==
Gökçen died of heart failure at Gülhane Military Medical Academy on 22 March 2001, her 88th birthday. 

Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in Istanbul is named after her. It opened on 8 January 2001, 2 months before her death.

She is recognized as the first female combat pilot by the Guinness Book of World Records.

She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of &quot;The 20 Greatest Aviators in History&quot; published by the United States Air Force in 1996.

That year, she was also honored at the Air Command and Staff College&#x27;s Gathering of Eagles at Maxwell Air Force Base. The program encourages the study of aviation history by emphasizing the contributions of aviation pioneers.

She was the subject of a Google Doodle honouring her birthday, which was displayed in Turkey on 22 March 2009.

<doc id="1032327" wikidata="Q189749" url="?curid=1032327" title="Ayerbe">
<text>:&quot;Ayerbe is also the name of a village in the Broto municipality.&quot;
Ayerbe is a town in the Hoya de Huesca comarca, in the autonomous community of Aragon in Spain.

==Geography==
Ayerbe is located 28 km from Huesca on highway A 132 in the direction of Pamplona, on the Gállego river. It is bounded by Riglos crags and the Santo Domingo range of hills to the north; to the east by the villages of Loarre and Loscorrales; to the south by the villages of Lupiñén-Ortilla, and to the west by the villages of Biscarrues and Murillo de Gállego. It is located at , with a height above sea level of Alicante of 582 m. and an area of 63.29 square kilometres. It is located in an excavated erosive depression in the surface of the Tertiary period.

The soil is dry, loose and stony, generally level with a sprinkling of small isolated hills. The land is largely covered by pines, olive and almond trees, with vineyards making a comeback. There are also areas of cereal production to the east and south. It is also populated by evergreen oaks, rosemary, gorse and other shrubs in addition to grass. There are occasional occurrences of rabbits, hares and partridges.

The area is particularly attractive to bird watchers, who come to see the lammergeier, griffon vulture and Egyptian vultures, as well as a wide variety of birds of prey. Hunters find plenty of wild boars and deer, as well as partridge and quail.

The hill range behind Ayerbe is part of the Pre-Pyrenees and reaches over 1,600 m, although the town itself is actually on the plain at the foot of the range, which eventually leads down to the River Ebro, around 100 km away.

==Points of interest==


The town center features two rectangular squares either side of the 16th-century palace of the Marquesses de Ayerbe or palace of the Marquesses of Urriez (declared a historical monument in 1931), and in general it is the collection of domestic architecture and other architecturally distinguished buildings that make Ayerbe particularly worth visiting.

Ayerbe&#x27;s main claim to fame is that Santiago Ramón y Cajal, winner of the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, lived here for ten years. The town promotes his memory with a museum and visitor centre; Ayerbe library holds a collection of Cajal-related books with more than 250 works and documents for public use.

Ayerbe has a public library, casino, bars, municipal swimming pool and, around the town, a network of footpaths, fields and highways for walkers and cyclists. There are several restaurants, a hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation, as well as tourist information center in the summer months in one of the town squares. Other attractions include Fontaneta park (at ) and the &quot;La Fuente de los Tres Caños&quot; fountain.

The hill directly behind the town is the location of a now renovated chapel at one end and a Moorish castle (in ruins) at the other. These can be reached on foot or by all-terrain vehicle and provide excellent views of the surrounding countryside (even to the Pyrenees).

The town is known by many in the region for its &quot;Tortas de Ayerbe&quot;, which are sweet flat, round pastries, usually flavoured with aniseed. Visitors can also purchase locally produced wine, olive oil and honey.

==Fiestas and celebrations==
The Fiesta of Santa Leticia takes place around September 9 and lasts for four to six days. A sculpture of the Saint is carried in procession, its pedestal garlanded with grapes; figures of giants and &quot;cabezudos&quot; parade in the streets and pyrotechnic figures of bulls race through the town every night.

In 2005 the 6th meeting of the Giants of Aragon took place in the town, bringing together 72 giant figures from all over Aragon: 32 bands, 166 musicians and 140 figure-carriers took part.

&quot;The week of the mushrooms&quot; has been celebrated in the town for years in the month of October and constitutes a social event on an international level.

<text>Midsomer Norton is a town near the Mendip Hills in Bath and North East Somerset, England, south-west of Bath, north-east of Wells, north-west of Frome, west of Trowbridge and south-east of Bristol. It has a population of around 13,000. Along with Radstock and Westfield it used to be part of the conurbation and large civil parish of Norton Radstock, but is now a town council in its own right. It is also part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset.

Midsomer Norton is characterised by the River Somer which runs the length of the town centre. The river itself was regenerated with new plant life during the summer of 2012 in a bid to improve the aesthetics of the town centre. The Town has a long history which can be seen through a number of early churches which remain, but really started to grow and become a transport hub with the development of the Somerset coalfield. For many years the coalmines provided employment for local men until they ceased operations in the 1960s, around the same time that the town&#x27;s two railway stations also closed. Afterwards, good employment opportunities still remained for the town with elements of the print industry. Some of these plants have also now begun to close, but overall employment levels in the area remain very high.

Midsomer Norton provides shopping and service industries for the surrounding areas and supports several music venues and bands. The town has four primary schools and two large secondary schools. Midsomer Norton is home to a leisure centre, several sports clubs and provides youth opportunities such as Scouts and Guides. It has been the birthplace or home to several notable people.

==History==
===Name===
&quot;Norton&quot; means &#x27;northish enclosure&#x27; from the Old English, while the use of its forename to distinguish it from other &#x27;Nortons&#x27; is of late origin and not mentioned until 1334. Sources point to the town being situated midway between two branches of the River Somer; the Somer itself and Wellow Brook, which joins the Somer a short distance to the east near Radstock.

The spelling &quot;Missomerys Norton&quot; may be a variation.

Eilert Ekwall wrote that the village &quot;is said to be so called in allusion to the festival held at midsummer on the day of St. John, the patron saint.&quot;

John Wesley wrote of the appalling local road conditions which ensured it was reachable &quot;only in midsummer.&quot; As Simon Winchester notes in his book &quot;The Map that Changed the World&quot;, &quot;...the roads on this part of Somerset were atrocious, thick with mud and as rough as the surface of the moon&quot;.

====&#x27;Norton Canonicorum&#x27; and the priory====
In some church records the town is referred to as &#x27;Norton Canonicorum&#x27; as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and this may be because of the local Priory&#x27;s link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538.

===Prehistory===

The area at what is now Langley’s Lane in Midsomer Norton was an important and rare area of Mesolithic activity focused around an
active tufa spring.

===Roman===

The Fosse Way runs through the south-western edge of the town between Westfield, Somerset and Stratton-on-the-Fosse.

===Middle Ages===
The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton.

Following the Norman Conquest William the Conqueror gave large parts of north Somerset, including the manor of Norton to Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, and Norton was held under him by Ulveva. From about 1150 until 1300 the manor was held by de Lincoln. From 1387 the manor was held by the family of Thomas West, 1st Baron West and his descendants.

===18th and 19th century: mining and landmarks===
The Duchy of Cornwall owned most of the mineral rights around Midsomer Norton and various small pits opened around 1750 to exploit these. Coal mining in the Somerset coalfield gave the town and area its impetus as an industrial centre.

Around 1866 an obelisk Crimean War monument with two marble plaques, was built at the site of St Chad&#x27;s well, by the mother of Frederick Stukeley Savage for the benefit of the poor. The obelisk was in the grounds of Norton House, a Georgian mansion built by Thomas Savage, an investor in coalmines in the area, in 1789. The house itself has since been demolished but other features of its estate are still visible at Silver Street Nature reserve (see below).

==Governance==
There are two electoral wards in the town from which Midsomer Norton elects its own Town Council with an elected Mayor. It is part of the Frome and East Somerset constituency, which elects a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The Palladian council offices were built in the mid to late 18th century. Midsomer Norton Town Hall was commissioned by a local brewer, Thomas Harris Smith, designed in the Italianate style and completed in 1860.

==Geography==
The main geological feature in this area of the Mendip Hills south of Hallatrow consists of Supra-Pennant Measures which includes the upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone. The relics of the industrial past are very evident within the area, including the distinct conical shape of the Old Mills batch overlooking the town.
Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer which rises to the west of Chilcompton and on the Wellow Brook which rises near the village of Ston Easton. The town therefore occupies two valleys of the Mendip Hills and these merge west of Radstock. The combined river then flows east reaching the River Avon near Midford, thence to Bath and through Bristol into the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth.

On the southern fringes of the town is the Silver Street Local Nature Reserve, on the site of the estate of Norton House, an eighteenth century mansion built by the coalmine-owning Savage family but demolished in 1937-8. It contains a broad-leaf woodland around several ponds, a restored nineteenth-century wellhead that supplied water to the house, and a grassland field. The woodland is leased to the Somerset and Dorset Heritage Railway Trust by Bath and North East Somerset Council and the meadow in the stewardship of Somervale School.

Along with the rest of South West England, the Midsomer Norton has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea, restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.

==Midsomer Norton flood alleviation scheme==
For many years, the centre of Midsomer Norton was prone to flooding. Sometimes several times a year, the Somer rose up during prolonged rainfall and flooded shops, particularly where the high street is at its lowest point in the middle between Martin&#x27;s newsagent and the former Palladium cinema.

To prevent future deluges, a major flood alleviation tunnel — completed in 1977 – was constructed beneath the high street to remove excess water when the town centre was threatened with flooding. The infrastructure comprises a sluice gate situated at the top of the high street near Somervale School through which the water is carried under the town via a pre-cast concrete culvert several metres in diameter to an outlet further downstream at Rackvernal. Since it began operation, no flooding has occurred to the high street and an Environment Agency report confirms that the relief scheme remains in good condition and continues to serve to its 100-year standard.

Despite the success of the scheme, some outlying areas of the town are now rated at increased risk of flooding from Wellow Brook due to climate change and the increased provision of housing in the vicinity. In 2008 a new monitoring station was installed at nearby Welton through which data on water pressure and flood levels can be collected via metal tubes placed in the river linked to a telemetry box. This facility is now providing the Environment Agency with extremely useful information for use in future assessments of flood risk.

==Industry and commerce==
For hundreds of years mining was an important industry for the area, and there were a number of mines in Midsomer Norton,  e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;D) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.

The last pit in the town, at Norton Hill, closed in 1966. Despite modernisation in the early 1960s, this final pit lapsed into unprofitability due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages.

One of the town&#x27;s best known businesses was Prattens, manufacturer of prefabricated buildings, founded in 1912. It was acquired by Beazer in 1980 and its factory in Charlton Road was demolished in the 1990s.

Midsomer Norton traditionally hosted other industries and became a major manufacturing centre for printing and packaging. Some 2,000 people (27% of total employment) work in this industry locally. Following the decline of mining, these companies expanded on local trading estates and in Welton. The sites of the disused collieries in the area have subsequently been developed for light industry.

In recent years some large local firms have closed or relocated blaming poor transport links. Packaging company, Alcan Mardon closed in 2006, although its social club remains. Polestar Purnell, based in nearby Paulton also closed the same year with the loss of 400 jobs. In August 2011, the town&#x27;s largest remaining employer, Welton, Bibby &amp; Baron, the largest producer of recyclable paper bags in Europe, announced the closure of its site in Welton, which it occupied for 150 years. The company, known locally as ‘Welton Bag’ planned to move to larger premises at Westbury in Wiltshire, but promised to transfer all 400 jobs to the new site.

The business parks remain busy however, and the town and environs has its share of national trading companies including supermarkets and retail outlets. The town&#x27;s High Street has free parking. Many inhabitants commute to Bath and Bristol for employment and shopping.

Dial-a-Ride services for the elderly and handicapped are well used, along with the local Community minibus set up by the local Rotary Club in 1967 under Midsomer Norton &amp; Radstock Community Service Vehicle Trust. This vehicle is for use primarily by organisations in the area serving the disabled and infirm.

==The railways==
The town was previously served by a station on the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S&amp;D) but this closed in 1966, and by a second station on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway at Welton in the valley. The railways were separate, the S&amp;D being administered by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway companies (later the London Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway) and the North Somerset being run by and then owned by the Great Western Railway. The stations were both called &quot;Midsomer Norton and Welton&quot; (the B&amp;NSR station was originally called just &quot;Welton&quot;); under British Railways, the S&amp;D station was renamed as Midsomer Norton South after a short period as Midsomer Norton Upper; and is currently being restored with occasional open weekends with engines in steam. The Somerset &amp; Dorset Railway Heritage Trust operates steam trains for a mile up to Chilcompton Tunnel. Today the nearest operating railway stations are at Frome (10.5 miles away) and Bath Spa (11 miles), the latter of which is the most easily accessible via regular direct bus routes.

==Culture==
Midsomer Norton&#x27;s railway station was mentioned in &quot;Slow Train&quot; by Michael Flanders and Donald Swann:

Children&#x27;s author Roald Dahl sold kerosene in Midsomer Norton and the surrounding area in the 1930s. He described the experience in his autobiographical work &quot;&quot; (published 1984):

The Waugh family connection with Midsomer Norton began when Dr Alexander Waugh, father of Arthur Waugh and grandfather of Evelyn Waugh and Alec Waugh, moved in 1865 to Island House, which had been built in the early eighteenth century, in The Island in the centre of the town. The family later moved to a house in Silver Street. As a boy, Evelyn Waugh spent his summer holidays in Midsomer Norton with his maiden aunts. He later described his visits there: &quot;I suppose that in fact I never spent longer than two months there in any year, but the place captivated my imagination as my true home never did.&quot;

The &quot;Palladium&quot; cinema was opened as the &quot;Empire&quot; in 1913 in a building which had previously been a brewery. It closed in 1993 and various attempts were made to turn it into a club and shop, before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission to convert it to a pub, which opened in September 2018 with the name of the Palladium Electric in reference to one of the cinema&#x27;s former names. The town was left without cinema for almost two decades. Cinema was brought back to the town under the &quot;Palladium&quot; name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall. In 2013, permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and an upgrade in 2018 saw new release cinema return to the town for the first time in 25 years.

The town is commemorated in &quot;The Sheriff of Midsomer Norton&quot;, by Somerset band The Wurzels. Midsomer Norton hosts the only unofficial carnival on the West Country Carnival circuit. Originally, floats travelled through the main High Street but road improvements put paid to the larger vehicles and for many years the procession was held on the main Fosseway through Westfield. Since 2014 however, the carnival has returned to the High Street following changes made to the traffic layout.

The town&#x27;s free newspaper is the &quot;Midsomer Norton, Radstock &amp; District Journal&quot;. The other local weekly paper is the &quot;Somerset Guardian&quot;, which is part of the Daily Mail and General Trust. The monthly magazine, the &quot;Mendip Times&quot;, also includes local features.

Somer Valley FM (97.5FM and online) is the Community Radio for the district. There is also a community website called Midsomer Norton People where residents can discuss local issues.

In 2016 the town&#x27;s first LGBT Pride celebration event was held at The Wunderbar, which had previously been host to comedians Matt Lucas and Ed Byrne. The event was held again in 2017.

===Music scene===

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the alternative live music and DJ scene in Midsomer Norton flourished with the help of venues such as The Stones Cross and The Wunderbar, which promoted unsigned bands for over 25 years.

On the first Friday of every month the Paradis Palm Court Trio perform free classical concerts in the Town Hall. Choir concerts (male voices in particular) command a local following and the Lions club is a promoter of such attractions usually held in the Methodist or Parish churches.

There are a number of local brass bands. In 2006 Midsomer Norton hosted the European Open Marching and Show Band Championship which saw many bands from all over Europe visit the town.

===&quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;===
Anthony Horowitz, the original writer of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, borrowed part of the name of the town when he adapted Caroline Graham&#x27;s Chief Inspector Barnaby series for television in 1997. Although no filming of the show has ever taken place in Midsomer Norton or the surrounding parishes, some names of other nearby locations have been used by the producers in creating their fictional county of Midsomer, including &quot;Midsomer Wellow&quot; (Wellow), &quot;Midsomer Magna&quot; (Chew Magna), &quot;Midsomer Morton&quot; and the main settlement of &quot;Causton&quot; (Corston). Despite some occasional confusion, there is no other link between Midsomer Norton and the television series.

==Religious sites and communities==
The Old Priory, which was a hotel and restaurant, dates from the early to mid 17th century. Another old building is the Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost, which is a 15th-century tithe barn converted by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. It is a grade II* listed building. For many years, the local Catholic community were served by Benedictine monks from the now defunct Downside Abbey, formerly under the Diocese of Clifton.

The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist has a tower dating from the 15th century, although the upper stages are from the 17th century, but the rest was rebuilt in Gothic Revival style by John Pinch the younger in 1830–1831 and was extended in the 20th century with new chancel and lady chapel. It is a grade II* listed building. The churchyard includes a memorial to the 12 miners killed in 1839 when their rope was severed. St. John&#x27;s is part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The Patronage vests in Christ Church, Oxford.

The Methodist Church in the town&#x27;s High Street celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2009. In 1746, John Wesley&#x27;s travelling preachers, based in Bristol, were invited in the mid-1700s to support the local society, the man himself first coming in 1767. By the middle of the 1800s, the congregation had outgrown the original chapel erected in 1775 in Rackvernal Road (now demolished). In the 1990s, the present church building and adjoining hall were totally refurbished and linked, the facilities being well used by the local community. Local Methodists are part of the Bristol District of the Methodist Church and in the North East Somerset &amp; Bath Circuit.

The Baptist Church have their building in Welton but hold their Sunday morning service at Paulton Rovers Football Club now in order to accommodate their congregation.

The Salvation Army meet in their citadel at Stones Cross. There is a successful Scout group, the 1st Midsomer Norton Scout Group based at Radstock Road, providing scouting to around 140 boys and girls per week, and a similarly popular Guide group a short distance away at Rock Hall.

==Education==
First schools for children up to 11 include Midsomer Norton Primary, St. John&#x27;s Church of England, Welton Primary, Longvernal Primary, Westfield Primary and Norton Hill Primary. In addition, St Benedict&#x27;s Catholic Primary School on the edge of Midsomer Norton with a &#x27;Midsomer Norton, Radstock&#x27; postal address, is actually part of the neighbouring Somerset County Council&#x27;s education service.

There are two local secondary schools. Norton Hill School has approximately 1,400 students from the age of 11 to 18. In 1999, it became a Technology College and in 2007 changed specialism to become a Maths and Computing College. In 2006, Norton Hill was also awarded a second specialism as a Language College. The school was described by Ofsted in 2007 as outstanding in every respect. The school has received both the Sportsmark Award by Sport England and Artsmark Silver Award. Somervale School which has foundation status, is a specialist Arts College. In 2008, the school was the first in Bath and North East Somerset to win the Eco-Schools Silver Award. The number of pupils on the school roll had fallen to 603. This fall prompted the school to propose a federation with nearby Norton Hill School in March 2009 called the Midsomer Norton Schools Partnership. This is now in place with Alun Williams as the overall head teacher of both schools within the federation.
In October 2010 the federation was confirmed as an academy. Somervale School was awarded ‘Good’ in June 2022 and Norton Hill School was awarded ‘Good’ in March 2023. The two schools share a sixth form called the Midsomer Norton Sixth Form which is based across the two school sites.

The town is served by a further education college, the Somer Valley branch of Bath College, in neighbouring Westfield. It serves 1,000 full-time students and 5,000 part-time students. The College has steadily expanded since it opened in the 1940s to serve the Somerset coalfields. As a Community College, it has expanded its range of vocational programmes, and has become an established part of the community. The college works with local employers to provide training programmes that meet the needs of both employers and employees. This ranges from short skills workshops, through to NVQs, BTEC, Higher National Diplomas and apprenticeships.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 102.4 FM and Somer Valley FM, a community based station which broadcasts from the town on 97.5 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, the &quot;Midsomer Norton, Radstock &amp; District Journal&quot;.

==Sport==
South Wansdyke Leisure Centre provides a wide range of activities including swimming. Norton Hill and Somervale School also have sports facilities used by town and local groups.
In 2010, additional leisure facilities were constructed including a skate board park and new children&#x27;s play area. In 2023, parts of the existing playground were removed and placed on the side of the building where a new playground was erected.

There are several football clubs including Welton Rovers F.C. who play in the Western Football League, Welton Arsenal, and Norton Hill Rangers.

Midsomer Norton has its own Cricket club, as do Midsomer Norton Methodists, and a Rugby union team.
In 2002, the World Professional Billiards Championship was held at the Centurion Hotel, part of L&amp;F Jones, Midsomer Norton.

<text>Richard Armstrong Whiting (November 12, 1891 – February 19, 1938) was an American composer of popular songs, including the standards &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Got Fun?&quot; and &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot;. He also wrote lyrics occasionally, and film scores most notably for the standard &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1936 for &quot;When Did You Leave Heaven&quot; from the film &quot;Sing, Baby Sing&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Whiting was born in Peoria, Illinois, United States, into a musical family. His father, Frank Whiting, was a real estate agent and gifted violinist; his mother Blossom was a piano teacher. Together they instilled a love of music in their son and worked towards nurturing his natural gift of piano playing. He attended the Harvard Military School in Los Angeles. Upon his graduation, Whiting started a vaudeville act with his college friend Marshall Neilan. The pair briefly toured the United States writing songs, singing, and playing the piano; although neither one had the stage presence or singing talent to become full-time performers. They broke up the duo and went their separate ways: Neilan to Hollywood, where he would go on to be a successful film director and actor, and Whiting to Detroit to try to jump-start a career as a professional songwriter. In 1913, Whiting began his career as a song plugger for Jerome H. Remick publishing company. Within a year he was the manager of the Detroit office, being paid US$25 per week. As an occasional talent scout, Whiting nurtured the careers of several songwriters from the day, most notably George Gershwin; Whiting heard Gershwin playing one day and gave him a job as a song plugger for Remick company. This act of kindness resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two powerhouse composers. To supplement his income at the time, Whiting worked with a local hotel&#x27;s Hawaiian band, playing piano in light blackface, earning him an extra $10 a week.
==Career==
In 1914, Whiting had his first two hit songs: &quot;I Wonder Where My Lovin&#x27; Man Has Gone&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Tulip Time in Holland.&quot; The latter song became a massive hit, selling over a million copies. Whiting received none of the royalties, however, having sold off the publishing rights to Remick in exchange for a Steinway grand piano. During his time at Remick Whiting had a substantial output, mostly with former bank-clerk Ray Egan, including 1918&#x27;s, &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;. The song quickly became the largest sheet music seller of all time, even today: at last count the song was said to have sold over 11 million copies. Other hit songs written by Whiting during his time at Remick include &quot;Where the Black-Eyed Susans Grow&quot; (1917), &quot;The Japanese Sandman&quot; (1920), &quot;Bimini Bay&quot; (1921, lyrics by Egan and Gus Kahn), &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Got Fun?&quot; (1921, lyrics by Egan and Kahn) and &quot;Ukulele Lady&quot; (1925, lyrics by Kahn).

In 1929, Whiting moved to Hollywood, where there were more opportunities for songwriters during the Depression. In Hollywood he wrote a number of film scores and classic songs. With Johnny Mercer he wrote the theme song of Tinseltown, &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;, shortly before his death. During his career, Whiting collaborated with such songwriters as BG DeSylva, Johnny Mercer, Neil Moret, Leo Robin, Ralph Rainger, Gus Kahn, Oscar Hammerstein II, Haven Gillespie, Seymour Simons, Nacio Herb Brown, Harry Akst, Walter Donaldson, Ray Egan, and Sidney Clare, to produce a number of hits (listed below). He also wrote a number of scores for Broadway plays.

In the film, &quot;Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1932), a song performed by The Boswell Sisters, titled &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, written by Richard A. Whiting and Sidney Clare, is sometimes credited as the first use of that term.

Whiting died from a heart attack in 1938 at the age of 46, at the height of his career. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 1970. A tribute to Whiting&#x27;s music, along with a medley of his best-known songs, formed part of the 1980 Broadway musical &quot;A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine&quot;. His Steinway grand piano was donated to the Great American Songbook Foundation by his granddaughter Debbi and can be seen on display.

Whiting was married to the former Eleanor Youngblood, a manager whose clients included Sophie Tucker. He was the father of singer/actress Margaret Whiting and actress Barbara Whiting, and the grandson of Rep. Richard H. Whiting.

<text>was allegedly a member of the Japanese Red Army, an armed militant organization.

==Arrest in The Netherlands==

Police arrested Kikumura in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam in 1986 when they found him carrying a bomb in his luggage. After spending four months in prison, a judge ruled the search of his luggage was illegal and he was deported to Japan.

==Arrest in the United States==

Kikumura was arrested on April 12, 1988, at a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike by a state trooper who thought he was acting suspiciously. He was found carrying three 18-inch (46-cm) mercury fulminate pipe bombs hidden in fire extinguishers containing roofing-nail shrapnel. Prosecutors believe that Kikumura had planned to bomb a US Navy recruitment office in the Veteran&#x27;s Administration building on 34th Street in Manhattan on April 14, the anniversary of the U.S. raid on Libya.

==Imprisonment==

Kikumura was indicted on several counts of interstate transportation of explosive devices and passport violations. After a bench trial on stipulated facts, Kikumura was convicted on November 29, 1988, to serve 30 years in prison. Then U.S. attorney Samuel Alito represented the prosecution. In 1991, his sentence was reduced to 21 years and 10 months.

==Release==

Kikumura, Federal Bureau of Prisons # 09008-050, was released on April 18, 2007. He had served a sentence of 221 months (slightly more than 18 years) at Florence ADMAX USP.

Upon Kikumura&#x27;s release he was sent back to Japan via San Francisco International Airport. Upon arrival in Japan he was immediately arrested on charges of falsifying official documents. He was released in October 2007.

<text>Élie Halévy (; 6 September 1870 – 21 August 1937) was a French philosopher and historian who wrote studies of the British utilitarians, the book of essays &quot;Era of Tyrannies&quot;, and a history of Britain from 1815 to 1914 that influenced British historiography.

==Biography==
Élie Halévy was born in Étretat, Seine-Maritime, where his mother had fled as the German army marched on Paris. His father was the playwright Ludovic Halévy, his brother was the historian Daniel Halévy. His family was of Jewish descent, but his parents were Protestant and he was brought up as a Protestant. Halévy grew up surrounded by musicians, scholars, and politicians. After studying at the École Normale Supérieure, he received his doctorate in philosophy in 1901 with the theses &quot;The Platonic Theory of Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Origins of Philosophical Radicalism&quot;. The latter formed the base of his first major study, &quot;The Formation of English Philosophical Radicalism&quot; (3 vols., 1901–1904).

In an article of 1893, Halévy suggested that the great moral question of modern thought was how the abstract idea of duty could become a concrete aim of society. This question had first attracted him to the utilitarians, and he found at the core of their answer a fundamental contradiction. Utilitarianism, he said, was based on two principles: first, that the science of the legislator must bring together the naturally divergent interests of individuals in society; and, second, that social order comes about spontaneously through the harmony of individual interests. To Halévy, this exemplified two fundamental human attitudes toward the universe: the contemplation of the astronomer and the intervention of the engineer.

In 1896, Émile Boutmy invited Halévy to lecture on English political ideas at the newly founded School of Political Science, known today as the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po). After 1900, he alternated this course with another, on the history of socialism. At the same time he helped found the &quot;Revue de métaphysique et de morale.&quot; Halévy remained at Sciences Po until his death in 1937.

Halévy&#x27;s teaching led him to undertake annual trips to England, during which he became the intimate friend of many of the most important scholars and political figures of the age. He thoroughly explored the Jeremy Bentham manuscripts at Cambridge for his work on philosophical radicalism and over the years developed a deep and intensive knowledge of all the sources of 19th-century English history. In 1901 he began to work on the first volume of his masterpiece, the &quot;History of the English People in the Nineteenth Century&quot; (published from 1913 onwards). In this first volume, he described England in 1815 and sought to explain how England avoided violent social change. &quot;If economic facts explain the course taken by the human race,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the England of the nineteenth century was surely, above all other countries, destined to revolution, both politically and religiously.&quot; Neither the British constitution nor the Established Church was strong enough to hold the country together. He found the answer in religious nonconformity: &quot;Methodism was the antidote to Jacobinism.&quot;

He did not write his history in chronological sequence, nor did he live to complete it. The second and third volumes of this history (1923) carried the story up to 1841. Then Halévy, profoundly moved by World War I, turned his attention to the period from 1895 to 1914. The two volumes on this period (published in 1926-1930) were written with considerable detachment, considering the immediacy of the problems he discussed. Together with Célestin Bouglé he would republish a set of Saint-Simonian lectures of the 1830, bundled in the 1924 work &quot;Doctrine de Saint-Simon&quot;.

In lectures of 1929, revised in 1936 (published in 1938; &quot;The Era of Tyrannies&quot;), Halévy argued that the world war had increased national control over individual activities and opened the way for de facto socialism. In opposition to those who saw socialism as the last step in the French Revolution, he saw it as a new organization of constraint replacing those that the Revolution had destroyed. Wallas translates: 

In what proved to be his last work (which he did not live to complete), Halévy began to bridge the gap between 1841 and 1895 with a volume entitled &quot;The Age of Peel and Cobden (1841-1852)&quot;. A liberal individualist to the last, Halévy died at Sucy-en-Brie on 21 August 1937. His publishers posthumously commissioned R. B. McCallum to contribute a supplementary essay to link this volume with the concluding ones, the whole appearing under the title &quot;Victorian Years&quot; in 1961.

<doc id="1032342" wikidata="Q4118977" url="?curid=1032342" title="Withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq (2007–2011)">
<text>The withdrawal of the United States troops from Iraq began in December 2007 with the end of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 and was mostly completed by December 2011, bringing an end to the Iraq War. The number of U.S. military forces in Iraq peaked at 170,300 in November 2007.

The withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq was a contentious issue in the United States for much of the 2000s. As the war progressed from its initial invasion phase in 2003 to a nearly decade-long occupation, American public opinion shifted towards favoring a troop withdrawal; in May 2007, 55% of Americans believed that the Iraq War was a mistake, and 51% of registered voters favored troop withdrawal. In late April 2007 Congress passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal but President George W. Bush vetoed this bill, citing his concerns about setting a withdrawal deadline. The Bush administration later sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 Bush signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which &quot;all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory&quot;. The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement.

In 2014, the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from Syria to Iraq&#x27;s western provinces prompted the U.S. to intervene again, alongside other militaries, to combat ISIL. In January 2019, Secretary Pompeo put the number of U.S. troops in Iraq at approximately 5,000. In early 2020 the Iraqi parliament voted to withdraw all remaining troops and the Iraqi Prime Minister told the U.S. to start working on troop withdrawal.

==Background==
===Polling===
Immediately before and after the 2003 invasion, most polls within the United States showed a substantial majority supporting war, though since December 2004 polls consistently showed that a majority thought the invasion was a mistake. In the spring of 2007, surveys generally showed a majority in favor of setting a timetable for withdrawal. However, in this area responses can vary widely with the exact wording of the question. Surveys found that most preferred a gradual withdrawal over time to an immediate pullout.

===2004 U.S. presidential election===
The issue was one on which John Kerry and George W. Bush differed in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Kerry said in August 2004 that he would make the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq a goal of his first presidential term. However, he did not offer a deadline or a timetable, and proposed an increase in deployment size in the immediate future. In the debate, he said that he reiterated that withdrawal was a goal, if an initial troop increase works.

In the debate, Bush did not offer any timetable or estimate of troops, either increasing or decreasing, but said only that the commanders of the troops in Iraq had the ability to ask for whatever force they needed. In general, this is consistent with his earlier remarks. When questioned about troop strength, Bush and then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that they were using the troops asked for by the general staff.

===Congressional proposals and acts===

On 17 November 2005 Representative John Murtha (D-PA) introduced , a resolution calling for U.S. forces in Iraq to be &quot;redeployed at the earliest practicable date&quot; to stand as a quick-reaction force in U.S. bases in neighboring countries such as Kuwait. In response, Republicans proposed a resolution that &quot;the deployment of United States forces in Iraq be terminated immediately,&quot; without any provision for redeployment, which was voted down 403–3.

On 16 June 2006 the House voted 256–153 in a non-binding resolution against establishing a deadline for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Republican then-House Majority Leader John Boehner, who argued against a deadline, stated &quot;achieving victory is our only option&quot;, and &quot;we must not shy away&quot;. On the other hand, Democratic then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that a deadline is necessary, and stated stay the course&#x27; is not a strategy, it&#x27;s a slogan&quot;, and &quot;it&#x27;s time to face the facts.&quot;

On 27 March 2007 Congress passed H.R. 1591, which called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq by March 2008. However, President Bush vetoed the bill and the House of Representatives failed to override the veto. Congress then passed H.R. 2206, which provided funding for the Iraq War through 30 September 2007 and was signed into law by President Bush on 25 May 2007. H.R. 2206 included eighteen benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet.

On 9 May 2007 Representative Jim McGovern introduced H.R. 2237 to the House, &quot;To provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq.&quot; The bill failed with a vote of 255 to 171, 13 of the Nays coming from Democrats representing districts won by John Kerry in 2004.

On 12 July 2007 the House passed H.R. 2956 by a vote of 223–201, for redeployment (or withdrawal) of U.S. armed forces out of Iraq. The resolution requires most troops to withdraw from Iraq by 1 April 2008.

On 18 July 2007, after an all-night debate, the Senate blocked the passage of a bill that would have set a troop withdrawal timetable with a vote of 52–47. The withdrawal would have started within 120 days, and would have required that all troops (except an unspecified number could be left behind to conduct a very narrow set of missions) be out of the country by 30 April 2008.

===McGovern-Polk proposal===
George McGovern and William R. Polk published a detailed proposal for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in their book &quot;Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for Withdrawal Now&quot;. A sizable excerpt was published in the October 2006 edition of Harper&#x27;s magazine. This plan was completely abandoned. Some of the basic features of their proposal included:

* The first soldiers to be sent home should be private security contractors.
* An international stabilization force of 15,000 soldiers to be established. Troops will be drawn from Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt, funded by the U.S. This force would remain for two years after the departure of U.S. troops.
* Transport, communications, and light arms equipment currently used by U.S. forces should be donated to the new multinational force.
* In place of a new Iraqi army, a national reconstruction corps should be established, modeled on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
* The immediate cessation of work on U.S. military bases.
* U.S. withdrawal from the Green Zone.
* Release of all prisoners of war.

===ANSWER, NION, UFPJ positions===
The three largest coalitions which organized demonstrations against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), and Not in Our Name (NION), have all called for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops, &quot;out now.&quot; The anti-war movement has debated whether to support existing proposals in Congress.

The UFPJ legislative working group has endorsed Murtha&#x27;s redeployment proposal &quot;because it is a powerful vehicle to begin the debate on the war,&quot; though the organization as a whole has not taken a position. ANSWER, on the other hand, has stated that &quot;Murtha has not adopted an antiwar position. He wants to redeploy militarily to strengthen the hand of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East.&quot;

===Burner Plan===
The Burner Plan, formally entitled &quot;A Responsible Plan to End the War in Iraq&quot;, was a 36-page policy paper presented 17 March 2008 by Darcy Burner and other 2008 Democratic congressional candidates, in cooperation with some retired national security officials. The plan outlined policy measures the candidates pledged to support in the 2008 United States presidential election.

==Formulation of Withdrawal Plans==

===Withdrawals under President Bush===
On 13 September 2007, President Bush announced that the 168,000 American troops in Iraq at that time would be reduced by 5,700 by Christmas and that additional troops would be withdrawn bringing the total U.S. troop level down from 20 to 15 combat brigades by July 2008. By the end of 2008, U.S. troops in Iraq had been reduced to 146,000.

===2008 U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement===
In 2008 the American and Iraqi governments signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a specific date, 30 June 2009, by which American forces should withdraw from Iraqi cities, and a complete withdrawal date from Iraqi territory by 31 December 2011. On 14 December 2008 then-President George W. Bush signed the security agreement with Iraq. In his fourth and final trip to Iraq, President Bush appeared in a televised news conference with Iraq&#x27;s prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to celebrate the agreement and applauded security gains in Iraq saying that just two years ago &quot;such an agreement seemed impossible&quot;.

===President Obama&#x27;s speech on 27 February 2009===
On 27 February 2009, at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, President Barack Obama announced his revision to the original date of withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq. The revision was to extend the original date of 30 June 2009 for an additional 10 months, to 31 August 2010. President Obama reaffirmed commitment to the original complete withdrawal date of 31 December 2011, set by the agreement between the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. President Obama defined the task of the transitional force as &quot;training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq&quot;.

==Withdrawal==

===August 2010 partial withdrawal===
On 19 August 2010 the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division was the last American combat brigade to withdraw from Iraq.

In a speech at the Oval Office on Obama declared: &quot;the American combat mission in Iraq has ended. Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.&quot;

About 50,000 American troops remained in the country in an advisory capacity as part of &quot;Operation New Dawn,&quot; which ran until the end of 2011. The U.S. military continued to train and advise the Iraqi Forces.

===Full withdrawal (2011)===

With the collapse of discussions about extending the stay of U.S. troops, President Obama announced the full withdrawal of troops from Iraq, as previously scheduled, on 21 October 2011. The U.S. retained an embassy in Baghdad with some 17,000 personnel, consulates in Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk, which have been allocated more than 1,000 staff each, and between 4,000 and 5,000 defense contractors. President Obama and al-Maliki outlined a broad agenda for post-war cooperation without American troops in Iraq during a joint press conference on 12 December 2011 at the White House. This agenda included cooperation on energy, trade and education as well as cooperation in security, counter-terrorism, economic development and strengthening Iraq&#x27;s institutions. Both leaders said their countries would maintain strong security, diplomatic and economic ties after the last U.S. combat forces withdraw.

President Barack Obama paid tribute to the troops who served in Iraq on 14 December 2011, at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina. As the last of the American troops prepared to exit Iraq, he said the United States was leaving behind a &quot;sovereign, stable and self-reliant&quot; Iraq. On 15 December, an American military ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the U.S. mission in Iraq. The last 500 soldiers left Iraq on the morning of 18 December 2011. At the time of withdrawal, the United States had one remaining soldier, Staff Sergeant Ahmed K. Altaie, still missing in Iraq since 23 October 2006, and had offered a $50,000 () reward for his recovery. On 26 February 2012, his death was confirmed.

<doc id="1032344" wikidata="Q366747" url="?curid=1032344" title="John Wetton">
<text>John Kenneth Wetton (12 June 1949 – 31 January 2017) was an English musician, singer, and songwriter. Although he was left-handed, he was known as a skilled right-handed bass player and had a booming baritone voice. He was a member of the band Family in 1971 for a short time, before joining King Crimson in 1972. After the breakup of King Crimson at the end of 1974, Wetton played in a number of progressive rock and hard rock bands, including Roxy Music (1974–1975), Uriah Heep (1975–1976), U.K. (1977–1980), and Wishbone Ash (1980–1981).

In 1981, he co-founded Asia as lead vocalist and principal songwriter, which was considered to be a supergroup. Their debut, self-titled album was released in 1982, selling ten million copies worldwide and becoming &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s number one album of 1982. Wetton later formed the duo Icon with his Asia bandmate and songwriting partner Geoff Downes, and he also had a successful solo career.

==Life and career==
===Early life and musical beginnings===
Wetton was born in Willington, Derbyshire, and grew up in Bournemouth, Dorset, where he attended Bournemouth School. His elder brother Robert was a classical organist and choirmaster. While practising organ, Robert would have John play the bass parts on a piano, since their home organ did not have a pedalboard. John recalled that during the practices, &quot;I got to like bass lines, because Bach bass lines are incredibly interesting. So I thought, this is good, I like bass lines, that&#x27;s me.&quot; Though an enthusiast of classical music since childhood, he opted to go into rock and roll instead in order to avoid being compared to his brother. He played bass and sang in a number of bands with Richard Palmer-James, including the Corvettes, the Palmer-James Group, Tetrad, and Ginger Man. A key early band he was in was the jazzy Mogul Thrash. After live work with Renaissance, he joined Family and also was in various recording sessions.

===King Crimson===
Wetton&#x27;s big break came when his fellow Dorset native Robert Fripp invited him to join King Crimson in late 1972. The band&#x27;s lineup also included violinist David Cross, former Yes drummer Bill Bruford, and percussionist Jamie Muir. Being in the band solidified Wetton&#x27;s skills as a lead singer and writer. His friend Palmer-James also worked with the band as their primary lyricist. Wetton remained with King Crimson until Fripp unexpectedly disbanded it in 1974.

After the dissolution of King Crimson, Wetton continued to work on various projects, including a tour with Roxy Music and two albums with Uriah Heep, for whom he occasionally provided vocals as well as bass parts—examples of his vocal style can be heard on the 1976 album &quot;High and Mighty&quot;. While still with King Crimson, Wetton had been asked by Roxy Music to sit in on their auditions for a replacement bass player and give his recommendations. Dissatisfied with all the applicants, he offered to do the 1975 tour with the group himself so as to give them time to find a good bassist. In 1977, after failed attempts to reunite King Crimson and to create a new band with Rick Wakeman, Wetton formed U.K. with Bill Bruford. Wetton recruited Curved Air and Roxy Music keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson; Bruford brought in guitarist Allan Holdsworth from his solo group.

===First solo music; Asia===
After U.K.&#x27;s breakup in 1980, Wetton released his first solo album, &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot;, also in 1980. Later that year, he had a brief stint with Wishbone Ash, appearing on their 1981 album, &quot;Number the Brave&quot;. In late 1981, he had a meeting with Geffen Records&#x27; president John Kalodner, who took him to task for playing bass in Bryan Ferry&#x27;s backing band, feeling he should be fronting a group himself. At Kalodner&#x27;s insistence, Wetton started writing with former Yes guitarist Steve Howe, with a view to forming their own band. Joined by keyboardist Geoff Downes and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer), the band became Asia. Their self-titled, debut album sold over ten million copies worldwide, making them a household name. Wetton worked with Asia until 1983, when he was fired (at the insistence of Geffen Records) for then-unknown reasons, but at least in part due to lower-than-expected sales of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;. He returned to Asia in 1985 (with Mandy Meyer replacing Steve Howe on guitar), completing the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Astra&quot;.

In 1986, a collaboration between Wetton and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera was released as &quot;Wetton/Manzanera&quot;. Around that time, Wetton began working with Downes and Palmer to restart Asia. Some of the material they recorded was featured on 1990&#x27;s &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot;, including the radio hit &quot;Days Like These&quot;.

===Return to solo work===
In the 1990s, Wetton focused on his solo career. In 1999, an aborted attempt to reform Asia resulted in him and Palmer forming a short-lived progressive group dubbed Qango, with John Young and Dave Kilminster. Qango performed several shows in the UK and recorded a live album, &quot;Live in the Hood&quot;, before disbanding.

In the early 2000s, Wetton reunited with Downes, and the duo released several albums. In 2006, a reunion of the original Asia lineup (Wetton, Downes, Howe, Palmer) finally occurred. A studio album titled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the original band&#x27;s first since 1983&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;, was released in April 2008 and peaked at No. 73 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. They issued two more studio albums, &quot;Omega&quot; (2010) and &quot;XXX&quot; (2012), before Howe departed in January 2013 to focus on Yes. With new guitarist Sam Coulson, Asia released &quot;Gravitas&quot; in March 2014.

In 2013, Wetton guested on the album &quot;Grandine il vento&quot; by Renaissance, with whom he had played live 42 years before. In the same year, he toured with &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Leslie Hunt&#x27;s group District 97, based in Chicago, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the King Crimson album &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;.

Wetton also worked extensively as a session musician with musicians including Brian Eno ( appearing on &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;), Bryan Ferry, and Ayreon.

==Death==
Wetton died in his sleep from complications of colorectal cancer at the Macmillan Unit of Christchurch Hospital in Christchurch, Dorset, on 31 January 2017, at the age of 67. He was surrounded by his wife, son, brother, and mother.

Geoff Downes: 

Billy Sherwood, who was Wetton&#x27;s producer, co-songwriter, and co-performer on his 2011 solo album, &quot;Raised in Captivity&quot;, replaced him in Asia. On 17 June 2017, Asia performed a special concert in Wetton&#x27;s memory, titled &quot;An Extraordinary Life&quot; (full title: &quot;An Extraordinary Life – An Interactive Celebration of the Life &amp; Music of John Wetton&quot;), in reference to the eponymous song from the 2008 Asia album, &quot;Phoenix&quot;; fan-submitted performances were shown on a large video screen above the stage. Some King Crimson songs were also performed at the event.

Asteroid 72802 Wetton, discovered by Marc Buie at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona in 2001, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 ().

==Influence==
Artists who have cited Wetton as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him include Billy Sheehan, Juan Alderete of the Mars Volta and Racer X, Michael Sweet of Stryper, Ron Anderson, and Joseph D. Rowland of Pallbearer. After Wetton&#x27;s death, Eric Clapton published a short instrumental tribute entitled &quot;For John W.&quot;

<text>Dorothy Irene Height (March 24, 1912 – April 20, 2010) was an African-American civil rights and women&#x27;s rights activist. She focused on the issues of African-American women, including unemployment, illiteracy, and voter awareness. Height is credited as the first leader in the civil rights movement to recognize inequality for women and African Americans as problems that should be considered as a whole. She was the president of the National Council of Negro Women for 40 years. Height&#x27;s role in the &quot;Big Six&quot; civil rights movement was frequently ignored by the press due to sexism. In 1974, she was named to the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, which published the &quot;Belmont Report&quot;, a bioethics report in response to the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study.

==Early life and education==
Dorothy Height was born in Richmond, Virginia, on March 24, 1912. When she was five years old, she moved with her family to Mckees Rocks Rankin, Pennsylvania, a steel town in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, where she attended racially integrated schools. Height&#x27;s mother was active in the Pennsylvania Federation of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs and regularly took Dorothy along to meetings where she established her &quot;place in the sisterhood&quot;.

Height&#x27;s long association with the YWCA began in a Girl Reserve Club in Rankin organized under the auspices of the Pittsburgh YWCA. An enthusiastic participant, who was soon elected president of the club, Height was appalled to learn that her race barred her from swimming in the pool at the central YWCA branch. Though her arguments could not bring about a change in policy in 1920&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Height later dedicated much of her professional energy to bringing profound change to the YWCA.

While in high school, Height became socially and politically active in anti-lynching movement. A talented orator, she won first place and a $1,000 scholarship at a national oratory contest held by the Elks. Height graduated from Rankin High School in 1929.

She was accepted to Barnard College of Columbia University in 1929, but was denied entrance because the school had an unwritten policy of admitting only two black students per year. She enrolled instead at New York University, earning an undergraduate degree in 1932 and a master&#x27;s degree in educational psychology the following year. She pursued further postgraduate work at Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work (the predecessor of the Columbia University School of Social Work).

==Her impact==

From 1934 to 1937, Height worked in the New York City Department of Welfare, an experience she credited with teaching her the skills to deal with conflict without intensifying it. From there she moved to a job as a counselor at the YWCA of New York City, Harlem Branch, in the fall of 1937. Soon after joining the staff there, Height met Mary McLeod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt at a meeting of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) held at the YWCA. In her 2003 memoir, Height described the meeting: &quot;On that fall day the redoubtable Mary McLeod Bethune put her hand on me. She drew me into her dazzling orbit of people in power and people in poverty…. &#x27;The freedom gates are half ajar,&#x27; she said. &#x27;We must pry them fully open.&#x27; I have been committed to the calling ever since.&quot; The following year, Height served as acting director of the YWCA of New York City&#x27;s Emma Ransom House residence. In addition to her YWCA and NCNW work, Height was also very active in the United Christian Youth Movement, a group intensely interested in relating faith to real-world problems.

In 1939, Height went to Washington, D.C., to be executive of the Phyllis Wheatley Branch of the DC YWCA. In the fall of 1944, she returned to New York City to join the YWCA national staff, joining the program staff with &quot;special responsibility&quot; in the field of Interracial Relations. This work included training activities, writing, and working with the Public Affairs committee on race issues where her &quot;insight into the attitude and feeling of both white and negro people [was] heavily counted on&quot;. It was during this period that the YWCA adopted its Interracial Charter (1946), which not only pledged to work towards an interracial experience within the YWCA, but also to fight against injustice on the basis of race, &quot;whether in the community, the nation or the world&quot;. Convinced that segregation causes prejudice through estrangement, Height facilitated meetings, ran workshops, and wrote articles and pamphlets aimed at helping white YWCA members transcend their fears and bring their daily activities in line with the association&#x27;s principles.

Height was an active member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, throughout her life, developing leadership training programs and ecumenical education programs. She was initiated at the Rho chapter at Columbia University, and served as national president of the sorority from 1947 to 1956. In 1950, Height moved to the Training Services department where she focused primarily on professional training for YWCA staff. She spent the fall of 1952 in India as a visiting professor at the Delhi School of Social Work, then returned to her training work in New York City. Height participated in the Liberia Watch Program and worked within the ranks of leadership in 1955.

In 1963, the increasing momentum of the civil rights movement prompted the YWCA&#x27;s National Board to allocate funds to launch a country-wide &quot;Action Program for Integration and Desegregation of Community YWCAs&quot;. Height took leave from her position as associate director for Training to head this two-year Action Program. At the end of that period, the National Board adopted a proposal to accelerate the work &quot;in going beyond token integration and making a bold assault on all aspects of racial segregation&quot;. It established an Office of racial integration (renamed Office of Racial Justice in 1969) as part of the Executive Office. In her role as its first director, Height helped to monitor the association&#x27;s progress toward full integration, kept abreast of the civil rights movement, facilitated &quot;honest dialogue&quot;, aided the Association in making best use of its African-American leadership (both volunteer and staff), and helped in their recruitment and retention. Shortly before she retired from the YWCA in 1977, Height was elected as an honorary national board member, a lifetime appointment.

In 1958, Height became President of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) and remained in that position until 1990. While working with both the YWCA and NCNW, Height participated in the Civil Rights Movement and she was considered a member of the &quot;Big Six&quot; (a group with up to nine members, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, John Lewis, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young). In his autobiography, civil rights leader James Farmer noted that Height&#x27;s role in the &quot;Big Six&quot; was frequently ignored by the press due to sexism. During the Civil Rights Movement, she organized Wednesdays in Mississippi with Polly Spiegel Cowan, which brought together black and white women from the North and South to work against segregation. Height&#x27;s background as a prize-winning orator allowed her to serve as an effective middleman through creating a dialogue of understanding between unfamiliar parties. Though Height was not called upon to speak at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, she served as one of the chief organizers for the gathering, becoming a key part in the demonstration&#x27;s success. Height also acted as an ambassador for the lone women&#x27;s organization during the event. Additionally, Height developed many international volunteer programs with the NCNW in Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America.

In the mid-1960s, she wrote a column called &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Word&quot; for the weekly African-American newspaper the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;.

In 1974, she was named to the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, which published the &quot;Belmont Report&quot; a response to the infamous &quot;Tuskegee Syphilis Study&quot; and an international ethical touchstone for researchers to this day. Height was the driving force in the campaign to erect a statue in honor of Mary McLeod Bethune in Lincoln Park, Washington, D.C. The monument was the first statue dedicated to either a woman or an African-American person to be erected on federal land. At the July 1974 unveiling of the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial, which had an attendance of more than eighteen thousand people, Height stated that the statue represented the awakening appreciation for the contributions of racial minorities and women within the United States, which was best represented by a Black woman. 

==Later life==
In 1990, Height, along with 15 other African Americans, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom. Height received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1994. Height&#x27;s 90th-birthday celebration in 2002 raised five million dollars towards funding the NCNW&#x27;s mortgage on their Washington, D.C., headquarters, the Dorothy I. Height Building. Two notable donors were Don King and Oprah Winfrey. Height was recognized by Barnard for her achievements as an honorary alumna during the college&#x27;s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 2004.

She was also well known for her hats and hat collection, many of them made by a Black Washington, D.C., milliner, Vanilla Beane. One of which was featured Height&#x27;s USPS stamp. Portions of her hat collection have been shown in museums.

The musical stage play &quot;If This Hat Could Talk&quot;, based on her memoirs &quot;Open Wide The Freedom Gates&quot;, debuted in 2005. The work showcases her unique perspective on the civil rights movement and details many of the behind-the-scenes figures and mentors who shaped her life, including Mary McLeod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt. President Barack Obama called Height &quot;the godmother of the civil rights movement and a hero to so many Americans&quot;. She attended the National Black Family Reunion on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., every year until her death in 2010. Height was the chairperson of the executive committee of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella group of American civil rights interest groups, until her death in 2010. She was an honored guest at the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, and was seated on the stage.

==Death==
On March 25, 2010, Height was admitted to Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for unspecified reasons and under protest, because she had pending speaking arrangements. She died less than four weeks later, on April 20, 2010, at the age of 98. President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy for her funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral on April 29, 2010, which was attended by many other dignitaries and notable people. She was later buried at Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Colmar Manor, Maryland.

Shortly after Height&#x27;s death, congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Mayor Vincent Gray encouraged the U.S. Postal Service to name D.C.&#x27;s former main post office the Dorothy I. Height Post Office. This honor made Height the only African-American woman to have a federal facility in Washington, D.C., named after her.

<text>Astrakhan Cossack Host () was a Cossack host of Imperial Russia drawn from the Cossacks of the Lower Volga region, who had been patrolling the banks of the Volga River from the time of Russia&#x27;s annexation of Astrakhan Khanate in 1556.

== History ==
In 1737, the Russian government relocated a number of the Volga Cossacks to Astrakhan and formed a Cossack unit of 3 sotnyas, or 300 men, for escorting couriers and correspondence and for guard duty, which would be re-organized into the Astrakhan regiment (5 sotnyas, or 500 men) on March 28, 1750. It was settled along the right bank of the Volga River from Astrakhan to Cherniy Yar (a town in the Astrakhan Oblast). In the early 19th century, the regiment was reinforced with the Cossacks from Tsaritsyn, Kamyshin, Saratov, and also with the remnants of the Volga Cossacks, some Kalmyks and Tatars. In 1817, the Astrakhan regiment (16 sotnyas, by that time) was reorganized into a 3-regiment Astrakhan Cossack Host. In 1833, it was transferred from under the authority of the Caucasus corps to the governor (ataman) of Astrakhan. In 1872, the Astrakhan Cossack Host was divided into 2 departments and re-grouped into 1 cavalry regiment. The Astrakhan Cossack Host possessed 4 stanitsas next to Tsaritsyn, Saratov, Cherniy Yar and Krasniy Yar, 16 yurt stanitsas, 57 khutors (farms), and 808,000 desyatinas of land. One desyatina equals 2,7 acres (11,000 m2).

The Astrakhan Cossack Host took part in the Patriotic War of 1812 and Russo-Turkish Wars of the 19th century. Major General Pyotr Mikhailovich Skarzhinsky was a notable commander(1790-1792). Skarzhinsky would also serve as governor of Astrakhan. At least two mounted regiments of Astrakhan Cossacks saw active service as part of the Tsarist armies in World War I.

During the Russian Civil War, Prince Tundutov formed a small army of Astrakhan Cossacks. A significant number of participated in the Astrakhan offensive. In October–November 1919, the Whites were defeated at Astrakhan, causing the disbandment of the Astrakhan Cossack Host in 1920.

==Organisation in final years==
In 1916, the total number of Astrakhan Cossacks was approximately 40,000 people. In times of peace, the Astrakhan Cossack Host supplied 1 cavalry regiment (4 sotnyas) and 1 platoon of guards (local police); in times of war - 3 cavalry regiments, 1 platoon of guards, 1 battalion of infantry, 1 special and 1 reserve sotnyas (to a Host total of 2,600 men). In addition, one platoon of the Composite Cossack Regiment of the Imperial Guard was provided by the Astrakhan Host.

The Astrakhan Cossacks were unusual in that there was no single Host area. They had instead evolved into a number of separate districts, communities and farms located in clusters along the right bank of the Volga River between Astrakhan and Chenyi Yar. Although long-established, their relatively small numbers and scattered locations made the Astrakhan Cossacks one of the less significant of the Hosts, overshadowed by the neighboring Don Cossacks.

==Uniform distinctions==
The distinguishing colour of the Astrakhan Cossack Host was yellow; worn on the cap bands, epaulettes and wide trouser stripes of a dark blue uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Individual regiments were distinguished by numbers on the epaulettes. Lambs-wool hats (&quot;papakha&quot;) were worn on occasion with yellow cloth tops.

No spurs were worn by the Astrakhan and other cossack hosts. After 1907 a khaki-grey jacket was adopted for field uniform, worn with blue-grey breeches. The astrakhan hats and yellow trouser stripes of the peacetime uniform were however retained during World War I.

<doc id="1032352" wikidata="Q7754047" url="?curid=1032352" title="The Nigger Bible">
<text>The Nigger Bible is a book by Robert H. deCoy, originally self-published by deCoy and then reissued by Holloway House in 1967, and again in 1972 (). Described as a &quot;key statement&quot; in the Black Power movement, it is a social and linguistic analysis of the word &quot;nigger&quot; and of the origins and contemporary circumstances of the black peoples of America. 

== Analysis ==
The form is varied and might be described as a series of reflections. In the preface, Dick Gregory (whose autobiography was entitled &quot;Nigger&quot;) writes: &quot;In abolishing and rejecting the Caucasian-Christian philosophical and literary forms while recording his &#x27;Black Experiences,&#x27; this writer has removed himself from their double-standard, hypocritical frames of reference&quot;.

It attempts to tease apart the cultural, philosophical, and scriptural origins of what the author calls an &quot;Alabaster Man&quot;, one that experienced the conclusions and prejudices at the root of their oppression. It examines, among other texts, the Christian Bible and its terminology. The book explores the power of words, and reinterprets and critiques core western religious and philosophical constructs, including those that are central to much of the modern African-American religious experience. In one of the chapters, he discusses &quot;the genealogy of Jody Grind&quot;; Eugene B. Redmond remarks that deCoy is one of many African-American writers who &quot;continues a tradition by seeking out folk epics and ballads as sources of poetry&quot;.

DeCoy re-examines the word &quot;nigger&quot;, demystifies it, and attempts to embed critical thinking skills about black personality types and categories. The author deconstructs the Christianity of &quot;Niggers&quot; (including, in his view, Black Muslims) as well as the values of the New Left. The book contains an analysis of the cultural and racial significance of Mardi Gras.

DeCoy also published &quot;Cold Black Preach&quot; (1971, ). &quot;The Black Scholar&quot; summarized: &quot;Noted author of the explosive best seller &quot;The Nigger Bible&quot; takes on the black preaching establishment&quot;.

<doc id="1032359" wikidata="Q189723" url="?curid=1032359" title="Saudi Arabia national football team">
<text>The Saudi Arabia national football team (SAFF) () represents Saudi Arabia in men&#x27;s international football. They are known as &quot;Al-Suqour Al-Arabiyyah&quot; (Arabian Falcons) and sometimes &quot;Al-Suqour Al-Khodhur&quot; (The Green Falcons), a reference to their traditional colours of green and white, and represent both FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

Considered one of Asia&#x27;s most successful national teams, Saudi Arabia have won the AFC Asian Cup three times (1984, 1988 and 1996), reached a joint record six Asian Cup finals and have qualified for the FIFA World Cup on seven occasions since debuting at the 1994 tournament. Saudi Arabia are the first Asian team to reach the final of a senior FIFA competition at the 1992 King Fahd Cup, which would eventually become the FIFA Confederations Cup. Only Australia and Japan managed to repeat this feat in 1997 and 2001 respectively, though Australia achieved it when they were a member of the OFC.

At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to Sweden in the round of 16. Thus, they became the second Arab team in history to reach the knockout stage of a World Cup after Morocco in 1986 and 2022, and one of the few Asian national football teams (the others being Australia, Japan, South Korea and North Korea) to accomplish such a feat to date. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Saudi Arabia caused a large upset when they beat eventual champions Argentina 2–1, the first time Argentina lost to an Asian representative at the World Cup. However, Saudi Arabia then lost the following matches against Poland and Mexico to finish last.

In 2027, Saudi Arabia will host the AFC Asian Cup, the first time that the nation has ever hosted the AFC Asian Cup. They will also host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.

==History==

=== Early history (1951–1955) ===
The idea of a Saudi national team first came about in 1951, when a Saudi XI team consisting of players from Al-Wehda and Al-Ahli took part in a friendly game against the Egyptian Ministry of Health on 27 June at the Al-Saban Stadium in Jeddah. The following day, the Egyptians took on a Saudi team made up of players from Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal in Al-Bahri in the same city. On 2 August, His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal organized a third friendly with the Egyptian team against Saudi Arabia with players from Al-Wehda, and Al-Ahli. By then, the idea of a national select team to represent the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was already in full flow, and in 1953 the first-ever Saudi team traveled to play friendly matches abroad. The same year, a Saudi team traveled to Damascus to play friendly matches as part of then-Crown Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz&#x27;s visit to the country in April.

In 1957, the Saudi national team took part in their first international tournament at the 2nd Pan-Arab Games in Beirut, where King Saud was invited to attend the opening ceremony and the inauguration of the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium with Lebanese President Camille Chamoun on 18 October. Abdulmajeed Kayal scored for the Saudis while Levon Altonian netted for the home side.

=== Debuting successes and subsequent declines (1956–2016) ===
Though their football federation was established in 1956, the Saudi Arabia national team did not participate in a tournament until they qualified for the AFC Asian Cup in 1984, becoming Asian champions for the first time. Since then, they reached the next four consecutive Asian Cup finals, winning two of them (1988 and 1996). They have qualified for every AFC Asian Cup since, reaching the final in the 2007 edition.
Saudi Arabia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1994 under the leadership of Argentine manager Jorge Solari and talents like Saeed Al-Owairan and Sami Al-Jaber, reinforced by national veteran Majed Abdullah as team captain. Wins against Belgium and Morocco in the group stage led to a match-up against Sweden in the round of 16, a 3–1 loss. Saudi Arabia qualified for the next three FIFA World Cups, but failed to win a match in any of them; in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the team suffered an agonizing group stage elimination for the first time after only a draw was achieved, which occurred against South Africa. The team placed last in the 2002 FIFA World Cup without scoring a goal, while conceding 12, including eight against Germany, the most humiliating FIFA World Cup performance ever by an Asian team since 1954, and the team saw no improvement in the 2006 FIFA World Cup after winning only a single point against Arab rival Tunisia, and squandering a 2–1 lead in the last minutes before losing to Ukraine.

After the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, Saudi Arabia suffered even further setbacks. The Saudis failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in agonizing playoffs that saw them again give up their 2–1 lead to a 2–2 draw to neighbor Bahrain. In the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, the Saudis went on to have their worst-ever Asian Cup performance in history, losing all three games in a shocking style to Syria, Jordan and Japan. Later on, Saudi Arabia failed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, finishing behind Australia and Oman in the third round. This embarrassing record kept following the Saudis into the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, as the Saudis suffered another group stage exit, this time losing to China and Uzbekistan. They only won against North Korea.

=== Revival (2017–present) ===
Saudi Arabia secured qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, their first in 12 years, ahead of Australia. In the first match of Group A and the tournament, Saudi Arabia were crushed by hosts Russia 5–0, making this the second largest victory of any host. Saudi Arabia then lost 1–0 to a Luis Suárez goal that put Uruguay as the eventual group winners. Although they were already eliminated, Saudi Arabia managed to win their final group stage match against Red Sea neighbours Egypt 2–1, coming back from behind after a Mohamed Salah goal.

After the 2018 World Cup, Saudi Arabia participated in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, held in the United Arab Emirates; the team finished second in the group stage, after falling to Qatar in the final game, leading to a showdown against Japan in the round of 16. The Saudis dominated the whole game, but ultimately lost 1–0 due to poor finishing.

On 15 October 2019, Saudi Arabia played its first-ever game with Palestine in the West Bank; the game marked a change in policy for Saudi Arabia, which has previously played matches against the Palestinian team in third-party countries. The visit was condemned by some Palestinian activists, who considered the game as a start of normalizing the relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, but it was viewed by the Palestinian National Authority as a support for their sovereignty over the West Bank. The game ended in a scoreless draw.
Saudi Arabia qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the first to be held in the Middle East, by topping their qualifying group and were drawn against Argentina, Poland and Mexico. In their opening game, they upset Argentina 2–1 within the first five minutes of second half with goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari, ending an Argentine unbeaten streak of 36 games dating back to 2019. The Saudi King declared a holiday after the win and Saudi fans celebrated with mocking words against Lionel Messi and the Argentine team. In the next match against Poland, Piotr Zieliński opened proceedings with a goal in the 39th minute and Robert Lewandowski scored the second goal; resulting in a 2–0 loss. This required a win against Mexico to advance to the round of 16 regardless of the Argentina–Poland result. Fielding three strikers in front, Saudi Arabia however were unable to exert any domination over the Mexican side, conceding two early second half goals by Henry Martín and Luis Chávez, the second being a thunderous midfield free kick; a late consolation goal by Salem Al-Dawsari was not enough as Saudi Arabia fell 2–1 and were eliminated after finishing last in Group C.

Saudi Arabia, under new manager Roberto Mancini, entered the 2023 AFC Asian Cup in Group F with Oman, Kyrgyzstan and Thailand. The Saudis started their campaign with a 2–1 comeback win over neighbour Oman, where Abdulrahman Ghareeb scored from a solo before a late Ali Al-Bulaihi&#x27;s header sealed the dramatic win. They then achieved a 2–0 win over Kyrgyzstan, where the Saudis were dominant from beginning to end against a nine-man squad. The Saudis rested most of their key players as they held Thailand in a goalless draw to advance and top the group, putting the Saudis against South Korea in the last sixteen. Against South Korea, Abdullah Radif opened the scoring in the first minute of the second half, but after conceding a Cho Gue-sung header in the ninth minute of second-half stoppage time, the game was determined by a penalty shootout after 30 minutes of extra time, where the Saudis lost 4–2 on penalties and were eliminated.

==Kits and crests==

Traditionally, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s home kit is white with a green trim, and the away kit is green with a white trim (the Saudi flag colors). From 2023, the team had a color kit reversal where green is the home kit, and white is their away kit. 

=== Kit suppliers ===
==Rivalries==

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s main rivals are mostly from the Arabian Gulf, notably Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.

Due to historical reasons, matches against Iran have been frequently followed and seen by Saudis as the most important rival. This stems from the strong hatred between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in particular in recent years due to historical enmities. Saudi Arabia has won 4 matches, drew 6 times, and lost 5 against Iran. It is one of the ten most heated rivalries with political influence.

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s rivalry against Iraq began in the 1970s. Due to the Gulf War, in which Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia&#x27;s ally Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq eventually became bitter rivals fighting to salvage Arab pride. The two countries since then have been up-and-down in relations, often ranging from lack of cooperation to political confrontation. Iraq almost pulled out of the 21st Arabian Gulf Cup after the country was disallowed to host the competition in a move believed to be motivated by Saudi Arabia.

Outside the Middle East, the Saudis also have established rivalries with South Korea, Japan (including two Asian Cup finals) and most recently Australia.

==Venues==
Historically, Saudi Arabia played most of their home matches in King Fahd Sports City, located in the capital Riyadh. The stadium was also where some of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s most important fixtures were played when the country hosted the first three King Fahd Cups (the predecessor of the FIFA Confederations Cup). The stadium was also home to some of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s matches in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Saudi Arabia started to diversify the use of venues from outside Riyadh in the 2000s, with the 2002 World Cup qualifying first round being played in Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam and the second round being played entirely in Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying second round against Sri Lanka and the first fixture against Uzbekistan in the third round, Saudi Arabia also played in Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium.

<text>Middlewich is a town and civil parish in Cheshire East, Cheshire, England. It is located east of Chester, east of Winsford, south-east of Northwich and north-west of Sandbach. The population of the parish at the 2021 census was 14,421.

Middlewich lies at the confluence of three rivers: the Dane, Croco and Wheelock. Three canals also pass through the town: the Shropshire Union, Trent &amp; Mersey and the Wardle Canal. The town has three major roads: the A533, A54 and A530; there are also good motorway links to the nearby cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The town&#x27;s population has doubled since 1970, despite a reduction in the number of manufacturing jobs in salt and textile manufacturing.

Since 1990, there have been initiatives to increase the volume of tourism into the town, through events such as the annual folk and boat festival, the Roman and Norman festivals, and regular farmers&#x27; markets.

In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in England.

==History==
In the Domesday Book Middlewich is spelt &quot;Mildestvich&quot;; the termination &quot;wic&quot; or &quot;wyc&quot; in Old English refers to a settlement, village or dwelling. It is also supposed that &quot;wich&quot; or &quot;wych&quot; refers to a salt town, with Middlewich being the middle town between Northwich and Nantwich.

Middlewich was founded by the Romans, who gave it the name &quot;Salinae&quot; because of its surrounding salt deposits. It became one of the major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, about a quarter of a mile north of the present-day parish church of St Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;History of Manchester&quot; claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is more likely that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.

Middlewich lies across the King Street fault, which roughly follows the Roman road, King Street, from Northwich to Middlewich. During their occupation the Romans built a fort at 
Harbutts Field (), and excavations to the south of the fort have found further evidence of Roman activity including a well and part of a preserved Roman road. An excavation in 2004, in Buckley&#x27;s Field, also uncovered signs of Roman occupation.

Salt manufacture has remained the principal industry for the past 2,000 years, and it has shaped the town&#x27;s history and geography. Before the Norman invasion of England in 1066, there is thought to have been one brine pit in Middlewich, between the River Croco and the current Lewin Street. In the Domesday Book the area is described as being &quot;wasted&quot;, having been cleared by King William around 1070 as an &quot;act of rage against his rebellious barons&quot;. Gilbert de Venables became the first Baron of Kinderton shortly after the Norman Conquest, the title being conferred by Hugh Lupus. A manor house was built to the east of the town and became the baronial seat of the Venables family. A Jacobean screen in the church of St Michael and All Angels has the carved Venables coat of arms. The title &quot;Baron of Kinderton&quot; is now vested in the Lord Vernon.

On 13 March 1643 the town was the scene of the first Battle of Middlewich, between the Parliamentarians, under Sir William Brereton, and the Royalist supporters of King Charles I of England, under Sir Thomas Aston. The second Battle of Middlewich took place on 26 December 1643, and claimed the lives of about 200 Parliamentarians, along with a number of Royalists under the command of Lord Byron.

The population of Middlewich rose during the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of this rise is attributable to a number of parishes being combined, for example parts of Newton were added to Middlewich in 1894, with Sutton having previously been added to Newton in 1892. Some will also be due to a general increase in population of the United Kingdom, and some of the increase would have been required to provide a labour force for the increased number, and scale, of salt and chemical works in the town. In the middle of the 19th century Middlewich was described as a town with principal works being the surrounding farming district, a silk factory, and the salt works in Kinderton and Newton. 
In 1887 the town was described as having an antique appearance, with its principal trade being salt, along with fruit and vegetables, and small silk and heavy cotton works. The town had one bank and one newspaper. By 1911 the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition mentions the existence of chemical works and the manufacture of condensed milk.
In common with the rest of the United Kingdom, Middlewich&#x27;s young male population was decimated during the First World War. The cenotaph, near to the parish church, lists the names of the 136 men who died in that conflict, representing around 10% of the male population of the town aged between 15 and 45. Forty-two of Middlewich&#x27;s inhabitants lost their lives in the Second World War, with a further fatality in the Korean War. The Brunner Mond salt works in Brooks Lane also erected a cenotaph in memory of the 16 men from the works killed in the First World War, and the two who died during the Second World War.

In the period between the end of the First World War until shortly after the Second World War, there was extensive housebuilding in the town; a significant number of houses were built in the King Street area to the north, the area bounded between Nantwich Road and St. Anne&#x27;s Road to the west, and especially in Cledford to the south. The 1970s commenced with the building of a new road, St. Michael&#x27;s Way, which allowed traffic moving from east to west through the town to bypass the main shopping street, Wheelock Street. Along with the bypass there was significant remodelling of the town centre, with the old town hall and library being demolished. This bypass successfully eased the flow of traffic away from the main shopping street, but the joining of three major roads remains a bottleneck, which will be eased by a proposed eastern bypass.

Since the early 1980s Middlewich has seen a significant quantity of new housing development, initially in the Sutton Lane and Hayhurst Avenue areas. New developments have recently been built on the sites of old salt workings to the south of the Roman Fort at Harbutt&#x27;s Field, near the Norman Baron&#x27;s moated manor house at Kinderton Manor, and on the site of the old railway station. One of the latest developments is on the old silk works next to the Big Lock public house. In common with other local towns such as Holmes Chapel, Northwich and Winsford, people are attracted to Middlewich because of its good road links via the M6 motorway and the relatively low price and availability of suitable building land.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Middlewich, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Middlewich Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall, formerly known as Victoria Buildings, on Lewin Street. For national elections, the town forms part of the Mid Cheshire constituency.

===Administrative history===
Middlewich was an ancient parish. It was subdivided into fifteen townships:

*Byley cum Yatehouse
*Clive
*Croxton
*Kinderton cum Hulme
*Middlewich
*Minshull Vernon
*Mooresbarrow cum Parme
*Newton
*Occlestone
*Ravenscroft
*Sproston
*Stublach
*Sutton
*Weaver
*Wimboldsley

Weaver was in Eddisbury Hundred, and the rest of the parish was in Northwich Hundred. The Middlewich township covered just around the parish church and adjoining streets in the town centre; by the 19th century, the urban area extended into the adjoining townships of Kinderton cum Hulme to the north and east and Newton to the south and west.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Middlewich, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes.

In 1869, a Middlewich local government district administered by an elected local board was established, covering a newly defined area which encompassed the township of Middlewich and parts of the neighbouring townships of Kinderton cum Hulme and Newton. The district was enlarged in 1893 to take in further parts of Kinderton cum Hulme and Newton, plus part of Byley. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so Middlewich parish was enlarged to match the urban district, and the parts of Kinderton cum Hulme and Newton outside the urban district were merged into a parish called Kinderton. The urban district was enlarged in 1936, notably gaining a large area from the parish of Kinderton, which was abolished.

The urban district council was initially based at the old Town Hall on Hightown, which had been built in 1844 and was gifted to the local board by its private owners in 1887. The rear part of that building, including the council&#x27;s offices, was demolished in 1930 to allow for street widening, at which point the council moved to the Victoria Buildings on Lewin Street, which had been built as a technical school and library in 1898. The remainder of the old Town Hall was demolished in the early 1970s.

Middlewich Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A successor parish called Middlewich was established covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Middlewich Town Council. District-level functions passed to Congleton Borough Council. In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished. In 2013, Middlewich Town Council was transferred the ownership of Victoria Buildings and the adjoining Civic Hall from Cheshire East Council, and renamed them the Town Hall and Victoria Hall respectively.

==Geography==

Middlewich is located at (53.192, −2.443), on the confluence of three rivers, the Dane, the Croco and the Wheelock. The town is approximately from junction 18 of the M6 motorway. The main westward traffic route between the motorway and Winsford, and also southbound traffic to Crewe, go through the town. There are three canals in Middlewich, the Middlewich Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal, the Trent and Mersey Canal, and the Wardle Canal, the United Kingdom&#x27;s shortest canal at long.

The town sits less than above sea level, on Upper Triassic Mercia mudstone laid down with large salt deposits as part of the Cheshire plain, a boulder clay plain separating the hills of North Wales and the Peak District of Derbyshire, formed following the retreat of ice age glaciers.

The climate is generally temperate with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean average temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom as is the average amount of sunshine. The average annual rainfall is slightly below the average for the UK. There are few days when snow is lying on the ground, although there are some days of air frost.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the Middlewich wards of Cledford and Kinderton had a total population of 13,101. Middlewich&#x27;s population is relatively young; the proportion of children (aged 0–15) is 3% higher than the national average. Households are larger than average, consistent with a younger population, with an average of 2.51 people per household, compared to the national average of 2.36. Approximately 25% are single person households, compared to 30% nationally; the majority (almost 85%) of Middlewich&#x27;s housing stock is owner-occupied.

Three-quarters of the 9,500 people between the ages of 16 and 74 are classed as &quot;economically active&quot;, that is, either in full or part-time employment, or full-time students. Unemployment runs at around 2.2%, compared to 3.4% nationally. Eighty-seven percent of households own at least one car, primarily used for travel to and from work; nearly 77% of residents travel to work by car, 10% work from home, and the remainder use public transport, walk, or cycle.

At the 2001 census, 16.3% of the population of Middlewich either did not answer the question about religion, or stated that they had no religion. The breakdown for Congleton showed that 99.3% of those that replied, and did not state that they had no religion, were Christian; the figures for Middlewich will be broadly similar.

==Economy==
Middlewich has a traditional high street, with small shops on Wheelock Street, Hightown and Lewin Street. There are also five supermarkets, Lidl, Tesco Express, Morrisons and Morrisons Daily. Historically the major employers have been the salt industry and agriculture. Salt is still manufactured at British Salt, which employs around 125 people. The close proximity to the M6 motorway has led to the creation of a large distribution and business park, with companies such as Tesco and ERF locating to the site. Approximately 300 people are employed at the Ideal Standard factory, which since 1937 has been making vitreous china sanitaryware.

Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in Cheshire, and Congleton East Council has recognised the importance of Middlewich&#x27;s canals in its attempts to promote tourism in the borough. Visitors to the 2003 Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival were estimated to have spent £2.3 million in the town over the two days of the festival.

Power for the town is provided from the National Grid for electricity, and National Grid Gas plc for natural gas. Fresh water supply and foul water collection is by United Utilities.

==Culture and community==

A highly regarded folk and boat festival has been run in the town every year since 1990, except for 2001 when it was cancelled because of a foot and mouth epidemic. It was also cancelled in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic. During the three-day festival (which takes place over a long weekend) folk artists play at a number of locations in the town, and it is estimated to bring in an extra 30,000 visitors to the town during the festival period, along with 400 narrowboats.

In addition to this annual event there have been a number of ad-hoc events, including the Middlewich Roman Festival in 2001. This Roman Festival led to a Heritage lottery fund grant which allowed the construction of a Roman theatre at the Bull Ring near to St Michaels and All Angels church. Since its construction this has regularly been used for other purposes, such as an open-air music stage and an ice-rink. Following the Roman festival in 2001, further Roman festivals were held in 2003 and 2007. Tim Strickland, a consultant archaeologist, was awarded a MBE for services to archaeology for his work in organising the Roman Middlewich Project. In 2005 a Norman Festival was put on in the town, and there are plans for an Industrial Festival. A series of arts and music events &quot;@ the Bull Ring&quot; was started in 2006.

The local newspapers are the &quot;Middlewich Guardian&quot; and &quot;Middlewich Chronicle&quot;. A radio station, Cheshire FM, was launched in 2007, covering the mid-Cheshire area including Middlewich – this closed in 2012. In 2013 a new local radio station was launched, Mid-Cheshire Radio covering Middlewich and the nearby towns of Northwich and Winsford. The library, in Lewin Street, was built in the 1970s to replace the old library which was demolished to build St Michael&#x27;s Way. It has examples of finds from Middlewich&#x27;s Roman past on display. 
Fountain Fields on Queen Street is a traditional town park, with a number of facilities including a bowling green. It has been owned by the council since 1926.

Middlewich has had a football club since at least 1902. The current club, Middlewich Town, was formed in 1998, and plays in the Mid-Cheshire League. Middlewich also has a cricket club on Croxton Lane. There is a leisure centre which shares facilities with the high school. Middlewich is one of two large towns in the former borough of Congleton without a public swimming pool, in spite of the various initiatives that have been started to provide one.

Middlewich&#x27;s hospital is Leighton Hospital near Crewe, part of the Mid Cheshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust. Primary care services are provided by the Central and Eastern Cheshire Primary Care Trust. GP services are provided by two medical practices. There are two dental practices.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire and Silk Radio. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Middlewich Guardian&quot; and &quot;Chester Chronicle&quot;.

==Landmarks and religious sites==
The principal landmark in Middlewich is the Anglican parish church of St Michael and All Angels, parts of which date back to the 12th century, although the majority was built during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. There was a general remodelling of the church during the 19th century, which included removing the whitewash from its interior to reveal the sandstone appearance seen today. The church was the site of fierce fighting in the first and second Battles of Middlewich during the English Civil War.

Other landmarks include: the Roman Theatre built on the Bull Ring on the site of the old town hall and library; and the town bridge, opened in 1931 as a replacement for an earlier bridge. Middlewich has a town cemetery with a twin chapel dating from 1859 by Bellamy &amp; Hardy; it contains the Commonwealth war graves of 21 British service personnel, 17 from World War I and 4 from World War II.
The Victoria technical school and library, which was opened in 1897, is a red brick and red terracotta building, &quot;with a cupola but otherwise vaguely in the Loire style&quot;. Since 1900, the building on Lewin Street has been used as offices by the Town Council. One mile north of the town centre along King Street lies Ravenscroft Hall, which dates from 1837.

There are places of worship for five Christian denominations within the town: Church of England, Methodist, United Reformed Church, Catholic and Pentecostal. There are no places of worship for non-Christian faiths.

Middlewich Methodist Church was built in 2000 in Booth Lane, replacing the earlier chapel in Lewin Street. Middlewich United Reformed Church (Image) was founded in 1797, with the current church (the second on this site) in Queen Street being built in 1870, and completed in 1871. The church celebrated its bicentenary in 1997 with the publication of a history of the church, &quot;Two Hundred Years (not out)&quot;.

Catholic masses were held in a cottage near the cemetery from 1848 until the building of the first Catholic church in the town in Wych House Lane in 1864. This church was enlarged to include the first Catholic school in the town in 1869. The church was later replaced by the modern St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church on New King Street (Image) in 1890, with the stone cross from the church on Wych House Lane being kept within the porch of the new church.

Middlewich Community Church (Image) is a relatively new Pentecostal church located in the former social club for the Brunner Mond works in Brooks Lane.

Middlewich lies on a railway branch line between and , but Middlewich railway station was closed to passenger traffic in 1959 and was demolished; the branch line is still used by freight trains. Efforts to get the line reopened to passenger traffic and have a new station built have been ongoing for nearly 30 years. In 2018, a request from the government to create an outline business case was announced. The request is being handled by Cheshire East Council, in conjunction with Cheshire West &amp; Chester Council and the Cheshire &amp; Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership, and will consider the cost and benefits of reopening the line and building new stations at Middlewich and Gadbrook Park.

===Canals===
Following a petition in 1766, the Trent and Mersey Canal was diverted from its original course to provide transport to the town and now links with a branch of the Shropshire Union Canal. The link between the two canals, which was opened in 1833, is actually a third canal known as the Wardle Canal; at about in length, it is the shortest canal in the United Kingdom.

===Airports===
Middlewich is from Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the UK outside London, and from Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

==Education==
There were three schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, close to the site of the largest Tesco store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and extended in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the &quot;Salinae Day Care Centre&quot;, opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary&#x27;s Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906. At the start of the 21st century there were seven schools in Middlewich: one infant, one junior, four primary schools and one secondary school. Cledford Primary School tends to accept students from the South of the town. It has now amalgamated with Cledford Infant And Nursery School. It is also in federation with Gainsborugh Primary School. Middlewich Primary School caters for children from the older, northern, part of the town, whilst St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School receives Catholic children from the town. Work began on the original buildings for the secondary school, Middlewich High School, in 1906, with later additions improving the teaching areas and providing a sports hall which could also be used by the wider community. The school opened on 1 November 1906. In 2007 it was ranked 34 out of 50 by GCSE results for schools in Cheshire in the 2007 league tables. Byley Primary School and Wimboldsley Community Primary School serve children from outside the immediate bounds of the town.

==Notable residents==
Notable residents include the theologians John Hulse (1708–1790) who founded the Hulsean lectures at Cambridge University, and Theophilus Lindsey (1723 OS1808) who inspired the Feathers Tavern Petition against clerical subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles, and so helped start one of the most profound debates within the Church of England in the 18th century. Elizabeth Ashbridge (1713–55), an 18th-century Quaker minister, was born in the town, as was William Benbow (1787–1864), a nonconformist preacher, pamphleteer and publisher. He was a prominent figure of the Reform Movement for widening the franchise.

The France-Hayhurst family were local landowners responsible for the development of the model village at Bostock, and Charles Frederick Lawrence (1873–1940) was a local antiquarian who documented much of the early history of Middlewich, and also discovered a Neolithic stone celt whilst digging in the town.
John Wright Oakes (1820–1887) born at Sproston House, was a landscape painter who exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. Craig McDean (born 1964) is a British fashion photographer who was born in the town and is now based in New York City.

James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was a chemist and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, developed a process for the electrolysis of brine using asbestos diaphragms. In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General Electrolytic Alkali Company at Middlewich.

Jack Wilkinson (1931–1996), also born in the town, was an English footballer for eight years who scored 81 goals in 158 league games.

<text>Tinker Air Force Base is a major United States Air Force base, with tenant U.S. Navy and other Department of Defense missions, located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, adjacent to Del City and Midwest City.

The base, originally known as the Midwest Air Depot, is named in honor of Oklahoma native Major General Clarence L. Tinker, the first Native American major general.

Tinker is the headquarters of the Air Force Materiel Command&#x27;s (AFMC) Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC), which is the worldwide manager for a wide range of aircraft, engines, missiles, software and avionics and accessories components. The commander of Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) is Lieutenant General Stacey T. Hawkins and the commander of the OC-ALC is Brigadier General Brian R. Moore. The host unit at Tinker is the 72nd Air Base Wing (72 ABW) which provides services and support for the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center and its tenant organizations. The Wing and Installation Commander of Tinker Air Force Base is Colonel Abigail L. W. Ruscetta.

==History==
Tinker Air Force Base is named in honor of Major General Clarence L. Tinker. An Osage from Pawhuska, Oklahoma, he received his wings in 1921. He was a graduate of Wentworth Military Academy who went on to become the first major general of Native American descent in U.S. Army history.

In 1926 he was awarded the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for returning to his blazing aircraft to rescue a fellow officer. On 7 June 1942, he led a flight of B-24 Liberators on a long-range strike against Japanese forces on Wake Island during World War II. Tinker was killed when his aircraft presumably crashed into the sea. At the time of his death, Tinker was commander of the Hawaii-based Seventh Air Force.

The base was originally called Midwest Air Depot and was renamed to honor Tinker. The creation of the base in Oklahoma City was in large part due to lobbying efforts by Stanley Draper.

Several of the base&#x27;s access gates are named in honor of persons with historic ties to the base or to Oklahoma. On 9 May 1997, base officials placed the following names:
*Tinker Gate (former Gate 1), located on the north side, opens onto Air Depot Boulevard. It was named for Tinker
*Eaker Gate (former Gate 2) opens onto F Avenue. It was named for General Ira C. Eaker, commander of the US Eighth Air Force in Europe during World War II
*Turnbull Gate, at the intersection of Perimeter Road and A Avenue. It was named for Colonel William Turnbull, the first Tinker Air Logistics Center Commander (1942)
*Hruskocy Gate (pronounced ruh-sko-see, former Gate 7), on Industrial Boulevard at the NE portion of base. It was named for Brigadier General Thomas C. Hruskocy, the OC-ALC chief of Maintenance Resource Management and Material Management Resource divisions at Tinker (1985–1988)
*Hope Gate, on SE 59th Street. It was named for Colonel John W. Hope, the first commander of the Ground Electronics-Engineering Installation Agency (GEEIA)
*Gott Gate (former Gate 34), on the south end of Air Depot Boulevard. It was named for 1st Lieutenant Donald J. Gott, posthumous Medal of Honor recipient in World War II.
*Vance Gate (former Gate 40), on the west side of base off Sooner Road. It was named Lieutenant Colonel Leon R. Vance Jr, posthumous Medal of Honor recipient in World War II.

In May 1997 the Base named the gates along Douglas Boulevard after aircraft that had been maintained at Tinker:
*Lancer Gate, named for the Rockwell B-1 Lancer
*Liberator Gate, named for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator
*Marauder Gate, named for the Martin B-26 Marauder

The base has more than 26,000 military and civilian employees and is the largest single-site employer in the state of Oklahoma. The installation covers approx. and has 760 buildings with a building floor space of over . The base is bounded by I-40 on the north and I-240 on the south.

With the City of Oklahoma City and Oklahoma County owning several square miles of land adjacent to the base, Tinker is one of the few military bases in a major metropolitan area with sufficient room for expansion. Furthermore, Tinker is located in a community that supports expansion; Oklahoma County voters approved a 2008 measure to purchase the former General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly plant (located adjacent to the base) and lease it to Tinker for future expansion. Now known as Building 9001, the former GM plant houses many shops moved from the main maintenance building, 3001.

===Operational history===
In 1940 the War Department was considering the central United States as a location for a supply and maintenance depot. Oklahoma City leaders offered a site and acquired an option for additional land. On 8 April 1941, the order was officially signed awarding the depot to Oklahoma City. The Midwest Air Depot was formally activated later in 1941.

The depot was the site of a Douglas Aircraft factory producing approximately half of the C-47 Skytrains used in World War II. The site also produced a number of A-20 Havocs. Production ceased in 1945.

The first successful tornado forecast in history was issued on 25 March 1948 from Tinker, about three hours before a tornado hit the southeast corner of the base. A granite marker in the Heritage Airpark on the base commemorates the event.

On September 29, 1957 Buddy Holly and The Crickets recorded &quot;An Empty Cup&quot;, &quot;Rock Me My Baby&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Love&quot;, and &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; in the Tinker Air Force Base Officer&#x27;s Club.

The base hosted the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and its carrier 747 on April 27, 1981, after its first mission (STS-1) during its journey back to Cape Canaveral. Oklahoma governor George Nigh, Oklahoma City mayor Patience Latting and Apollo 10 Commander Tom Stafford were there to greet the crew. The visiting personnel included Deke Slayton, who traveled beside the craft in a T-38 chase plane. An estimated 100,000 people were allowed to enter the base and take pictures.
On 14 November 1984, a massive fire that burned for two days destroyed or damaged over in the Air Logistics Center, Building 3001. The resulting repairs cost $63.5 million.

During much of the 1990s, Tinker was home to the Automated Weather Network switching facility, which consolidated all U.S. military weather data worldwide. Originally located at Carswell Air Force Base, this unit was later moved to an Air Force Weather Agency facility at Offutt Air Force Base.

In May 1992, Tinker became home to the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Take Charge and Move Out&quot; (TACAMO) wing, which provides maintenance, security, operations, administration, training and logistic support for the Navy&#x27;s E-6B Mercury aircraft fleet. TACAMO was the first Navy Air Wing fully integrated on an Air Force base, carrying out a Navy mission in joint operations.

On 3 May 1999, a deadly tornado caused extensive damage to the northwest corner of the base and surrounding communities. For many days afterwards, Tinker personnel helped by providing shelters, search and rescue, and clean-up efforts.

The Oklahoma Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul Technology Center (MROTC), a public-private partnership, was started in 2003. MROTC is managed by Battelle Oklahoma and owned by Oklahoma Industries Authority (OIA), a public trust housed in the offices of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. The first hangars were completed in 2007.

Tinker celebrated the 30-year anniversary of the E-3 Sentry from 29 June to 1 July 2007. Past and present airmen were invited to swap stories and learn about the latest upgrades.

On 13 May 2008, Oklahoma County voters voted in favor of $71.5 million in general obligation bonds, the majority of which has been used to purchase the former General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly plant which is located on the southwest section of the base, next to the runway. A 50-year lease-purchase agreement was executed in September 2008 between Oklahoma County and the Air Force, covering the 3.8 million square foot (353,000 m2) facility and surrounding acreage. Oklahoma County officials paid $55 million to buy the plant from General Motors, which is now called the Tinker Aerospace Complex.

From 2008 to 2015, the Oklahoma Air National Guard&#x27;s 137th Air Refueling Wing also assumed an aerial refueling mission in accordance with the 2005 BRAC Recommendations. The then-137th Airlift Wing (ANG) relocated from Will Rogers Air National Guard Base to Tinker AFB, was redesignated as an air refueling wing, and associated with the 507 ARW while its C-130H aircraft were redistributed to other ANG airlift wings. In 2015, the 137th ended its associate relationship with the 507th, was redesignated as the 137th Special Operations Wing (137 SOW), and returned to Will Rogers ANGB, where it operates the MC-12 Liberty aircraft, operationally gained by Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).

In 2015, it was announced that the Tinker was in the running for a squadron of the new KC-46A Pegasus. In October, it was announced that the base would not be receiving the plane, which instead was given to the 916th Air Refueling Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. Tinker was also in competition with Westover Air Reserve Base and Grissom Air Reserve Base for the plane.

===March 1948 Tornadoes===

Two large tornadoes struck Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, damaging or destroying a large number of aircraft including at least two Douglas C-54 Skymasters, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain, and many Boeing B-29 Superfortresses stored from World War II. In the first storm, &quot;54 aircraft were destroyed, including 17 C-54 transports valued at $500,000 apiece. Also destroyed were 15 P-47 fighters and two B-29 bombers. About 50 other planes were damaged and about 100 vehicles were damaged or destroyed.&quot; In the second tornado, &quot;84 planes were hit, 35 of which were destroyed. These included 18 B-29s, 8 P-47s, 20 B-17s, and 3 C-47s. Hangars and other buildings were destroyed.&quot; Other types destroyed included Beechcraft AT-11s and Fairchild PT-19s and PT-26 Cornells. Damage from the second tornado was estimated at $6,100,000. Total damages for both storms was estimated at $16,350,000.

== Role and operations ==
Tinker AFB is home to major Department of Defense, Air Force and Navy units with national defense missions.

===Air Force and related entities===

The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex is the largest air logistics center in the Air Force Materiel Command. It provides depot maintenance, product support, services and supply chain management, and information support for 31 weapon systems, 10 commands, 93 Air Force bases and 46 foreign nations. It is the contracting office for the Air Force&#x27;s Contract Field Teams program.

The Air Logistics Complex includes the 76 Aircraft Maintenance Group, the 76 Propulsion Maintenance Group, the 76 Commodities Maintenance Group, the 76 Software Engineering Group and the 76 Maintenance Support Group. Combined, these groups provide depot-level maintenance, repair and overhaul of KC-135, B-52, E-3, E-6, and B-1 aircraft, as well as engines, components, support equipment, and associated software for the US Air Force and US Navy.

The 72nd Air Base Wing is a multi-unit, multi-mission wing that includes base services and support for the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, associate organizations, dependents, and retirees.

The 38th Cyberspace Engineering Group, Air Force Space Command, has worldwide responsibility for engineering, installation, and interoperability of all communications and electronic facilities for the Air Force.

Oklahoma Wing Civil Air Patrol Headquarters is located at the base ops building and provides state-level support to the 17 units across the state. The Flying Castle Composite Squadron is a Civil Air Patrol squadron that is composed of cadet and senior members that meet Tuesday evenings.

The 552nd Air Control Wing flies Air Combat Command&#x27;s E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The E-3&#x27;s radar and other sensors provide deep-look surveillance, warning, interception control and airborne battle management. The 552 ACW encompasses 3 groups: 552nd Operations Group, 552nd Maintenance Group and 552nd Air Control Group.

The 507th Air Refueling Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) is one of two Air Force Reserve flying units in the state of Oklahoma and administratively reports to Fourth Air Force (4 AF). The wing operates twelve KC-135R &quot;Stratotanker&quot; air refueling aircraft at Tinker and is operationally gained by Air Mobility Command (AMC). As an associate unit, the 507 ARW also operates the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) British Aerospace 125-800 aircraft (ex-USAF C-29A) in the aviation standards and navigational aid inspection mission.

===Navy and other defense agencies===

The United States Navy&#x27;s Strategic Communications Wing One consists of three squadrons and a wing staff, and employs over 1,300 active-duty sailors and 100 contractors to provide maintenance, security, operations, administration, training and logistic support for the E-6 Mercury aircraft fleet. The E-6B Mercury enables the president of the United States and the Secretary of Defense to directly contact submarines, bombers and missile silos enforcing the country&#x27;s national security through nuclear deterrence. The wing also operates alert facilities for E-6B aircraft at Travis AFB, California and Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.

Defense Mega Center Oklahoma City is the local branch of the Defense Information Systems Agency. The Mega center operates computer systems for the base and serves 110 other bases in 46 states.

Tinker has on-base several offices of the Defense Logistics Agency, the agency that provides supplies to the military services and supports their acquisition and transportation of repair parts and other materials.

*DLA Aviation has two offices at Tinker Air Force Base, DLA Aviation Customer Operations commanded by COL Rex Adee, USAF, and DLA Strategic Acquisitions at Tinker AFB, under Frances Evans, acting director, DLR Procurement Operations.
*DLA Distribution Oklahoma City provides the receipt, storage, issue, inspection and shipment of material, including material quality control, preservation and packaging, inventory, transportation functions and pick up and delivery services in support of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, other tenants at Tinker Air Force Base, and other global customers. Support to the Air Logistics Center is primarily for programmed depot maintenance for aircraft and engines. The majority of the items shipped from Oklahoma City are destined for &quot;customers&quot; on base including the 552nd Air Control Wing, the U.S. Navy Strategic Communications Wing One, the 507th Air Refueling Wing and the 3rd Combat Communications Group.
*DLA Document Services provides a full portfolio of document services including traditional offset printing, on-demand printing, and online document services. DLA Document Services locations in Oklahoma include Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, and Tinker AFB.

===Public/private partnerships===
Community support for Tinker can be seen by the establishment of two public/private partnerships that support base operations by using local dollars to make available additional facilities for base use. While these partnerships are technically separate facilities, Tinker&#x27;s security perimeter is extended around these facilities.

====Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Technology Center (MROTC)====
The first of the public/private partnerships is The Oklahoma Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Technology Center (MROTC), managed by Battelle Oklahoma, owned by Oklahoma Industries Authority (OIA), and partners with the Department of Defense to provide a national center for technical solutions to aging commercial and military aircraft. The MROTC is a MRO facility, on the southeast side of Tinker AFB, sharing runways and security with the base. The MROTC complex is planned as a major military and commercial aircraft facility with 17 hangars and more than one million square feet of related industrial space and education and training facilities. The facility currently houses three hangars, one leased by Boeing (designed to accommodate Boeing 767-400 class aircraft), a second hangar for 767 for lease, and a third hangar designed to accommodate Boeing 707-300 class aircraft.

====Building 9001 (Tinker Aerospace Complex)====
The second of the public-private partnerships is Building 9001, originally known as the Tinker Aerospace Complex housed in the former General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly Plant located west of the runway on the south side of the base, north of I-240. A 50-year lease-purchase agreement was executed in September 2008 between Oklahoma County and the Air Force, covering the 2.5 million square foot (353,000 m2) facility and . Previously, the largest single building at the base was Building 3001 at . Tinker has leased about 4/5 of the facility and will host some current 76th Maintenance Wing operations as well as other Department of Defense missions, including work on the C-17 engines, joint strike fighter engines and core work on the new KC-46 tanker. Work being transferred to the complex is currently being done at 69 separate facilities on base, many of which are World War II-era temporary buildings located in runway clear zones. Burlington Northern Santa Fe provides a rail spur into the complex.

In 2014 Oklahoma County agreed to issue $10 million in bonds to help finance the purchase of a BNSF Railway marshaling yard, just north of the TAC building.

In addition to providing space for the work of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, the Tinker Aerospace Complex can also be used to house public/private business partnerships. Currently, there are three programs. The Cooperative Research and Development Partnership has the objective of advancing science and technology to meet Air Force requirements and transferring technology into the commercial marketplace (CRADA, governed by Title 15 USC 3710a). Public-Private Partnerships, or statutory partnering, is where the government acts as a seller to private industry in either a direct sales agreement, Workshare Partnering Agreement, or a Facilities Use Agreement (governed by Title 10 USC 2474). Finally, the Enhanced Use Lease requires Congressional approval and full fair market value rent for underutilized Air Force assets(governed by 10 USC 2667).

<text>Bornhagen is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany, located at the foot of the ruins of Hanstein Castle. The town district Rimbach is positioned directly south of the castle citadel at an elevation of 370 m. Bornhagen is located 22 km south of Göttingen, 85 km northwest of the state capital Erfurt and 270 km southwest of Berlin. It is the westernmost settlement in Thuringia but does not contain the westernmost point which is 75 km south near Geisa.

Hanstein Castle was mentioned for the first time in official documents in the 9th century in Corvey Monastery, and is considered one of the largest castle ruins in central Germany. In the Middle Ages, the castle served as a prison. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it was partly destroyed by Swedish troops, after which it was no longer inhabited on a regular basis. Reconstruction work was begun on the castle in 1985 with the support of the local heritage society. The three-wing altar from the former castle chapel can be viewed in the Catholic Church in Rimbach. Bornhagen is also a popular tourist destination 

Bornhagen contains a full-scale replica of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.

<text>William Canton (27 October 1845 – 2 May 1926) was a British poet, journalist and writer, now best known for his contributions to children&#x27;s literature. These include his series of three books, beginning with &quot;The Invisible Playmate&quot;, written for his daughter Winifred Vida (1891-1901). The book was read by the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1895. In his lifetime Canton was known for his use of recent archeological evidence of prehistory in his poetry.

==Life==
William Canton was born at Chusan in China on 27 October 1845, to a Catholic family of civil servants. His childhood was spent mostly in Jamaica. He studied for the priesthood at Douai School and later in Paris, but eventually abandoned the priesthood as a vocation to become a teacher and writer. He later left the Roman Catholic Church to become a Protestant. He worked as a journalist in London and Glasgow, where he became editor of the &quot;Glasgow Weekly Herald&quot; and later a leader-writer for the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;.

He married Emma Moore in 1874, and they had one daughter, who died in 1877. Emma died in 1880, and he remarried to Annie Elizabeth Taylor in 1882. They had a son and a daughter together.

In 1891 Canton moved to London, where he worked for the religious book and magazine publisher W. Isbister, later being appointed as editor of the &quot;Sunday Review&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot; . He also contributed articles and poems to &quot;Good Words&quot;.

In 1901 Canton&#x27;s daughter Winifred died suddenly at the age of 10. He resigned from Isbister and took up the offer to write the official history of the Bible Society, which he hoped would comfort him. The nine volume history took five years to complete. He also published literature about Winifred: &quot;The Invisible Playmate&quot;, recollections of his daughter, &quot;W.V.: Her Book&quot; and &quot;Rhymes About a Little Woman&quot;.

Canton completed his history in 1910, after which he devoted himself to children&#x27;s literature and historical works, including &quot;The Bible and the Anglo-Saxon People&quot; (1914) &quot;The Bible Story&quot; (1915).

He died at his home in Hendon on 2 May 1926.

==Poetry==
Canton&#x27;s early poetry was highly regarded in his lifetime for its attempt to represent in verse recent scientific theories, especially Darwinism, which he addressed in his poem &quot;Through the Ages&quot; (1879). Thomas Huxley supported Canton&#x27;s attempts to introduce scientific terminology into verse. The Sanskritist Max Müller also praised Canton&#x27;s works, writing that &quot;I look upon them as equal to Matthew Arnold&#x27;s poems, and having been an old friend and sincere admirer of Arnold, I could give no higher praise&quot;. Walter Pater, wrote to Canton that he gave expression to &quot;primeval, pre-adamite, or pre-historic subjects...you have certainly made their poetic side your own&quot;.

Canton&#x27;s later work was more religious in emphasis, but his output almost ceased after the death of his daughter. In 1913 Canton began a new religious poem &quot;The Mask of Veronica&quot;, but it was unfinished at his death.

<text>The Mayor of Jacksonville is the chief executive for the city of Jacksonville, Florida, and the administrator of Duval County. Jacksonville currently utilizes the strong mayor form of government in which the mayor currently has significant powers compared to the Jacksonville City Council. Ever since the land consolidation of Jacksonville as early as the late 19th century with the rest of Duval County, Florida the mayor was considered the administrator over the entire county, with the further consolidation in 1968 the mayor&#x27;s office officially serves as the executive administrator for the county. The incumbent is Donna Deegan, who was elected in the 2023 election.

==History==
The first mayor of Jacksonville, William J. Mills, was elected in 1832. A new city charter in 1841 changed the titled to &quot;Intendant&quot; until 1859 when it was changed back to mayor. The information on mayors of Jacksonville from 1832 to 1848 is limited, mostly due to the Great Fire of 1901 which destroyed some of the city&#x27;s records. Most of the information available today was taken from newspapers published during the period.

There was no election for mayor in 1840, nor during the Civil War in 1862, 1863, and 1864. During the Reconstruction era, mayoral elections resumed but the position had no real power, with the city being administered by the United States Military. There was no set amount of time in which one person can stay as mayor.

On May 31, 1887, the city instituted a new charter, annexing several suburbs, including LaVilla, Springfield, Riverside, Brooklyn, East Jacksonville, and Fairfield. The mayor&#x27;s term of office was also increased from one year to two. The mayor serving at the time, John Quincy Burbridge, had been elected on April 8 of that year, but the new charter required a new election to be held. On December 13, 1887, another election was held and Charles Bristol Smith, a Republican, won with support from members of the city&#x27;s large African American community. After this, local Democrats petitioned the Florida State Legislature to change the city charter once again in an effort to curb Republican and black participation in local politics. The result was that direct election of mayors in the city was abolished from 1889 until 1893. Mayors during this period were elected by the city council, who were appointed by the governor of Florida.

The city&#x27;s charter changed several times over the next several decades, and additional areas were annexed, expanding the city limits. The biggest change to local government, however, was the Jacksonville Consolidation, which took effect on October 1, 1968. In this measure, the Duval County and City of Jacksonville governments were consolidated, expanding the city limits to include almost the entire county. Mayor Hans Tanzler had just taken office on June 23, 1967; however, consolidation meant that he would have to run again for the office of mayor for the newly consolidated city government. Tanzler was re-elected and took office on March 1, 1968. Since that time mayors have been elected every four years. Voters in 1991 approved a two-term limit for Duval constitutional officers.

<text>Upplands storregemente or Landsregementet i Uppland (Uppland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Uppland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the late 1610s and split into smaller regiments in the 1620s.

==History==

Raised in Svealand from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the provinces of Uppland, Dalarna and Västmanland, in 1617 and counting 3,000 men. The regiment had six &quot;fänikor&quot; in 1617. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;) and a cavalry regiment, thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

The regiment did not take part in any campaign during its short lifetime. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the early 1620s to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment. It is unsure whether or not the cavalry regiment was included in the total number.

Between 1623 and 1626, the regiment was split into four smaller regiments, Uppland Regiment, Västmanland Regiment, Dalarna Regiment and &quot;Upplands ryttare&quot;.

== Campaigns ==
* None.

== Organization ==
Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Dalarna
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Uppland
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 6 companies from Västmanland
** 2 companies from Dalarna
* &quot;Kavalleriregementet&quot; (Cavalry Regiment)
** 8 companies from Uppland

<doc id="1032401" wikidata="Q133091" url="?curid=1032401" title="Rugosa">
<text>The Rugosa or rugose corals are an extinct order of solitary and colonial corals that were abundant in Middle Ordovician to Late Permian seas.

Solitary rugosans (e.g., &quot;Caninia&quot;, &quot;Lophophyllidium&quot;, &quot;Neozaphrentis&quot;, &quot;Streptelasma&quot;) are often referred to as &quot;horn corals&quot; because of a unique horn-shaped chamber with a wrinkled, or , wall. Some solitary rugosans reached nearly a meter (3 ft 3 in) in length. However, some species of rugose corals could form large colonies (e.g., &quot;Lithostrotion&quot;). When radiating septa were present, they were usually in multiples of four, hence &quot;Tetracorallia&quot; in contrast to modern &quot;Hexacorallia&quot;, colonial polyps generally with sixfold symmetry.

Rugose corals have a skeleton made of calcite that is often fossilized. Like modern corals (Scleractinia), rugose corals were invariably benthic, living on the sea floor or in a reef-framework. Some symbiotic rugose corals were endobionts of Stromatoporoidea, especially in the Silurian period. Although there is no direct proof, it is inferred that these Palaeozoic corals possessed stinging cells to capture prey. They also had tentacles to help them catch prey. Technically they were carnivores, but prey-size was so small they are often referred to as microcarnivores.
== Morphology ==

Rugose corals always show tabulae, horizontal plates that divide the corallite skeleton. The corallites are usually large relative to different types of coral. Rugose corals will sometimes have dissepiments, which are curved plates connected to septa and tabulae. The symmetry can be distinguished by the orientation of septa in a transverse section of the coral. Rugose corals always display bilateral symmetry whereas tabulate and scleractinian corals show radial symmetry. Initially there are only four major septa; later minor septa are added in the four resulting spaces. The complex arrangement of septa is diagnostic of rugose corals. Rugose corals will also always have a columella, an axial rod which supports the septa running up the center of the corallite. It is present in rugose corals because they were mainly solitary and so required the extra support. Tabulate corals have no columella because they were always colonial and relied on the support of neighboring corallites.

<text>Inkster was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was located in the northwestern corner of the city of Winnipeg. Officially created by redistribution in 1957, it has existed since the provincial election of 1958.

The riding was named after the Inkster family, who were prominent local figures at the time of the province&#x27;s creation in 1870. John Inkster was a member of Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government, while Colin Inkster was a member of the province&#x27;s Legislative Council (which existed from 1871 to 1876).

There were 19,246 persons living in the riding in 1996. Inkster had a broad range of income levels and a strong working-class presence (the manufacturing sector accounting for 23% of industry in 1999). Census reports from 1999 showed an average family income of $51,274, with 8.10% unemployment.

Inkster had the third-largest immigrant population of all ridings in the province, at over 30% of the total population. 21% of the riding&#x27;s residents are Filipino, 6% are Ukrainian, and 5% are East Indian. Only 4% of the population is above age 65.

Like many other north-end Winnipeg ridings, Inkster traditionally supported the New Democratic Party and its predecessor, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, although Liberal Kevin Lamoureux represented the riding for all but four years from 1988 to 2010. For the 2011 election, Inkster was dissolved into The Maples and the new riding of Tyndall Park.

<text>JuK is a free software audio player by KDE, the default player since K Desktop Environment 3.2. JuK supports collections of MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC audio files.

JuK was started by Scott Wheeler in 2000, and was originally called QTagger; however, it was not until 2002 that the application was moved into KDE CVS, where it has grown into a mature audio application. It was first officially part of KDE in KDE 3.2.

== Features ==
Though an able music player, JuK is primarily an audio jukebox application, with a strong focus on management of music, as shown by features such as:

* Collection list and multiple user defined playlists.
* Ability to scan directories to automatically import playlists (.m3u files) and music files on start up.
* Dynamic Search Playlists that are automatically updated as fields in the collection change.
* A Tree View mode where playlists are automatically generated for sets of albums, artists and genres.
* Playlist history to indicate which files have been played and when.
* Inline search for filtering the list of visible items.
* The ability to guess tag information from the file name or using MusicBrainz online lookup.
* File renamer that can rename files based on the tag content.
* ID3v1, ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis tag reading and editing support (via TagLib).

<text>The Uzbekistan national football team ( / ) represents Uzbekistan in international football and is controlled by the Uzbekistan Football Association, the governing body for football in Uzbekistan.

Uzbekistan holds the highest competitive results among teams from Central Asia. Although they have never qualified to the World Cup, the team has qualified for every AFC Asian Cup since post-independence formation. At the 2011 Asian Cup, Uzbekistan reached the semi-finals of the tournament for the first time. At other competitions such as the Asian Games, Uzbekistan won the gold medal in 1994 in Japan, while finishing as the runners-up at the Afro-Asian Cup of Nations in 1995.

== History ==

The year of birth of football in Uzbekistan is 1912 (read more in this article), since it was then that football teams were created in Kokand, a little later in Ferghana, Andijan, Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara and Urganch, between which began to be held long-distance matches. The first championship of Ferghana valley was held in 1914, the Championship of the Uzbekistan SSR began to be played since 1926, and the drawing of the Uzbekistan SSR Cup began to be carried out since 1939. From 1924 to 1991 Uzbekistan was part of the Soviet Union (USSR) as the Uzbekistan Soviet Socialist Republic (UzSSR).

In 1928, the national team of Uzbekistan was created for the first time, which took part in the Spartakiade, which included representatives of some European countries. At this tournament, the national team of Uzbekistan Soviet Socialist Republic held its first international match against team of jobs Switzerland and won with a score of 8:4. Until mid-1991, Uzbekistan was part of the USSR and had its own national team as well as the rest of the Union republics, which mostly played matches within teams and teams of the USSR, in particular in football tournaments of the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR. The national team of the Uzbekistan SSR participated in all draws of the football tournament of the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR, and in the 1986 tournament reached the final, lost to the Ukrainian SSR (modern Ukraine) team with a score of 0–1, thereby winning the silver medal of the tournament. Throughout the history of Soviet Union, Uzbekistan SSR was one of five main center of football development in the country, alongside Russia SFSR, Ukraine SSR, Belarus SSR and Georgia SSR.

The most powerful football clubs, as well as semi-professional and professional clubs of the Uzbekistan SSR participated in the USSR Football League (Higher League, First League, Second League and Second League B) and USSR Cup. Nonprofessional clubs of the Uzbekistan SSR participated in the Uzbekistan SSR Championship and the Uzbekistan SSR Cup.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and Uzbekistan gaining independence, the national team of Uzbekistan of the new convocation was organized. The national team held its first matches in 1992. The first game of the national team of Uzbekistan was a match against Tajikistan, in the framework of the Central Asian Cup 1992 (the tournament was held once) initiated by FIFA. These matches are officially registered by FIFA on the basis of the fact that the national team of Uzbekistan has been allowed since 1992 to participate in tournaments held under the auspices of FIFA. At the drawing of this tournament in the format of the league, the national team of Uzbekistan was the second after the national team of Kazakhstan. In the first year of existence, the national team of Uzbekistan held matches only with the teams of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In 1993, the team has not played a single match.

In 1992, Uzbekistan was also a member of the CIS national football team, which existed for one year and replaced the USSR national football team and instead participated in the Euro 1992.

Most of the former Soviet republics became members of UEFA (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan), and Uzbekistan also wanted to become a member of UEFA. But like the rest of the republics of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan), chose AFC. In 2002, Kazakhstan became a member of UEFA for better development of its football, but Uzbekistan chose to remain in the AFC.

In 1994, the Uzbekistan Football Federation was officially adopted by the AFC and FIFA. In the same year Uzbekistan won in the international tournament the Cup of Independence of Uzbekistan, and at the end of the year the national team won in the ending the national team of China with the score 4:2, became the winner of football tournament of the Asian Games of 1994 which took place in the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

=== 1990s ===
The 1994 Asian Games tournament was considered as the shocking successful birth of Uzbekistan, and gives prelude for the rise of Uzbekistan as a serious Asian contender. The tournament would go on remembered as &quot;Miracle of 1994&quot;.

Although the tournament was mostly for amateur players at the time (the under-23 competed only since 2002), Uzbekistan was not considered to be a favourite to win the tournament. In addition, the Uzbek team lacked support with only 17 players and a budget below $14.000 for the new born Football Federation. Conflict also emerged internally as Rustam Akramov was appointed as the head coach of Uzbekistan while the more popular Berador Abduraimov became assistant, which Abduraimov resented greatly. Not just that, many of its players, mostly Russian-ethnic based players, chose to represent Russia or Ukraine, or some to Nigeria, following the fall of USSR. The two major clubs, Pakhtakor and Neftchi, formed majority of their players for Uzbek team, traveling to Japan with little expectation.

Nonetheless, Uzbekistan would mark the tournament with an outstanding performance. Grouped with powerhouse Saudi Arabia, two Southeast Asian sides Thailand and Malaysia, alongside Hong Kong, the Uzbeks shocked Hiroshima with a 4–1 victory over the Saudis. It was followed by 5–0 victory over Malaysia, hard-fought 1–0 win over Hong Kong before sealing its first place in a 5–4 thriller over Thailand. In the quarter-finals, Uzbekistan crushed neighbor Turkmenistan 3–0 to advance to the semi-finals where they faced South Korea. The Korean side included nine players that had already participated in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was expected to steamroll Uzbekistan easily, having beaten hosts Japan in the previous match. However, Uzbekistan shocked South Korea with a 1–0 victory to advance to the final, its first ever final since gaining independence from the Soviet Union.

In their final game against China, Uzbekistan created its miracle, beating the rising Chinese side 4–2 to capture its first and only Asian honor two years after its creation. This miraculous conquest gave Uzbekistan a new fresh image, and would boost Uzbekistan&#x27;s position as a serious contender for future Asian competitions.

Uzbekistan overcame its rival and neighbor Tajikistan in an insane comeback. Having been beaten 0–4 away in Dushanbe, Uzbekistan looked like would miss its debut. Yet, Uzbekistan overturned the game at home, crushing Tajikistan 5–0 to win 5–4 on aggregate, thus giving Uzbekistan its first ever debut in the tournament. In 1996 AFC Asian Cup, Uzbekistan was grouped with Japan, China and Syria. Unlike the Asian Games, the Asian Cup was regarded as tougher because it consisted of professional teams. Under these conditions, Uzbekistan, which only appeared in the 1994 Asian Games, was regarded very low. Yet, in their opening game against China, Uzbekistan stunned all predictions. Despite rampant Chinese pressure, Uzbekistan held their nerves and overcame China with two shock late goals to give them a 2–0 win and its first ever points in the tournament. This shock victory of Uzbekistan, however, raised alarms for other opponents, Japan and Syria didn&#x27;t tolerate Uzbekistan, and destroyed the Uzbeks in the two decisive matches. Because of it, Uzbekistan stood bottom in their group and failed to make it through the first round.

Uzbekistan put a decent performance in the country&#x27;s first-ever attempt to qualify for World Cup, at the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. Grouped with Yemen, Cambodia and Indonesia in the first stage, Uzbekistan proved to be too strong for the rest, with the team only failed to win once, an away draw to the Indonesians. Shortly after, the Uzbeks gallantly marched into the final stage, however, things would prove to be more difficult, with Uzbekistan did not have luck in facing with more powerful South Korea, Japan and the UAE. The only win for Uzbekistan came after the match against neighbor Kazakhstan. Little to know for many Uzbek supporters, this would begin to make the country as the choker of every major World Cup qualifications, with the team often fell short in their final quest.

=== 2000s ===
The 2000 AFC Asian Cup for Uzbekistan was a whitewashed moment, in a terrible way as it became Uzbekistan&#x27;s worst ever performance in any major competition. Grouped again with Japan, Saudi Arabia and the new opponent Qatar, Uzbekistan was dumped in the bottom once more, with two devastating losses to Saudi Arabia and Japan, alongside its 1–1 draw to Qatar.

Uzbekistan participated in the first round in order to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea. As thing stood, Uzbekistan was able to dominate the group stage and qualify for the second round. The group contained themselves with China, the UAE, Oman and Qatar. The Uzbeks were unable to make any major breakthrough in the second round, losing twice to the Emirates, two away defeats toward China and Oman and an away draw to Qatar confirmed Uzbekistan&#x27;s failure to qualify, despite a late win over already qualified China in the final match.

Uzbekistan failed to make further impact on the continental stage until they reached the last eight of the 2004 Asian Cup, topping their group after winning all matches, where they were beaten by Bahrain after a penalty shoot-out.

That performance was followed by a victory over Iraq in the second qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, with goals from Maksim Shatskikh and Alexander Geynrikh sending them through to the last eight. They were knocked out in the final stage of the Asian qualification to the 2006 World Cup after losing on the away goals rule to Bahrain. The result was subject to controversy as actually three games were played; the first, a 1–0 win for Uzbekistan, was wiped out after FIFA declared the result void after a mistake by Toshimitsu Yoshida, a Japanese referee. The replay ended 1–1, and after the return finished 0–0, Uzbekistan were eliminated.

In the 2007 Asian Cup, Uzbekistan was able to get past the group stage by beating Malaysia 5–0 and China PR 3–0. However, Uzbekistan was knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals by losing to Saudi Arabia 2–1.

=== 2010s ===

After having three foreign coaches (German Hans-Jürgen Gede, Englishman Bob Houghton and Russian Valeri Nepomniachi) in three years, Uzbekistan turned to former Uzbekistan Olympic team coach Rauf Inileev. During qualification for the 2010 World Cup, Uzbekistan advanced to the fourth round of the Asian qualifiers after winning their first four matches, but finished last in Group A of the final round behind favorites Australia, Japan, Bahrain and Qatar, with four points from eight matches.
Four years later, in the 2011 Asian Cup, Uzbekistan ended in fourth place, their all-time best result in the tournament. After getting past the group stage and quarter-finals, the Uzbek team lost their first opportunity to reach the Asian Cup finals when Australia thrashed the team 0–6 in the semi-final game. Several days later, they were defeated again by South Korea in the third place match 3-2.

In qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Uzbekistan advanced to the fourth round of the Asian qualifiers after winning their group in the third round over perennial favorites Japan. Uzbekistan finished with 16 points (five wins and one draw), which was more than any other team in the third round, including an impressive 1–0 away win against Japan.

In the fourth round of the qualifiers, Uzbekistan finished third in Group A behind Iran and South Korea. Uzbekistan had the same number of points as South Korea (14 points), who had a better goal difference by one goal.

The two teams who finished third in the fourth round groups (Jordan and Uzbekistan) played each other in the fifth round to determine the AFC participant in the intercontinental play-off. The games took place on 6 and 10 September 2013. With the two teams still evenly matched at full-time in the second leg, Jordan eventually progressed to the intercontinental play-off after winning 9–8 on penalties.

In the 2015 Asian Cup, Uzbekistan advanced to the quarter-finals after finishing as runners-up in the tough Group B, which was won by China, while Saudi Arabia and North Korea were eliminated. However, the team was knocked out of the tournament in the quarter-finals after losing 2–0 in extra time to South Korea.

Uzbekistan continued their quest to head to the World Cup during 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification in Russia, but their campaign had been shattered with a humiliating 2–4 defeat to North Korea. However, the Uzbeks soon bounced back and won the last remaining matches to top the group and qualified to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup as well as the last round. Once again, Uzbekistan in the last round, missed an opportunity when they finished fourth, behind Iran, South Korea and Syria, when Uzbekistan could only manage a 0–0 draw to the South Koreans last match.
Uzbekistan started their 2019 Asian Cup campaign with a 2–1 victory over Oman and continued with a 4–0 win over neighbor Turkmenistan, which guaranteed Uzbekistan to progress from the group stage for the fifth consecutive time, despite ending with a 1–2 defeat to Japan in the last match. However, they had to face Australia, then-champions of Asia. Despite playing well, Uzbekistan could not break the deadlock as it ended 0–0 after 120 minutes. In the penalty shootout, Australia prevailed with a 4–2 win, thus Uzbekistan&#x27;s dream was crushed in the round of sixteen.

=== 2020s ===
In the second qualifying round for the 2022 World Cup, Uzbekistan suffered another disappointment by failing to qualify for the final round, a first since the Central Asian team had always reached the final round since it took part in the qualifying rounds of a World Cup, the first time being the 1998 edition. The &quot;White Wolves&quot; did not manage to finish among the five best runners-up, with a record of 5 wins against 3 defeats (in the first and second leg against Saudi Arabia, leader of group D, as well as in the first leg away against Palestine), in which the latter&#x27;s shock loss to Palestine proved detrimental. Moreover, Uzbekistan&#x27;s failure was also compounded by the fact that North Korea, originally competed in the qualification&#x27;s Group H of the same round, surprisingly withdrew due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which FIFA and AFC then ruled North Korea&#x27;s results as null and void, directly played a crucial role in helping other Group H opponent Lebanon to qualify ahead of Uzbekistan, since Lebanon&#x27;s original results against North Korea were poor with a draw and a loss.

Uzbekistan then took part in the third qualifying round for the 2023 Asian Cup. Designated as the host country of Group C (due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia), the Central Asians took advantage of this advantage and the relative weakness of most of their opponents to win all three games and finish top of their group without conceding a goal, validating their qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.

After qualifying for the Asian Cup, Uzbekistan was placed in Group B with familiar opponents Australia, as well as Syria and India. Prior to the tournament, Uzbekistan&#x27;s star striker and all-time top goalscorer Eldor Shomurodov sustained a leg injury, ruling him out of the squad. Uzbekistan drew 0-0 in their opening game against Syria. However, they bounced back in their second match against India, winning 3-0. In their last match against Australia, Uzbekistan drew 1-1 in a hard-fought draw that guaranteed them progression to the round of 16 as the second-placed team in their group. They faced Thailand, whom they managed to beat 2-1. In the quarter-finals, they faced hosts Qatar. After the score was level at 1-1 after extra time, Uzbekistan lost 3-2 in the penalty shoot-out.

== Team image ==
=== Nicknames ===

The Uzbekistan national team has received several nicknames by supporters and media. The most common one used is &quot;The White Wolves&quot; ( &quot;/ &quot;).

Also, the Uzbekistan national football team is called &quot;Asian Italy&quot; ( &quot;/ &quot;). This is due to the similarity of colors (white and blue) clothing teams of Italy and Uzbekistan, as well as similar tactics (defensive football) of these teams.

Also the team of Uzbekistan is called &quot;Huma birds&quot; ( &quot;/ &quot;). The mythical Huma bird is the national bird of Uzbekistan, and is depicted on the state emblem of Uzbekistan. The Huma bird is depicted on the emblem of the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

Sometimes the Uzbekistan national football is called &quot;Turanians&quot; ( &quot;/ &quot;), because the current country of Uzbekistan is located in the center of this ancient region Turan, and all the ancient and major cities of this region are located in this country, and therefore Uzbekistan is considered by some to be the successor of the Turan.

=== Rivalries ===

The main rivals of the Uzbekistan national team are the countries of Central Asia, the national teams of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, the main and most important rivals of the national team of Uzbekistan are Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The matches between the countries of Central Asia have always aroused great interest among fans throughout the region, in spite of Uzbekistan&#x27;s dominance since the fall of the USSR. Football is one of the instruments of rivalry between the states of Central Asia, dating back to the Soviet era.

Iran also became a fierce rival of the Uzbeks since the Persians joined the Central Asian Football Federation in 2015. Both teams played also in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers of Brazil 2014, Russia 2018, Qatar 2022 and in the recent qualification, 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Outside the Central Asia, the Uzbeks created some rivalries with East Asian nations like China and South Korea.

===Kit sponsorship===
The Uzbekistan team often wears a variety of competition jerseys. At major continental or world tournaments, team often wear eye-catching jersey that highlight the team&#x27;s identity. In qualifying tournaments, the team usually wears the normal plain jersey of the kit sponsor and only has the logo of the Uzbekistan Football Association printed on them.
== Home stadium ==
From the moment of its formation (1992) until the end of 2012, the main home stadium of the Uzbekistan national football team was the Pakhtakor Central Stadium in Tashkent, built and opened in 1956. This stadium is also the venue for home matches of Pakhtakor Football Club. During the USSR, this stadium was home for the Uzbekistan SSR national team. Was reconstructed in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and currently holds 35,000 spectators (before this capacity was 55,000 spectators). For today&#x27;s time the national team of Uzbekistan holds only some of the matches at Pakhtakor Stadium.

From 2013 to the present, the main home stadium of the Uzbekistan national team is Milliy Stadium (until 2018 was named Bunyodkor Stadium), built in 2008–2012 and accommodating 34,000 spectators. This stadium is also a home for the Bunyodkor Football Club.

<text>A Princess of Mars is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first of his Barsoom series. It was first serialized in the pulp magazine &quot;All-Story Magazine&quot; from February–July, 1912. Full of swordplay and daring feats, the novel is considered a classic example of 20th-century pulp fiction. It is also a seminal instance of the planetary romance, a subgenre of science fantasy that became highly popular in the decades following its publication. Its early chapters also contain elements of the Western. The story is set on Mars, imagined as a dying planet with a harsh desert environment. This vision of Mars was based on the work of the astronomer Percival Lowell, whose ideas were widely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Barsoom series inspired a number of well-known 20th-century science fiction writers, including Jack Vance, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and John Norman. The series was also inspirational for many scientists in the fields of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, including Carl Sagan, who read &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; when he was a child.

==Plot summary==
John Carter, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, goes prospecting in Arizona immediately after the war&#x27;s end. Having struck a rich vein of gold, he runs afoul of the Apaches. While attempting to evade pursuit by hiding in a sacred cave, he is mysteriously transported to Mars, called &quot;Barsoom&quot; by its inhabitants. Carter finds that he has great strength and superhuman agility in this new environment as a result of its lesser gravity and lower atmospheric pressure. He soon falls in with the Tharks, a nomadic tribe of Green Martians, as the planet&#x27;s warlike, six-limbed, green-skinned inhabitants are known. Thanks to his strength and martial prowess, Carter rises to a high position in the tribe and earns the respect and eventually the friendship of Tars Tarkas, one of the Thark chieftains.

The Tharks subsequently capture Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, a member of the humanoid red Martian race. The red Martians inhabit a loose network of city-states and control the desert planet&#x27;s canals, along which its agriculture is concentrated. Carter rescues Dejah Thoris from the green men in a bid to return her to her people.

Subsequently, Carter becomes embroiled in the political affairs of both the red and green Martians in his efforts to safeguard Dejah Thoris. He eventually raises a horde of Tharks and other tribes, and leads them against the city-state of Zodanga, the historic enemy of Helium. Winning Dejah Thoris&#x27; heart, he becomes Prince of Helium, and the two live happily together for nine years. However, the sudden breakdown of the Atmosphere Plant that sustains the planet&#x27;s waning air supply endangers all life on Barsoom. In a desperate attempt to save the planet&#x27;s inhabitants, Carter uses a secret telepathic code to enter the factory, bringing an engineer along who can restore its functionality. Carter then succumbs to asphyxiation, only to awaken back on Earth, left to wonder what has become of Barsoom and his beloved.

==Characters==
* John Carter: An Earth human from Virginia with a mysterious background, Captain John Carter fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side. At the end of the war in 1865 he goes prospecting for gold in Arizona. After various adventures, including an attack by Apaches, he is miraculously transported to Mars. During his nine years on that planet he effectively disappears from Earth and is believed dead, but he re-emerges in New York in 1876, settling in a house overlooking the Hudson River. He apparently dies again in 1886, leaving instructions for a fictionalized Burroughs, who refers to Carter as his Uncle Jack, to entomb him in a crypt. He also leaves Burroughs with the manuscript of &quot;A Princess of Mars,&quot; with instructions not to publish it for another 21 years. John Carter states that he has no memory before the age of 30 and has always appeared the same, without aging. He is adept at strategy, horsemanship, and all weapons, including firearms and swords. He is tall, clean-shaven, with close-cropped black hair and steel gray eyes. He is honorable, courageous, and eternally optimistic, even in the face of certain death. From the Green Martians he received the name &quot;Dotar Sojat&quot;, after the first two green warriors whom he slew after his advent on Barsoom. He sometimes uses this name as an alias in later books of the Martian series.
* Dejah Thoris: A red Martian princess of Helium, she is courageous, resolute, and frequently in mortal danger or under threat of dishonor by the evil designs of a succession of villains. She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, Jed (chieftain) of Lesser Helium, and the granddaughter of Tardos Mors, Jeddak (overlord or high king) of Helium. As such, she is highly aristocratic and fiercely proud of her heritage. Introduced early in the novel, she immediately becomes the love interest of John Carter. As a central character in the first three Barsoom novels, her frequent capture by various enemies, and subsequent pursuit by John Carter, is a constant motivating element in their plots.
* Tars Tarkas: A fierce Green Martian warrior from the Thark tribe, he is unusual among his race for his ability to experience tender emotions such as friendship and love. His emotional development stems from a forbidden love affair in his youth, when he secretly began a partnership with a Green Martian woman named Gozava. He befriends John Carter and later fights at his side. Carter helps him become Jeddak of Thark and negotiates an alliance between the Green Martians and the city-state of Helium, which results in the destruction of Helium&#x27;s enemy, Zodanga. Tars Tarkas more than once displays an ironic sense of humor; he mocks John Carter&#x27;s perception of himself as &quot;a cruel green warrior&quot; while fighting beside him, and in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; he comments on the disappointment of Barsoomian hopes for the afterlife.
* Tal Hajus: &quot;Jeddak&quot; (king) of the Tharks, who years previously had ordered Gozava&#x27;s death.
* Sola: Daughter of Tars Tarkas and a friend of John Carter, she teaches him the Barsoomian language and the history of her race, as well as the secret of her own parentage. She appears in the immediate sequels to &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, but has no role in later books of the series.
* Sarkoja: A Green Martian woman whose intrigues resulted in the death of Gozava and who schemes against John Carter. After Carter tells Tars Tarkas about her role in Gozava&#x27;s death, she is frightened into a self-imposed exile and never heard from again.
* Kantos Kan: A warrior of Helium who escapes a Warhoon prison with John Carter. By the beginning of the second book, Kantos Kan is the chief commander of Helium&#x27;s navy.

==Production==

===Background===
Burroughs began work on &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; in the summer of 1911 when he was 35. He wrote most of the first half of the novel while working for his brother in a stationery company, penning the words on scratch pads produced by the business. He had been struggling for some time to establish himself as a businessman, so far with little success, and with a wife and two children to support, turned to writing in desperate need of income. Despite failure in his business affairs, he had accumulated a wealth of unusual experiences from working in a variety of jobs which had brought him into contact with miners, soldiers, cowboys, and Native Americans.

===Initial drafting===
While writing &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, Burroughs initiated what soon became a regular writing tool: maintaining worksheets relating to the piece he was completing. The sheets included start and end dates of writing, titles of chapters, and characters. By August 11, 1911, he had completed a large section of the novel. He was apprehensive about revealing what he was working on, and told only his wife that he was doing so. He still hoped to find business success, and thought the tale to be indicative of a childish nature, and so outlandish that potential business contacts would think him ungrounded if they discovered what he was working on. At this point he had already decided to adopt the pen name of &quot;Normal Bean&quot;, an attempt to suggest that despite the incredible nature of his story, he was still a sane, reliable character. He struggled to find an appropriate title for the novel: &quot;My First Adventure of Mars&quot;, &quot;The Green Martians&quot;, and &quot;Dejah Thoris, Martian Princess&quot; were all early attempts to solve this problem.

===Submission for publication===
Before completing the novel, he considered options for publishing, and realized he knew little about this world or how to submit a story. Because he liked and was familiar with &quot;The All-Story&quot; magazine, he submitted 43,000 words to the editor under the title &quot;Dejah Thoris, Martian Princess&quot;. His cover letter explained that he thought he could produce another two parts of similar length. The Managing Editor of the magazine, Thomas Newell Metcalf, wrote back on August 24, 1911, to offer some criticisms of the pacing and focus of the tale, and suggested omitting the chapter &quot;Sola Tells Me Her Story&quot; (it was restored in the novel); he suggested that if Burroughs could finish the novel at under 70,000 words, he (Metcalf) would consider publishing it.

After further work on the novel, and further correspondence with Metcalf, which included suggestions for plot devices and structural changes, Burroughs submitted the finished novel. On November 4, 1911, Burroughs received an acceptance letter from Metcalf, offering US$400 for the serialization rights (), with the request to change the title and further edit the opening section of the novel.

==Publication==

===Serialization===

When Burroughs received his acceptance letter from Thomas Metcalf of &quot;The All-Story&quot;, Metcalf said that the serial would be published under the title &quot;In the Moons of Mars&quot;. However, when the first part of the serialization appeared in the February 1912 edition of &quot;The All-Story&quot;, it bore the title &quot;Under the Moons of Mars&quot;.

For the publication of the serial, Burroughs used the pen name &quot;Normal Bean&quot;, which he selected as a pun to stress that he was in his right mind, as he feared ridicule for writing such a fantastic story. The effect was spoiled by a typesetter who interpreted &quot;Normal&quot; as a typographical error and changed it to &quot;Norman&quot;.

===Book===
By 1914, Burroughs had become very popular with the reading public, and A.C. McClurg &amp; Company decided to print a number of his formerly serialized tales as novels. McClurg began with three Tarzan novels, and then published &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; on October 10, 1917. Although Metcalf thought that the chapter &quot;Sola Tells Me Her Story&quot; slowed the story&#x27;s pace, and thus omitted it from the magazine serialization, this chapter was restored for the novel version. The novel was illustrated by Frank E. Schoonover, who carefully read the descriptive passages on the costumes and weapons of Barsoom and developed an overall concept for the artwork, even ensuring that John&#x27;s Carter&#x27;s pistol and belt in his cover illustration reflected their origins in Green Martian craftsmanship.

===Rights===
&quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; was one of the few works for which Burroughs, in his inexperience as a new writer, relinquished all serialization rights. Others included the sequel &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;.

==Genre==
While the novel is often classed as science fantasy, it also belongs to the subgenre of planetary romance, which has affinities with fantasy and sword and sorcery; it is distinguished by its inclusion of scientific (or pseudo-scientific) elements. Planetary romances take place primarily on the surface of an alien world, and they often include sword-fighting and swashbuckling; monsters; supernatural elements such as telepathic abilities (as opposed to magic); and cultures that echo those of Earth in pre-industrial eras, especially with dynastic or theocratic social structures. Spacecraft may appear, but are usually not central to the story; this is a key difference from space opera, in which spacecraft are usually key to the narrative. While there are earlier examples of this genre, &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and its sequels are the best known, and they were a dominant influence on subsequent authors. Initially published in magazines with general readership, by the 1930s the planetary romance had become very popular in the emerging science fiction pulp magazines.

The novel can also be classified as the closely related genre sword and planet, which consists of what are essentially sword and sorcery stories that take place on another planet. &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; is widely considered to be the archetypal novel of the sword and planet genre.

The novel also shares a number of elements of Westerns, such as desert settings, women taken captive, and a climactic life-or-death confrontation with the antagonist.

==Introduction==

Burroughs employs a literary device for &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; to which he returned in several sequels—introducing the novel as though it were a factual account passed on to him personally. In this case he frames John Carter as an avuncular figure known to his family who has given him the manuscript earlier, and instructed him not to publish it for 21 years. Burroughs used the same device in the sequels, &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot;, &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot; and &quot;Swords of Mars&quot;. In &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot;, Burroughs even includes a reference to the chess games he played with his real life assistant, John Shea, while writing the novel.

==Style==
&quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; is similar to many of Burroughs&#x27; tales. Characterized by copious violent action, it is basically a travelogue, a tale of a journey and various encounters on that journey, which does not necessarily have a defined plot. It is also a captivity narrative, involving a civilized hero being captured by an uncivilized culture and being forced to adapt to the primitive nature of the captors to survive.

As is the case with the majority of the Barsoom novels to follow, it portrays a hero facing impossible odds and forced to fight a range of lurid creatures in order to win the love of the heroine. Burroughs&#x27; Barsoom is also morally unambiguous; there is no sense of moral relativity and characters are either good or evil. The tale portrays a hero with a sense of honor transcending race and politics. Compassion, loyalty and bravery are celebrated, and callousness, deception, and cowardice are frowned upon.

==Setting==
The novel&#x27;s vision of Mars was inspired by astronomical speculations of the time, especially those of Percival Lowell, who saw the planet as a formerly Earth-like world now becoming inhospitable to life because of its advanced age. According to the Barsoomians themselves, Mars was a lush world with global oceans just one million years before the present day. As the oceans evaporated and the atmosphere thinned, the planet devolved into partial barbarism. Living on a dying planet, with dwindling resources, the inhabitants of Barsoom have become hardened and warlike, constantly fighting one another to survive.

Barsoomians distribute scarce water via a worldwide system of canals, controlled by quarreling city-states. The thinning Martian atmosphere is artificially replenished by an &quot;atmosphere plant&quot; on which all life on the planet depends. The days are warm and the nights are cold, and climate varies little across the planet, except at the poles.

==Scientific background==
In 1895 Percival Lowell published a book entitled &quot;Mars&quot; which speculated about an arid, dying landscape, whose inhabitants had been forced to build canals thousands of miles long to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. Lowell built upon ideas introduced by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, who in 1877, observed geological features on Mars which he called canali (Italian for &quot;channels&quot;). This was mistranslated into the English as &quot;canals&quot; which, being artificial watercourses, fueled the belief that there was some sort of intelligent extraterrestrial life on the planet.

In the early 20th century Lowell published two more books, further developing the concept of a dying Mars. Burroughs was aware of these theories and appears to have consciously followed them. However, Burroughs does not seem to have based his vision of Mars on precise reading of Lowell&#x27;s theories, as there are a number of errors in his interpretation which suggest he may have got most of his information from reading newspaper articles and other popular accounts of Lowell&#x27;s Mars.

The ideas of canals with flowing water and an inhabited, if dying, world, were later disproved by more accurate observation of the planet, and fly-bys and landings by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions which found a dead, frozen world where water could not exist in a liquid state.

==Antecedents==
The first science fiction to be set on Mars may be &quot;Across the Zodiac: The Story of a Wrecked Record&quot;, by Percy Greg, published in 1880. An 1897 novel by Kurd Lasswitz, &quot;Auf Zwei Planeten&quot;, dealt with benevolent Martians arriving on Earth, but as it was not translated until 1971 it is unlikely that Burroughs knew of it.

H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898) was influenced, as was Burroughs&#x27; novel, by the ideas of Percival Lowell starting with publication of the book &quot;Mars&quot; (1895). It depicted Mars as an ancient world, nearing the end of its life, home to a superior civilization capable of advanced feats of science and engineering. Burroughs, however, claimed never to have read any of H. G. Wells&#x27; books.

It is possible, as Richard A. Lupoff argues in the book &quot;Master of Adventure: The Worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs&quot;, that Burroughs took some inspiration from the 1905 novel &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot;, by Edwin Lester Arnold, which also featured an American military man transported to Mars. Lupoff also suggested John Carter has strong similarities to Phra, hero of Arnold&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Phra the Phoenician&quot; (1890), who is also a master swordsman who appears to be immortal.

==Legacy==
This book and its series are noted as early inspirations for many later science fiction authors, including Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ray Bradbury. Bradbury admired Burroughs&#x27; stimulating romantic tales, and they were an inspiration for his &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (1950), which used some similar conceptions of a dying Mars. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Barsoom&quot; novels have also been cited as a model for H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;. Frederik Pohl paid homage to the novel in his short story &quot;Sad Solarian Screenwriter Sam&quot; (1972), although it is a backhanded compliment: the story so offends the actual Martians, they obliterate the Earth (as the Martians attempt to do in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells).

Others influenced by Burroughs and his John Carter books include James Cameron, who mentioned the influence on his science-fiction epic &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, and George Lucas, whose &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were influenced by Flash Gordon, which in turn was influenced by Burroughs.

Author Michael Crichton named a character on the TV medical drama series &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2009) after John Carter.

The John Barnes novel &quot;In the Hall of the Martian King&quot; (2003) features a Space Shuttle named &quot;John Carter&quot;. The ninth book in the Diane Duane Young Wizards series was entitled &quot;A Wizard of Mars&quot; (2010), in reference to the book.

Burroughs&#x27; Barsoom series was popular with American readers, helping inspire their support for the US Space Program, and also scientists who grew up on reading the novels. These include pioneers of space exploration research and the search for life on other planets. Scientist Carl Sagan read the books as a young boy, and they continued to affect his imagination into his adult years; he remembered Barsoom as a &quot;world of ruined cities, planet girding canals, immense pumping stations—a feudal technological society&quot;. For two decades, a map of the planet, as imagined by Burroughs, hung in the hallway outside of Sagan&#x27;s office in Cornell University.

Author-Illustrator Mark Rogers lampooned the Barsoom series in the second Samurai Cat book. The novels based on the TSR &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; RPG has a military academy on Mars called the John Carter Academy, which one of the characters in the franchise attends.

The Lin Carter Callisto stories are in part an homage to John Carter.

==Themes==

===The American frontier===
&quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; has many similarities to Westerns, including a desert setting, a heroine taken captive, and a showdown with the antagonist. Burroughs worked as a soldier at Fort Grant, Arizona, where he patrolled the desert to protect white settlers. During this time he gained a great respect for American Indians and their warriors, such as Geronimo. Barsoom resembles a kind of Martian Wild West. Indeed, John Carter is an adventuring frontiersman who is cornered by Apache warriors in the Arizona desert before his transition to Mars. When he arrives there, he discovers a savage, frontier world with scarce resources, where strength is respected, and where the civilized Red Martians maintain their racial vigor by repelling the constant attacks of the Green Martians. The barbaric and tribal Green Martians are depicted similarly to how Native Americans were stereotyped in Westerns. 

A nostalgic desire to return to the frontier became a common theme in the United States during the early twentieth century. In the Disney movie &quot;John Carter&quot;, Bryan Cranston portrays a U.S. Cavalry colonel who tries to convince John Carter to fight American Indians. As the nation become more urbanized, the 19th-century frontier was romanticized as a lost world of freedom and noble savagery. Similar ideas may be reflected in the fate of the ancient white race of Mars, which is mentioned in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and reintroduced in a later Martian novel, &quot;Llana of Gathol&quot;; they are described as having become weak and degenerate through their dependence on the trappings and comforts of civilization.

===Race===
Race is a constant theme in the Barsoom novels, as Barsoom is distinctly divided along racial lines. White, Yellow, Black, Red, and Green races appear in various novels of the series, each with ethnic qualities that often define their individual representatives. Although John Carter is able to befriend the Green Martian Tars Tarkas, who shows noble qualities, Tarkas is called an exception to the rule, and remains a noble savage. John Carter himself is white-skinned, so that Barsoomians sometimes identify him with their own surviving White race, known as the Holy Therns; for example, Carter successfully impersonates a Thern named Sator Throg in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot;. Carter&#x27;s unusual appearance and un-Barsoomian strength and agility make him a kind of mythic figure, capable of achievements that no Barsoomian could manage.

====Red Martians====
The Red Martians have created the dominant culture on Barsoom. They are organized into imperial city-states that control the planetary canal system, as well as more isolated states in the hinterlands.

The Red Martians are hybrids of the ancient Yellow Martians, White Martians, and Black Martians, who joined forces when the seas of Barsoom began to dry up; their union created a hardy race capable of surviving in a dying world.

They are, like all the humanoid races of Mars, oviparous, i.e., their newborn hatch from eggs.

The Red Martians, like the Green Martians, eschew clothing, going nude except for jewelry and other ornamentation. In Chapter 11, Dejah Thoris derides Earth men, who &quot;almost without exception, cover their bodies with strange, unsightly pieces of cloth.&quot;

The Red Martians are honorable and highly civilized; they respect private property and have a keen sense of fairness. Their culture is lawful and technologically advanced, and they are capable of love and family life. The chief crime in their cities is assassination.

====Green Martians====
The Green Martians are tall, Burroughs wrote, adding from John Carter&#x27;s observation of newly hatched children,

They are nomadic, warlike, and barbaric; do not form families; have discarded concepts of friendship and affection (presumably in the name of survival); and enjoy torture. Their social structure is communal and rigidly hierarchical, with various levels of chiefs. The highest rank is the all-powerful Jeddak, who reaches this position through combat. They are tribal, and war among one another. They are primitive, intellectually backwards, and have no art or written language. Any advanced technology they possess is stolen from the Red Martians. They inhabit the ancient ruined cities of Barsoom.

==Copyright==
The copyright for this story has expired in the United States and, thus, resides in the public domain there. The text is available from Project Gutenberg and Wikisource. In anticipation of the 2012 Disney film &quot;John Carter&quot;, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. trademarked the phrases &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot;, &quot;Princess of Mars&quot;, and &quot;Barsoom&quot;, among others, despite the &quot;Dastar&quot; decision of the United States Supreme Court, which invalidates trademark on public domain works.

Except for Guatemala, Honduras, Samoa, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Mexico, Burroughs&#x27; works, including &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, has entered public domain in the rest of the world.

==Film adaptations==
The Asylum released a feature-length direct-to-DVD film based on the novel, titled &quot;Princess of Mars&quot;, on December 29, 2009.

A full-length feature film of the novel had been attempted and aborted many times. Its working title was originally &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, but it was renamed &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; and then simply &quot;John Carter&quot; during pre-production. It was originally due in 2006, with Jon Favreau (&quot;Zathura&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;) as director and Harry Knowles of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; as producer. &quot;John Carter&quot; was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and directed by Andrew Stanton. Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins, who appeared together in the 2009 movie &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, play John Carter and Dejah Thoris. Willem Dafoe, Polly Walker, and James Purefoy play Tars Tarkas, Sarkoja, and Kantos, respectively. The film&#x27;s U.S. release date was March 9, 2012.

<text>Lindewerra is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany. It is part of the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Hanstein-Rusteberg. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 Lindewerra was one of the few villages in the German Democratic Republic that could be observed directly from the West. After the fall of the Berlin Wall a bridge was built to connect the village to the Hessian bank of the Werra River.

<text>This Is the Law was a Canadian panel game show which aired on CBC Television from 1971 to 1976.

==Description==
It presented short, humorous vignettes supposedly set in various towns and cities across Canada which ran with musical accompaniment rather than a soundtrack, and challenged panellists to guess which (obscure) law of that particular region was being broken by the &quot;Lawbreaker&quot; character who was always arrested at the end of the vignette. 

The vignettes were quite subtle, and more often than not, despite many guesses, the panellists were unable to come up with the law that was actually being broken, because the laws featured were generally archaic but, at the time of production, still on the books in the featured communities. (An example: in one vignette, the Lawbreaker is seen wearing a caveman-style costume at an event and engages in dubious behaviour before being suddenly arrested. After the panel failed to correctly identify the indiscretion, Willis indicated it was because the Lawbreaker&#x27;s costume did not fully cover his chest, and in the Canadian locale where the vignette was set, it was illegal for individuals of any gender to expose their nipples in public.)

The vignettes alternated with depictions of actual court cases, presented in a series of still cartoons, in storyboard format, with narration. The narrator would end by asking a question about how the judge eventually ruled. The four panellists would each guess what the judge decided, and why, and each panellist would conclude by lighting up a large &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; in front of his or her seat. After all four panellists had guessed, the answer would be revealed.

Robert Warner starred as the police officer, and Paul Soles portrayed the Lawbreaker. Soles was the first show host, but after the initial 1971 summer episodes, Austin Willis became host, from the regular 1971 fall season until the end of the series.

<doc id="1032452" wikidata="Q334255" url="?curid=1032452" title="Robert Knox (sailor)">
<text>Robert Knox (8 February 1641 – 19 June 1720) was an English sea captain in the service of the British East India Company. He was the son of another sea captain, also named Robert Knox.

==Life ==
Born at Tower Hill in London, the young Knox spent most of his childhood in Surrey and was taught by James Fleetwood, later the Bishop of Winchester. He joined his father&#x27;s crew on the ship &quot;Anne&quot; for his first voyage to India in 1655, at the age of 14, before returning to England in 1657. That year, Oliver Cromwell issued a charter granting the East India Company a monopoly of the Eastern trade, requiring the elder Knox and his crew to join the service of the Company.

The two Knoxes sailed for Persia in January 1658. They suffered the loss of the ship&#x27;s mast in a storm on 19 November 1659, forcing them to put ashore on Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. The ship was impounded and sixteen of the crew, including the Knoxes, were taken captive by the troops of the ruler of Kandy, Rajasinghe II. The elder Knox had inadvertently angered the king by not observing the expected formalities and had the misfortune to do so during a period of conflict between the king and the Dutch East India Company. Although the crew was forbidden from leaving the kingdom, they were treated fairly leniently; the younger Knox was able to establish himself as a farmer, moneylender and pedlar. Both men suffered severely from malaria and the elder Knox died in February 1661 after a long illness.

Robert Knox eventually escaped with one companion, Stephen Rutland, after nineteen years of captivity. The two men were able to reach Arippu, a Dutch fort on the north-west coast of the island. The Dutch treated Knox generously and transported him to Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, from where he was able to return home on an English vessel, the &quot;Caesar&quot;. He arrived back in London in September 1680.

During the voyage Knox wrote the manuscript of &quot;An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon&quot;, an account of his experiences on Ceylon, which was published in 1681. Recently, this book has been translated into the Sinhala language as &quot;Knox Dutu Lakdiva&quot; by Premachandra Alwis. The book was accompanied by engravings showing the inhabitants, their customs and agricultural techniques. It attracted widespread interest at the time and made Knox internationally famous, influencing Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; as well as sparking a friendship with Robert Hooke of the Royal Society. It is one of the earliest and most detailed European accounts of life on Ceylon and is today seen as an invaluable record of the island in the 17th century.
Knox became a close friend and collaborator of Robert Hooke, for whom he frequently brought back gifts from his travels. In return, Hooke took Knox to the local coffeehouses for chocolate and tobacco, then considered luxuries. On one occasion, Knox presented Hooke with samples of &quot;a strange intoxicating herb like hemp&quot; which he dubbed &quot;Indian hemp&quot; or &quot;Bangue&quot;; it is better known today as &quot;Cannabis indica&quot;, a plant which was unknown at the time in Europe. Hooke gave an address to the Society in December 1689 in which he provided what was the first detailed description of cannabis in English, commending its possible curative properties and noting that Knox &quot;has so often experimented it himself, that there is no Cause of Fear, tho&#x27; possibly there may be of Laughter.&quot; Knox also described termites, bees and ants in Ceylon. Knox was present when Hooke died on 3 March 1703 after a long illness and took on the responsibility of arranging his friend&#x27;s burial.

Knox continued to work for the East India Company for thirteen years after his return from the East, captaining the ship &quot;Tonqueen Merchant&quot; for four further voyages to the East. He enjoyed only mixed success and quarrelled with the company, which eventually dismissed him in 1694. Four years later he set himself up on his own trading vessel, the &quot;Mary&quot;, but the venture was not a success. He returned permanently to England in 1701 and spent his retirement writing about Ceylon and his life. He died, prosperous but unmarried, at St Peter le Poer in the City of London in June 1720 and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon.

<text>Bucky O&#x27;Hare is an arcade game produced by Konami in 1992.

==Gameplay==
This video game is based on the cartoon television series &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Wars&quot; under license from Hasbro, Inc. While it is generally classified as a scrolling beat &#x27;em up game, as the player&#x27;s character is also armed with a laser gun, it adds elements of a scrolling shooter.

Much like the cartoon, &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; features colorful animation, and voice actors from the series were hired to participate in the game&#x27;s cut scenes.

The player chooses from four protagonists: Bucky O&#x27;Hare, the heroic rabbit captain of the space ship &quot;Righteous Indignation&quot;; Jenny, an &quot;Aldebaran cat&quot; and telepath; Dead-Eye Duck, a four-armed mallard; and Blinky, a one-eyed android. As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as &quot;Komplex&quot; and release the &quot;Interplanetary Life Force&quot;.

The enemies in the game are Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror Toad, a &quot;Cyborg Spider&quot;, the various varieties of Toad Storm Troopers, the Toads&#x27; Air Marshall, and &quot;Komplex-2-Go&quot;, who are featured in the comic book and cartoon series continuities.

==Soundtrack==
The music for Arcade &quot;Bucky &#x27;O Hare&quot; were: &quot;Planet Warren&quot;, &quot;Climate Converter&quot;, &quot;Space River&quot;, &quot;Toad Star&quot; and &quot;Komplex&quot; was contained on the CD Soundtrack &quot;Konami All-Stars 1993: Music Station of Dreams&quot; on December 24, 1992.

== Reception ==
&quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot; to be the third most-popular arcade game at the time.

<doc id="1032461" wikidata="Q7337692" url="?curid=1032461" title="River Pang">
<text>The River Pang is a small chalk stream river in the west of the English county of Berkshire, and a tributary of the River Thames. It runs for approximately from its source near the village of Compton to its confluence with the Thames in the village of Pangbourne.

The river, and its water voles, are thought to have inspired author Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s character Ratty and his book &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

==Course==
The river&#x27;s source is normally near the village of Compton, although the exact location varies depending on rainfall levels. In times of high rainfall it can be traced back to Farnborough, some four miles to the west-north-west, whilst at other times it may be as far downstream as the outfall from Hampstead Norreys sewage works.

From Compton the Pang flows south through the villages of Hampstead Norreys and Frilsham, before turning east to flow through the villages of Bucklebury, Stanford Dingley and Bradfield.

To the east of Bradfield the Pang is joined by the River Bourne and turns north to flow through the villages of Tidmarsh and Pangbourne, eventually entering the Thames between Whitchurch Lock and Whitchurch Bridge.

The valley of the River Pang between Compton and Bradfield is rather isolated, penetrated only by narrow country lanes. Because of this isolation, the valley has not become the residential commuter area that is much of Berkshire, and is still largely agricultural.

==Wildlife==
The Pang contains American signal crayfish, which have displaced the native white-clawed crayfish species.

The Berks, Bucks and Oxon Wildlife Trust owns a nature reserve straddling the Pang at Moor Copse, close to the village of Tidmarsh. A extension to the nature reserve, in the area that is believed to have inspired Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s work, was purchased in December 2006.

In August 2007 a coalition of the WWF, the National Trust, the RSPB and others called on the British government to adopt their Blueprint for Water. To publicize their campaign they highlighted the dangers to sites well known through literature such as The Lake District (Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; and Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Tiggy-Winkle&quot;), the North Kent Marshes (Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;) and the River Pang.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the River Pang in 2019:
==Etymology==
The river is named after a man, thought to be an early Saxon chieftain, or tribe called Pǣga who lived there in the post-Roman era.

<text>Discovery Park is a park on the shores of Puget Sound in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. As the city&#x27;s largest public park, it contains of walking trails. The Discovery Park Loop Trail, designated a National Recreation Trail in 1975, runs through the park, connecting to other trails. Forests, beaches, prairies, and bluffs dominate the landscape of the park. Daybreak Star Cultural Center is within the park&#x27;s boundaries. The West Point Lighthouse is located on West Point, the westernmost point of the park and the entire city of Seattle. On the south side of the North Beach strip is the West Point Treatment Plant which is almost entirely concealed from the marsh, beach, and trail.

The park is built on the historic grounds of Fort Lawton; most of the Fort Lawton Historic District (FLHD) falls within the park (an enclave within the district remains in military hands). Both the FLHD and the lighthouse are on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Description==

The park is one of the best places in the city to view wildlife, especially birds and marine mammals. The Seattle Audubon Society has compiled a checklist of 270 species of birds seen in the park and nearby waters. Elliott and Shilshole Bays are home to harbor seals and California sea lions, while the wooded areas support Townsend&#x27;s chipmunks. Most visitors enjoy hiking the Loop Trail, which forms a circuit through forest, meadow, and shrub habitats around the upland portion of the park, and provides excellent views of Puget Sound. Many historical buildings stand in semi disrepair in the main grassy area. The shoreline is accessible by road or trail (the hike back up from the north beach is mildly strenuous), however, a permit is required prior to driving a vehicle to the beach. Free permits can be obtained at the Environmental Learning Center in the East Parking Lot and are designated for qualified individuals only (groups with children 7 and under, seniors 62+, and people with a physical disability). The south beach is on the windward side of the peninsula, Elliott Bay, and the north beach is on the leeward side and has views of Shilshole Bay. At the point between the north and south beaches is West Point and the West Point Lighthouse. Coniferous forest is mostly to be found in the north bluff region and can be accessed from the road that leads to the beach. Deciduous woods surround the two parking lots and the visitor center. Overlooking the south bluff is a large meadow with small trees and shrubs. Bigleaf maple, red alder, bitter cherry, Douglas-fir, western red cedar, and western hemlock make up a large percentage of the tree cover in the park. Invasive species such as Himalayan blackberry, Scot&#x27;s broom, English ivy, and holly are present throughout, requiring active on-going management to suppress.
==History==

Discovery Park was created in the early 1970s from land surplus to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Lawton. The site for the fort had been given to the Army by the city in 1898, and the fort opened in 1900. The Army offered to sell it back to the city for one dollar in 1938 but the city refused, citing maintenance concerns. Much of the land was surplused in 1971, given to the city in 1972, and dedicated as Discovery Park in 1973 in honor of the British sloop HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;, commanded by Captain George Vancouver during the first European exploration of Puget Sound in 1792. Fort Lawton continued as an Army Reserve facility until it was officially closed at a ceremony on February 25, 2012.


In 2004, the City of Seattle announced it would purchase 23 (later 24) acres of U.S. Navy property within the park. The decision was made to demolish the structures to create open space. In 2008, plans to close Army base Fort Lawton opened up debate over what to do with the former military properties: housing advocates wanted it converted into affordable housing, while some neighborhood groups opposed the idea. The City Council approved building up to 216 housing units, leading to a lawsuit. As of March 2009, the King County Superior Court Judge ordered the city to comply with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process.

In 2008, a group of homeless people and homeless rights advocates set up camp in the park, but was forced to vacate by the city.

In September 2010, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved October 10, 2008 Proposed Redevelopment Plan and Homeless Assistance Application for the US Army Ft. Lawton Complex. The HUD letter to the mayor of Seattle stated the need for homeless housing outweighed the need for other redevelopment proposals and that 144 family housing units and over 2000 beds in &quot;supportive&quot; permanent housing should be built and that HUD was ready to assist the city of Seattle, if required.

The park attracts wild animals. In the winter of 2008-2009, a coyote in the park made headlines, and in May 2009, a black bear was seen. In September 2009, the park was closed because of the presence of a cougar. The animal was trapped and transported to the Cascade mountains.

The beach has a history of sporadic clothing-optional use in the more remote areas of its shoreline. This use is not sanctioned by the city. A beach rally organized by The Body Freedom Collaborative&#x27;s Seattle Free Beach Campaign on September 4, 2004 to shore support for clothing-optional use resulted in the arrest of a man sunbathing, after a complaint was made to the Seattle Police.

==In popular culture==
The Grunge band Temple of the Dog filmed the music video for their hit single &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; on the shores of Discovery Park.

<doc id="1032464" wikidata="Q7075547" url="?curid=1032464" title="Obstructing the field">
<text>Obstructing the field is one of the ten methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. Either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. It is Law 37 of the Laws of cricket, and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed; in the history of cricket, there has been only two instances in Test matches, nine in One Day International (ODI) matches, and six in Twenty20 International matches. There have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball, a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field.

One modern pattern of obstruction in limited overs cricket occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be run out and blocks the ball with his bat, or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate.

==Definition==
Obstructing the field is Law 37 in the Laws of cricket established by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for obstructing the field if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.

Law 37 describes three specific circumstances where this applies, but the Law is not limited to these circumstances:
*If, in the act of playing the ball, the batsmen wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, unless this is to avoid injury.
*If either batsman should wilfully obstruct or distract a fielder preventing a catch being made.
*If, at any time while the ball is in play and without the consent of a fielder, he uses his bat or any part of his person, to return the ball to any fielder.

In the second specific case, the striker is out, as it would have been him who could have been caught were it not for the obstruction. In any other case it is the batsman who obstructs who is out .

If a batsman deliberately alters his course whilst running, or interposes his bat, to block the path of a ball thrown at the stumps by a fielder, the umpire must decide whether the action is wilful. The umpire does not have to judge whether the fielding would have been likely to effect a Run out.

The bowler does not get credit for any obstruction dismissal. Any runs completed before the offence is committed are scored (unless the obstruction prevents a catch being made).

==Returning the ball to a fielder==

When, after being played with the bat or hitting the batter, the ball comes to rest nearer the batter that any fielder, it may seem natural, polite and quickest for the batter to pick up the ball and give it to a fielder. There is some risk that the fielding team may construe the act to be a wilful obstruction.

Traditionally, a batter would ask the fielding team&#x27;s consent to touch the ball before doing so, but even if not, if there were any goodwill between the teams, the fielding team would be unlikely to appeal, and unlikely to have their appeal confirmed by their captain, but the umpire would be obliged to give the batsman out if an appeal was made. Batters were advised to ask to avoid the possibility of &#x27;unpleasantness.&#x27; 

In the modern professional game the question is sensitive, as the fielding side may be trying to keep the ball dry and clean so that they may obtain reverse swing, and may well decline the batter&#x27;s offer to touch the ball. 

The first such dismissal in elite cricket was in an U19 World Cup game against Zimbabwe on 3rd Feb 2024 when England&#x27;s Hamza Shaikh picked up a stationary ball that he had just played at, and tossed it to the wicketkeeper, who appealed before even catching the ball. Shaikh was given out after lengthy consultation between the onfield and third umpires. Commentators have been uncomfortable with the decision, but the umpires only have to decide whether the ball is in play (if the fielding side acted as if they regarded it as so, that is sufficient) and whether the batter&#x27;s action was wilful (picking the ball up without consent is sufficient). 

==Earliest recorded instance==
The first known instance of a player being dismissed in a manner equivalent to the modern term &#x27;Obstructing the field&#x27; occurred in a minor match at Sheffield on 27 August 1792, between Sheffield Cricket Club and Bents Green. The Bents Green player John Shaw, who scored 7 in the first innings, had his dismissal recorded as &quot;run out of the ground to hinder a catch&quot;. The information was recorded by G. B. Buckley who found it in the &quot;Sheffield Advertiser&quot; dated 31 August 1792. Sheffield won by 10 wickets in a match that was notable for two other reasons, these being that it was the first match played in Yorkshire for which full scores are recorded and it was the earliest known instance of a three innings match.

==Dismissals in international cricket==
===Test cricket===
Two batsmen have been dismissed obstructing the field in a Test match. The first time was during the fifth Test match of South African cricket team&#x27;s tour of England in 1951, when England&#x27;s Len Hutton top edged the ball and, thinking the ball would hit the stumps, attempted to hit the ball away which prevented the wicket-keeper from catching the ball. In the second instance, from the second Test of New Zealand&#x27;s tour of Bangladesh in December 2023, Mushfiqur Rahim defended a ball from Kyle Jamieson and then pushed the ball away with his right hand as it bounced away from the stumps. He also became the first batsman in test to get out by obstructing the field since the rule for handling the ball was included in this law in October 2017.
===One Day Internationals===
In One Day Internationals, Rameez Raja (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) was given out for hitting the ball away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and Mohinder Amarnath (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is Inzamam-ul-Haq of Pakistan in the first ODI of India vs Pakistan Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian Suresh Raina threw it back to the striker&#x27;s end, Inzamam stopping it with his bat while standing out of his crease. Umpire Simon Taufel gave him out adjudging it a wilful obstruction.

Mohammad Hafeez of Pakistan was dismissed obstructing the field on 21 March 2013 in the 4th ODI of the bilateral series match against South Africa. He became the first man to be given out obstructing the field after the new playing conditions were introduced. His teammate, Anwar Ali, was dismissed obstructing the field on 27 November 2013 in the second ODI against South Africa.

Ben Stokes of England was dismissed obstructing the field on 5 September 2015 in the second ODI against Australia for stopping the ball with his hand when the bowler, Mitchell Starc, had thrown the ball in an attempt to run him out. Stokes was outside the crease when he stuck out his hand not holding the bat, blocking the ball which was on a path likely to hit the stumps.

The complete list of batsmen given out obstructing the field in One Day Internationals is:

===Women&#x27;s One Day Internationals===

===T20 Internationals===
On 23 June 2017, in a Twenty20 match against South Africa, Jason Roy of England was given out obstructing the field, for changing the side of the pitch he was running on when returning from backing up. This caused the returned ball to hit him when he was out of his crease, when it could conceivably have hit the stumps. The South African fielders immediately appealed for a dismissal. Responding to this, the on-field umpires called the ball dead and referred the decision to the third umpire, who gave Roy out.

The complete list of batsmen given out obstructing the field in Twenty20 Internationals is:

===Women&#x27;s T20 Internationals===
Indian middle-order batter Anuja Patil was given out obstructing the field in the first innings of the final of the 2018 Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Asia Cup against Bangladesh. She changed the course of her run en route to the non-striker&#x27;s end while attempting a single.

Zimbabwean captain Mary-Ann Musonda was given out obstructing the field in the first innings of a game against Uganda during the 2022 Namibia Women&#x27;s Tri-Nation Series in April 2022. She defended a ball from Janet Mbabazi which then rebounded towards her stumps, then gently hit the ball back to Mbabazi while remaining in her crease at all times.

==Other recent instances==
Mark Ramprakash was dismissed obstructing the field on 30 July 2011, in a County Championship Division 2 match between Surrey and Gloucestershire. Ramprakash was deemed to have deliberately tried to distract a fielder who was in the act of trying to run him out. He made no contact with the ball and it did not hit the stumps.

Yusuf Pathan of India was dismissed obstructing the field on 15 May 2013 while playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders against the Pune Warriors India in Match 65 of the 2013 Indian Premier League for deliberately kicking the ball while rotating the strike. He became the first player to be dismissed in T20 cricket in this fashion.

Sheldon Jackson was given out obstructing the field on 3 March 2017 during the 2016–17 Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Chhattisgarh. Jackson became only the second Indian batsman to be given out in a List A match in this manner.

Alex Ross of the Brisbane Heat was given out obstructing the field in a Big Bash League match against the Hobart Hurricanes in January 2018 for interfering with an attempted run out. It was the first time in Big Bash League history that a player was given out in this manner.

Ryan Burl was given out in a match in the 2017–18 Logan Cup for obstructing the field, after he protected his wicket by pushing the ball away from the stumps with his hand, having missed the ball with his bat. 

Amit Mishra was also dismissed for obstructing the field in the 2019 Indian Premier League Eliminator match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. He changed his line while Khaleel Ahmed was throwing the ball to prevent a run out, and was thus given out.

<text>Arnold (Arnoul) of [[Soissons]] or Arnold or Arnulf of [[Oudenburg]] (c. 1040–1087) is a saint of the Catholic Church, the patron saint of hop-pickers, Belgian brewers.

==Biography==
Arnold, born in Brabant, the son of a certain Fulbertus was first a career soldier before settling at the Benedictine St. Medard&#x27;s Abbey, Soissons, France. He spent his first three years as a hermit, but later rose to be abbot of the monastery. His hagiography states that he tried to refuse this honor and flee, but was forced by a wolf to return. He then became a priest and in 1080, bishop of Soissons, another honor that he sought to avoid. When his see was occupied by another bishop, rather than fighting, he took the opportunity to retire from public life, founding the Abbey of St. Peter in Oudenburg.

As abbot in Oudenburg, Arnold brewed beer, as essential in medieval life as water. He encouraged local peasants to drink beer, instead of water, due to its &quot;gift of health&quot;. During the process of brewing the water was boiled and thus freed of pathogens, making the beer safer to drink. The beer normally consumed at breakfast and during the day at this time in Europe was called small beer, having a very low alcohol content, and containing spent yeast. It is likely that people in the local area normally consumed small beer from the monastery, or made their own small beer at the instructions of Arnold and his fellow monks. During one outbreak of sickness, Arnold advised the local people to avoid consuming water, in favor of beer, which advice effectively saved lives.

One miracle tale says, at the time of an epidemic, rather than stand by while the local people fell ill from drinking water, Arnold had them consume his monastery brews. Because of this, many people in his church survived the plague. This same story is also told of Arnulf or Arnold of Metz, another patron of brewers.

==Legacy==
There are many depictions of St. Arnold with a mashing rake in his hand, to identify him. For example, the label on &quot;Steenbrugge Abbey&quot; beers has a picture of St Arnold holding a mash rake.

Arnold is honoured in July with a parade in Brussels on the &quot;Day of Beer.&quot;

Miracles that were reported at his tomb were investigated and approved by a council at Beauvais in 1121; in 1131 Arnold&#x27;s relics were transferred to the in Aldenburg. St. Arnold&#x27;s feast day is 14 August.

<text>Södermanlands storregemente or Landsregementet i Södermanland (Södermanland Grand Regiment, Regiment of the Land in Södermanland) was one of the nine grand regiments organized by Gustavus Adolphus in 1614 with foot soldiers from Värmland and Närke. This unit was divided as early as 1627, one of which later became the Södermanland Regiment.

== History ==

Raised in Svealand from smaller units of 500 men called &quot;fänikor&quot;, more specifically from the provinces of Södermanland, Närke and Värmland, in 1614 and counting 3,000 men. The grand regiment was in turn organized into three field regiments (&quot;fältregementen&quot;) and a cavalry regiment, thus actually being more like a brigade in spite of the name.

The Scot Alexander Leslie led the regiment between 1622 and 1624. The grand regiments of Sweden where reorganized during the period to consist of three field regiments, each of eight companies of 150 men, thus making the total number 3,600 soldiers per grand regiment. It is unsure whether or not the cavalry regiment was included in the total number.

Between 1624 and 1627, the regiment was split into three smaller regiments, &quot;Södermanlands regemente&quot;, &quot;Närkes regemente&quot; and &quot;Värmlands regemente&quot; (these two were soon after merged into the Närke-Värmland Regiment) and the cavalry unit &quot;Svenska adelsfanan&quot;.

== Campaigns ==
*None.

== Organization ==

Before being split, the regiment was organized as follows:

* &quot;1:a fältregementet&quot; (1st Field Regiment)
** 5 companies from Närke
** 3 companies from Vadsbo-Valle Härad (in Västergötland)
* &quot;2:a fältregementet&quot; (2nd Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Värmland
* &quot;3:e fältregementet&quot; (3rd Field Regiment)
** 8 companies from Södermanland
* &quot;Kavalleriregementet&quot; (Cavalry Regiment)
** 10 companies from different parts of Sweden

<doc id="1032478" wikidata="Q3067853" url="?curid=1032478" title="Federal Air Marshal Service">
<text>The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the supervision of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Because of the nature of their occupation, federal air marshals (FAMs) travel often. They must also train to be highly proficient marksmen. A FAM&#x27;s job is to blend in with other passengers on board aircraft and rely heavily on their training, including investigative techniques, criminal terrorist behavior recognition, firearms proficiency, aircraft-specific tactics, and close quarters self-defense measures to protect the flying public.

==History==
In 1961, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., presented the idea of armed security forces on commercial flights. President John F. Kennedy ordered federal law enforcement officers to be deployed to act as security officers on certain high-risk flights. The Federal Air Marshal Service began on March 2, 1962, as the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) &quot;FAA Peace Officers Program.&quot; On this date, the first 18 volunteers from the FAA&#x27;s Flight Standards Division graduated training. They received training from the U.S. Border Patrol at Port Isabel, Texas, and later went through recurrent yearly training in Brownsville, Texas. These initial FAA peace officers were named by FAA Administrator Najeeb Halaby. Later, it became an integral part of the Civil Aviation Security Division of the FAA. As early as 1963, after an article in &quot;FAA Horizons Magazine,&quot; the FAA peace officers were referred to as &quot;Sky Marshals&quot; internally within the FAA, although the term would not be used by the media for nearly a decade. Many years after their initial inception, personnel were given firearms and some close quarters combat training at the FBI Academy located on the U.S. Marine Corps training grounds at Quantico, Virginia.

In October 1969, due to the increasing violence of hijacked aircraft in the Middle East, the U.S. Marshals Service started a &quot;Sky Marshal Division&quot; out of the Miami Field Office. The program was run by John Brophy and staffed with a handful of deputies. Since the majority of hijackings were occurring out of Florida in the late 1960s, the U.S. Marshals Service started their program to try and combat air piracy given their broad jurisdiction.

The &quot;Sky Marshal Program&quot; of the 1970s later became a joint effort between the then United States Customs Service and the FAA and was led by General Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a former Tuskegee Airman. On September 11, 1970, in response to increasing acts of air piracy by hijacking to Cuba and Islamic radicals, President Richard Nixon ordered the immediate deployment of armed federal agents on United States commercial aircraft. Initially, the deployed personnel were federal agents from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Subsequently, the United States Customs Service formed the Division of Air Security, and established the position of Customs Security Officer (CSO). Approximately 1,700 personnel were hired for this position and were trained at the Treasury Air Security Officer (TASOS) training complex at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Customs security officers were deployed on U.S. flagged commercial aircraft, flying on both domestic and international routes in an undercover capacity in teams of two and three. Customs security officers also handled ground security screening on selected flights at domestic U.S. airports.

Following the mandatory passenger screening enacted by the FAA at U.S. airports beginning in 1973, the customs security officer force was disbanded and its personnel were absorbed by the U.S. Customs Service. By 1974 armed sky marshals were a rarity on U.S. aircraft. The former customs security officers were reassigned as customs patrol officers, customs inspectors, and customs special agents.

A small force of Federal Air Marshals were retrained at the FAA starting in 1974. The personnel trained under this program was limited to 10–12 people. For the next several years after customs security officer disbandment, the FAA air marshals rarely flew missions.

In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested the expansion of the program and Congress enacted the International Security and Development Cooperation Act, which expanded the statutes that supported the Federal Air Marshal Service. The FAM program was begun in response to domestic hijackings and FAM operational flights were almost exclusively conducted on domestic U.S. flights until 1985. After the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 in 1985 and the enactment of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act, the number of FAMs was increased and their focus became international U.S. air carrier operations. Due to resistance of several countries including the United Kingdom and Germany to having individuals carrying firearms entering their countries, the coverage of international flights was initially limited. Resistance to the entrance of armed personnel to their countries was overcome through negotiations and agreements about the terms and handling of weapons when they were brought in country. Hence, the FAMs could operate worldwide in carrying out their mission to protect U.S. aviation from hijackings.

Air marshals were originally designated as U.S. Customs security officers assigned by order of President Kennedy on an as-needed basis, and later were specially trained FAA personnel. The customs officers were phased out in 1974. Many of them transferred to the FAA&#x27;s Civil Aviation Security Division to serve as aviation security inspectors and also in the volunteer FAM program directed by the FAA&#x27;s Civil Aviation Security Division (later renamed the &quot;Office of Civil Aviation Security&quot;). This program later became non-voluntary, required of all FAA Inspectors, breeding other problems within the FAA&#x27;s Office of Civil Aviation Security. In 1992, Retired Major General Orlo Steele, then the Associate Administrator for Civil Aviation Security, hired Greg McLaughlin as Director of the Federal Air Marshal Program. McLaughlin was hired as an air marshal after the hijacking of TWA 847 and was working in Frankfurt, Germany, investigating the bombing of Pan Am 103. McLaughlin turned the Federal Air Marshal Program into an all-voluntary program. The voluntary nature of the program and efforts by McLaughlin and Steele turned the small force of Federal Air Marshals into an extremely capable one. From 1992 to just after the attacks on 9/11, the air marshals had one of the toughest firearms qualification standards in the world. A study from the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) later came out with a classified report during this time period, placing Federal Air Marshals among the top 1% of combat shooters in the world. This is no longer the case due to changes in capabilities and training.

Before the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Air Marshal Service consisted of varying numbers of FAMs dependent on government funding. Although 50 positions were authorized by Congress, only 33 FAMs were active on September 11, 2001. As a result of the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush ordered the rapid expansion of the Federal Air Marshal Service. Many new hires were agents from other federal agencies, such as the United States Secret Service, United States Border Patrol, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the DEA, NPS, FBI, ATF, INS, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Office of the Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), IRS CID, and many others. Immediately after the attacks on 9/11, then-Director McLaughlin was tasked with hiring and training 600 air marshals in one month. A classified number of applicants were later hired, trained, and deployed on flights worldwide. As of August 2013, this number is estimated to be approximately 4,000. Currently, these FAMs serve as the primary law enforcement entity within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

On October 16, 2005, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff approved the transfer of the Federal Air Marshal Service from U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) to TSA as part of a broader departmental reorganization to align functions consistent with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) &quot;Second Stage Review&quot; findings for the following:

#consolidating and strengthening aviation law enforcement and security at the Federal level;
#creating a common approach to stakeholder outreach; and
#improving the coordination and efficiency of aviation security operations.

As part of this realignment, the director of the Federal Air Marshal Service also became the assistant administrator for the TSA Office of Law Enforcement (OLE), which houses nearly all TSA law enforcement services.

In March 2014, Director Robert Bray announced six of the service&#x27;s twenty-six offices would be closed by the end of 2016. Bray attributed the cuts to a reduction of operating budget from $966 million to $805 million and the Transportation Security Administration stated no positions would be eliminated.

==Securing other modes of transportation==
Since July 2004, TSA has provided supplemental personnel, including federal air marshals, to assist mass transit systems during major events, holidays and anniversaries of prior attacks. These TSA personnel deploy as Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams (VIPR teams), whose goal is to provide both seen (random, unannounced, and unpredictable) and high-visibility (seen) presence in mass transit or passenger rail environments. The level of assistance transit systems request depends on a transit system&#x27;s local political and security environment. Beginning in July 2007, TSA significantly increased the number and frequency of VIPR deployments from an average of one exercise per month to one or two per week.

There were issues with Federal Air Marshals and early VIPR deployments. TSA field officials said the initial exercises put their safety at risk. TSA required Federal Air Marshals to wear raid jackets or shirts identifying them as air marshals, which potentially compromised their anonymity. In response to this concern, TSA changed the policy such that Federal Air Marshals began attending VIPR exercises in civilian clothes or jackets that simply identify them as DHS officials. Some transit security officials reported that Federal Air Marshals were unfamiliar with local laws, local police procedures, the range of behavior encountered on public transportation and the parameters of their authority as federal law enforcement officers. In 2011, Amtrak temporarily banned VIPR teams from its property after screenings at the Savannah, Georgia station because Amtrak Police chief John O&#x27;Conner called their activities illegal and violations of Amtrak policy.

==Organization==

*Executive Assistant Administrator of Law Enforcement/Director of FAMS
**Deputy Executive Assistant Administrator of Law Enforcement/Deputy Director of FAMS
***Assistant Administrator, Field Operations
***Assistant Administrator, Flight Operations
***Assistant Administrator, Operations Management

===Rank structure===
The Federal Air Marshal Service uses the following rank nomenclature, introduced in 2011.

*Director
*Deputy Director
*Assistant Director
*Deputy Assistant Director
*Supervisory Air Marshal in Charge (SAC)
*Deputy Supervisory Air Marshal in Charge (DSAC)
*Assistant Supervisory Air Marshal in Charge (ASAC)
*Supervisory Federal Air Marshal (SFAM)
*Senior Federal Air Marshal
*Federal Air Marshal (FAM)

Previously, the supervisory ranks had different naming. A SAC was known as a Special Agent in Charge as were the Assistant and Deputy SACs and a Supervisory Federal Air Marshal was known as an Assistant to the Special Agent in Charge or ATSAC. The rank change was introduced in 2011 to reduce an &quot;us versus them&quot; perception between supervisory and non-supervisory air marshals.

==Training==
Federal Air Marshals go through an intense, two-phase training program. The first phase of the program is a twelve-week basic law enforcement course. This training is completed at one of two Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers: either Artesia, New Mexico or Glynco, Georgia. Air marshals also receive follow-on training at the William J. Hughes Technical Center in New Jersey at the Federal Air Marshal Service Training Center. Their training is tailored to their role. Some of the subjects covered in this training include constitutional law, marksmanship, physical fitness, behavioral observation, defensive tactics, emergency medical assistance and other law enforcement techniques. On April 7, 2023, the first instructional textbook on aviation-specific tactics used by Federal Air Marshals was published by CRC Press, Routledge.

The second phase trains the candidates for tasks that they will be expected to carry out in the field. This training places an emphasis on perfecting marksmanship skills, including tactics for close-quarters combat and active-shooter situations, as well as close-quarters defensive skills. This is a necessity of the job due to both the confines of aircraft and the number of bystanders. Candidates who successfully complete this training are assigned to one of 20 field offices, where they begin their missions.

==Equipment==
Federal Air Marshals carry the following equipment: 
* Glock 19 Gen5 9mm or Glock 26 9mm
* SIG Sauer P229 or SIG Sauer P239 chambered in .357 SIG
* ASP 16″ expandable baton
* Handcuffs

According to an anonymous marshal, they are trained to &quot;shoot to stop&quot;, typically firing at the largest part of the body (the chest) and then the head to &quot;incapacitate the nervous system.&quot;

In early 2020, the Federal Air Marshal Service announced that it would be transitioning to the Glock 19 Gen 5 9mm handgun, and it awarded SIG Sauer the contract for ammunition.

Early in the program in the 1970s, Air Marshals carried the Charter Arms .44 Bulldog revolver loaded with Glaser Safety Slugs (a type of frangible bullet). This was designed to stop the threat without penetrating either the target or the aircraft.

==Practices==
The air marshals may be deployed on as little as an hour&#x27;s notice and at high-risk locations. Undercover air marshals were deployed on flights in and out of New Orleans during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002; flights coming near Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympics; and cities visited by the President.

Federal Air Marshal Frank Terreri of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) successfully sued senior executives of the Department of Homeland Security complaining that policies prevented air marshals from speaking out that current policies (such as their strict dress code, &quot;Federal Air Marshal discount&quot; mandatory grouping hotel policy, airport policies that force air marshals to walk up security checkpoint exit lanes, and priority aircraft pre-boarding before handicapped passengers and passengers flying with small children) make marshals easy targets for any possible hijackers, making them stand out as government agents concealing firearms, and thus eliminating their effectiveness.

A policy change in August 2006 allowed air marshals to wear whatever clothing they want, in addition to staying at any hotel of their choice to protect their anonymity.

On May 30, 2013, the first book on the history of the air marshals was published in the United States by Federal Air Marshal Clay Biles, who resigned three days after its publication. The book, entitled &quot;The United States Federal Air Marshal Service: A Historical Perspective, 1962–2012,&quot; gave never-before-released information on the more than fifty years of Federal Air Marshal Service. On July 1, 2014, a new book and personal memoir was published by Biles. The book, titled &quot;Unsecure Skies,&quot; gave a behind the scenes look at the inner workings of the Federal Air Marshal Service under the Transportation Security Administration, including discussions on alleged bureaucratic strain and favoritism within the agency.

==Immigration and Customs Enforcement==
Budgeting issues within the TSA created tension between funding for airport screeners versus the FAMS, and in time the FAMS was realigned to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The reasoning was that the FAMS could be re-designated as criminal investigator/special agents and would have a career path. ICE has an investigative division, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), that is the critical investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security whose special agents investigate criminal organizations illegally exploiting America&#x27;s travel, trade, financial and immigration systems. HSI special agents would be cross trained to serve as supplemental FAMS in the event of a national emergency or in response to intelligence requiring additional marshals on flights.

Ultimately, one of Asa Hutchinson&#x27;s final decisions before resigning as head of DHS&#x27;s Border and Transportation Security Directorate was the issuance of a memorandum determining that air marshals would not be HSI special agents. In 2005, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff conducted a second-stage review of DHS&#x27; organization and ordered the FAMS to be moved from ICE and back to the TSA. This move to TSA was effective October 1, 2005.

==Controversies==
===Rigoberto Alpizar incident===

On December 7, 2005, two Federal Air Marshals shot and killed 44-year-old U.S. citizen Rigoberto Alpizar, a passenger of American Airlines Flight 924, on a boarding bridge at Miami International Airport.

According to initial media reports of the incident, a fight broke out between Alpizar and his wife, after which Alpizar suddenly ran up the aisle from the back of the plane. Lonny Glover, national safety coordinator for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said, &quot;As the man came forward it was obvious that he was upset ... That&#x27;s when one of our attendants at the front of plane told him, &#x27;Sir, you can&#x27;t leave the plane.&#x27; His response, she said, was implying that he had a bomb in his backpack. It was at that point that the air marshals gave up their cover and pursued him out the door and up the jet bridge.&quot;

On December 8, 2005, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said that President George W. Bush was satisfied that air marshals acted appropriately in the Alpizar shooting.

===Termination of Robert MacLean===
On July 29, 2003, the FAMS Agency Executive Vice President for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), FAM Robert MacLean, disclosed that the FAMS planned to remove air marshals from long haul flights in order to avoid the cost of an overnight hotel stay. The plan was ordered when TSA was faced with a budget shortfall and right after DHS issued a July 26, 2003 warning that terrorists were planning to smuggle weapons onboard aircraft leaving the U.S. East Coast, United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia with the intention of hijacking them. After Congressional outrage, this plan was cancelled before going into effect. This plan was also at odds with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), whose Section 105 states that &quot;Deployment of Federal Air Marshals... [on] nonstop, long distance flights, such as those targeted on September 11, 2001, should be a priority.&quot;

MacLean was fired for &quot;Unauthorized Disclosure of Sensitive Security Information&quot; as a result of his whistleblower disclosure. Sensitive Security Information (SSI) is a label used for unclassified information that could compromise aviation safety. After challenging this charge in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that Maclean was protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act, he was unconditionally reinstated as air marshal.

===Alcoholism===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; quotes: &quot;Several air marshals said they took medication or drank alcohol to stay awake — despite a policy prohibiting alcohol consumption within 10 hours before work.&quot; Thirteen marshals received DUIs between 2016 and 2018. One marshal who was a recovering alcoholic, saw himself featured in a TSA alcohol awareness promo video and subsequently died by suicide. TSA opted to monitor whether employees were sober before boarding flights.

===Other controversies===
In recent years, the Federal Air Marshal Service has been the subject of controversies related to the number of flights that air marshals actually fly on and of criminal activities involving air marshals. CNN conducted an investigative report by Drew Griffin that included current and former air marshals that accused TSA of exaggerating the numbers of flights with on-board air marshals and of poor quality training. The TSA has rejected the report and pursued investigations into personnel who gave interviews to the media. They also responded to the accusations.

Another investigation was conducted by reporter Amy Davis of Houston news station KPRC into the possibility that air marshals with criminal convictions were still being employed by FAMS. The investigation discovered that 28 had been hired with pre-existing misdemeanors and that several current air marshals had been convicted of or were awaiting trial for offenses including disorderly conduct, DUIs, and sexual crimes against children. In a congressional hearing on aviation security, U.S. Congressman Ted Poe of Houston questioned then-Assistant Secretary for the TSA, Kip Hawley, about some of the investigation&#x27;s findings, saying, &quot;there are some concerns about criminal record, criminal violations while they&#x27;re in air service, and then what happens to them when they&#x27;re on light duty still receiving full pay.&quot;

On August 6, 2006, two air marshals were sentenced in the Southern District of Texas (Houston) after having been convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and also on bribery charges. According to a Department of Justice press release, &quot;Shawn Ray Nguyen, 38, and Burlie L. Sholar, 33, were sentenced to 87 months and 108 months in federal prison, respectively, by United States District Judge Kenneth Hoyt on Monday, August 28, 2006. Nguyen&#x27;s lesser sentence is a result of the court&#x27;s consideration of his cooperation with the United States.&quot;

FAMS effectiveness against crime and terror, has also been questioned. According to Congressman John J. Duncan, the air marshal program has led to only 4.2 arrests a year, at an average cost of $200 million per arrest. He argued that this represents a win of the perceived dangers of terror, supported by a profit center-type approach, over realistic spending priorities.

On August 20, 2018, two air marshals were detained at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport after one of them allegedly showed their gun to the air crew during the flight, instead of their badge, as is required. The flight crew became suspicious and declared an emergency and landed the aircraft.

*18 February 1999: Chicago Fire traded Zak Ibsen to Los Angeles Galaxy for 2001 second-round pick 
*24 February 1999, Colorado acquired GK Ian Feuer from New England Revolution in exchange for future considerations . It is unclear whether this trade was fulfilled through a 2001 first-round pick (#6), a 2001 second-round pick (#18), or why New England gave up draft picks to unload a player. 
*2 August 1999, Tampa Bay Mutiny traded defender Sam George, midfielder Paul Dougherty, and a conditional draft choice to Chicago Fire in exchange for defender Richie Kotschau and midfielder Manny Lagos. The draft pick may be 2001 pick #20.

<text>Debra Ann Fischer is an American astronomer who is the Eugene Higgins professor of astronomy at Yale University researching detection and characterization of exoplanets. She has detected hundreds of exoplanets and was part of the team to discover the first known multiple-planet system.

==Education==
Fischer received her degree in nursing from the University of Iowa in 1975, a masters of science in physics from San Francisco State University in 1992, and her PhD in astrophysics from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1998.

==Research and career==
Fischer has co-authored more than 300 papers on dwarf stars and exoplanets. In two papers with Jeff Valenti, she quantified a correlation between the chemical composition of host stars and the formation of orbiting gas giant planets. She led the N2K Consortium with Gregory P. Laughlin, detecting dozens of exoplanets around metal-rich stars at Keck Observatory, Subaru Observatory, and the Magellan Observatory. Her work &quot;The Twenty Five Year Lick Planet Search&quot; is summarized in a 2014 paper. In 2015, she organized an international workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities at Yale University and led the conference proceedings paper with 55 co-authors. With the Oxford Zooniverse team, Fischer co-founded the Planet Hunters Citizen Science project.

Fischer has worked on instruments to improve measurement sensitivity for the detection of exoplanets. In 2011, she started the Fiber-optic Improved Next-generation Doppler Search for Exo-Earths with the Planetary Society, an improvement that helped planet hunters find smaller, more Earth-like extrasolar planets. In 2014, she worked with colleagues at Yale University on a microcomb for precise wavelength calibration. She was the principal investigator for three spectrographs: CHIRON, the CTIO High Resolution Spectrometer, VUES, the Vilnius University Echelle Spectrograph and EXPRES, the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph.

Fischer and colleagues have also helped to advance statistical and machine learning methods to improve data analysis and sensitivity to low mass planets. Fischer served as the Division Director at the National Science Foundation from 2021 - 2023.

== Projects and Contributions ==
When Fischer discovered the first multiple planet system in 1999, she contributed to the acknowledgement of planet formation by using an analysis that identified and collaborated the impact of structures of planets and their gas giants and even the chemical composition of host stars.

Fischer also created a project called planethunters.org, which helped with her and her organization with planet detection. According to Fischer, her &quot;Planet Hunters&quot; project was based on the Kepler Project, further resulting her and her group&#x27;s expectations of their project to exceed successfully.

<doc id="1032491" wikidata="Q937758" url="?curid=1032491" title="Elizabethtown-Kitley">
<text>Elizabethtown-Kitley is a township in eastern Ontario, Canada, in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. Its southern border lies along the St. Lawrence River and it extends north into many rural hamlets and villages. The township was created on January 1, 2001, by the amalgamation of the former Township of Elizabethtown and Township of Kitley.

==Communities==
The township comprises the following communities:

* Elizabethtown Ward: (former Elizabethtown Township) - Addison, Forthton, Greenbush, Lyn, New Dublin, Rocksprings, Seeley, Spring Valley, Tincap; &quot;Bethel&quot;, &quot;Butternut Bay&quot;, &quot;Fairfield&quot;, &quot;Fairfield East&quot;, &quot;Fernbank&quot;, &quot;Glen Buell&quot;, &quot;Hallecks&quot;, &quot;Hawkes&quot;, &quot;Hillcrest&quot;, &quot;Jellyby&quot;, &quot;Lillies&quot;, &quot;Manhard&quot;, &quot;Redan&quot;, &quot;Row&#x27;s Corners&quot;, &quot;Woodridge&quot;
* Kitley Ward: (former Kitley Township) - Bellamys Mill, Frankville, Jasper, Lehighs Corners, Newbliss, Toledo; &quot;Bellamys&quot;, &quot;Blanchard&#x27;s Hill&quot;, &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Eloida&quot;, &quot;Judgeville&quot;, &quot;Motts Mills&quot;

The township administrative offices are located in New Dublin.

=== Bellamys Mill ===
During the time of its settlement in the late 1700s, Bellamys Mill would have been situated among thick forest with small spring-fed streams whereas currently, the site now sits on a lake called Bellamy Lake. The lake was the result of damming, which created a large swamp. During the late eighteenth century the land was ideal for building a settlement, and in 1798, a man named John Livingston established a gristmill here which a community later surrounded. The mill was likely made of stone, as sawn lumber would have been hard to obtain in the settlement that early, however there is no confirmed account of the building materials used. There is no trace of the mill today; only records from the township and other histories as well as the remnants of an old stone bridge indicate its existence. The building was destroyed by fire. In 1822, a sawmill was established nearby this mill which ran until the 1900s.

Bellamys Mill was its own common school section, known as school section #10. The school, first built in 1836, was named S.S. #10 Mahon&#x27;s School. The first log schoolhouse burned down and was rebuilt in the 1850s across the road. The school ran successfully until the 1910s when it was periodically closed and reopened until its permanent closure in the 1940s. At the time of its closure it was converted into a private residence. Additionally at Bellamys Mill was a Roman Catholic separate school, known as R.C. #10.

Around 1830, land owned by the Livingston family was being used as a community burial ground. Although commonly called Dayton&#x27;s Cemetery, the burying ground&#x27;s name upon establishment was Livingston&#x27;s Cemetery after the family who started it and were first buried there. The first burial was a member of the Livingston family, buried there in 1803 before it became a community cemetery. The cemetery is slightly unique, as instead of tombstones, most of the graves are marked by primitive field stone markers. There are around one hundred stones in the cemetery, however it is estimated there are around two hundred individuals actually buried here. Presently, the cemetery sits on the northern tip of Bellamys Lake and is maintained, but not open to burials.

By the mid-1800s, the village had its own post office; the original grist mill had been destroyed, and a shingle mill was erected nearby. At this time, Chauncey Bellamy established a frame sawmill as well as a new grist mill. Around 1866, a woollen mill was constructed. The woollen mill burned in 1883, and the other mills ceased operations shortly after. At this time, Bellamy and another local man opened and operated a cheese factory in the community. The three-storey tall factory burned down once but was rebuilt; it operated until 1937 when it closed and was later demolished.

In 1840, the Roman Catholic congregation of Bellamys Mill built a stone church on a hill overlooking the millpond measuring with a large steeple. The church was surrounded by a stone fence and a cemetery was located beside it. Prior to the church, mass was conducted from local homes by a travelling priest. There are no remains of the church today. The cemetery from the church is still standing but is no longer in use.

By the mid-to-late 1900s, all the businesses including the church had disappeared from Bellamys Mill. Like many other pioneer communities in the area, improved infrastructure led to its obsolescence and decline. Today, the area exists as a rural residential community. Almost none of the original structures remain except in ruins, aside from three small graveyards still standing in the area. Currently, the former site of the settlement is a campground and park.

=== Newbliss ===
The area that would become Newbliss was settled mostly by Loyalists or immigrants from the British Isles who received their land here as grants from the Crown. Located at a crossroads, it was originally referred to as Dack&#x27;s Corners, followed by Dodd&#x27;s Corners which has still been used in recent history to describe the main intersection. One of the first businesses to operate here was Dack&#x27;s Tavern, built in 1817 and established as a tavern around the 1830s. The tavern had five rooms, three bed and horse stables, and also hosted Orange Lodge meetings.

Newbliss had two schoolhouses to serve the community, each its own section. The first school was built around 1830 and was titled S.S. #5 Newbliss School. It is believed the first schoolhouse for S.S. #5 was made of log, however no records of the school exist. In 1858, the stone schoolhouse which replaced the log structure was erected. This schoolhouse is still standing, located at the intersection of Highway 29 and Line Road 4. The other school section in Newbliss was #6, with its school being called S.S. #6 Coad&#x27;s School. Originally, Coad&#x27;s School was known as Dack&#x27;s. This schoolhouse was also constructed of log before being replaced by a stone building in 1870. Upon its closure in the 1940s, Coad&#x27;s School was sold to the Orange Lodge.

By the mid-1800s, the village began to flourish when roads improved in the area. By this time, the settlement consisted of two hotels, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, a general store, a post office, as well as its own schoolhouse. A cheese factory also operated from Newbliss consisting of three buildings. The main building was later turned into the general store, however the building burned down in the 1980s. The curing building was converted into a home. In the late 1850s, Newbliss received its name when an Irish immigrant from Newbliss, Ireland who was a respected citizen began calling the community Newbliss after his former home.

According to Lovell&#x27;s gazetteer of 1873, Newbliss&#x27; population by the 1870s had reached 250 individuals. By this time, the community had gained a Temperance Hall, an Orange Lodge and became home to many more pioneer tradespeople. By the end of the century, Newbliss hit its peak. The community was then home to around 600 individuals. In 1904, a plot of land was donated to erect an Anglican church in Newbliss called St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church. The congregation had been in existence for around forty years, having services in the schoolhouse. In 1910, a large shed was added to the ground for horses and in 1930 a parish hall was built.

After the 1930s, Newbliss began to decline. By 1950, Newbliss had only 25 residents and only a church, post office, school, general store and restaurant in operation within the community. Currently, none of the original businesses are still conducting business here.

==== Luckey murders ====
On October 8, 1892, the community of Newbliss was the scene of a triple homicide. Charles Sanford Luckey, was released from the Central Prison in Toronto and made his way to Newbliss, Ontario where his father, John Luckey and his second-wife Martha Luckey lived in a farmhouse with their daughter Mary Ann &quot;Minnie&quot; Luckey. Charles had just served a year for larceny and was known to be on bad terms with his father.

Shortly after two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, neighbours noticed smoke emanating from the Luckey farmhouse. When they arrived on scene, the neighbours realized the entire interior of the house was completely engulfed in flames. While the fire was being attended to, some neighbours attempted to enter the farmhouse in order to rescue the family; when they got to the building every window and door was secured shut. When entrance was finally gained, the bodies of John, Martha and Mary Ann Luckey were discovered, having been severely burned to the point they were unrecognizable, and were removed from the farmhouse. The house then burned completely to the ground. The neighbours immediately suspected murder followed by arson due to the locked windows, the nature of the fire and the fact two axes were found at the scene.

According to residents&#x27; accounts in a Smiths Falls newspaper from October 13, 1892, a strange man was seen by many lurking around the farmhouse. Since Martha was home alone, it was believed amongst the neighbours that she must have been murdered first, followed by John who was seen running errands shortly before the fire. It was assumed that Mary Ann was killed last as her teeth were found in the driveway, indicative of a struggle, as though she may have foreseen danger and attempted escape.

Charles Luckey was a suspect due to the known tension between himself and his father, coupled with his criminal past. To add to the suspicion, he was later found in Smiths Falls, a short distance from Newbliss, staying in a hotel under an alias. When questioned, blood was found on his clothing and he admitted to being in Newbliss earlier in the day. The police chief also noted he seemed to be apathetic to the murders of his family.

Charles Luckey was found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to be executed. On December 14, 1893, Charles Luckey was hanged in Brockville, Ontario. Luckey&#x27;s last meal was a bun and tea before he read from the bible, recited hymns, then was marched to the scaffold for his execution.
== Former localities, settlements or communities ==
There are many sources which reference communities or localities within the township that are unrecorded on contemporary maps or no longer in use. According to a local history, there was a settlement called Shane&#x27;s Corners located along Highway 29. Statistics Canada also provides the names of further localities no longer in use or not listed on contemporary maps: Bell, Bells Crossing, Glen Elm, Gosford, Hawkens, Heather Heights, Hutton, Linden Bank, and Story.

=== Shane&#x27;s Corners ===
Shane&#x27;s Corners was a small settlement located along Highway 29 near what was the First Concession of Kitley. Shane&#x27;s Corners was settled by a man named Lawrence Shane and his wife; Mrs. Shane kept a private school here at one time. The settlement consisted of a few homesteads and very few businesses.

The settlement was large enough that it was able to become its own school section in the late nineteenth century. The school was known as S.S. #2 Shane&#x27;s School, and at the time was located along the boundary of Kitley and South Elmsley townships. The stone building was constructed in 1875, replacing an older school further down the road which was subject to arson, possibly committed by a pupil. The schoolhouse was used after hours as the community church, as well as a meeting hall. Well into the 1900s, the building was used by the Shane&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Institute.

In 1860, the settlement became home to a Temperance Hall, called Mount Albion Lodge No. 60, I.O.G.T., and located on the first concession.

In the late 1800s, Shane&#x27;s Corners had its own cheese factory, Cameron&#x27;s Cheese Factory. This factory was originally built on a local homestead, however was later moved to the lot across the road from Shane&#x27;s School, a more central location.

At some point in the 1800s, an Anglican cemetery was established.

== Cemeteries ==
The amalgamated townships of Elizabethtown-Kitley are dotted with numerous old cemeteries, many of which lay abandoned. There are a total of 67 cemeteries recorded in the township. The majority of these cemeteries are old family burying ground dating from the late 1700s to the early 1800s - a time when burying the dead on the family&#x27;s land was common. Many have been fully transcribed through local volunteer efforts however many are not, possibly due to the fact the stones are now illegible from deterioration. Most of the old family burial plots are completely abandoned or located on private properties. Additionally, the Brockville cemeteries are located within Elizabethtown-Kitley.

Fulford Pioneer Cemetery is a designated historical location situated along the bank of the St. Lawrence River along Fulford Point Road, Woodridge, west of Brockville. It was designated for being one of the oldest cemeteries in the township, having been dedicated in 1786. The cemetery is on land originally granted to one of Jessup&#x27;s Rangers, Jonathan Fulford. On June 7, 1786, the cemetery was opened with the burial of Fulford&#x27;s infant son. The cemetery contains the graves of members of Fulford&#x27;s family as well as the Cole family, who were related through marriage, and a few other local families.

This is a contrast from national percentages which are 68.2% for English only and 25.7% for non-official languages only as a mother tongue. Multiple responses were given by 0.4% of the population.

In 2011, 98.3% of the population spoke English as their primary language at home; 0.8% spoke French and 0.5% spoke a non-official language in their home.

Of non-official languages, Dutch, German and Italian were cited as being the most common languages spoken. Dutch speakers accounted for 42.4% of the non-official language speakers. German accounted for 18.2% and Italian 4.5%.
 
In the year 2011, only 155 individuals (1.7%) of the population of Elizabethtown-Kitley township identified with an Aboriginal identity. Of the individuals with an Aboriginal identity, 58.1% reported having a First Nations identity while 41.9% reported Métis.

During 2011, it was estimated that 90 individuals within Elizabethtown-Kitley belonged to a visible minority group. This accounted for 1.0% of the township&#x27;s total population; in Ontario, the percentage is 25.9%. The biggest visible minority groups were South Asian and Black.

The three most reported ethnic origins in 2011 in Elizabethtown-Kitley were Canadian (43.6%), Irish (35.5%), and English (31.5%).

In 2011, the National Household Survey determined that 8,725 individuals in the township were Canadian-born, accounting for 94.2% of the total population. 525 individuals, 5.7% of the population, were foreign-born immigrants. Recent immigrants, those who immigrated between 2006 and 2011, accounted for 5.7% of the immigrant population. The most common countries of origin for the immigrant population of the township were the United Kingdom and the Netherlands who accounted for 39% and 19% of the population of immigrants, respectively.

<text>Sir Thomas Erpingham (27 June 1428) was an English soldier and administrator who loyally served three generations of the House of Lancaster, including Henry IV and Henry V, and whose military career spanned four decades. After the Lancastrian usurpation of the English throne in 1399, his career in their service was transformed as he rose to national prominence, and through his access to royal patronage he acquired great wealth and influence.

Erpingham was born in the English county of Norfolk, and knighted when a young man. During the reign of Richard II he served under the King&#x27;s uncle John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, in Spain and Scotland, and was with Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke on crusades in Lithuania, Prussia and the Holy Land. Erpingham accompanied Bolingbroke into exile in October 1398, and was with him when he landed at Ravenspur in July 1399 to reclaim his inheritance as Duke of Lancaster, after his lands had been forfeited by Richard. Bolingbroke rewarded Erpingham by appointing him as constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports, and after ascending the throne as Henry IV he made him chamberlain of the royal household. Erpingham later helped to suppress the Epiphany Rising and was appointed guardian of Henry&#x27;s second son Thomas. He was a member of the Privy Council, acting at one point as marshal of England. He attempted to have Henry le Despenser, the anti-Lancastrian bishop of Norwich, impeached as a rebel.

On becoming king in 1413, Henry IV&#x27;s son Henry of Monmouth appointed Erpingham as steward of the royal household. Henry IV&#x27;s reign had been marked by lawlessness, but Henry V and his administrators proved to be unusually talented, and within twelve months law and order had been re-established throughout England. In 1415 Erpingham was indentured to serve as a knight banneret, and joined Henry&#x27;s campaign to recover his lost ancestral lands in France and Normandy. Erpingham presided over the surrender of Harfleur. On 25 October 1415, he commanded the archers in the Battle of Agincourt, where he was positioned alongside the king.

Erpingham married twice, but both marriages were childless. He was a benefactor to the city of Norwich, where he had built the main cathedral gate which bears his name. He died on 27 June 1428, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral.

==Ancestry and early life==
Thomas Erpingham was born in about 1357, the son of Sir John de Erpingham of Erpingham and Wickmere in Norfolk, England. His grandfather, Sir Robert de Erpingham was recorded as holding Erpingham manor in 1316 and Erpingham and Wickmere in 1346. Sir Robert represented Norfolk in Parliaments during the 1330s and 1340s. In 1350, Sir Robert and his son Sir John de Erpingham both witnessed a deed of feoffment by Nicholas de Snyterle, rector of &quot;Matelask&quot; (Matlaske near Erpingham), to Philip Tynker and Maud his wife of a messuage there.

Sir John owned a house in Norwich in Conisford Lane, now King Street. Thomas, who would have known the house, was possibly born there. The identity of Erpingham&#x27;s mother is not mentioned by his biographers. In September 1368 he may have travelled with his father to Aquitaine in the service of Edward the Black Prince. 

His grandfather died in 1370, after 8 March but before 1 August, the date of death of the father of Thomas. On 8 March 1370 at Erpingham, Sir Robert de Erpingham and his son Sir John, both signed their names and left seals on a charter of an inescutcheon between eight martlets. In his will, Robert left legacies to all the friars of Norwich. He was buried near the south door of Erpingham church. Sir John de Erpingham succeeded his father Robert, but did not survive him long, dying later that same year on 1 August 1370. He was buried in the church at Erpingham in the east end of the south aisle.

==Early career==
===Early military service===

Erpingham served under William Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk in 1372 and was with Suffolk in France the following year. In 1379 he was serving under the Captain of Calais, William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. In the summer of 1380 he was indentured into the retinue of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, a military leader and the third surviving son of Edward III of England, with whom Salisbury had recently served. Indentured retainers gave their allegiance for life in a personal written contract—conditions of service and payment were agreed, and these were rarely relaxed.

The year Erpingham was knighted is unknown, but he is likely to have been at least 21. In June 1380 he was named as &#x27;Sir Thomas&#x27; in an order of payment made by Lancaster, the earliest known date at which his knighthood is referred to. The payment, provided by the ducal manor of Gimingham, was for a considerable annual income of £20—it has been estimated that during the 15th century only 12,000 households in England had an income of between £10 and £300. Erpingham was with Lancaster during the English invasion of Scotland in 1385.

Lancaster&#x27;s determination to rule the Kingdom of Castile after his marriage to the Castilian princess Constance in 1371 dominated his life for 15 years. In 1386 Richard II of England agreed to release the funds needed for Lancaster to lead a Castilian campaign. Lancaster&#x27;s royal status gave him a prominence in affairs of state that created tension between him and Richard, and the cost of the Castilian campaign was seen by the King&#x27;s advisers as a price worth paying for the political freedom Richard would gain from Lancaster&#x27;s absence.

Erpingham was with Lancaster when his army set sail from Plymouth in July 1386. It landed at Brest, France, and temporarily relieved the besieged English garrison. After leaving Brest the army arrived at A Coruña, and went on to bring Galicia under English control. John I of Portugal joined with Lancaster in March 1387, but because of a lack of food for their animals, and the successful defensive tactics employed by the Castilians, their campaign was abandoned after six weeks. In 1388, Erpingham participated before Charles VI of France in a jousting tournament at Montereau, his adversary being Sir John de Barres. As related by the French chronicler Jean Froissart, half way through the tournament, Erpingham was struck violently on his shield by his opponent, and was knocked off his horse. Stunned by the blow, he managed to recover and continue the joust, &quot;to the satisfaction of the king and his lords&quot;.
Erpingham was sent back to England to watch over Lancaster&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke and went into his service. In 1390 he was with Bolingbroke&#x27;s retinue when it crossed the English Channel with the intention of joining Duke Louis II of Bourbon in a siege of the Tunisian port of Mahdia on a crusading expedition via Marseilles. The expedition was abandoned when Charles VI refused him permission to travel through France. Bolingbroke then went on a crusade in Lithuania. Erpingham, one of the most trusted and experienced of Lancaster&#x27;s men, belonged to what the historian Douglas Biggs describes as &quot;the &#x27;adult&#x27; portion of Henry&#x27;s force&quot;—older men who were probably sent by Lancaster to guide and protect his son. The &quot;crusade&quot; resulted in an unsuccessful siege of Vilnius and the capture of Lithuanian women and children, who were then converted to Christianity. It is not known if Erpingham was present with Bolingbroke at the siege.

Erpingham was with Bolingbroke when he returned unnecessarily to Prussia in July 1392—a peace was being made in Lithuania between its ruler, Władysław II Jagiełło, and his cousin Vytautas, and the crusaders who had supported Vytautas had already left. Bolingbroke and his reduced retinue journeyed through Europe and the Near East, visiting Prague, Vienna, Corfu, and the Holy Land. It is thought that it was in Italy that Erpingham obtained the silk for the chasuble which bears his name, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

=== Revolution of 1399 ===
The historian Helen Castor has described the Lancastrian presence in East Anglia as a &quot;disparate collection” that lacked coherence or a single identity. Erpingham rose to become the most important of Lancaster&#x27;s retainers in the region. He was appointed to a commission of peace, and given powers to preserve order in Norfolk in the aftermath of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in the summer of 1381. He had a part in supervising the defence of Norfolk in 1385, when a French invasion seemed imminent. In 1396 Lancaster granted him the legal right to use the land within the hundred of South Erpingham, a reward for his loyal service to the Duchy of Lancaster.
In January 1398 a dispute erupted between Bolingbroke and Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, after Mowbray had attempted to ambush and kill Lancaster, and which the King ordered be settled by a trial by battle between the two men. During the five months before 16 September, the day the trial was due to take place, Bolingbroke travelled throughout England on a tour of the Lancastrian lands. Richard stopped the contest as it was about to begin and banished Bolingbroke from the kingdom for ten years, and exiled Mowbray for life. Those assembled were told that the trial had been stopped to avoid dishonouring the loser and to prevent a feud from arising, but chroniclers (writing after Henry IV&#x27;s accession) considered Richard&#x27;s decision an act of revenge. Bolingbroke, as one of the five Lords Appellant, had rebelled in November 1387; for a year they maintained Richard as a figurehead with little actual power.

Erpingham was one of 17 named companions who volunteered to accompany Henry Bolingbroke into exile. He entrusted his lands and property to Sir Robert Berney and others. The party headed for Paris, where they were welcomed by Charles VI and presented with lavish gifts. Following the death of his father on 3 February 1399, Bolingbroke&#x27;s inheritance was confiscated by Richard, and his banishment was increased by the King to life. On 17 June 1399, Erpingham witnessed a secret pact made in Paris between Bolingbroke and Louis I, Duke of Orléans, the brother of Charles VI, stating that as allies they would support each other against each other&#x27;s enemies—the kings of England and France excepted.

Erpingham was one of Bolingbroke&#x27;s supporters who landed with him at Ravenspur, probably at the end of June 1399. Whilst Bolingbroke was gaining support for his cause to restore his rightful inheritance of the Duchy of Lancaster as he moved across northern and central England, Richard was delayed in Ireland. He eventually found ships to cross the Irish Sea, and reached Wales by around 24 July. Realising the strength of the threat posed by his rival, he deserted his court and moved across country with a small group of followers.
By 27 July Bolingbroke had reached Berkeley, near Bristol, where he had a meeting with Richard&#x27;s uncle the Duke of York. At Berkeley, York deserted the King&#x27;s cause and joined Bolingbroke. Shortly afterwards, Erpingham arrested Henry le Despenser, bishop of Norwich and one of the few remaining supporters of Richard prepared to resist Bolingbroke.

Richard had reached Conwy Castle when Chester fell to Bolingbroke on 5 August. The King was persuaded by the Earl of Northumberland to leave Conwy and travel to Rhuddlan Castle, but during the journey his party was ambushed and he was taken prisoner. According to a French chronicle, the ambush was devised by Northumberland and carried out by his men, led by Erpingham. When Richard saw armed men everywhere, Northumberland&#x27;s plans were revealed to him, and: &quot;As he spoke, Erpingham came up with all the people of the Earl, his trumpets sounding aloud.&quot; Taken to London under armed guard and kept under Erpingham&#x27;s custody in the Tower of London, Richard was given no option by Bolingbroke and his representatives—including Erpingham—but to relinquish the throne.

Erpingham was given two important positions at court by Bolingbroke. He was made lord warden and constable of Dover Castle as early as 21 August, and appointed to be chamberlain of the royal household after Henry&#x27;s accession, a post which made him the head of the royal household with overall responsibility for the arrangement of Henry&#x27;s domestic affairs, and which he held until 1404. His appointment as lord warden and constable involved the command of a garrison at the castle, and gave Erpingham a position in the King&#x27;s council when strategic matters were discussed; as constable, he was paid over £300 a year.

==Career under Henry IV==

Henry&#x27;s coronation took place on 13 October 1399 at Westminster Abbey. As part of the ceremony, Erpingham carried one of the King&#x27;s swords during the procession to the abbey. He was one of 11 men who petitioned Henry in person to have Richard killed. He was a commander in the army that suppressed the Epiphany Rising of 13991400, led by the (the disparaging term given to a large group of noblemen, many of whom had received titles from Richard). Erpingham supervised the execution of two of the leading rebels, Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Benedict Kely. As Blount watched his own bowels being burnt before him, he cursed Erpingham for being a &quot;false traitor&quot;:
Henry rewarded Erpingham with the custody for life of a house called &#x27;le Newe Inne&#x27; in London. The following year, Erpingham was appointed as guardian of the King&#x27;s second son, Thomas, Duke of Clarence, and in about 1401 he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. He acted briefly as steward of the royal household the same year and became acting marshal of England in October. In July 1407 the Duke of Burgundy was authorised to negotiate a permanent peace settlement between the French and the English. A mission led by Erpingham went to Paris the following month, and were lavishly entertained by members of the French king&#x27;s council.

Despite the military nature of the office of constable of Dover, Erpingham took little part in the warfare of the early years of Henry IV&#x27;s reign, and he generally remained at court. He campaigned in Scotland in August 1400, when Henry made a futile attempt to make the Scots acknowledge him as king of England and pay him homage.

According to one tradition, Erpingham was a supporter of John Wycliffe&#x27;s English translation of the Bible, which was considered heretical. Supposedly, Erpingham was spared from persecution by the Church because he was favoured by Henry IV, and so merely paid a fine, which financed the construction of the Erpingham Gate. The historian Veronica Sekules considers it unlikely that Erpingham supported Wycliffe, and suggests that if he had such a dispute with the Church, it was more likely over Erpingham&#x27;s arrest of Despenser.

===Power and influence in Norfolk===

Sir Thomas Erpingham was one of Henry IVs closest associates, and after 1399, influence in Norfolk shifted from Despenser to Erpingham and his friends. Due to his local connections, his links with the Duchy of Lancaster and his position in the centre of government, Erpingham held a prominent position in East Anglian society; he was named to every commission of the peace in Norfolk during the reign of Henry IV. During the 1400s, Erpingham&#x27;s authority in north Norfolk was extended to other parts of the county and into Suffolk. Gentry from East Anglia who were associated with Erpingham benefited from his powerful position at court: Sir John Strange of Hunstanton became controller of the royal household in 1408; Sir Robert Gurney of Gunton became Erpingham&#x27;s deputy at Dover Castle in 1400; and John Winter of Barningham became controller of Prince Henry&#x27;s household in 1403. Other beneficiaries of Erpingham&#x27;s friendship included Sir Ralph Shelton, John Payn, and John Raynes of Overstrand, who succeeded Payn as the constable of Norwich Castle in 1402.

The principal citizens of Norwich had become disillusioned with Richard II&#x27;s policies, the city having lost its charter in 1388 when it supported the Lords Appellant.
Despenser had remained within his diocese after Henry&#x27;s coronation, but his nephew Thomas Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester had been executed for his part in the Epiphany Rising. Erpingham attempted to have Despenser impeached for actively supporting the rebels; at Erpingham&#x27;s suggestion, Norwich petitioned Henry with charges against Despenser, which were presented to the King by Erpingham.

At Despenser&#x27;s hearing in London, Erpingham was publicly congratulated by the King for his loyalty to the Crown. Despenser was forced to accept Henry&#x27;s authority and publicly rebuked; he was later pardoned. Henry awarded the city a new charter, and Norwich showed its gratitude by showering Erpingham with lavish gifts &quot;for bearing his word to the King for the honour of the city and for having his counsel&quot;. The city authorities cooperated with him as an important member of Henry&#x27;s inner circle.

==Career under Henry V==
Henry IV died at Westminster on 30 March 1413, and was succeeded by his son Henry of Monmouth, the Prince of Wales. Monmouth had replaced Erpingham as warden of the Cinque Ports in 1409, but relationships between the two men remained good, and after the coronation on 9 April 1413, Erpingham was appointed steward of the household, a post he held until at least 1415. After Henry IV&#x27;s reign, which had been marked by banditry and rioting, Henry V acted quickly to restore law and order throughout the country. This was achieved within a year. Henry&#x27;s administrators—Erpingham included—were unusually talented, and order was maintained in England throughout his reign.

Henry&#x27;s great-grandfather Edward III had lost Aquitaine in 1337 when it was confiscated from the English by Philip VI of France, and as a grandson of Philip IV of France, Edward had a claim to the French throne. In November 1414, Henry launched a campaign to recover Aquitaine and France. It was an effective way of establishing his authority as king at the start of his reign. Strategic planning for the expedition in February 1415 involved discussions with Erpingham and other soldiers in Henry&#x27;s inner circle, part of what the historian Anne Curry describes as the King&#x27;s &quot;strong infrastructure and amply supply of manpower&quot;. Erpingham was indentured to serve as a knight banneret. His retinue, which mustered on heathland outside Southampton where they obtained provisions, consisted of two knights, 17 squires and 60 archers.

===Participation at Harfleur and Agincourt===
Erpingham crossed over from England to Normandy with Henry&#x27;s army on 11 August 1415. The King&#x27;s ship reached the mouth of the River Seine on 13 August, and the army landed from Harfleur, a landing point likely to have been decided on beforehand. Erpingham&#x27;s men were present during the siege of the town, and on 22 September he led the procession to the walls and presided over the truce that led to its surrender. The English army then marched towards Calais, shadowed by the French, who forced them to divert away from the coast. The English successfully forded the River Somme at Voyennes; two days&#x27; march short of Calais, they were blocked by the French near Agincourt.

Erpingham was one of the middle-aged English commanders on the field at Agincourt, and at 60 was one of the oldest men present. Although having never experienced a pitched battle before, he had taken part in lesser actions and, as noted by Curry, was &quot;undoubtedly one of the most experienced soldiers present&quot; at Agincourt. He is not mentioned in any contemporaneous English versions of the battle, but three French chroniclers, Jean de Wavrin, Enguerrand de Monstrelet and Jean Le Fèvre, all give detailed descriptions of his role in the battle. The three main divisions (or &#x27;battles&#x27;) of the English army were commanded by Henry and two veteran soldiers: the rearguard (to the right of the King) was led by Thomas Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys; and the vanguard (on the King&#x27;s left) was led by Edward, Duke of York.

====The battle====
On 25 October, the day of the battle, the English army was in position by dawn. With both of its flanks protected by the woods of Tramecourt and Azincourt, the army consisted of 5,000 archers and 800 dismounted men-at-arms—in proportion to the number of men-at-arms present, the number of English archers was high. Because of the authority his seniority would carry, Erpingham was given command of the archers. The men-at-arms were positioned fours ranks deep in the centre of the gap between the two woods. Most of the archers were positioned on the flanks of the men-at-arms, but a few archers were placed amongst them, and 200 were hidden in a clearing in the Tramecourt woods, close to the French lines. Each archer had a stake, double-pointed and long, which was planted deep into the ground and—according to an eye-witness account—&quot;sloping towards the enemy higher than a man&#x27;s waist above the ground&quot;. The stakes gave protection against a charge by the French cavalry.
After the French army failed to attack, Erpingham was ordered to warn the army that it was about to advance to within bowshot of the French. He threw his baton upwards as a signal to advance, and commanded &quot;Now strike!&quot;. Erpingham&#x27;s strong Norfolk accent may have caused the French to mishear him, as some chroniclers recorded the command as &quot;Nestroque&quot;. He then dismounted and moved with his banner to join the King, where he remained during the rest of the battle.
When the English advanced with a great shout, the French responded by beginning their own advance, each army moving roughly the same distance. The English paused and the main body of archers replanted their stakes. They then began to continuously discharge their arrows, which signalled the concealed archers to start firing into the French flanks. The French plan was to use mounted men-at-arms to overcome the English archers, leaving the battles and the men in the wings to attack their heavily outnumbered English counterparts. This plan failed when the cavalry were halted by the storm of arrow fire and the stakes planted by the archers; their retreat was disrupted by the advancing French foot soldiers. The chaos that ensued allowed the English men-at-arms to penetrate the French battles.

The ensuing was the most important part of the battle. Once the men-at-arms in the two armies engaged, the English archers fired into the flanks of the French. Evidence suggests the English vanguard, led by York, who was killed, bore most of the fighting. Advancing through deep mud, the French were exhausted when they reached the English. Those killed or knocked down at the front hindered others behind them, causing men to pile up. The immobilised French were killed where they stood, the English suffering far fewer casualties. Any of the French attempting to retreat were blocked by their advancing comrades; if they tried to move to the flanks they were targets for the English archers. At this stage in the , the archers abandoned their bows and attacked the flanks of the mass of the French with any weapons to hand. This, and their failing position to their front, caused the French to break, and many were cut down or captured by pursuing English archers and men-at-arms. Not all the French had engaged in the fighting and only the vanguard had been defeated. When much of the main French battle were destroyed by the English men-at-arms and the re-armed archers firing into them, the largely leaderless French army withdrew from the field, except for a group of 600 men who were killed or captured when they charged the English.

====Aftermath of the battle====
After the battle, Henry&#x27;s army marched to the English enclave of the Pale of Calais, embarked from Calais on 16 November and returned to England. Erpingham was among 300 men-at arms—which included four barons and 22 knights—and 900 archers who garrisoned the town over the winter. The seniority of the men-at-arms was a reflection of how important it was to Henry that the town was not lost to the French.

On his return to England, Erpingham&#x27;s reward for the services he rendered had during the war included the farm of Lessingham manor and an annuity from the King of 50 marks. In July 1416, in his capacity as the steward of the royal household, he travelled back to Calais with John Wakering, the bishop of Norwich. There they welcomed the Duke of Burgundy, before his meeting with King Henry.

==Personal life==

When staying in Norwich, Erpingham and his family and servants lived in a large house located between Norwich Cathedral and the River Wensum, with his land going down to the river. The house was acquired from Sir Robert Berney in 1409. Known variously as &#x27;Berney&#x27;s Inn&#x27;, &#x27;the Erpingham&#x27; or &#x27;Calthorpe&#x27;s House&#x27;, it was only accurately located in 1981. No remains survive, although it was a major source of employment for the local area during the time that it was occupied by Erpingham. It was inherited by his niece. In the 17th century, the house and its associated land was subdivided and built upon.

Erpingham&#x27;s connections with the Lancastrians and his increasing wealth led to his acquisition of lands, rents and services in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, manors sometimes being held in joint possession with his neighbours or relatives. Curry lists over 40 manors he held during his life, some permanently: three were inherited from his father, such as the manor at Erpingham; seven came to him during the 1370s and 1380s; eight manors were given to him in 1399 by Henry IV and a further seven were acquired that year by other means; another seven were acquired during the 1400s; and he purchased twelve manors from 1410 to 1421. He also lost the tenure of some of his lands, a common occurrence at the time when manors were awarded &#x27;for life&#x27;; the hundred, which included his home village, was lost in 1398, when King Richard gave to Katherine Swynford, third wife of the Duke of Lancaster, &quot;the manors of Erpingham and Wyckmere, and of all lands, rents, services, villeins with their villeinages etc. there and in all other towns in Norfolk sometime of Robert Erpingham knight&quot;. In 1407 Berney helped Erpingham to buy the manor at Blickling. His family sold Blickling to the soldier Sir John Fastolf in 1431.
Erpingham married Joan Clopton, the daughter of Sir William Clopton of Clopton, Suffolk, sometime before 1389; Erpingham was widowed in 1404. His second marriage was to Joan Walton, the daughter of Sir Richard Walton, and widow of Sir John Howard, who died in 1409 or 1410. Joan died in 1425. Evidence that Erpingham was twice married comes in part from a window opposite the chantry of Norwich Cathedral, which once displayed him and his two wives, as well as church records, which state he was buried with both of his wives. Both marriages were childless.

Erpingham had a profound influence on the careers of the two sons of his sister Julian, who married Sir William Phelip (or Philip) of Dennington. Erpingham&#x27;s position in court helped the elder son William to become a member of Henry IV&#x27;s personal household; William&#x27;s brother John held a similar position at the court of Henry of Monmouth. The brothers remained closely attached to their uncle. William and Erpingham were often recorded as co-feoffees of estates in East Anglia, and William stood surety for his uncle at the Exchequer. The family&#x27;s fortunes improved still further when Henry of Monmouth became king, although John died at Harfleur in 1415. His brother was knighted on the eve of the coronation and later fought at Agincourt.

From 1417, Erpingham seems to have retired and lived out his remaining years in Norfolk, having relinquished his position as steward that May. King Henry died in 1422, after which Erpingham had no further contact with the court. He died on 27 June 1428, and was buried on the north side of the presbytery of Norwich Cathedral. Sir William Phelip, who was an executor of his uncle&#x27;s will, &quot;inherited his substantial possessions in Norfolk&quot;. Dated 25 March 1427, the will contains bequests to Norwich Cathedral, churches in Norfolk and London, two Norwich hospitals and several East Anglian convents. Erpingham specified that &quot;all my armour and the harness of my person to be delivered up to the Holy Trinity [Cathedral] in Norwich&quot;.

==Architectural legacy==

Erpingham was a benefactor to the city of Norwich. In 1420 he had built the cathedral gate which bears his name, opposite the west door of Norwich Cathedral leading into Cathedral Close. He funded the rebuilding of the Church of the Blackfriars in Norwich after a fire in the city caused serious damage to the original friary complex in 1413. Today it forms part of the most complete friary surviving in England. The west tower of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, in the village of Erpingham, was paid for by him.

In 1419, Erpingham paid for the east chancel window of the church of St. Austin&#x27;s Friary in Norwich to be glazed. The window contained eight panes, containing dedications to 107 noblemen or knights who died without producing an heir since the reign of Edward III. The building was demolished in 1547 after the priory was suppressed in 1538.

==Appearance in the Henriad==
Sir Thomas Erpingham appears twice in Act IV of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;, first printed in 1600, and is mentioned (but does not appear) in Act II of &quot;Richard II&quot;. According to the Shakespearean scholar Thomas M. Cranfill, Erpingham plays a &quot;considerable, affecting role&quot;. Just after the beginning of Scene 1, Erpingham enters and is acknowledged by the King. As the old man departs, Henry replies (probably out of Erpingham&#x27;s hearing), &quot;God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak&#x27;st cheerfully&quot;, a line, as historian Lawrence Danson writes, &quot;poised at gratitude and irony, admiration and desperation&quot;: Later in the same scene, Erpingham re-enters to inform the King that his nobles are looking for him, and in a simple line conveys the burden of being a ruler. Erpingham is a counterpart to the character of John Falstaff, his brief appearance in the Henriad contrasting with the much larger part given to Falstaff. Henry emphasises the knight&#x27;s old age and marks him apart by consistently referring him by his full name, and the character is used to accentuate the connection between old age and goodness.

In film depictions of the play, Erpingham&#x27;s part is largely silent, as in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film of 1944. Erpingham first appears near the end of the film, during the night before the battle of Agincourt. Kenneth Branagh, in his 1989 film, used the character more often and in, according to Curry, in a way that was &quot;notably more inventive&quot; than Olivier and showed more of an awareness of Erpingham&#x27;s place in history. Identifiable in both films by his distinctive coat of arms and his white hair—in contrast with that of the youthful looking Henry and his courtiers—Branagh includes Erpingham to good effect in the court scenes set in England, as well as during the battle and its aftermath. The character is given a more central (if largely silent) role by Branagh, without distorting Shakespeare&#x27;s original intentions for the part.

<text>The Chamberlin is an electro-mechanical keyboard instrument that was a precursor to the Mellotron. It was developed and patented by the American inventor Harry Chamberlin from 1949 to 1956, when the first model was introduced. There are several models and versions of the Chamberlin. While most are keyboard-based, there were also early drum machines produced and sold. Some of these drum patterns feature the work of Chamberlin&#x27;s son Richard.

==Development==
Harry Chamberlin&#x27;s idea for the instrument came from recording himself playing an organ and conceiving its playback as entertainment. He designed the first Chamberlin instrument as early as 1949, intended as a home entertainment device for family sing-alongs and playing the big band standards of the day.

The Chamberlin&#x27;s use as a commercial instrument in rock (or rock and roll) music was not considered, as Harry Chamberlin disliked rock music and rock musicians.

The Chamberlin has a piano-style keyboard. Underneath each key is a tape-playing mechanism. Each tape is prerecorded with various musical instruments or special effects. When the musician presses a key, a pressure pad pushes the tape against a tape head, and a pinch roller beneath the key pulls it forward into storage box (or onto a roller mechanism). The electric signal generated by the tape head is amplified and heard through a loudspeaker. When the player releases the key, the sound stops, and the tape rewinds by either metal spring rods (on the early Chamberlins) or by a return-roller mechanism (on the later M1 models). Each tape is only a few seconds long (eight seconds on many units).

Harry Chamberlin converted a walk-in closet into a home studio and spent considerable time (usually from sunrise to sunset) experimenting with sounds. After modifying the acoustics in the studio, and also in other rooms in his house, the first Chamberlin recordings were made. All Chamberlin recordings were contracted and performed by members of the Lawrence Welk Orchestra throughout the 1950s. Welk was impressed with the idea of a tape playback instrument and offered to fund its manufacture if it was called a &quot;Welk&quot; machine. Chamberlin refused Welk&#x27;s offer.

Chamberlin used Neumann U47 microphones to record the sounds. The sounds are characterized by a very clean output and heavy vibrato, which was customary of the music styles of the time. The Chamberlin sounds have little compression and possess dynamics true to the instruments recorded on the tapes (such as the air in the flute, or the flow in of the strings). The Chamberlin instruments were designed to accurately replicate the sound of the instrument recorded on the tape. They were meant to be stationary and not transportable. so there was little effort devoted to reliability. Many early Chamberlins have no internal chassis and are prone to go out of adjustment.

As Chamberlin refined the design he began to demonstrate it at music trade shows, and competitors such as Hammond and Lowrey were curious about the origin of Chamberlin sounds. In an effort to compete, these companies created drum rhythms and added plastic tabs with orchestral instrument names on them. These tabs would generate tones that simulated the sound of the instrument selected. The American Federation of Musicians took notice and attempted to limit live performances of Chamberlin instruments fearing that their members would be put out of work. Despite the controversy, musicians worldwide embraced the Chamberlin. &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; singer Bobby Darin was one of the first customers, buying a customized model 300 without the rhythm section tapes. Elvis Presley was also an early owner, occasionally using it for home entertainment.

Chamberlin&#x27;s company grew by employing his wife, his children, and his window cleaner Bill Franson as his salesman. Franson travelled the country offering the Chamberlin instruments to music stores, parlours, and cocktail lounges. Offers of wider distribution were made, but Harry Chamberlin preferred word of mouth advertising and did not like the terms and conditions of distributorship and eschewed it. Chamberlin favoured doing business directly with lounges, nightclubs and musicians who embraced big band music.

In 1962 Bill Franson went missing for several months. A radio could be heard playing music in his apartment but attempts to contact him proved futile. Franson had left for England by boat taking two Chamberlin 600 models with him (one of these eventually became the possession of Todd Rundgren&#x27;s studio and appears on XTC&#x27;s &quot;Skylarking&quot; album in 1986). Franson placed an ad asking for a company that could manufacture seventy standard playback heads. Bradmatic Ltd. (an engineering company) responded to the ad.

Franson removed the Chamberlin labels and sold the rebadged &quot;Franson&quot; instrument without Harry Chamberlin&#x27;s knowledge. Refining the 600&#x27;s design into the Mellotron Mark 1, Bradmatic eventually became Streetly Electronics and began manufacture of the Mellotron Mark 2 in 1963. In 1965 Harry Chamberlin became aware of the fraud after discovering a copy of his instrument being marketed at an American musical instrument trade show. He forced a legal settlement with Streetly Electronics. After visiting owners Frank, Norman, and Les Bradley in person (and having an intense discussion with Franson), an arrangement was made that Mellotrons would only be sold in the UK and Chamberlins would be sold in the US. Chamberlin would receive royalty payments from the Mellotron company, though this apparently ended in the late 1960s. Through this same royalty system, he licensed the Chamberlin &quot;3 violins&quot; sound to be used as the violins sound in the Mellotron library. This sound was used on much of the British Mellotron music since the mid-1960s. Consequently, it can be difficult to tell whether a recording features a Mellotron or Chamberlin when the three violins tapes are used, other than by the country of origin of the recording.

Mistaking Chamberlin sounds for real instruments is common because they were recorded with no processing and because there were fewer mixdown master tapes used compared to the Mellotron library. The M series Chamberlins wide bandwidth playback heads also enhanced fidelity.

Chamberlin instruments were never distributed for sale outside the US and Canada. Chamberlin Co. continued to refine and sell their products, and invested more effort into reliability to compete with the Mellotron. Sales to major US studios resulted in Chamberlins being heard on many pop records of the 1960s including recordings by The Lettermen, Marvin Gaye, Bobby Goldsboro (&quot;Honey&quot; in 1968), The Beach Boys, and educator Edmund Bordeaux Szekely.

A new Chamberlin design emerged in the late 1960s, ending the use of rhythm tapes. This was the much more durable M1 which appeared in 1970 with a flawless tape-return roller system. This model has higher-quality playback tape heads with no tape warble and greater bandwidth than the Mellotron. The unit is a table-top version of the earlier models and much smaller than the competing M400 Mellotron model. About 130 M1 Chamberlins were built.

These musicians included Disneyland/Disney Worlds&#x27; live performance artist Michael Iceberg in his shows featuring electronic instruments. Others include Skip Konte with Three Dog Night, Olivia Newton-John, Leon Russell (&quot;Carney&quot; in 1972), Neil Merryweather, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, Ambrosia, Mike Pinder with The Moody Blues on the album &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; (1972), American progressive rock band Ethos, David Bowie (from &quot;Low&quot; in 1977 through &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; in 1980), Edgar Winter (&quot;Jasmine Nightdreams&quot; in 1975), Joe South, Iron Butterfly, Chip Taylor, New York session player Barry Frederick, Canadian musicians Joe and Gino Vannelli, jazz/fusion group Shadowfax (&quot;Watercourse Way&quot; in 1976), and Bob Seger keyboardists Robyn Robbins and Tom Neme.

Chamberlin Co. continued to earn revenue by licensing patents to Mattel for their Optigan keyboard, which uses its prerecorded loop as well as some Chamberlin music tapes in the Optigan library. By the end of the 1970s, digital synths eroded the market for tape-based keyboards and Chamberlin ended M1 production in 1981, building the last few units in an Ontario, California factory, and later in the family garage with previously unreleased sounds. Harry Chamberlin died in 1986.

In the 1980s Chamberlin recordings were minimal but producers Mitchell Froom (Crowded House) and Todd Rundgren (XTC&#x27;s &quot;Skylarking&quot; in 1986) used the instrument. The Chamberlin experienced a revival in the 1990s with a new generation of musicians using them and appreciating the unique sounds produced by playing them in unorthodox ways. These included Michael Penn and his keyboardist Patrick Warren (&quot;March&quot;, &quot;Free-for-All&quot;, &quot;Resigned&quot;, &quot;MP4&quot; as well as Penn&#x27;s film scores for &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; in 1997), singer/songwriter Sam Phillips on her album &quot;Cruel Inventions&quot; (1991), and singer/songwriter/producer Jon Brion on the soundtrack to the film &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004). Tom Waits also used the instrument on albums such as &quot;The Black Rider&quot; (1993) and &quot;Bone Machine&quot; (1992).

<text>Richard Rowley was the pseudonym of Richard Valentine Williams (2 April 1877 – 25 April 1947), born at 79 Dublin Road, Belfast, Ireland, who wrote poetry, plays and stories.

==Early life==
At the age of 16 he entered the family firm, McBride and Williams, which manufactured cotton handkerchiefs and eventually became its managing director. After the collapse of the company in 1931 he was Chairman of the Northern Ireland Unemployment Assistance Board. His early poems, in &quot;The City of Refuge&quot; (1917), were rhetorical celebrations of industry. His next volume, &quot;City Songs and Others&quot; (1918), included his most quoted poem &quot;The Islandmen&quot;, and is regarded as containing his most original work: &quot;Browning-like monologues straight from the mouths of Belfast&#x27;s working-class.&quot;

==Later life==
He moved to Newcastle, County Down. He also wrote short stories: &quot;Tales of Mourne&quot; (1937), as well as at least one highly successful play, &quot;Apollo In Mourne&quot; (1926). During World War II, Rowley founded, and ran from his Newcastle home, the short-lived Mourne Press. He published first collections of Sam Hanna Bell and Michael McLaverty, but the press failed in 1942.

With Bell, Rowley was one of a set of Linen Hall Library members who would retire regularly to Campbell&#x27;s Cafe. The regulars, at various points, included writers John Boyd and Denis Ireland, actors Joseph Tomelty, Jack Loudon and J.G. Devlin, poets John Hewitt and Robert Greacen, artists Padraic Woods, Gerald Dillon, and William Conor and (an outspoken opponent of sectarianism) the Rev. Arthur Agnew. The ebullient atmosphere the circle created was a backdrop the appearance of Campbell&#x27;s Cafe in Brian Moore&#x27;s wartime &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, The Emperor of Ice-Cream.

Rowley died at Drumilly, County Armagh, in 1947. The poet&#x27;s Newcastle home, Brook Cottage, has since been demolished. George MacCann and Jack Loudan presented a commemoration of Rowley&#x27;s life on the radio in 1952. The programme used recordings of his friends Lady Mabel Annesley, who illustrated several of his publications, along with the poet John Irvine, the playwright Thomas Carnduff and William Conor. In Newcastle Rowley&#x27;s name is remembered through the Rowley Meadows housing development and the Rowley Path, which runs along the southern boundary of the Islands Park.

<text>Ambato (; full form, San Juan de Ambato; Quechua: Ampatu Llaqta) is a city located in the central Andean valley of Ecuador. Lying on the banks of the Ambato River, the city also sits beneath several tall mountains. It is the capital city of the Tungurahua Province, situated at an elevation of 2,577 meters above sea level. It is variously nicknamed &quot;City of Flowers and Fruits&quot;, &quot;Land of the Three Juan&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Garden of Ecuador.&quot; Ambato&#x27;s inhabitants are called Ambateños or Guaytambos (after a type of native peach that the valley is famous for producing). The current mayor of Ambato is Diana Caiza.

The city has been fully or partially destroyed by earthquakes several times in its history, most recently on August 5, 1949, when the city and its cathedral were almost completely devastated. The city was rebuilt in the following two years. In honour of the tenacity of their residents, Ambato celebrates &quot;The Festival of Fruits and Flowers&quot; during Carnival in February. Today, the Festival of Fruits and Flowers is one of the most important festivities in Ecuador.

The city is referred to as &quot;Land of the Three Juan&#x27;s&quot; as it was the birthplace of three notable Ecuadorians: Juan Montalvo, a noted essay writer of the 19th century, Juan León Mera, the author of the country&#x27;s national anthem, and Juan Benigno Vela, a key figure in the Ecuadorian independence movement. The city is well known for its production of fruit, tanneries, food products and textiles.
It also serves as a major transportation hub, especially for travelers moving south on the Pan-American Highway.

==History==
The city of Ambato was founded in its present location on December 6, 1698, as the Seat of Ambato, on the request of Ambateños to the Royal Audience of Quito. Prior to its founding, on June 20, the former Ambato settlement was destroyed by an earthquake and landslide which killed thousands. The settlement was relocated to higher ground at its present location. For the next century, Ambato grew slowly into an important mountain center. The city was to play a pivotal role in the Ecuadorian War of Independence. On October 9, 1820, the citizens of Guayaquil, along with help from a number of Venezuelans and Colombians, declared independence from the Spanish monarchy. The group raised an army (known as the Junta de Guayaquil), and began to move against Spanish forces in Quito. On their way to Quito, Ambato was one of the first cities to be liberated. The city formally declared its separation from Spain on November 12, 1820.

After liberating Ambato, the Junta de Guayaquil then turned their attention to Quito. Under the command of Colonel Luis Urdaneta, the army had liberated most of the central highland region, but Quito and the northern highland region were still under the authority of the Royal Audience. Field-Marshal Melchior Aymerich, acting President and commander of the Royalist army took swift action and ordered forces to march on the Urdaneta&#x27;s army stationed in Ambato. Urdaneta&#x27;s army met the Royalists, led by Colonel Francisco Gonzaelz at the First Battle of Huachi just outside Ambato on November 22, 1820, and were soundly defeated. Urdeneta retreated and Gonzalez entered Ambato.

A year later, the reformed patriots, under Antonio José de Sucre, left their position in Babahoyo to retake the highlands. In September 1821, the forces left the city, marching to reconquer Guaranda. On September 12, 1821, Sucre met the same fate as Urdeneta in the Second Battle of Huachi. Aymerich&#x27;s forces defeated Sucre in the same plains that now form the neighborhood of Huachi, just southeast of downtown Ambato. Sucre returned to Guayaquil once more.

In 1822, the tide began to turn for Ambato and the rest of the towns in the central mountains. After two attempts to take the highlands, Sucre and the revolutionaries had built a network of spies and a dedicated spirit of liberation. They had also had some luck; in 1821, the Spanish monarch, Fernando VII had sent his own commander, General Mourgeon to lead the royalist defense in Quito. Mourgeon arrived in November only to fall terminally ill in the spring of 1822. At the same time, Sucre was marching his army south to Macará to meet up with Peruvian forces sent by General José de San Martín. From Loja they moved north retaking Riobamba in April. Ambato was retaken soon after and the royalists were soon defeated at the Battle of Pichincha.

During the early years of the Republic of Ecuador, the city served as an important cultural and economic center. Several times, Ambato served as the setting for rewriting of constitutions and continued to produce excellent artists and thinkers like Montalvo and Mera.

On August 5, 1949, the city was struck by a devastating earthquake. It is estimated that more than 6,000 people died, and thousands more were left homeless and destitute by the disaster. Much of the city&#x27;s colonial center was completely ruined, including the cathedral that many considered on par with Cuenca&#x27;s Iglesia de El Sagrario. The city was rebuilt with significant help from international aid organizations and the Ecuadorian government. The new modernist cathedral was inaugurated on December 12, 1954.

==Geography==
Ambato lies in the main valley of the Central Cordillera, the highest of the Andean mountain ranges. The city itself is carved into the side of Cerro Casigana, the mountain that dominates the north end of the city. From Ambato, it is possible to see many snow-capped volcanoes including Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Carihuairazo, and the largest mountain in Ecuador, Chimborazo. Tungurahua lies about 40 kilometers to the southeast. The threat of eruption from the volcano is constant. On May 16, 2006, Tungurahua erupted, covering the city with a thick layer of ash.

The Ambato River cuts through the north end of the city. It is not a very wide or deep river, but can cause significant flooding during periods of heavy rainfall. Throughout the years, the river has cut a deep basin into the land, creating the need for better bridges. In October 2008, the City of Ambato finished the long-awaited Juan Leon Mera bridge, connecting downtown Ambato to the neighborhoods of Ficoa and Atocha. The span of the Ambato River cost the city $5.5 million.

==Climate==
Ambato has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild afternoons and cool nights all year long due to its elevation of 2400 m above sea level and location near the equator. Its climate is similar to other Andean cities in Ecuador, such as Quito or Cuenca.

==Economy==

Given its central location, Ambato is an important industrial hub for Ecuador. Vehicle bodywork, especially for large transport vehicles is one of the largest employers in the city. In 2010, it was announced that Venezuela will overhaul the metal frames of almost 65% of their transportations and much of that work is to be done in Ambato. Leather tanning also makes up a significant portion of Ambato&#x27;s economic output. Many of the leather goods are sold in nearby Quisapincha or exported. Other areas of economic development include textiles, glass fabrication, foodstuffs, and shoes.

As a transportation hub, Ambato also depends on small tourist sector. Though not as charming or cosmopolitan as larger cities like Quito or Guayaquil, or as attractive as smaller cities like Baños or Otavalo, Ambato&#x27;s attractions include the modern cathedral and the Mera house. Tourists often use Ambato as a base for visiting nearby towns like Quisapincha or Píllaro. The Monday market also brings tourists and locals alike as the streets fill with food and clothing vendors. Many consider Ambato to be a quintessential 21st-century Ecuadorian city: proud of its history, but eager to emerge as a leader in industry and technology.

==The Festival of Fruits and Flowers==
The Festival of Fruits and Flowers is held every year in Ambato to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake that destroyed the city on August 5, 1949, where 6000 people died. The festival was created on June 29, 1950. Although the earthquake was in August, the festival is celebrated in February to fall closer to Carnival. The rich volcanic soil of the area are home to a large number of farms and a great diversity of agricultural products. Ambatenos refer to the city as the &quot;land of the three Juanes,&quot;. Ambateños are commonly referred to as &quot;Guaytambos&quot; or &quot;Patojos&quot; - .

==Points of interest==

===Parque Juan Montalvo===

In the center of the city is the emblematic Montalvo Park. Named after the Ambato-born writer, Juan Montalvo, the park was built in 1905 and has served as a social gathering spot for the people of Ambato since. The park was designed by local architect Pedro Durini. It lies at the meeting point of four important streets in Ambato: Montalvo, Sucre, Bolivar, and Castillo. It also sits in the shadow of the modern cathedral which has served as a symbol of the new Ambato. The statue of Juan Montalvo at the center of the park was built in Italy by Pietro Capurro. It was inaugurated in 1911. The mausoleum where Juan Montalvo is buried is just down the street. The park is currently undergoing a $450,000 renovation to restore the gates and walkways that surround the park. 

===Quinta Juan León Mera===

Home to one of Ambato&#x27;s most famous residents, the Quinta Juan León Mera was the villa-style house of writer Juan León Mera. Located on the north bank of the Ambato River in the neighborhood of Atocha, the house was built in 1874. It is now open to the public. Famous for its gardens, which are supposed to contain over 257 species of flowers, the house also posts well-maintained colonial furniture and paintings. The properties surrounding the Quinta hold now a new Botanic Garden with native and foreign species. Gardens were created inspired on the continents.

===La Catedral===

The very modern, white cathedral is downtown Ambato is perhaps the most recognizable symbol of the city. The cathedral is built on the site of the original chapel that was constructed in 1689. This was destroyed in an earthquake later and a much larger church was built only to be destroyed again in the 1797 Riobamba earthquake. A new church was built of the same design but again, an earthquake claimed the structure in the 1949 Ambato earthquake. The new cathedral was inaugurated in 1954 and sits across the street from Parque Juan Montalvo.

===Central Library===

Located right next to the Casa de Portal is the city&#x27;s newest and largest library. The three-story library is part of the city&#x27;s plan to rejuvenate the downtown area around Parque Montalvo. The library contains over 70,000 titles and has many computer stations for users. The official name is the &quot;Library of the City and Province&quot;, as it serves both the city of Ambato and the larger province of Tungurahua.

===Parque Cevallos===

Within walking distance of Parque Montavlo, Parque Pedro Fermín Cevallos is a leafy space located on one of downtown Ambato&#x27;s main thoroughfares, Calle Cevallos. Two of Ambato&#x27;s most well-known schools are located on the edges of the park: a high school, Colegio Bolivar, and an elementary school, Escuela de la Providencia. In the last few years, concerns about security in the park have led city leaders to re-think the space. In July 2010, plans were made to replace many of the trees and lawns with an open plaza. The plans also called for the building of an underground parking lot beneath the square to alleviate some of Ambato&#x27;s downtown parking woes. In August 2010, Mayor Barona announced that those plans had not received sufficient public support and appeared to be dead.

===Parque de la Familia===
Parque Provincial de la Familia, or &quot;Provincial Park of the Family&quot;, is a large gathering spot located about 7 miles above Ambato. Though the park itself is not within city limits, Ambateños pack the park on weekends. Maintained by the provincial government of Tungurahua, the park is actually just outside the community of Quisapincha. In addition to walking paths, there are open fields, basketball and volley courts, as well as a large garden features an impressive amount of native species. On clear days, the park also affords the visitor excellent views of the city of Ambato and the constantly smoking Tungurahua volcano.

==Neighborhoods==
===Ficoa===
One of the most affluent sections in the city, the neighborhood of Ficoa lines the north bank of the Ambato River across from Miraflores. The trees of Ficoa are famous for their production of succulent fruits, including peaches, pears, and a local variety of citrus. Ficoa is also home to many small restaurants which serve typical Ambateño dishes, such as llapingachos, and fritada.

===Miraflores===

Traditionally considered the most influential neighborhood, Miraflores abuts the downtown on the west side. Miraflores used to be the location of the train depot, connecting it with the city of Quito and giving it a very important position in the city. Without a passenger train through Ambato, Miraflores is now a residential neighborhood, so named because of its many flowers.

===Atocha===

Perhaps the oldest of Ambato&#x27;s neighborhoods, Atocha is famous for being the home to the Quinta Juan León Mera and thus, being an important part of Ambateño and Ecuadorian culture. Together with Ficoa, Atocha makes up the north end of the city. Atocha is also known for the production of colada morada, a purple, spiced drink that is traditionally consumed with bread. Around Carnival, Ambateños flock to Atocha for the drink.

===Ingahurco===

Small quiet neighborhood in Ambato, home to the industrial corporation Plasticaucho Industrial S.A. Ambato&#x27;s bus terminal is located in Ingahurco which sits right next to Technical University of Ambato (Universidad Tecnica de Ambato).

==Transportation==

As an important transportation hub, Ambato is connected with other cities through Ecuador&#x27;s widely used bus system. Although there used to be a train service running through Ambato from Quito to Riobamba, this service has long since closed. Ambato has an airport, the Chachoan Airport in the Izamba neighborhood, but it is not used for commercial flights. The city&#x27;s main bus terminal is located in the Ingahurco neighborhood, which lies on the north side of downtown. This main terminal, or Terminal Terrestre (as it is known in Spanish), serves some of the country&#x27;s numerous bus operators. There are plans to renovate the aging bus terminal, making it the main terminal in a network of terminals around the city. As it stands, travelers can also catch buses traveling to the south from unlabeled stops along the Pan-American Highway.

==Education==

===Universities===
Universidad Técnica de Ambato

The main public university in Ambato, &quot;la Técnica&quot; or &quot;la U&quot; was created on April 18, 1969, in accordance with Ecuadorian law. A technical university, la Técnica offers courses in the many fields of the sciences and humanities. There are three campuses located in Ambato: the main campus is located across from the main bus terminal in the Ingahurco neighborhood, another campus lies to the west in the Huachi neighborhood, and finally a third location is further afield in the Querocacha located in the Cevallos Canton.

Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador (PUCE) - Sede Ambato

&quot;La Catolica&quot; is a branch of Quito&#x27;s Catholic University. The Ambato campus was created on January 13, 1982, by the bishop of Ambato, Monseñor Vicente Cisneros. The university wasn&#x27;t completed until 1994 when classes first began. Even though, the languages courses were the very first goal of the new campus. The university offers courses in both undergraduate and graduate levels as well as open courses of English and French.

Universidad Regional Autonoma de los Andes (UNIANDES)
It is a private university in Ambato.

===High schools===

Ambato contains a wide selection of public and private high schools. In Ambato, all high school students must wear uniforms. Formerly, many of the high schools in Ambato were either all-girls or all-boys schools, but most schools have begun to accept members of the opposite sex. Some of the most well-known high schools in Ambato include: 
* Colegio Instituto Tecnológico Superior Bolivar
* Instituto Superior Tecnologico Docente Guayaquil
* Centro Educativo Diosesano San Pio X
* Colegio de La &quot;Inmaculada&quot;
* Colegio Técnico Rumiñahui
* Colegio Menor Indoamerica
* Colegio Santo Domingo de Guzmán
* Unidad Educativa Mayor Ambato
* Colegio Técnico Atahualpa
* Colegio Universitario Juan Montalvo
* Unidad Educativa Bilingüe Atenas
* Centro Educativo Bilingue Internacional CEBI
* Instituto Técnico Superior Hispano America
* Colegio Técnico Superior Tirso de Molina
* Liceo Policial Galo Miño
* Colegio Natalia Vaca
* Institulo Agropecuario Luis A. Martinez
* Unidad educativa Bolivar
* Unidad Educativa Celite

==Sports==

Ambateños enjoy a variety of sports, but none so much as soccer. Ambato plays host to three professional teams, playing in Ecuador&#x27;s highest leagues: Macará, Técnico, and Mushuc Runa. Macará and Técnico currently play in Serie A and Mushuc Runa in Serie B. All three teams play in the centrally located Estadio Bellavista, and Mushuc Runa also maintains one of the world&#x27;s highest altitude practice stadiums in the Chibuleo community about 20 minutes outside of Ambato, although as it exceeds FIFA altitude rules it is not used for Series fixtures. None of the three teams has been wildly successful in Ecuador or beyond, however they maintain a loyal following of spectators. Matches between Macará and Técnico U. are known as &quot;El Clásico Ambateño&quot; (English: The Ambato Derby). In 2007 both derby teams briefly played in Serie A for the first time in over ten years, and they have been regular fixtures of Serie A in the years since. In general, Ambato has at least one team in Serie A at any given time, and in 2018 Macará has led the series.

There are many other sports popular among Ambateños including basketball, tennis, swimming, and Ecuavolley. Ecuavolley is a variation of volleyball, played specifically in Ecuador. It features three players per team on a small court with a high net. Players normally use a soccer ball in place of a volleyball. Ecuavolley is popular in Ambato and the surrounding regions, where it is played both on formal courts in city parks as well as on the side streets of barrios. The Plaza de toros Monumental is located in Ambato. The bullring has a capacity of 11,000 and it opened in 1963.

Basketball is also gaining popularity in Ambato. There is a very fierce rivalry in basketball between two of Ambato&#x27;s largest high schools, Colegio Nacional Bolívar and Colegio Técnico Guayaquil. These games are usually hosted in the Coliseo Cerrado de Deportes, the large coliseum across the street from Estadio Bellavista.

<doc id="1032500" wikidata="Q7654071" url="?curid=1032500" title="Sway (dance)">
<text>The term sway has a specific meaning in the technique of ballroom dances. Sway describes a dancer&#x27;s body position in which the entire body gracefully deflects from the vertical, normally away from the standing foot and the direction of movement. Entrance to and exit from this position are matters of fine technical detail and differ in various dance figures. 

Sway may be an element of both stationary and moving dance figures. In moving figures, sway is commonly achieved as a natural result of body swing, but small amounts from other sources may be useful as an inflection. Sway comes primarily from an incline of the entire body, but a portion may also come from gradual bending of the trunk. It is customary to consider any bending of the trunk to occur more as a &quot;stretching&quot; of one side of the rib cage more than as a &quot;compression&quot; of the other side. This description helps to produce sway without the body line breaking awkwardly at the waist. Substantial abdominal strength may be needed to fully utilize this technique.

Possible angles of sway range from having the upper body substantially trailing the lower through a movement, to having the upper body a very small amount in advance. The purposes of sway are both better control of dance motion and aesthetics.

<text>Oswaldo Guayasamín Calero (July 6, 1919 – March 10, 1999) was an Ecuadorian painter and sculptor of Kichwa and Mestizo heritage.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Guayasamín was born in Quito, Ecuador, to a native father and a Mestiza mother, both of Kichwa descent. His family was poor and his father worked as a carpenter for most of his life. Oswaldo Guayasamín later worked as a taxi and truck driver. He was the eldest of ten children in his family. When he was young, he enjoyed drawing caricatures of his teachers and the children that he played with. He showed an early love for art. He created a Pan-American art of human and social inequalities which achieved international recognition.

He graduated from the School of Fine Arts in Quito as a painter and sculptor. He also studied architecture there. He held his first exhibition when he was 23, in 1942. While he was attending college, his best friend died during a demonstration in Quito. This incident would later inspire one of his paintings, &quot;Los Niños Muertos&quot; (The Dead Children). This event also helped him to form his vision about the people and the society that he lived in.

===Career===
Guayasamín started painting from the time he was six years old. He loved to draw from that age. Starting from watercolors and transforming all the way through to his signature humanity pieces, his art career had many highlights. Although tragedy molded Guayasamín&#x27;s work, it was his friend&#x27;s death that inspired him to paint powerful symbols of truth in society and injustices around him. While his interest was seldom with his school work, he began selling his art before the time that he could even read. After his attendance at the School of Fine Arts in Quito, his career took off.

La Galería Caspicara, an art gallery opened by Eduardo Kingman in 1940, was one of the first places that Guayasamín was featured. His themes of oppression in the lower social classes allowed him to stand out and gain more recognition. &quot;El Silencio&quot; in particular, was a painting from this showcase that stood out. It marks a shift in Guayasamín&#x27;s work from storytelling to focusing on his subjects symbolizing all human suffering.

Guayasamín met José Clemente Orozco while traveling in the United States of America and Mexico from 1942 to 1943. They traveled together to many of the diverse countries in South America. They visited Peru, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and other countries. Through these travels, he observed more of the indigenous lifestyle and poverty that appeared in his paintings.

Oswaldo Guayasamín won first prize at the Ecuadorian Salón Nacional de Acuarelistas y Dibujantes in 1948. He also won the first prize at the Third Hispano-American Biennial of Art in Barcelona in 1955. In 1957, at the Fourth Biennial of São Paulo, he was named the best South American painter.

In 1988, the Congress of Ecuador asked Guayasamín to paint a mural depicting the history of Ecuador. Due to its controversial nature, the United States government criticized him because one of the figures in the painting shows a man in a Nazi helmet with the lettering &quot;CIA&quot; on it.

The artist&#x27;s last exhibits were inaugurated by him personally in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, and in the Palais de Glace in Buenos Aires in 1995. In Quito, Guayasamín built a museum that features his work. His images capture the political oppression, racism, poverty, Latin American lifestyle, and class division found in much of South America.

Guayasamín dedicated his life to painting, sculpting and collecting. He was an ardent supporter of the communist Cuban Revolution in general and Fidel Castro in particular. He was given a prize for &quot;an entire life of work for peace&quot; by UNESCO. His death on March 10, 1999, was considered a great loss to Ecuador and occurred in the midst of a political and socioeconomic crisis, with the day marked by strikes by the indigenous people (whom he spent his life supporting) and other sectors of society. Guayasamín himself suffered personally in the last months of his life, after his 27-year-old grand-daughter Maita Madriñan Guayasamín, her 4-year-old daughter Alejandra and her 4-month-old son Martín (both Guayasamín&#x27;s great-grandchildren) were killed in the crash of Cubana de Aviación Flight 389 in Quito in August 1998 

He is still lauded as a national treasure and has been likened to the Michelangelo of Latin America by the Spanish art historian José Camón Aznar. In 2002, three years after his death, a building co-designed by Guayasamín, &quot;La Capilla del Hombre&quot; (&quot;The Chapel of Man&quot;), was completed and opened to the public. The Chapel is meant to document not only man&#x27;s cruelty to man but also the potential for greatness within humanity. It is co-located with Guayasamín&#x27;s home in the hills overlooking Quito.

<text>Hombourg-Haut (; ) is a commune located in the department of Moselle, region of Grand Est, in the cultural and historical region Lorraine, north-eastern France.

Hombourg-Haut is an old medieval fortress town, built in the thirteenth century by the bishops of Metz. The old village lies at the foot of the imposing collegiate church in a green and wooded landscape.

Nowadays, the city has several neighbourhoods: the old Hombourg, the old village of Hellering, urban areas with HLMs built in the 1950s-1960s and residential district. The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Hombourgeois&quot; and &quot;Hombourgeoises&quot;.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
After a bitter dispute over the ownership of the castle of &quot;Hombourg-Bas&quot; (the old castle) between the Duke of Lorraine and the bishop of Metz, the latter prevailed end of the 12th century. Hombourg remained the property of the prelates of Metz until the 16th century. In 1270, the bishop, Jacques of Lorraine, decided to build a new and splendid castle on the opposite elongated hill, probably from 1245 on.

This castle became the main seat of the bailiwick of Hombourg/St-Avold. It was the residence of the bishops&#x27; representatives and sometimes of the prelates themselves. In front of the castle, Jacques of Lorraine got a fortified town built, surrounded by a long wall, today&#x27;s &quot;Vieux-Hombourg&quot;. 
Jacques granted his new town privileges and rights and in 1254, he founded a collegiate church with 13 capitular canons that was run until 1743. The collegiate got a new church built in 1300 which took almost a century to complete.

=== Thirty Year&#x27;s War and the decline ===

=== Industrial revolution and steel production ===
In 1758, Charles de Wfendel founded an ironworks at the banks of the Roselle. That was the beginning of the industrial era of Hamburg-Haut. The ironworks was taken over by the d&#x27;Hausen family during the First Empire.
The Gouvy family from Saarland bought the factory in 1850 and transformed it into a modern steel plant. Providing employment to generations of Hombourg&#x27;s inhabitants, the Gouvy steel mill also supported music, sports, youth movements and other leisure activities. The Münch family continued the work of the Gouvys when they bought the factory in 1935, offering work to almost 250 employees. The plant ceased opérations permanently during the 1980s. Following the mill demolition, a shopping centre has been built on the site.

=== Coal mining in the area ===

== Geography ==
Hombourg-Haut is situated thirty two miles east of Metz (capital of the département de la Moselle) and thirteen miles southwest of Saarbrücken (Germany). 
It is surrounded by the following towns and villages: Saint-Avold, Freyming-Merlebach, Betting, Guenviller and Macheren.

The Rosselle, a small affluent of the Saar, flows through Hombourg-Haut.

<text>Robert Paul Butler (born April 1960) is an astronomer and staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., who searches for extrasolar planets.

 he and his team have discovered over half of the planets found orbiting nearby stars. He is noted for his pioneering work in Doppler spectroscopy, a method used to detect stars having orbiting planets by measuring the &quot;wobble&quot; induced by the gravitational forces between the star and its orbiting planet(s).

==Early life and education==
Butler was born in April 1960 in San Diego, California. Even as a boy, he was interested in astronomy. When he was 14, he built an 8-inch reflector telescope and began looking at planets and stars. He was fascinated by early astronomers and cosmologists like Galileo and Giordano Bruno, who dared to speculate about multiple worlds at a time when such ideas were considered heresy. As a high school student in 1977, he learned techniques of orbit calculation when he attended the Summer Science Program at his school.

Butler went on to receive a BA (physics, 1985), a BS (chemistry, 1986) and an MS (physics, 1989) from San Francisco State University, completing his Master&#x27;s thesis with Geoffrey Marcy. During this time, he began work on the design of a very sensitive spectrograph, seeking to detect extrasolar planets by detecting variations in the radial velocity of their parent stars.

Butler received his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1993 from the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences in College Park, Maryland.

==Career==
While Butler was still working on his master&#x27;s degree, he and Marcy developed a spectrographic apparatus capable of detecting the tiny gravitational effects of a planet on its host star. By viewing the starlight they measured through a glass absorption cell containing molecular iodine, they obtained a reference set of spectral lines with sufficient precision to identify the changing light waves caused by a stellar wobble.
After completing his Ph.D., Butler returned to San Francisco State University to work with Marcy. Butler was a research scientist there and a visiting research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley from 1993 to 1997.

In 1995, Marcy and Butler used their Doppler velocity measurement equipment to confirm the discovery by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, of the first true exoplanet to be unequivocally identified orbiting a main sequence star, 51 Pegasi b. Its characteristics were so unexpected that researchers re-examined their assumptions and their data.

In 1996 Marcy and Butler became the first Americans to discover a new planetary system, a planet orbiting 70 Virginis. The planet was detected using radial velocity measurements taken with the C. Donald Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. They went on to find 70 of the first 100 exoplanets to be discovered.

In 1997 Butler became a staff astronomer at the Anglo-Australian Observatory in Sydney, Australia, leading the Anglo-Australian Planet Search. After thirty years of research into exoplanets, few systems have been found that resemble the Solar System.

Since 1999, Butler has been a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. As of 2001, his expressed goal was &quot;to survey all 2,000 Sun-like stars out to 150 light-years.&quot;

==Awards==
Marcy and Butler have shared a number of prizes including the inaugural Bioastronomy Medal of the International Astronomical Union in 1997.
In 2001, Butler and Marcy were awarded the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences &quot;for their pioneering investigations of planets orbiting other stars via high-precision radial velocities.&quot; 
The Carnegie Planet Search Team, consisting of Marcy, Butler, Steven Vogt and Debra Fischer received the Carl Sagan Award from the American Astronautical Society and the Planetary Society in 2002.
Butler received the Beatrice Tinsley Prize of the American Astronomical Society with Marcy and Vogt in 2002.
Marcy and Butler were named Discover Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Space Scientists of the Year&quot; in 2003.

In 2011, Butler was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work in developing the precision Doppler velocity technique, &quot;the most precise method to date&quot; for observing planets that orbit nearby stars, and for his many discoveries of such stars. Butler was credited with a &quot;central role&quot; in changing &quot;the way we look at our place in the universe.&quot;

<doc id="1032530" wikidata="Q1309409" url="?curid=1032530" title="Unanimity">
<text>Unanimity is agreement by all people in a given situation. Groups may consider unanimous decisions as a sign of social, political or agreement, solidarity, and unity. Unanimity may be assumed explicitly after a unanimous vote or implicitly by a lack of objections. It does not necessarily mean uniformity and can sometimes be the opposite of majority in terms of outcomes.

==Voting==
Practice varies as to whether a vote can be considered unanimous if some voter abstains. In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, a &quot;unanimous vote&quot; is not specifically defined, although an abstention is not counted as a vote regardless of the voting threshold. Also in this book, action could be taken by &quot;unanimous consent&quot;, or &quot;general consent&quot;, if there are no objections raised. However, unanimous consent may not necessarily be the same as a unanimous vote (see Not the same as unanimous vote). In either case, it does not take into account the members who were not present.

In contrast, a United Nations Security Council resolution is not considered &quot;unanimous&quot; if a member abstains. In the European Union, the Treaty of Amsterdam introduced the concept of &quot;constructive abstention&quot;, where a member can abstain in a vote where unanimity is required without thereby blocking the success of the vote. This is intended to allow states to symbolically withhold support while not paralysing decision-making.

===Democracies===
The occurrence of unanimity in a representative democracy can be elusive with the diversity and variety of opinions in a participatory democracy. Unanimity is often a political endeavor. Although governments and international organizations may occasionally achieve unanimous decisions, popular consent is most often a more achievable aspiration for elected officials.

===Dictatorships===
The legitimacy supposedly established by unanimity has been used by dictatorial regimes in an attempt to gain support for their position. Participants in a legislature may be coerced or intimidated into supporting the position of a dictator, with the legislature becoming little more than a rubber stamp for a more powerful authority.

One-party states can restrict nominees to one per seat in elections and use compulsory voting or electoral fraud to create an impression of popular unanimity. The 1962 North Korean parliamentary election reported a 100% turnout and a 100% vote for the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. 100% votes have also been claimed by Ahmed Sékou Touré in Guinea in 1975 and 1982, Félix Houphouët-Boigny in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1985, and Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2002.

===Juries===
In criminal law jury trials, many jurisdictions require a guilty verdict by a jury to be unanimous. This is not so in civil law jury trials.

The United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Ramos v. Louisiana&quot; (2020) that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution mandates unanimity in all federal and state criminal jury trials. This overturned &quot;Apodaca v. Oregon&quot;, which held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require jury unanimity in state courts, with a concurring opinion that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution mandates unanimity for a guilty verdict in a federal court jury trial. Many U.S. state constitutions have their own provisions requiring jury unanimity for a finding of guilty; for example, article 21 of the Maryland Constitution&#x27;s Declaration of Rights states:

In England and Wales, since the Juries Act 1974, a guilty verdict may be returned where not more than 2 jurors dissent.

<doc id="1032540" wikidata="Q5871570" url="?curid=1032540" title="Hit the ball twice">
<text>Hit the ball twice, or &quot;double-hit&quot;, is a method of dismissal in the sport of cricket. It is exceptionally rare at all levels of the game. The law was codified at the very latest by 1744 and had likely been introduced earlier than that due to injuries and deaths occurring from double hit attempts in the 1600s and 1700s. The law prohibits a batter from making a second clear attempt to hit the ball after it has hit their bat or their person.

==Definition==
Law 34.1 of the Laws of Cricket states:

34.1 Out Hit the ball twice
&lt;br&gt;
34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his/her person or is struck by his/her bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his/her bat or person, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his/her wicket.&lt;br&gt;
34.1.2 For the purpose of this Law ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker.

A player can hit the ball twice in order to prevent it from hitting his/her stumps but not with a hand that is not in contact with the bat and not if doing so prevents a catch being taken (in which case they would be out obstructing the field). The bowler does not get credit for the wicket.

For the sole purpose of guarding his/her wicket means that a player who hits the ball twice to protect his wicket, without obstructing the field, can then be given out on appeal if they then decide to attempt to score a run. A lawfully struck second hit can be caught for a dismissal if hit into the air, or become a run-out dismissal, but otherwise the play becomes a dead ball with no runs scored and the batsmen returned to their original ends upon the ball hitting the boundary or when the batsmen complete one run. No balls and penalty runs can still be scored with the exception that no penalty runs will be awarded for the batsman&#x27;s second hit striking a helmet left on the playing surface by the fielding side.

==History==
Cricket is often considered to be a rather gentle pastime but it has a history of extreme violence. In the early days before the modern rules had universal effect batsmen could go to almost any lengths to avoid being out. They could obstruct the fielders and they could hit the ball as many times as necessary to preserve their wicket. This had fatal consequences on more than one occasion and strict rules were gradually introduced to prevent the batsman from physically attacking the fielders, to keep them at their crease, and only allowing one attempt to hit the ball even if they missed it with the bat the first time.

In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in West Sussex, were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday 5 May. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local by-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was that &quot;a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt&quot;.

The latter situation was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to &quot;hit the ball more than once&quot; and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as two later incidents confirm.

In 1624, a fatality occurred at Horsted Keynes in East Sussex when a fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the head by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall is thus the earliest known cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner&#x27;s court, which returned a verdict of misadventure.

In 1647, another fatality was recorded at Selsey, West Sussex, when a fielder called Henry Brand was hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time.

It is not known when the rules were changed to outlaw striking for the ball a second time or when the offence of obstructing the field was introduced, but both those rules were clearly stated in the 1744 codification of the Laws of Cricket, which were drawn up by the London Cricket Club and are believed to be based on a much earlier code that has been lost.

The first definite record of a batsman being dismissed for hitting the ball twice occurred in the Hampshire v Kent match at Windmill Down on 13–15 July 1786. Tom Sueter of Hampshire, who had scored 3, was the player in question, as recorded in &quot;Scores and Biographies&quot;.

==Unusual dismissal==
This method of dismissal is the second rarest after timed out, recorded on 23 occasions in first-class cricket and twice in List A cricket.

The last incident of the dismissal in English cricket occurred in 1906 when John King, playing for Leicestershire against Surrey at The Oval tried to score a run after playing the ball twice to avoid getting bowled. Had he not tried to score a run, he would not have been out.

Kurt Wilkinson was dismissed in this manner when playing for Barbados against Rest of Leeward Islands in the 2002–03 Red Stripe Bowl. The dismissal was controversial as there was doubt as to whether Wilkinson had &quot;wilfully&quot; struck the ball twice as required under the relevant law of cricket.

The only occurrence of this dismissal in international cricket was when Malta&#x27;s Fanyan Mughal got out against Romania in the 2023 Men&#x27;s Continental Cup on 20 August 2023. Mughal missed a pull shot, causing the ball to hit him and land nearby on the ground. He then knocked the ball away with his bat — moving it away from the wicket-keeper, who was running in to collect the ball in order to attempt a run-out of the non-striker who was well out of his crease. Because of this, Romania appealed and Mughal was given out by the umpires.

<doc id="1032545" wikidata="Q2137507" url="?curid=1032545" title="Rainwater harvesting">
<text>Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground water. Rainwater harvesting differs from stormwater harvesting as the runoff is typically collected from roofs and other area surfaces for storage and subsequent reuse. Its uses include watering gardens, livestock, irrigation, domestic use with proper treatment, and domestic heating. The harvested water can also be used for long-term storage or groundwater recharge.

Rainwater harvesting is one of the simplest and oldest methods of self-supply of water for households, having been used in South Asia and other countries for many thousands of years. Installations can be designed for different scales, including households, neighborhoods, and communities, and can also serve institutions such as schools, hospitals, and other public facilities.

== Uses ==



=== Domestic use ===
Rooftop rainwater harvesting is used to provide drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels.

Kenya has already been successfully harvesting rainwater for toilets, laundry, and irrigation. Since the establishment of the 2016 Water Act, Kenya has prioritized regulating its agriculture industry. Additionally, areas in Australia use harvested rainwater for cooking and drinking. Studies by Stout et al. on the feasibility of RWH in India found it most beneficial for small-scale irrigation, which provides income from produce sales, and for groundwater recharge.

=== Agriculture ===
In regards to urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding. The combination of urban &#x27;green&#x27; rooftops with rainwater catchments have been found to reduce building temperatures by more than 1.3 degrees Celsius. Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with urban agriculture would be a viable way to help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for cleaner and sustainable cities, health and wellbeing, and food and water security (Sustainable Development Goal 6). The technology is available, however, it needs to be remodeled in order to use water more efficiently, especially in an urban setting.

Missions to five Caribbean countries have shown that the capture and storage of rainwater runoff for later use is able to significantly reduce the risk of losing some or all of the year&#x27;s harvest because of soil or water scarcity. In addition, the risks associated with flooding and soil erosion during high rainfall seasons would decrease. Small farmers, especially those farming on hillsides, could benefit the most from rainwater harvesting because they are able to capture runoff and decrease the effects of soil erosion.

Many countries, especially those with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills and slopes. Even in periods of low rainfall, enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs, dams and ponds can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater so that even on days when little to no rainfall occurs, enough is available to irrigate crops.

=== Industry ===

Frankfurt Airport has the largest rainwater harvesting system in Germany, saving approximately 1 million cubic meters of water per year. The cost of the system was 1.5 million dm (US$63,000) in 1993. This system collects water from the roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 square meters. The water is collected in the basement of the airport in six tanks with a storage capacity of 100 cubic meters. The water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering plants and cleaning the air conditioning system.

Rainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome – The London Olympic Park – in order to increase the sustainability of the facility. A 73% decrease in potable water demand by the park was estimated. Despite this, it was deemed that rainwater harvesting was a less efficient use of financial resources to increase sustainability than the park&#x27;s blackwater recycling program.

== Technologies ==
Traditionally, stormwater management using detention basins served a single purpose. However, optimized real-time control lets this infrastructure double as a source of rainwater harvesting without compromising the existing detention capacity. This has been used in the EPA headquarters to evacuate stored water prior to storm events, thus reducing wet weather flow while ensuring water availability for later reuse. This has the benefit of increasing water quality released and decreasing the volume of water released during combined sewer overflow events.

Generally, check dams are constructed across the streams to enhance the percolation of surface water into the subsoil strata. The water percolation in the water-impounded area of the check dams can be enhanced artificially manyfold by loosening the subsoil strata and ANFO explosives as used in open cast mining. Thus, local aquifers can be recharged quickly using the available surface water fully for use in the dry season.

=== System setup ===
Rainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building&#x27;s terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water. There are common components that are installed in such systems, such as pre-filters (see e.g. vortex filter), drains/gutters, storage containers, and depending on whether the system is pressurized, also pumps, and treatment devices such as UV lights, chlorination devices and post-filtration equipment.

Systems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain an adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. 
For low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture, and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).

=== Rainwater harvesting by solar power panels ===
Good quality water resources near populated areas are becoming scarce and costly for consumers. In addition to solar and wind energy, rainwater is a major renewable resource for any land. Vast areas are being covered by solar PV panels every year in all parts of the world. Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rainwater falling on them and drinking quality water, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple filtration and disinfection processes as rainwater is very low in salinity. Exploiting rainwater for value-added products like bottled drinking water makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall or cloudy areas by generating additional income. Recently, cost-effective rainwater collection in existing wells has been found highly effective in raising groundwater levels in India.

=== Other innovations ===
The Groasis Waterboxx is an example of low scale technology, in this case to assist planting of trees in arid area. It harvests rainwater and dew.

== Advantages ==
Rainwater harvesting provides the independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed countries, it is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. Rainwater harvesting increases the availability of water during dry seasons by increasing the levels of dried borewells and wells. Surface water supply is readily available for various purposes thus reducing dependence on underground water. It improves the quality of ground by diluting salinity. It does not cause pollution and is environmentally friendly. It is cost-effective and easily affordable. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of rainwater harvesting in urban water system provides a substantial benefit for both water supply and wastewater subsystems by reducing the need for clean water in water distribution systems, less generated stormwater in sewer systems, and a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies.

A large body of work has focused on the development of life cycle assessment and its costing methodologies to assess the level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems. 

=== Independent water supply ===
Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during water restrictions. In areas where clean water is costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than the main source, but the harvesting of rainwater can also decrease a household&#x27;s water costs or overall usage levels. Rainwater is safe to drink if the consumers do additional treatments before drinking. Boiling water helps to kill germs. Adding another supplement to the system such as a first flush diverter is also a common procedure to avoid contaminants of the water.

=== Supplemental in drought ===
When drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is scarce but also unpredictable, the use of a rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running downhills. Even in periods of low rainfall, enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs and tanks can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater.

In addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further sustained rather than depleted.

=== Life-cycle assessment ===
Life-cycle assessment is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a system from cradle-to-grave of its lifetime. Devkota et al, developed such a methodology for rainwater harvesting, and found that the building design (e.g., dimensions) and function (e.g., educational, residential, etc.) play critical roles in the environmental performance of the system. 

To address the functional parameters of rainwater harvesting systems, a new metric was developed – the demand to supply ratio (D/S) – identifying the ideal building design (supply) and function (demand) in regard to the environmental performance of rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing. With the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network (thereby requiring treatment), the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one.

=== Cost-effectiveness ===
Although standard RWH systems can provide a water source to developing regions facing poverty, the average cost for an RWH setup can be costly depending on the type of technology used. Governmental aid and NGOs can assist communities facing poverty by providing the materials and education necessary to develop and maintain RWH setups.

Some studies show that rainwater harvesting is a widely applicable solution for water scarcity and other multiple usages, owing to its cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. Constructing new substantial, centralized water supply systems, such as dams, is prone to damage local ecosystems, generates external social costs, and has limited usages, especially in developing countries or impoverished communities. On the other hand, installing rainwater harvesting systems is verified by a number of studies to provide local communities a sustainable water source, accompanied by other various benefits, including protection from flood and control of water runoff, even in poor regions. Rainwater harvesting systems that do not require major construction or periodic maintenance by a professional from outside the community are more friendly to the environment and more likely to benefit the local people for a longer period of time. Thus, rainwater harvesting systems that could be installed and maintained by local people have bigger chances to be accepted and used by more people.

The usage of in-situ technologies can reduce investment costs in rainwater harvesting. In-situ technologies for rainwater harvesting could be a feasible option for rural areas since less material is required to construct them. They can provide a reliable water source that can be utilized to expand agricultural outputs. Above-ground tanks can collect water for domestic use; however, such units can be unaffordable to people in poverty.

== Limitations ==

Rainwater harvesting is a widely used method of storing rainwater in countries presenting with drought characteristics. Several pieces of research have derived and developed different criteria and techniques to select suitable sites for harvesting rainwater. Some research was identified and selected suitable sites for the potential erection of dams, as well as derived a model builder in ArcMap 10.4.1. The model combined several parameters, such as slope, runoff potential, land cover/use, stream order, soil quality, and hydrology to determine the suitability of the site for harvesting rainwater.

Harvested water from RWH systems can be minimal during below-average precipitation in arid urban regions such as the Middle East. RWH is useful for developing areas as it collects water for irrigation and domestic purposes. However, the gathered water should be adequately filtered to ensure safe drinking.

=== Quality of water ===
Rainwater may need to be analyzed properly, and used in a way appropriate to its safety. In the Gansu province, for example, solar water disinfection is used by boiling harvested rainwater in parabolic solar cookers before being used for drinking. These so-called &quot;appropriate technology&quot; methods provide low-cost disinfection options for treatment of stored rainwater for drinking.

While rainwater itself is a clean source of water, often better than groundwater or water from rivers or lakes, the process of collection and storage often leaves the water polluted and non-potable. Rainwater harvested from roofs can contain human, animal and bird feces, mosses and lichens, windblown dust, particulates from urban pollution, pesticides, and inorganic ions from the sea (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4), and dissolved gases (CO2, NOx, SOx). High levels of pesticide have been found in rainwater in Europe with the highest concentrations occurring in the first rain immediately after a dry spell; the concentration of these and other contaminants are reduced significantly by diverting the initial flow of run-off water to waste. Improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism (rather than from the base of the tank) and by using a series of tanks, withdraw from the last in series. Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.

A concept of rainwater harvesting and cleaning it with solar energy for rural household drinking purposes has been developed by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute.

Conceptually, a water supply system should match the quality of water with the end-user. However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts on the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for non-potable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation, and laundry, may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.

Rainwater cisterns can also act as habitat for pathogen-bearing mosquitoes. As a result, care must be taken to ensure that female mosquitoes can not access the cistern to lay eggs. Larvae eating fish can also be added to the cistern, or it can be chemically treated.

== Country examples ==
=== Canada ===
=== India ===
While rainwater harvesting in an urban context has gained traction in recent years, evidence points toward rainwater harvesting in rural India since ancient times. 

=== United Kingdom ===
=== United States ===
=== Other countries ===

* Uganda: Rainwater harvesting has been used in Uganda to promote household and community scale water security for many years. Regular maintenance is an ongoing challenge with existing installation and there are many examples of installations that have failed due to poor maintenance. Research has also shown that awareness of RWH and how to access necessary resources to implement RWH is variable across Ugandan society.
* Thailand has the largest fraction of the population in the rural area relying on rainwater harvesting (currently around 40%). Rainwater harvesting was promoted heavily by the government in the 1980s. In the 1990s, after government funding for the collection tanks ran out, the private sector stepped in and provided several million tanks to private households, many of which continue to be used. This is one of the largest examples of self-supply of water worldwide.
*In Bermuda, the law requires all new construction to include rainwater harvesting adequate for the residents.
*New Zealand has plentiful rainfall in the West and South, and rainwater harvesting is the normal practice in many rural areas, using roof water directed by spouting into covered, 1000 litre storage tanks, with the encouragement of most local councils.
* In Sri Lanka, rainwater harvesting has been a popular method of obtaining water for agriculture and for drinking purposes in rural homes. The legislation to promote rainwater harvesting was enacted through the Urban Development Authority (Amendment) Act, No. 36 of 2007. The Lanka Rainwater Harvesting Forum is leading Sri Lanka&#x27;s initiative. The tank cascade system is an ancient irrigation system spanning the island of Sri Lanka.

== History ==

The construction and use of cisterns to store rainwater can be traced back to the Neolithic Age, when waterproof lime plaster cisterns were built in the floors of houses in village locations of the Levant, a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east. By the late 4000 BC, cisterns were essential elements of emerging water management techniques used in dry-land farming.

Many ancient cisterns have been discovered in some parts of Jerusalem and throughout what is today Israel/Palestine. At the site believed by some to be that of the biblical city of Ai (Khirbet et-Tell), a large cistern dating back to around 2500 BC was discovered that had a capacity of nearly . It was carved out of a solid rock, lined with large stones, and sealed with clay to keep it from leaking.

The Greek island of Crete is also known for its use of large cisterns for rainwater collection and storage during the Minoan period from 2,600 BC–1,100 BC. Four large cisterns have been discovered at Myrtos-Pyrgos, Archanes, and Zakroeach. The cistern found at Myrtos-Pyrgos was found to have a capacity of more than and to date back to 1700 BC.

Around 300 BC, farming communities in Balochistan (now located in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran), and Kutch, India, used rainwater harvesting for agriculture and many other uses. Rainwater harvesting was done by Chola kings as well. Rainwater from the Brihadeeswarar temple (located in Balaganapathy Nagar, Thanjavur, India) was collected in Shivaganga tank. During the later Chola period, the Vīrānam tank was built (1011 to 1037 AD) in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu to store water for drinking and irrigation purposes. Vīrānam is a 16-km-long tank with a storage capacity of .

Rainwater harvesting was also common in the Roman Empire. While Roman aqueducts are well-known, Roman cisterns were also commonly used and their construction expanded with the Empire. For example, in Pompeii, rooftop water storage was common before the construction of the aqueduct in the 1st century BC. This history continued with the Byzantine Empire; for example, the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul.

Though little known, the town of Venice for centuries depended on rainwater harvesting. The lagoon surrounding Venice is brackish water, which is unsuitable for drinking. Venice&#x27;s ancient inhabitants established a rainwater collection system based on man-made insulated collection wells. Water percolated down the specially designed stone flooring, and was filtered by a layer of sand, then collected at the bottom of the well. Later, as Venice acquired territories on the mainland, it started to import water by boat from local rivers. Still, the wells remained in use and were especially important in times of war when an enemy could block access to the mainland water.

<text>The Amur Cossack Host () was a Cossack host created in the Amur region and Primorye in the 1850s on the basis of the Cossacks relocated from the Transbaikal region and freed miners of Nerchinsk region.

==Early history==

Their resettlement began in 1854. The first Cossack &quot;stanitsa&quot; (Khabarovskaya) was created in 1858. A decree announcing the creation of the Amur Cossack Host was issued in 1860. Initially the host was subordinate to the military governor of the Amur Oblast and Primorye. In 1879 it became responsible to the governor of the Amur Oblast. Subsequently, the Amur Cossack army became the responsibility of the Governor-General of the Amur region and the Commander of the armies of the military district of the Amur region (the latter was also the ataman of the Amur and Ussuri Cossack Hosts). The headquarters of the Amur Cossack Host was located in Blagoveshchensk.

==Region, resources and organisation==
The Amur Cossack Host patrolled the borders along the Amur River and Ussuri River (in 1889, a separate Ussuri Cossack Host was created for patrolling the Ussuri). It also staffed the Amur-Ussuri flotilla (river squadron), created in 1897. The Amur Cossacks possessed 5,8 million desyatinas of land (64,000 km2). The Cossack population (120 settlements) numbered 49,200 people. In times of peace, the Amur Cossack Host supplied 1 mounted regiment (4 ) and 1 platoon of local guards. In times of war this contribution expanded to two mounted regiments,
1 platoon of guards, 5 special and 1 reserve sotnyas and 1 infantry battalion. These made up a total of 3,600 men.
The Amur Cossack Host took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05
and World War I. During the Russian Civil War a significant number of the Amur Cossacks fought on the side of the Soviets. There were also some small units that fought on the side of the White Movement, more specifically in helping to regain control of the Amur region.

==Distinctions==
The distinguishing colour of the Amur Cossack Host was yellow; worn on the cap bands and broad trouser stripes of a green uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Epaulettes were green. High fleece hats were worn on occasion with yellow cloth tops. White blouses and cap covers were worn in summer (see photograph opposite). In 1911 their parade uniform comprised a dark green &quot;chessman&quot; (frock coat) with yellow piping on cuffs and collar, the fleece hat and blue-grey breeches with yellow stripes.
The field service dress worn during World War I consisted of a khaki-grey tunic or blouse, worn with the grey-blue breeches noted above.

In common with other Cossacks, no spurs were worn by the Amur Host.

<text>Edmund O&#x27;Meara (, also known as Edmund Meara; 1614–1681) was an Irish physiologist and one of the last prominent champions of the medical ideas of Galen. Son of Dermod O&#x27;Meara who was a physician, poet and author. O&#x27;Meara is remembered today for his criticism of vivisection, stating that the agony suffered by lab animals distorted the research results, using this as a basis to reject William Harvey&#x27;s ideas about the circulatory system and defend the earlier theories of Galen.

O&#x27;Meara wrote an epitaph for Malachy Ó Caollaidhe, but was unable to locate his grave.
