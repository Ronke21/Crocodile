==History==

Hornsby Shire is the traditional lands occupied by the Darug and Kuringgai peoples of indigenous Australians. While the northern part of the Shire via the Hawkesbury River was visited by the first European settlers in late 1788, due to the Shire&#x27;s rugged landscape permanent European settlement did not begin until almost half a century later.

Hornsby Shire got its name from the town of Hornsby at the eastern end of the Shire, is derived from convict-turned-Constable Samuel Horne, who earned distinction by capturing bushrangers Dalton and MacNamara on 22 June 1830. In return he was granted land in the locality known as &quot;Hornsby Place&quot;.

Hornsby Shire has remained largely rural for many decades. The construction of the Main North railway line in the 1880s opened up the Shire to the rest of Sydney and also to Newcastle, but it was not until motor vehicles became commonplace in the 1950s that the southern part of the Shire truly became part of Sydney&#x27;s suburbia. The Shire was incorporated as a local government authority on 6 March 1906.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Hornsby Shire merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of part of Hornsby with the Ku-ring-gai Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 270,000. The second proposed a merger of parts of Parramatta, Auburn, The Hills, Hornsby, and Holroyd to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 215,725. The outcome of the review was that the suburbs of Hornsby Shire Council south of the M2 joined an expanded Parramatta City Council. The NSW Government also gave in principle support for the Hornsby Shire suburbs north of the M2 to amalgamate with Ku-ring-gai Council. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. This failed merger resulted in the council losing lucrative area south of the M2 including Epping and Carlingford.

== Heritage listings ==
The Hornsby Shire has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Brooklyn, Main Northern railway: Hawkesbury River railway station
* Cheltenham, 67 Cobran Road: &quot;Ahimsa&quot;, Cheltenham

==Geography==

Hornsby calls itself the &#x27;Bushland Shire&#x27;. This is in reference to its location on a high ridge separating two expansive areas of natural bushland which consists of up to 70% of the total area: The Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park on the eastern side and the Berowra Valley Regional Park on the western side. These provide large areas of natural parkland that form a green belt running from Sydney at the south to the Hawkesbury River at the Shire&#x27;s northern end. These parks are extremely popular with day-trippers from all areas of Sydney and provides diverse recreations such as bushwalking and boating.

The northern half of Hornsby Shire remains a semi-rural area, retaining a number of farmlands and market gardens. This area consists of small village settlements such as Mount Colah and Hornsby Heights. The village of Galston is the centre of this rural area.

The western part of the shire shares a border with The Hills Shire and is separated from the rest of the Shire by national parks and the Galston Gorge.

The southern half of the Shire is urban, forming part of Sydney&#x27;s suburbia on the North Shore and Northern Suburbs. Traditionally most of the Shire&#x27;s residents live in free-standing houses, but in recent years a number of semi-detached housings as well as high-density apartments have appeared around Hornsby&#x27;s central business district.

The Shire has several areas with industrial activity including Hornsby, Asquith and Thornleigh. The major commercial centres of the Shire, apart from Hornsby&#x27;s central business district, are the suburbs of Pennant Hills and North Epping.

Local attractions in the Hornsby Shire include its easily accessible wilderness areas including part of the Great North Walk, parkland recreational facilities such as Fagan Park at Galston, Pennant Hills Park, Koala Park Sanctuary in West Pennant Hills, and the village of Brooklyn on the Hawkesbury River.

Hornsby Shire has four public libraries (at Hornsby, Pennant Hills, Berowra and Galston, two public swimming pools (&quot;aquatic centres&quot;), and a range of other sporting and community facilities.

<doc id="1024563" wikidata="Q31583" url="?curid=1024563" title="Kapan">
<text>Kapan ( ) is a town in southeast Armenia, serving as the administrative centre of the Kapan Municipality and also as the provincial capital of Syunik Province. It is located in the valley of the Voghji River and is on the northern slopes of Mount Khustup. Kapan is the most populous town in the Syunik Province as well as the entire region of southern Armenia. According to the 2011 census, the population of Kapan was 43,190, a slight decline from 45,711 in the 2001 census. According to the 2022 census, the current population of the town is around 32,780.

==Etymology==
The name Kapan derives from the Classical Armenian common noun (), meaning (related to the verb ). In later centuries, the name evolved into (), which was in use until 1991, when the older form of the name was restored.

==History==
===Ancient history and Middle Ages===

The area of modern-day Kapan was first mentioned in the 5th century as a small settlement within the properties of the Siunia dynasty. Historically, it was part of the &quot;&quot; canton of Syunik, the ninth province of the historic Greater Armenia. Though originally a small settlement, by the late 9th and early 10th century, it was fortified by Prince Dzagik, becoming the residence of the Dzagikian princes. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler of Syunik, Prince Smbat II, moved to the town of Kapan and founded the Kingdom of Syunik, proclaiming himself a king under the protectorate of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. As the capital of the Kingdom of Syunik, Kapan flourished throughout the 11th century, reaching around 20 thousand inhabitants, composed of mostly Armenians with a prominent Jewish minority, and being a center of trades, crafts, and metallurgy.

In 1103, Kapan was entirely ruined by the Seljuk invaders. The medieval Armenian historian Stephen Orbelian of Syunik states that the Seljuks began massacring from the Jewish quarter of Kapan. After the fall of the Kingdom of Syunik in 1170, Syunik and the rest of the historic territories of Armenia suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, in that order, between the 12th and 15th centuries.

===Iranian rule===
At the beginning of the 16th century, Kapan became part of the Erivan Province within the Safavid Iran. In 1722, the Armenian principality of Kapan was established by uniting the noble families of Syunik into one state in order to fight against Muslim oppression. By the beginning of the 18th century, Kapan was associated with the Armenian military leader David Bek, who led the liberation campaign of the Armenians of Syunik against the Iranians and the invading Ottoman Turks. David Bek started his battles in 1722 with the help of thousands of local Armenians, including Avan Yuzbashi and Mkhitar Sparapet, taking control of Syunik. The centre of Bek&#x27;s struggle was the Baghaberd Fortress northwest of Kapan and the Halidzor Fortress southwest of Kapan, where he died in 1728. In 1747, Kapan was incorporated into the Nakhichevan Khanate and by 1750, Kapan became part of the newly formed Karabakh Khanate. It was turned into a significant urban settlement during Qajar Iranian rule by the end of the 18th century.

===Russian rule===
In 1813, the territory of historic Syunik, including the region of Kapan, officially became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13 and the following Treaty of Gulistan signed between Russia and Iran. In 1828–30, many Armenian families from the Iranian cities of Khoy and Salmast migrated to the region. In 1868, it became part of the Zangezur uezd within the Elizavetpol Governorate of the Russian Empire. By the last quarter of the 19th century, Kapan formed an important urban community for the region as a result of merging several villages together.

===Modern history===
Both the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic claimed Kapan between 1918 and 1920. As a result of the sovietisation of Armenia in December 1920, Kapan was included in the Republic of Mountainous Armenia under the commandment of Garegin Nzhdeh, who fought against the Bolsheviks between 26 April and 12 July 1921. After the Soviet Red Army entered the Zangezur region in July 1921, Kapan, along with the towns of Goris, Sisian and Meghri, fell under the Soviet rule, where it was administered as part of the Armenian SSR.

In September 1930, the Kafan raion was formed with Kapan as its administrative center. In 1938, Kapan received city status. Until 1991, the city was called in Russian and in Armenian.

Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Kapan became the centre of the newly formed Syunik Province as per the 1995 administrative reforms of the republic. Many streets bearing the name of Bolshevik activists were changed. The town&#x27;s central square was renamed after Garegin Nzhdeh, while the central park of the town was named after Vazgen Sargsyan.

During the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, Kapan was bombarded by artillery coming from the neighboring Zangilan District of Azerbaijan, causing deaths among the civilian population. This prompted an Armenian operation to capture several nearby Azerbaijani border villages in December 1992.

==Geography and climate==
Kapan is the largest town in the Syunik province as well as the entire region of southern Armenia. It is located in the eastern part of Syunik, within the narrow valley of the Voghji River with a length of from the east to the west, at the southeastern slopes of the Zangezur Mountains, between the Bargushat and Meghri ridges.

The town is about north of the Iranian border. With a height of 3201 meters, Mount Khustup is the highest peak of the region. The elevation of Kapan is 750–1050 meters above sea level, with an average height of 910 meters. Two tributaries of the Voghji River, Vachagan and Kavart, flow through the town.

Kapan has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with very warm summers and cold winters. Temperatures can reach up to during summer, and can fall to during winter.

The Shikahogh State Preserve, founded in 1958, is located around south of Kapan, near the Shikahogh village. The preserve is home to about 1,100 species of plants, 70 of which have been registered in the Red Book of Armenia. The fauna of Shikahogh has not been fully explored, but studies have revealed rare species of animals such as leopard, wild goat, bear, viper, and hedgehog.

==Demographics==

Kapan is a major historic centre of the Armenian civilization within historic Syunik. A sizable Jewish community lived in its own quarter in Kapan during the Middle Ages.

During the first half of the 19th century, many Russian and German engineers and workers arrived in Kapan to work in the copper mines of the region. In 1850, Greek specialists also arrived in the town. The Greeks built the Saint Catherine Orthodox church near Kapan in 1865.

The population of Kapan was at its peak with 45,711 citizens as per the 2001 census. However, the population has greatly declined during the first decade of the 21st century to 34,600 as per the 2016 official estimate.

Currently, Kapan is almost entirely populated by ethnic Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The town&#x27;s Saint Mesrop Mashtots Church opened in December 2001 and is regulated by the Diocese of Syunik of the Armenian Apostolic Church, based in the nearby town of Goris.
The town is served by the Kapan Medical Center, which was fully modernized in 2015.

==Culture==

The historic part of Kapan is located around km west of the modern-day town. As one of the historic settlements of Armenia, Kapan and the surrounding areas are home to many heritage monuments of Armenian architecture, including:
*Baghaberd Fortress of the 4th century, also known as the castle of Davit Bek.
*The medieval bridge of Kapan dating back to 871.
*Tatev Monastery of the 9th century, founded in the place of an ancient tabernacle well known in ancient times.
*Vahanavank Monastery of the 11th century.
*Halidzor Fortress of the 17th century.

The town has several statues of prominent Armenian patriotic figures, such as the equestrian statue of Davit Bek erected in 1983, and Garegin Nzhdeh&#x27;s memorial opened in 2001. Other decorative statues in the town include the bear statue of &quot;Kajaran&#x27;s Key&quot; erected in 1966, the statue of the &quot;Girl from Zangezur&quot; erected in 1978, the World War II memorial opened in 1987, and the memorial to Armenian genocide erected in 1988.

Currently, the town is home to the Kapan Museum of Geology and the Kapan history museum named after Shmavon Movsisyan. Other cultural institutions of Kapan include the Children&#x27;s School of Fine Arts opened in 1972, the House of Culture opened in 1977, the Children&#x27;s School of Arts opened in 1981, the public library, the children&#x27;s and youth creativity centre opened in 1990, the Alexander Shirvanzade drama theatre of Kapan, as well as two schools of music, which opened in 1977 and 1986. A branch of the Modern Art Museum of Yerevan is also operating in Kapan.

The Wings of Tatev cableway connecting Halidzor village with the Tatev Monastery is located north of Kapan. It is the longest reversible aerial tramway built in one section only.

===Media===
Kapan has two local TV companies: Khustup TV and Sosi TV. Khustup TV was founded in 2004 and covers the entire region of Syunik. Sosi TV was founded in 2012 and covers the central and southern parts of Syunik.

==Transportation==

The M-2 main road that connects the capital Yerevan with southern Armenia and the Iranian border passes through Kapan.

In late 2008, the road between Kapan and Meghri on the Iranian border was redeveloped. However, the Kapan-Zangilan-Mincivan railway line is currently inactive.

Prior to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, the nearby airport accommodated the YAK-40 and AN-14 cargo aircraft. In February 2017, the governor of Syunik Province, Vahe Hakobyan, announced that the airfield would become a modern airport serving the town of Kapan and southern Armenia, and on June 6 a test landing was conducted at the airfield with the governor on board. According to the plan, the reconstruction of Kapan Airport was expected to be completed in 2018, with an estimated cost of US$2 million.

<text>The International Working Union of Socialist Parties (IWUSP; also known as the 2½ International or the Vienna International; , IASP) was a political international for the co-operation of socialist parties.

==History==
The IWUSP was founded on 27 February 1921 at a conference in Vienna, Austria, by ten parties, including the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), the Independent Labour Party (ILP), the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SPS), the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), and the Federation of Romanian Socialist Parties (FPSR, created by splinter groups of the Socialist Party of Romania). In April 1921, it was joined by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. The Maximalist faction of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) also joined.

==Members==
The secretary of the IWUSP was the Austrian Friedrich Adler of the SPÖ; other prominent members were Otto Bauer and Julius Martov. The group was heavily influenced by Austromarxism. It published &quot;Nachrichten der Internationalen Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sozialistischer Parteien&quot; (&quot;News of the IWUSP&quot;). Poale Zion (labour Zionist) leaders David Ben-Gurion and Shlomo Kaplansky were active in the movement behind the Two and a Half International.

==Ideology==
The founders of the IWUSP were parties that saw neither the reformist Second International nor the Communist and pro-Soviet Third International as alternatives for affiliation. The IWUSP criticized the other two Internationals for what it perceived to be dogmatism, and advocated that more consideration should be given to the particularities of the political situation in each country. It worked for the unification of the Second and Third Internationals. From 2 to 5 April 1922 the Conference of the Three Internationals was held in Berlin with delegations from the three different international bodies to discuss a merger, but unity was not achieved and the Comintern withdrew from the talks.

==Dissolution==
In Germany on 24 September 1922, the USPD, one of the main components of the IWUSP, merged with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), a member of the Berne International. Discouraged by the intransigent position of the Third International, the Berne International and the IWUSP merged to form the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) at a joint congress in Hamburg in May 1923. Some, such as the FPSR, refused to join the new body.

In the 1930s, a similar effort was made to create an international between the reformism of the Second and the Leninism of the Third, as the London Bureau of left-wing socialist parties. Sometimes called the &quot;Three-and-a-Half International&quot;, it involved many of the same parties.

<text>Cytochrome P450 3A4 (abbreviated CYP3A4) () is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the intestine, which in humans is encoded by &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene. It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics), such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed from the body. It is highly homologous to CYP3A5, another important CYP3A enzyme.

While many drugs are deactivated by CYP3A4, there are also some drugs that are &quot;activated&quot; by the enzyme. Some substances, such as some drugs and furanocoumarins present in grapefruit juice, interfere with the action of CYP3A4. These substances will, therefore, either amplify or weaken the action of those drugs that are modified by CYP3A4.

CYP3A4 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of oxidizing enzymes. Several other members of this family are also involved in drug metabolism, but CYP3A4 is the most common and the most versatile one. Like all members of this family, it is a hemoprotein, i.e. a protein containing a heme group with an iron atom. In humans, the CYP3A4 protein is encoded by the &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene. This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 7q22.1. Previously another CYP3A gene, &quot;CYP3A3&quot;, was thought to exist; however, it is now thought that this sequence represents a transcript variant of &quot;CYP3A4&quot;. Alternatively-spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

== Function ==
CYP3A4 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of steroids (including cholesterol), and other lipids.

The CYP3A4 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, and its expression is induced by glucocorticoids and some pharmacological agents. Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize approximately 60% of prescribed drugs, with CYP3A4 responsible for about half of this metabolism; substrates include acetaminophen (paracetamol), codeine, ciclosporin (cyclosporin), diazepam, erythromycin, and chloroquine. The enzyme also metabolizes some steroids and carcinogens. Most drugs undergo deactivation by CYP3A4, either directly or by facilitated excretion from the body. Also, many substances are bioactivated by CYP3A4 to form their active compounds, and many protoxins are toxicated into their toxic forms &quot;(see table below for examples)&quot;.

CYP3A4 also possesses epoxygenase activity in that it metabolizes arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), i.e. (±)-8,9-, (±)-11,12-, and (±)-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. EETs have a wide range of activities including the promotion of certain types of cancers (see epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid). CYP3A4 promotes the growth of various types of human cancer cell lines in culture by producing (±)-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which stimulate these cells to grow. The CYP3A4 enzyme is also reported to have fatty acid monooxgenase activity for metabolizing arachidonic acid to 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). 20-HETE has a wide range of activities that include growth stimulation in breast and other types of cancers (see 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid).

== Evolution ==
The &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene exhibits a much more complicated upstream regulatory region in comparison with its paralogs. This increased complexity renders the &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene more sensitive to endogenous and exogenous pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) ligands, instead of relying on gene variants for wider specificity. Chimpanzee and human CYP3A4 are highly conserved in metabolism of many ligands, although four amino acids positively selected in humans led to a 5-fold benzylation of 7-BFC in the presence of the hepatotoxic secondary bile acid lithocholic acid. This change in consequence contributes to an increased human defense against cholestasis.

== Tissue distribution ==
Fetuses do not express &quot;CYP3A4&quot; in their liver tissue, but rather &quot;CYP3A7&quot; (), which acts on a similar range of substrates. CYP3A4 increases to approximately 40% of adult levels in the fourth month of life and 72% at 12 months.

Although CYP3A4 is predominantly found in the liver, it is also present in other organs and tissues of the body, where it may play an important role in metabolism. CP3A4 is the major CYP enzyme in the intestine. CYP3A4 in the intestine plays an important role in the metabolism of certain drugs. Often this allows prodrugs to be activated and absorbed, as in the case of the histamine H1-receptor antagonist terfenadine.

CYP3A4 has also been identified in the brain, but its role in the central nervous system is unknown.

== Mechanisms ==
Cytochrome P450 enzymes perform an assortment of modifications on a variety of ligands, utilizing its large active site and its ability to bind more than one substrate at a time to perform complicated chemical alterations in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds. These include hydroxylation, epoxidation of olefins, aromatic oxidation, heteroatom oxidations, N- and O- dealkylation reactions, aldehyde oxidations, dehydrogenation reactions, and aromatase activity.

Hydroxylation of an sp3 C-H bond is one of the ways in which CYP3A4 (and cytochrome P450 oxygenases) affects its ligand. In fact, hydroxylation is sometimes followed by dehydrogenation, leading to more complex metabolites. An example of a molecule that undergoes more than one reaction due to CYP3A4 includes tamoxifen, which is hydroxylated to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and then dehydrated to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen quinone methide.

Two mechanisms have been proposed as the primary pathway of hydroxylation in P450 enzymes. The first pathway suggested is a cage-controlled radical method (&quot;oxygen rebound&quot;), and the second involves a concerted mechanism that does not utilize a radical intermediate but instead acts very quickly via a &quot;radical clock&quot;.

== Inhibition through fruit ingestion ==
In 1998, various researchers showed that grapefruit juice, and grapefruit in general, is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, which can affect the metabolism of a variety of drugs, increasing their bioavailability. In some cases, this can lead to a fatal interaction with drugs like astemizole or terfenadine. The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989. The first published report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991 in the &quot;Lancet&quot; entitled &quot;Interactions of Citrus Juices with Felodipine and Nifedipine&quot;, and was the first reported food-drug interaction clinically. The effects of grapefruit last from 3–7 days, with the greatest effects when juice is taken an hour previous to administration of the drug.

In addition to grapefruit, other fruits have similar effects. Noni (&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot;), for example, is a dietary supplement typically consumed as a juice and also inhibits CYP3A4. Pomegranate juice has shown some inhibition in limited studies, but has not yet demonstrated the effect in humans.

== Variability ==
While over 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene, it has been found that this does not translate into significant interindividual variability . It can be supposed that this may be due to the induction of CYP3A4 on exposure to substrates.

CYP3A4 alleles that have been reported to have minimal function compared to wild-type include CYP3A4*6 (an A17776 insertion) and CYP3A4*17 (F189S). Both of these SNPs led to decreased catalytic activity with certain ligands, including testosterone and nifedipine in comparison to wild-type metabolism. By contrast, &quot;CYP3A4*1G&quot; allele has more potent enzymatic activity compared to &quot;CYP3A4*1A&quot; (the wild-type allele).

Variability in CYP3A4 function can be determined noninvasively by the erythromycin breath test (ERMBT). The ERMBT estimates CYP3A4 activity by measuring the radiolabelled carbon dioxide exhaled after an intravenous dose of (14C-&quot;N&quot;-methyl)-erythromycin.

== Induction ==
CYP3A4 is induced by a wide variety of ligands. These ligands bind to the pregnane X receptor (PXR). The activated PXR complex forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which binds to the XREM region of the &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene. XREM is a regulatory region of the &quot;CYP3A4&quot; gene, and binding causes a cooperative interaction with proximal promoter regions of the gene, resulting in increased transcription and expression of CYP3A4. Activation of the PXR/RXR heterodimer initiates transcription of the CYP3A4 promoter region and gene. Ligand binding increases when in the presence of CYP3A4 ligands, such as in the presence of aflatoxin B1, M1, and G1. Indeed, due to the enzyme&#x27;s large and malleable active site, it is possible for the enzyme to bind multiple ligands at once, leading to potentially detrimental side effects.

Induction of CYP3A4 has been shown to vary in humans depending on sex. Evidence shows an increased drug clearance by CYP3A4 in women, even when accounting for differences in body weight. A study by Wolbold et al. (2003) found that the median CYP3A4 levels measured from surgically removed liver samples of a random sample of women exceeded CYP3A4 levels in the livers of men by 129%. CYP3A4 mRNA transcripts were found in similar proportions, suggesting a pre-translational mechanism for the up-regulation of CYP3A4 in women. The exact cause of this elevated level of enzyme in women is still under speculation, however studies have elucidated other mechanisms (such as CYP3A5 or CYP3A7 compensation for lowered levels of CYP3A4) that affect drug clearance in both men and women.

CYP3A4 substrate activation varies amongst different animal species. Certain ligands activate human PXR, which promotes CYP3A4 transcription, while showing no activation in other species. For instance, mouse PXR is not activated by rifampicin and human PXR is not activated by pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile In order to facilitate study of CYP3A4 functional pathways &quot;in vivo,&quot; mouse strains have been developed using transgenes in order to produce null/human CYP3A4 and PXR crosses. Although humanized hCYP3A4 mice successfully expressed the enzyme in their intestinal tract, low levels of hCYP3A4 were found in the liver. This effect has been attributed to CYP3A4 regulation by the growth hormone signal transduction pathway. In addition to providing an &quot;in vivo&quot; model, humanized CYP3A4 mice (hCYP3A4) have been used to further emphasize gender differences in CYP3A4 activity.

CYP3A4 activity levels have also been linked to diet and environmental factors, such as duration of exposure to xenobiotic substances. Due to the enzyme&#x27;s extensive presence in the intestinal mucosa, the enzyme has shown sensitivity to starvation symptoms and is upregulated in defense of adverse effects. Indeed, in fatheaded minnows, unfed female fish were shown to have increased PXR and CYP3A4 expression, and displayed a more pronounced response to xenobiotic factors after exposure after several days of starvation. By studying animal models and keeping in mind the innate differences in CYP3A4 activation, investigators can better predict drug metabolism and side effects in human CYP3A4 pathways.

==Turnover==
Estimates of the turnover rate of human CYP3A4 vary widely. For hepatic CYP3A4, &quot;in vivo&quot; methods yield estimates of the enzyme half-life mainly in the range of 70 to 140 hours, whereas &quot;in vitro&quot; methods give estimates from 26 to 79 hours. Turnover of gut CYP3A4 is likely to be a function of the rate of enterocyte renewal; an indirect approach based on the recovery of activity following exposure to grapefruit juice yields measurements in the 12- to 33-hour range.

==Technology==
Due to membrane-bound CYP3A4&#x27;s natural propensity to conglomerate, it has historically been difficult to study drug binding in both solution and on surfaces. Co-crystallization is difficult since the substrates tend to have a low KD (between 5–150 μM) and low solubility in aqueous solutions. A successful strategy in isolating the bound enzyme is the functional stabilization of monomeric CYP3A4 on silver nanoparticles produced from nanosphere lithography and analyzed via localized surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (LSPR). These analyses can be used as a high-sensitivity assay of drug binding, and may become integral in further high-throughput assays utilized in initial drug discovery testing. In addition to LSPR, CYP3A4-Nanodisc complexes have been found helpful in other applications including solid-state NMR, redox potentiometry, and steady-state enzyme kinetics.

<text>The chief minister of Maharashtra (IAST: Mahārāṣṭrāce Mukhyamaṃtrī) is the head of the executive branch of the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Following elections to the Legislative Assembly, the governor invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government and appoints the chief minister. If the appointee is not a member of either the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of Maharashtra, then the Constitution stipulates that they need to be elected within six months of being sworn in. The office of the CM is coterminous with the concurrent Assembly provided the CM commands confidence in the house and hence does not exceed five years. However, it is subject to no term limits.

Maharashtra was formed by dissolution of Bombay State and Hyderabad State on 1 May 1960. Yashwantrao Chavan, who was serving as the third CM of Bombay State since 1956, became the first CM of Maharashtra. He belonged to the Indian National Congress and held the office until the 1962 Assembly elections. Marotrao Kannamwar succeeded him and was the only CM to die while in office. Vasantrao Naik, who was in office from December 1963 to February 1975 for more than 11 years, has by far been the longest serving CM. He also was the first and only CM to complete his full term of five years (1967-1972) till Devendra Fadnavis matched it (2014-2019). With the exceptions of Manohar Joshi (SS), Narayan Rane (SS), Devendra Fadnavis (BJP), Uddhav Thackeray (SS) and Eknath Shinde (SS), all other CMs have been from the Congress or its breakaway parties.

So far, President&#x27;s rule has been imposed thrice in the state: first from February to June 1980 and again from September to October 2014. It was again imposed on 12 November 2019.

The current incumbent is Devendra Fadnavis of the Bharatiya Janata Party since 5 December 2024.

<doc id="1024613" wikidata="Q1117056" url="?curid=1024613" title="Bulgarian Muslims">
<text>The Muslim Bulgarians (, &quot;Bǎlgari-mohamedani&quot;, as of recently also Българи-мюсюлмани, &quot;Bǎlgari-mjusjulmani&quot;, locally called &quot;Pomak&quot;, &quot;ahryan&quot;, &quot;poganets&quot;, &quot;marvak&quot;, or &quot;poturnak&quot;) are Bulgarians who follow the faith of Islam. They are generally thought to be the descendants of the indigenous Slavs who converted to Islam during Ottoman rule. Most scholars have agreed that the Bulgarian Muslims are a &quot;religious group of Bulgarian Slavs who speak Bulgarian as their mother tongue and do not understand Turkish, but whose religion and customs are Islamic&quot;. Bulgarian Muslims live mostly in the Rhodopes – Smolyan Province, the southern part of the Pazardzhik and Kardzhali Provinces and the eastern part of the Blagoevgrad Province in Southern Bulgaria. They also live in a group of villages in the Lovech Province in Northern Bulgaria. The name &quot;Pomak&quot; is pejorative in Bulgarian and is resented by most members of the community, The name adopted and used instead of Pomak is &quot;Bulgarian Muslims&quot;.

Bulgarian Muslims do not represent a homogenous community and have a multitude of ethnic and religious identities. A clear majority of them (127,350 according to the latest census in 2001) declare themselves to be ethnic Bulgarians of Islamic faith. However, a significant percentage, in particular in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes (the Smolyan and Kardzhali Province) are strongly religious and have preserved the Muslim name system, customs and clothing, the Smolyan Province, which is largely populated by Bulgarian Muslims (approximately 117,000 or 71% of the population according to the Ministry of Interior in 1989), According to the 2001 census, 43 municipalities out of 262 have a Muslim majority. There were five municipalities with a Muslim population over 90 percent: Chernoochene (96.8 percent) has the highest share of Muslims, followed by Venets (95.9 percent), Satovcha (91.3 percent), Ruen (90.9 percent) and Kaolinovo (90.0 percent)(122,806 or 87.7%) and that only 58,758 people or 41.9% of the population of the province declared to profess Islam in 2001.

Muslims in Bulgaria have slightly better demographic indicators compared to the Orthodox Christians in Bulgaria. The reason for this difference is mostly because of ethnicity most Muslims in Bulgaria have different reproductive traditions and they have a younger age structure compared to the ethnic Bulgarians which leads to higher fertility and birth rates. In provinces with large Muslim concentrations, birth rates are a little bit higher while death rates are lower than the country average. For example: Bulgaria had a total birth rate of 10.5‰ in 1992 while Muslims formed about 13 percent of the total population. However, in provinces with large Muslim populations the birth rate ranged from in 11.0% in Smolyan and 11.6% in Silistra to 13.1% in Razgrad (&gt;50 percent Muslim) and 14.7% in Kardzhali (about 70 percent Muslim).

A small number of Bulgarian Muslims less than 50, from the Central and Eastern Rhodopes, have converted into Orthodox Christianity or have adopted a Christian identity since 1990.

The use of Bulgarian names among Muslims is common. For example, only one-third of the Muslim Bulgarian population of the region of Kirkovo, mostly people aged over 60, have Turkish or Arabic names.

Unlike the Bulgarian Muslims in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes, who usually have a Bulgarian identity, the ones living on the western fringes of the Rhodopes (in the provinces of Pazardzhik and Blagoevgrad) largely Identify as Turkish. For example, out of 62,431 self-declared Muslims in the Blagoevgrad Province in 2001, 31,857 (more than half) have opted for Turkish ethnicity although the self-declared speakers of Turkish as a mother tongue are only 19,819.

Considering that mother tongue in the Bulgarian census is counted on the basis of a declaration of the respondent and not on actual proof of what language this person speaks at home and that an inquiry of the Ministry of the Interior in 1989 gave only 3,689 ethnic Turks and 56,191 Pomaks for the Blagoevgrad Province, it is highly likely that the vast majority of the Turks in the province are actually Pomaks. A similar phenomenon exists in the Pazardzhik Province where there may be between 10,000 and 15,000 Pomaks.

Almost 64% of Muslims in Bulgaria that are ethnically Turks live in Kardzhali, Razgrad, Targovishte, Shumen, Silistra, Dobrich Ruse, and Burgas. They live mostly in rural settlements. Muslims in Bulgaria that are ethnically Roma mainly live in Shumen, Sliven, Dobrich, Targovishte, Pazardzhik and Silistra. Pomak Muslims mainly live around the Rhodope Mountains, especially in the province Smolyan and the municipalities of Satovcha, Yakoruda, Belitsa, Garmen, Gotse Delchev, Ardino, Krumovgrad, Kirkovo and Velingrad.

A large part of the population in those areas did not respond to the census questions which makes it difficult to calculate the exact number of Pomaks. In the municipality of Dospat for example, only 4746 people out of 9116 answered the question on their religion and in the municipality of Satovcha only 9562 out of 15444 people did so. Tatar Muslims live in northeastern Bulgaria and the small Arab diaspora is based mainly in the capital, Sofia.

Finally, there are those Bulgarian Muslims who have chosen not to declare their ethnicity in the 2001 Census . The percentage of undeclared in the Smolyan Province (9,696 or 6.9%), the Kardzhali Province (4,565 or 2.8%) and the Blagoevgrad Province (4,242 or 1.2%) is well above the national average of 0.8%. These are most likely to be Muslim Bulgarians who would have opted for another ethnicity, for example &quot;Pomak&quot; or &quot;Muslim&quot;, if these were allowed as answers at the census or are unclear themselves about their own ethnic identity.

Due to the multitude of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, it is extremely difficult to calculate the exact number of the members of the community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000.

A summation of the different groups with different ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared) yields approximately the same number. Despite the multitude of different ethnic the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim.

Muslim Bulgarians in the Rhodopes speak a variety of archaic Bulgarian dialects. Under the influence of mass media and school education, the dialects have been almost completely unified with standard Bulgarian among Muslim Bulgarians living in Bulgaria.

==Turkey==
Thracian Bulgarians in East Thrace in Turkey, descended from the people and families who converted to Islam in order to stay and avoid being deported to Bulgaria. Bulgarian historian Lyubomir Miletich wrote a book in 1918 detailing these events called the Destruction of the Thracian Bulgarians in 1913.

<doc id="1024614" wikidata="Q2600653" url="?curid=1024614" title="Taylor–Proudman theorem">
<text>In fluid mechanics, the Taylor–Proudman theorem (after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and Joseph Proudman) states that when a solid body is moved slowly within a fluid that is steadily rotated with a high angular velocity formula_1, the fluid velocity will be uniform along any line parallel to the axis of rotation. formula_1 must be large compared to the movement of the solid body in order to make the Coriolis force large compared to the acceleration terms.

==Derivation==
The Navier–Stokes equations for steady flow, with zero viscosity and a body force corresponding to the Coriolis force, are
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the fluid velocity, formula_5 is the fluid density, and formula_6 the pressure. If we assume that formula_7 is a scalar potential and the advective term on the left may be neglected (reasonable if the Rossby number is much less than unity) and that the flow is incompressible (density is constant), the equations become:

:formula_8
where formula_1 is the angular velocity vector. If the curl of this equation is taken, the result is the Taylor–Proudman theorem:
:formula_10

To derive this, one needs the vector identities

:formula_11 

and 

:formula_12

and 
:formula_13

(because the curl of the gradient is always equal to zero).
Note that formula_14 is also needed (angular velocity is divergence-free).

The vector form of the Taylor–Proudman theorem is perhaps better understood by expanding the dot product:

:formula_15

In coordinates for which formula_16, the equations reduce to
:formula_17
if formula_18. Thus, &quot;all three&quot; components of the velocity vector are uniform along any line parallel to the z-axis.

==Taylor column==

The Taylor column is an imaginary cylinder projected above and below a real cylinder that has been placed parallel to the rotation axis (anywhere in the flow, not necessarily in the center). The flow will curve around the imaginary cylinders just like the real due to the Taylor–Proudman theorem, which states that the flow in a rotating, homogeneous, inviscid fluid are 2-dimensional in the plane orthogonal to the rotation axis and thus there is no variation in the flow along the formula_19 axis, often taken to be the formula_20 axis. 

The Taylor column is a simplified, experimentally observed effect of what transpires in the Earth&#x27;s atmospheres and oceans.

==History==

The result known as the Taylor-Proudman theorem was first derived by Sydney Samuel Hough (1870-1923), a mathematician at Cambridge University, in 1897. Proudman published another derivation in 1916 and Taylor in 1917, then the effect was demonstrated experimentally by Taylor in 1923.

<text>François-Joseph-Philippe de Riquet (21 September 1771 - 2 March 1843), as a French aristocrat who became the 16th Prince de Chimay from 24 July 1804 to 1843.

==Early life==
François-Joseph-Philippe was born in Paris on 21 September 1771. He was a son of Victor Maurice de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay and Marie Anne Gabrielle Josephe Francoise Xaviere de Henin-Liétard. Among his siblings was &quot;Victor&quot;-Louis-Charles de Riquet, Marquis de Caraman, a Peer of France who served as the French ambassador in Vienna.

==Career==
During the French Revolution, he emigrated but came back during the First French Empire, and received the title of &quot;chef de cohorte&quot; from Napoleon.

He became the sixteenth Prince of Chimay after the death of his childless uncle in 1804, inheriting the Chimay estates (now in Belgium). After the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, these became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and, after 1830, of the current Kingdom of Belgium.

==Personal life==

On 22 August 1805, he became the third husband of Thérésa de Cabarrus, who was known as Madame Tallien, former wife of Jean Lambert Tallien who bore eleven children by various husbands and lovers. After their marriage, they lived quietly in Hainaut on the Chimay estate (today a province of Belgium). Their children were:

# Joseph Philippe (1808-1886), 17th Prince de Chimay, Prince de Caraman
# Michel Gabriel Alphonse Ferdinand (1810-1865) - father of Marie-Clotilde-Elisabeth Louise de Riquet, comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau
# Marie Auguste Louise Thérèse Valentine (1815-1876)

François-Joseph-Philippe de Riquet died in Toulouse on 2 March 1843. He and Thérésa were interred under the sacristy of the church of Chimay.

<text>John Hondorp (born 1964 in Doetinchem, Netherlands) is a professor at the Enschede Conservatory. He was the first to teach Hammond organ as a fully autonome jazz major.

His international class of students come from all over the world to study with him in Enschede. In the last 10 years they came from the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan and Indonesia.
In March 2007 John was playing with the Enschede az Quintet &quot;5-ESSENCE&quot; (Quintessence) at the Indonesian &quot;Java Jazz Festival&quot; in Jakarta.

He has a master&#x27;s degree in Hammond Organ from the Enschede Conservatory. He plays the jazz stages throughout Europe and toured with many European jazz artists like Ferdinand Povel, Judy Niemack, Bruno Castellucci, Nippy Noya. In 2004 he founded the John Hondorp Trio, with guitarist/composer Dominik Korte and drummer Marco Schmitz. After two seasons of playing they recorded the CD Open Stories in February 2006 at Organic Music Studio in Obing, Germany.

In 2007 John Hondorp was invited twice to perform and teach at Jazz festivals in Indonesia. His teaching activities were at UNJ (Universitas Negeri Jakarta), DAYA Music Institute and Universitas Pelita Harapan.

In 2008 John started his collaboration with German drummer Markus Strothmann. This collaboration grew into a strong duo &quot;Transitions Organ duo&quot;. An energetic, flexible and highly interactive jazz playground. Regularly combined with featured soloists. In the last couple of years Transitions Organ Duo toured with Jeanfrançois Prins, Frederik Köster, Bart van Lier, Nippy Noya, Fredrik Lundin, Adrienne West Linley Hamilton, Bruno Castellucci and Darmon Meader.

Starting March 1, 2013, John was appointed teacher for Hammond Organ at the Institut für Musik in Osnabrück, Germany. This institute is the only music academy in Germany where one can study Hammond Organ as an independent jazz major instrument. He left the Osnabrück Institute in the summer of 2019.

<doc id="1024622" wikidata="Q5132870" url="?curid=1024622" title="Clifford Bax">
<text>Clifford Lea Bax (13 July 1886 – 18 November 1962) was a versatile English writer, known particularly as a playwright, a journalist, critic and editor, and a poet, lyricist and hymn writer. He also was a translator (for example, of Goldoni). The composer Arnold Bax was his brother, and set some of his words to music.

==Life==

The youngest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen (1860–1940), daughter of Rev. William Knibb Lea, of Amoy, China,
Bax was born in Upper Tooting, south London (not Knightsbridge, as sometimes stated). His father was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. He was educated at the Slade and the Heatherley Art School. He gave up painting to concentrate on writing.
Independent wealth gave Bax time to write, and social connections. He had an apartment in Albany, the apartment complex in Piccadilly, London. He was a friend of Gustav Holst, whom he introduced to astrology, the critic James Agate, and Arthur Ransome, among others. He met and played chess with Aleister Crowley in 1904, and kept up an acquaintance with him over the years, later in the 1930s introducing both the artist Frieda Harris and the writer John Symonds to him. An early venture (1908–1914) was &quot;Orpheus&quot;, a theosophical magazine he edited. His interest in the esoteric extended to editing works of Jakob Boehme, and helping Allan Bennett, the Buddhist.

His first play on the commercial stage was &quot;The Poetasters of Ispahan&quot; (1912), and he became a fixture of British drama for a generation. He was involved in the &quot;Phoenix Society&quot; (1919–1926), concerned with reviving older plays, and the &quot;Incorporated Stage Society&quot;.

He also edited, with Austin Osman Spare, &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, an artistic and literary magazine that appeared from October 1922 to July 1924.

A cricket enthusiast, he was a friend of C. B. Fry and wrote a biography of W. G. Grace.

==Family==
He married actress and jewellery-maker Gwendolen Daphne Bishop, née Bernhard-Smith, on 21 September 1910. Their daughter, Undine, was born 6 August 1911.

In 1927, Bax married Vera, née Rawnsley, a painter and poet (1888–1974). Rawnsley was previously married to Stanley Kennedy North, an artist, and Alexander Bell Filson Young (1876–1938), a journalist with whom she had two sons: William David Loraine Filson-Young and Richard Filson-Young; they—Bax&#x27;s stepsons—were both killed in World War II.

<text>Salisbury is a town located in Westmorland County, New Brunswick, Canada.

Previously a village for 57 years from 1966 to 2023, in January 2023 Salisbury was amalgamated with parts of four local service districts (including the rural community of River Glade) to become a new town with the same name.

==History==

Salisbury first became a permanent settlement when settlers from Yorkshire, England, settled there in 1774 (History, Village of Salisbury Website).

It grew quickly as a fox farming community, a special mutation of fox with grey/white fur, which was imported, was commonly bred in the many fox farms in Salisbury. This is where the saying &quot;Home of the Silver Fox&quot; comes from. While no fox farms are known to operate locally some wild foxes now share these genes.

==Geography==
Salisbury is situated on the north bank of the Petitcodiac River, approximately west of Moncton / Riverview, and east of Petitcodiac.

==Services==
The town has elementary, middle, and high schools and an outdoor swimming pool. Several family-owned shops and churches serve the surrounding area. There is also a Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron, 580 A/M Hugh Campbell Squadron.

Salisbury is a local service centre for several farming communities in the Petitcodiac River AKA Three Rivers, New Brunswick area. The town and many surrounding communities are served by Ambulance New Brunswick, Salisbury Fire &amp; Rescue.

One of the first acts of the new council was to approve construction of a new fire hall.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, at this time the Village of Salisbury had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>James Albert Bonsack (October 9, 1859, – June 1, 1924) was an American inventor who developed an early cigarette rolling machine in 1880, and patented it the following year. 

== Early life ==
James A. Bonsack was born in eastern Roanoke County, Virginia. His father, Jacob Bonsack, owned a woolen mill where James learned about industrial machinery. In 1878 he was admitted to the Lutheran Roanoke College, but decided to withdraw to work on designing a cigarette rolling machine. After building a successful prototype and patenting his invention, he registered the Bonsack Machine Company of Virginia on March 27, 1883. Following a court battle of alleged patent infringement by the inventor of a competing rolling machine, Bonsack paid $18,000 to buy out the competitor&#x27;s patent claim.

== Bonsack Cigarette Machine ==
Prior to that time, cigarettes had been rolled by hand. Readymade cigarettes were a luxury item, but were becoming increasingly popular. The slow manual fabrication process—a skilled cigarette roller could produce only about four cigarettes per minute on average—was insufficient to satisfy demand by the 1870s. In 1875, the Allen and Ginter company in Richmond, Virginia, offered a prize of $75,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) for the invention of a machine able to roll cigarettes. 

Bonsack took up the challenge and left college to devote his time to building such a machine. In 1880, he had a first working prototype, which was destroyed by a fire while in storage at Lynchburg, Virginia. Bonsack rebuilt it and filed a patent application on September 4, 1880. The patent was granted the following year (U.S. patents 238,640 from March 8, 1881 and 247,795 from October 4, 1881). Allen and Ginter had ordered a Bonsack machine but quickly rejected it, eager to save their prize money and fearing that consumers would balk at a machine-made product. 

Bonsack&#x27;s partnership with tobacco industrialist James Buchanan Duke made full commercial use of the invention, which could produce 120,000 cigarettes in 10 hours, (200 per minute), and thereby revolutionized the cigarette industry. Duke set a deal with the Bonsack Machine Company in 1884. Duke agreed to produce all cigarettes with his two rented Bonsack machines and in return, Bonsack reduced Duke&#x27;s royalties from $0.30 per thousand to $0.20 per thousand. Duke also hired one of Bonsack’s mechanics, resulting in fewer breakdowns of his machines than his competitors’. This secret contract resulted in a competitive advantage over Duke&#x27;s competitors; he was able to lower his prices further than others could. Bonsack&#x27;s machine was so efficient that by 1888, Duke had laid off all the company&#x27;s cigarette rollers, who had been replaced by Bonsack&#x27;s machine.
== Legacy ==
The census-designated place of Bonsack, Virginia, located in Roanoke County, was named after James Bonsack, who lived in this town located along Route 460 between Roanoke and Bedford.

<doc id="1024644" wikidata="Q7295571" url="?curid=1024644" title="Ratfucking">
<text>Ratfucking is an American slang term for behind the scenes (covert) political sabotage or dirty tricks, particularly pertaining to elections. It was brought to public attention by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1974), the book that chronicled their investigative reporting of the Watergate scandal.

==Origins==
As a term, &quot;ratfucking&quot; was commonplace in Southern California and possibly other college slang from the late 1950s to at least the early 1960s, meaning a prank. Around that time, Tony Auth was the cartoonist for the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot;. One of his cartoons showed a large, inebriated rat suggesting to another rat, &quot;Let&#x27;s go PF-ing tonight!&quot;, a play on ratfucking or &quot;RF-ing&quot;. The lead story in the January 6, 1961, &quot;California Tech&quot;, Caltech&#x27;s student newspaper, was headlined, &quot;Tech Scores First Televised RF&quot;. The article chronicled the Great Rose Bowl Hoax, which had just taken place. A political context was irrelevant to such usage. At the end of the article, an Editor&#x27;s Note both explained and bowdlerized: &quot;RF (for Royal Flush) is a contemporary college colloquialism for a clever prank.&quot;

Woodward and Bernstein&#x27;s account in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; reports that many Republican staffers—H. R. Haldeman (pre-1948), Donald Segretti (early 1960s), White House aide Tim Elbourne, Ronald Louis Ziegler, and Dwight Chapin—had attended the University of Southern California (USC) and participated in the highly competitive student elections there. At USC, future Watergate scandal participants Chapin, Ziegler, Elbourne, Segretti, Gordon Strachan, and Herbert Porter were members of Trojans for Representative Government. United Press International reporter Karlyn Barker sent Woodward and Bernstein a memo, &quot;Notes On the USC Crowd&quot;, which outlined the connection. Fraternities, sororities, and underground fraternal coordinating organizations—such as Theta Nu Epsilon and their splintered rival &quot;Trojans for Representative Government&quot;—engaged in creative tricks and underhanded tactics to win student elections. Officially, control over minor funding and decision-making on campus life was at stake; the positions also gave bragging rights and prestige. The young operators called these practices &quot;ratfucking&quot;. The tactics were either promoted by or garnered the interest of major political figures on the USC board of trustees, such as Dean Rusk and John A. McCone.

== Usage ==
The term received media attention in Australia after it was reported that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd used the term in a speech at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, candidate Ted Cruz said that &quot;Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him&quot;, a euphemized reference to the term. That same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote about the term and Roger Stone. In August 2017, journalist Marcy Wheeler received the disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) when she used the term in a radio broadcast. Wheeler maintained that the word has become a term of art in political science and is thus not an obscenity; FCC officials disagreed.

On May 23, 2019, scholar Svetlana Lokhova filed a claim in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Stefan Halper, claiming that &quot;Stefan Halper is a ratfucker and a spy&quot; with a footnote that &quot;ratfucking&quot; is a well-known political term. After the results of the 2020 United States presidential election were called for Joe Biden and there were attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election as Trump refused to concede, John Oliver, host of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;, said on one of his shows following the set up of the Trump voter fraud hotline that &quot;a political term for election shenanigans is rat[s fucking]. So if you, say, happen to have any access to images of Pennsylvania-based rats fucking, it&#x27;s frankly your patriotic duty to send them to the Trump campaign straight away.&quot; While saying this, Oliver displayed an image of rats engaged in sexual intercourse titled &quot;Stay Up Late&quot; and the online link to the voter fraud hotline&#x27;s website.

<doc id="1024656" wikidata="Q1430664" url="?curid=1024656" title="Henry of Essex">
<text>Henry of Essex or Henry de Essex (died c. 1170) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who was feudal baron of Rayleigh in Essex (by inheritance) and of Haughley in Suffolk (by right of his second wife). He served as one of the royal constables during the reigns of Kings Stephen and Henry II by right of his second wife, which office included the duty of bearing the royal standard to indicate the location of the king when on campaign or in battle. In 1163 he was convicted as a traitor, having been defeated in trial by battle, and took the habit of a monk, spending his last years at Reading Abbey.

==Life==
Henry was the son and heir of Robert fitz Swein of Essex, a descendant of the pre-Conquest landowner Robert fitz Wimarch who was favoured by King Edward the Confessor.

Henry is mentioned in several chronicles, including that of Jocelin of Brakelond. His influence at the royal court was greatest during the reign of Stephen, but it continued into the early years of Henry II&#x27;s. He served Henry as Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire from 1156 to 1159, and as a justiciar, as well as being his constable. Henry participated in the king&#x27;s Toulouse campaign in the spring and summer of 1159.

He was alleged to have dropped the royal standard in a Welsh ambush during Henry II&#x27;s campaign into Wales of 1157. As royal constable, his office required that he hold the standard to indicate the king&#x27;s position during any military engagement. Dropping the standard seemed to signal the king&#x27;s death. At the royal court held at Easter, 1163, Henry was accused of treason for that act by Robert de Montfort, a claimant to the Montfort estate of Haughley. The two men fought a judicial duel a few months later. Jocelin details Henry&#x27;s judicial duel with Robert de Montfort (a rival for Henry&#x27;s wife&#x27;s inheritance) on Fry&#x27;s Island in the River Thames at Reading. Henry&#x27;s body was carried senseless from the site of the duel by monks of the nearby Reading Abbey, but he survived and took the Benedictine cowl. As he was a convicted traitor, however, his estates and offices were forfeit, and his family was disgraced. Henry was allowed to remain as a monk at Reading Abbey for the rest of his life.

Henry of Essex is thought to have died at Reading Abbey in the same year that Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered, 1170.

==Family==
Henry married firstly Cecily, daughter of Roger de Valognes; they had least at two sons, Henry and Hugh. His second wife was Alice, probably the daughter and heiress of Robert de Ver, the royal constable (d. circa 1151). It is unknown which wife was the mother of Henry&#x27;s daughter, Agnes, who married Aubrey de Vere, first Earl of Oxford, but Cecily seems most likely.

<doc id="1024667" wikidata="Q5379939" url="?curid=1024667" title="Ensemble (fluid mechanics)">
<text>In continuum mechanics, an ensemble is an imaginary collection of notionally identical experiments.

Each member of the ensemble will have nominally identical boundary conditions and fluid properties. If the flow is turbulent, the details of the fluid motion will differ from member to member because the experimental setup will be microscopically different, and these slight differences become magnified as time progresses. Members of an ensemble are, by definition, statistically independent of one another. The concept of ensemble is useful in thought experiments and to improve theoretical understanding of turbulence.

A good image to have in mind is a typical fluid mechanics experiment such as a mixing box. Imagine a million mixing boxes, distributed over the earth; at a predetermined time, a million fluid mechanics engineers each start one experiment, and monitor the flow. Each engineer then sends his or her results to a central database. Such a process would give results that are close to the theoretical ideal of an ensemble.

It is common to speak of ensemble average or ensemble averaging when considering a fluid mechanical ensemble.

For a completely unrelated type of averaging, see Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (the two types of averaging are often confused).

<doc id="1024673" wikidata="Q4484215" url="?curid=1024673" title="Kyra Phillips">
<text>Kyra Phillips (born August 8, 1968) is a correspondent for ABC News.

==Early life and career==
Phillips was born in Illinois, and grew up in the city of Jacksonville. In the fourth grade, she moved to San Diego, California, where her parents became professors at San Diego State University. After graduating from Helix High School, Phillips earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism from University of Southern California. Among her first jobs in broadcasting were the positions of weekend anchor and reporter for WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before moving on to WDSU-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1994. Phillips has also held positions as morning anchor for KAMC-TV in Lubbock, Texas, field producer for CNN-Telemundo’s Washington, D.C., offices and a journalist of the special assignment unit of KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, California. Phillips participates in the Brain Tumor Foundation for Children, T.A.P.S. (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors), Global Down Syndrome Foundation and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, which she has been involved with since 1992.

==Career==

===CNN===

Phillips joined CNN in 1999. During her early years at CNN, Phillips was granted access to U.S. Navy Air Wing CVW-9 in 2001 as they prepared for the war in Afghanistan. In January 2002, Phillips spent about a month in Antarctica to work on a television documentary to be featured on the program &quot;CNN Presents&quot;. Later in 2002, Phillips produced reports focusing on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s reconnaissance missions from the destroyer , the Navy&#x27;s Special Operations Command, the Navy SEALs, and Special Warfare Combatant Crewman training, riding in an F-14 Tomcat during an air-to-air combat mission over the Persian Gulf. She has also participated in the Navy&#x27;s TOPGUN school, SWAT training, and other police and weapons training.

In 2003, she was an embedded journalist during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where she reported from the aircraft carrier . In 2006, Phillips was the last journalist to fly in an F-14 Tomcat before its official retirement from service in the U.S. Navy.

Phillips was criticized for her insensitivity during an April 16, 2003, interview with Dr Imad al-Najada, the doctor of Ali Ismail Abbas, a 12-year-old boy who lost 15 relatives and both arms when a U.S. missile hit his home in Baghdad. Discussing live images of the 2006 labor protests in France, in which it was later determined that no one was killed, she said that the images of the demonstrations &quot;Sort of brings back memories of Tiananmen Square, when you saw these activists in front of tanks.&quot; CNN&#x27;s Chris Burns told French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy that her comments were &quot;regrettable.&quot;

On August 29, 2006, during a CNN broadcast of President George W. Bush&#x27;s speech on the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s landfall, Phillips&#x27;s microphone was left on while she was in the washroom. Portions of a personal conversation were broadcast live, during which Phillips offered advice on men, criticized her sister-in-law for being a &quot;control freak&quot;, and praised her then-husband. The conversation audio was mixed with the President&#x27;s audio feed and both were discernible. Daryn Kagan broke into Phillips&#x27;s comments with an audio recap of Bush&#x27;s speech. CNN immediately apologized for the on-air gaffe. Phillips later appeared on CBS&#x27; &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; poking fun at herself in retrospect.

Phillips co-anchored CNN Radio&#x27;s November 4, 2008, election coverage with Capitol Hill correspondent Lisa Desjardins.

In March 2012, Phillips moved to the 11am Newsroom, and her timeslot was shortened to one hour. However, on June 26, 2012, it was officially announced that she would leave CNN and launch her own show at its sister channel HLN. She soon returned to CNN as an &quot;investigative correspondent&quot;.

===ABC===
On April 2, 2018, Phillips left CNN to join ABC News as a &quot;D.C.-based correspondent&quot;.

On July 19, 2019, Phillips posted a tweet praising President Trump for &quot;giving us [journalists] access on a regular basis and the ability to ask any question.&quot; Democrats and other journalists criticized the comment as being overly deferential.

==Awards==
In 1997, Phillips was named Reporter of the Year by the Associated Press. She has also won four Emmy Awards, two Edward R. Murrow Awards for investigative reporting, the top documentary award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her coverage of Jena, Louisiana and multiple Golden Microphones.

==Personal life==
Having been married to John Assad from 2000 to 2008, Phillips became engaged to Fox News correspondent John Roberts in 2010. She gave birth to their twins in March 2011. As of 2018, the couple are married.

<doc id="1024674" wikidata="Q65768" url="?curid=1024674" title="Claus Spahn">
<text>Claus Spahn (born 15 May 1940 in Bottrop, Germany) is a former TV programme editor of Germany&#x27;s Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) broadcasting corporation, a presenter, producer and author. He was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2001.

== Vita ==

Spahn studied History of theatre, German language and literature, Philosophy, and History of art at the University of Cologne. He received his doctorate (&#x27;Dr. Phil.&#x27;) in 1969 for his dissertation &quot;The history of the theatre of the Ruhr region up to 1933&quot;. He worked as a TV journalist for the WDR from 1969 to 2005. He produced numerous series, portraits and documentaries in the field of cultural and educational policy.

He became known both nationally and internationally through chess programmes. Between 1983 and 2005, he presented the annual live broadcast Chess of the Grandmasters (&quot;Schach der Großmeister&quot;), where players including Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik competed for the TV Cup.

It was on his initiative and under his direction that the WDR regularly reported on the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting.

== Series / Films ==

The series written and produced by Spahn included &quot;Keine Angst vorm Fliegen&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid to fly&quot;) and &quot;Der Elternführerschein&quot; (&quot;The driving licence for parents&quot;). Together with Lida Winiewicz, Spahn wrote the 12-part TV serial &quot;Wenn die Liebe hinfällt&quot; (&quot;When love ends&quot;).
He was awarded the &quot;Medal of German Cancer Aid&quot; for &quot;Niemand soll der Nächste sein!&quot; (&quot;Nobody should be the next&quot;). In 1979, Spahn received the &quot;German Industrial Film Prize&quot; for the TV series &quot;Computer können nicht vergessen!&quot; (&quot;Computers can&#x27;t forget&quot;) in connection with the Federal Data Protection Act. Under the title and with the TV production &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid to fly&quot;, Spahn and Rainer Pieritz founded seminars to allay the fear of flying in Germany. As author and director, Spahn produced two impressive portraits on Carl Djerassi, the chemist, author, art collector and &quot;Father of the pill&quot;, and Otto Erich Deutsch, the Schubert researcher (&quot;Deutsch Catalog&quot;).

== Awards ==

Claus Spahn was awarded the &quot;Ehrenteller des Deutschen Schachbundes&quot; (&quot;Commemorative Plate of the German Chess Federation&quot;) in 1992. He received the &quot;Deutscher Schachpreis&quot; (&quot;German Chess Award&quot;) of the German Chess Federation on two occasions (1983/2001) for his commitment to the sport of chess, as well as the Medal of the European Chess Union (ECU) and the Gold Merit Award of the World Chess Federation FIDE in 2002.

<text>Robert Buck known as Robbie Buck is an Australian radio announcer.

==Career==
Robbie&#x27;s radio experience began in his home town of Lismore where he took up a late night shift on the local radio station. Once he moved to Sydney he began doing graveyard shifts on community station 2SER, and eventually became a full-time employee for the station. Following this, he spent time at SBS radio and TV as a sound producer. During his time at SBS, he co-hosted &quot;Alchemy&quot; which was a late night TV program focused on the electronic music scene.

In 2003, he took on the role of a new show at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Triple J, &quot;Home and Hosed&quot;, the successor to Richard Kingsmill&#x27;s &quot;Australian Music Show&quot;. The new program aired every weeknight from 9 pm for two hours, replacing the single three-hour timeslot that Kingsmill&#x27;s show had taken. The show cemented the station&#x27;s tradition of being a strong supporter of Australian music at a time when the station was going through turmoil in management changes.

In 2006, Caroline Tran took the reins of &quot;Home and Hosed&quot;, and Robbie started a new program &quot;Top Shelf Radio&quot;, airing in the afternoon drive timeslot from 3 – 5:30 pm. He remained the host of the program until the end of the 2007 ratings period, to make way for &quot;Dools and Linda&quot; in 2008, hosted by Scott Dooley and Linda Marigliano. Robbie subsequently joined Lindsay McDougall and Marieke Hardy to host the new breakfast show, &quot;Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor&quot;. During his time at Triple J, Robbie also hosted the Lunch and Weekend Lunch shows, and has appeared on ABC TV programs including &quot;Mondo Thingo&quot; hosted by Amanda Keller.

In September 2009, Robbie announced that he would be leaving Triple J to host the Evenings program on 702 ABC Sydney, 1233 ABC Newcastle, 666 ABC Canberra and ABC Local Radio stations across New South Wales. In 2012 he was replaced by Dominic Knight and moved on to host &quot;The Inside Sleeve&quot; on Radio National until the end of the 2013 ratings year. Buck returned to 702 ABC Sydney in 2014 when he replaced Adam Spencer as host of Breakfast 5:30 – 8 am weekdays. On 1 October 2021, Robbie announced via ABC news that he was leaving his ABC Radio Sydney breakfast show that he co-hosted with Wendy Harmer for three years, stating they had decided to &quot;go out on a high&quot;.

<doc id="1024683" wikidata="Q3643222" url="?curid=1024683" title="Bovara">
<text>Bovara is a village in the Italian province of Perugia in east central Umbria on the lower flank of Monte Serano. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of Trevi, which is 2 km northwards. Its population is around 300.

The name of the town derives from Latin &quot;(forum) boarium&quot;, a cattle market, and the area has been known for its cattle since Roman times. In the 1950s an Umbrian inscription was found there, now conserved at the Museo S. Francesco in Trevi; and a Roman mosaic still exists &quot;in situ&quot; (although reburied). The chief interest of Bovara, however, lies in the attractive Romanesque abbey church of S. Pietro.

<doc id="1024684" wikidata="Q6304655" url="?curid=1024684" title="Judy Woodruff">
<text>Judy Carline Woodruff (born November 20, 1946) is an American broadcast journalist who has worked in local, network, cable, and public television news since 1970. She was the anchor and managing editor of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; through the end of 2022. Woodruff has covered every presidential election and convention since 1976. She has interviewed several heads of state and moderated U.S. presidential debates.

After graduating from Duke University in 1968, Woodruff entered local television news in Atlanta. She was named White House correspondent for NBC News in 1976, a position she held for six years. She joined PBS in 1982, where she continued White House reports for the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, formerly &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, in addition to presenting another program. She moved to CNN in 1993 to host &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;CNN WorldView&quot; together with Bernard Shaw, until he left CNN. Woodruff left CNN in 2005, and returned to PBS and the &quot;NewsHour&quot; in 2006. In 2013, she and Gwen Ifill were its named official anchors, succeeding founding presenter Jim Lehrer. Woodruff and Ifill shared managing newsgathering duties until Ifill&#x27;s death in 2016. Woodruff succeeded Ifill as the program&#x27;s sole main presenter. In May 2022, Woodruff announced that she would step down as the &quot;NewsHour&quot; anchor at year&#x27;s end, and her final day as anchor was on December 30, 2022.

==Early life and education==
Woodruff was born on November 20, 1946, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to William H. Woodruff, a chief warrant officer in the Army, and Anna Lee (née Payne) Woodruff. She has one sister, Anita. She grew up as an army brat, and moved with her family multiple times during her childhood, attending seven schools between kindergarten and seventh grade. The family moved from Oklahoma to Germany when she was five years old. They then moved to army bases in Missouri and New Jersey, returned to Oklahoma, lived in Taiwan for a few years, and subsequently went to North Carolina, before settling in the Augusta, Georgia, area, when her father was stationed at Fort Gordon. Woodruff attended the Academy of Richmond County, a high school in Augusta. In 1963, she won the beauty pageant Young Miss Augusta.

Woodruff attended Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, starting in 1964, initially pursuing a degree in mathematics. In an interview, she said that her political science teacher at Meredith got her interested in politics. After two years at Meredith, Woodruff transferred to Duke University in 1966. She was active in the student government of Duke, and was a member of the sorority Alpha Delta Pi.

While studying, Woodruff worked for Georgia Representative Robert Grier Stephens Jr. as an intern during two summers, but was discouraged from working in Washington, D.C., because of how women were treated there. Woodruff decided to enter journalism in her senior year. She graduated from Duke with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1968. She served on Duke&#x27;s board of trustees between 1985 and 1997. Woodruff received an honorary degree (DHL) from Duke in 1998 and was also awarded honorary degrees by the University of Scranton in 1991 and by the University of Pennsylvania (LL.D.) in 2005.

==Career==
===From local television to White House correspondent===
Woodruff applied for her first job in journalism during the spring break of her senior year at Duke. She was hired as a secretary at the news department of the ABC affiliate in Atlanta, Georgia (WQXI-TV), and began working after she graduated in 1968. Besides being a secretary, she presented the weather forecast on Sundays in her last six months at the station. Woodruff left the affiliate after a year and a half to move to the local CBS affiliate WAGA-TV in 1970, working as a reporter. She covered the Georgia State Legislature, and anchored the noon and evening news.

In 1975, she moved to NBC, where she served as a general-assignment reporter based in Atlanta. Together with Kenley Jones, she covered the southeast, an area spanning 10 states, and the Caribbean. Woodruff was assigned to cover Jimmy Carter&#x27;s successful 1976 presidential campaign for NBC, when Carter was not yet seen as a major contender. She had already covered Carter&#x27;s second gubernatorial campaign in 1970 for WAGA. Woodruff traveled with Carter&#x27;s presidential campaign until she was taken off the campaign trail halfway through 1976. Although she was not on the campaign trail anymore, she kept reporting about the Carter campaign for NBC. After he won the presidency and was inaugurated on January 20, 1977, she moved to Washington, D.C., to become a White House correspondent for NBC News. She continued covering the White House into the Reagan presidency until 1982. Subsequently, she was Chief Washington correspondent for &quot;The Today Show&quot; on NBC for a year.

Woodruff moved to PBS in mid-1983, becoming the chief Washington correspondent for &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, when the duration of that program was extended to one hour. In addition to reporting on politics, she conducted studio interviews and served as a backup anchor. Woodruff started hosting the weekly documentary series &quot;Frontline with Judy Woodruff&quot; a few months later in 1984 after its presenter Jessica Savitch died in October the year before. Woodruff left &quot;Frontline&quot; in 1990 to spend more time with her family and at the &quot;NewsHour&quot;. While at PBS, she covered all presidential conventions and campaigns, and moderated the 1988 vice-presidential debate between United States Senators Dan Quayle (R-IN) and Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX). The debate is remembered for the remark &quot;I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy&quot;, made by Senator Bentsen.

===CNN and years after===

Woodruff left the &quot;NewsHour&quot; in 1993 to move to CNN. She was first asked to work for CNN by Tom Johnson at the end of 1992, and took the job four months later after some initial hesitation. Woodruff was teased about this move by her colleague Jim Lehrer: &quot;When I left the &#x27;NewsHour&#x27; for a spell to work for a cable-news channel, he always inquired about life at the  &#x27;Home Shopping Network&#x27;&quot;. In June 1993, Woodruff started anchoring the political talk show &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, that aired on weekdays, together with Bernard Shaw, and the international news program &quot;The World Today&quot; together with Frank Sesno. Sesno was replaced by Shaw in May 1994. When the daily world affairs program &quot;CNN WorldView&quot; was launched in 1995, Woodruff and Shaw became the hosts.

She remained co-anchor of &quot;WorldView&quot; until it went off the air in 2001. In February 2001, Shaw retired, causing Woodruff to become the sole host of &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, which was subsequently renamed &quot;Judy Woodruff&#x27;s Inside Politics&quot;. During her time at CNN, Woodruff also co-anchored CNN&#x27;s election coverage and the news shows &quot;Live From...&quot; and &quot;CNN NewsStand&quot; on Wednesdays. She was the sole anchor of the 1996 documentary series &quot;Democracy in America&quot; as well. She reported on the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, and co-anchored CNN&#x27;s special coverage of, among other things, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s funeral, the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, 9/11, the War in Afghanistan, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, and the Iraq War.

Woodruff moderated three Republican presidential primary debates and one Democratic debate during the 2000 campaign season and one Democratic debate during the 2004 campaign season.

Woodruff left CNN in June 2005, after her contract expired, in order to teach, write, and work on a long-form television project. She was a visiting fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University in the fall of 2005, and taught a course at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University on media and politics in the fall of 2006. Additionally, Woodruff started hosting &quot;Conversations with Judy Woodruff&quot;, a monthly Bloomberg Television program, in which she interviewed people, in 2006. She also hosted the Bloomberg election night coverage of the 2006 midterms. Woodruff continued presenting &quot;Conversations with Judy Woodruff&quot; until 2013.

===Return to PBS===

Woodruff started working for MacNeil/Lehrer Productions in 2006 on the multimedia project &quot;Generation Next: Speak Up. Be Heard&quot;, about the views of Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The project included a PBS documentary series, segments on the &quot;NewsHour&quot;, a series of NPR specials, and articles on the Internet and in &quot;USA Today&quot;. Woodruff returned to &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; as a special correspondent that same year, and became a senior correspondent a few months later in February 2007. As a senior correspondent, she reported, conducted studio interviews, was part of the political team, and occasionally filled in as anchor. In December 2009, the news program moved to a dual-anchor format, and changed its name to &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. Jim Lehrer, the main anchor was alternately joined by Woodruff, Gwen Ifill, and Jeffrey Brown.

Lehrer stepped down as anchor of the &quot;NewsHour&quot; in June 2011, which resulted in the news program being anchored by Woodruff, Ifill, Brown, Ray Suarez, and Margaret Warner on a rotating basis. Earlier that year, the documentary &quot;Nancy Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime&quot;, of which Woodruff was the principal reporter, was released. In September 2013, she became co-anchor of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, presenting the program with Gwen Ifill on weekdays and alone on Fridays. It was the first time an American network broadcast had been anchored by two women. Besides the &quot;NewsHour&quot; itself, the duo also presented PBS coverage of special events, including presidential conventions, election night, and States of the Union. In February 2016, Woodruff and Ifill moderated the sixth Democratic presidential debate. When Ifill died in November 2016, Woodruff became the sole anchor of the &quot;NewsHour&quot;. PBS initially sought a replacement for Ifill, but in March 2018, formalized Woodruff&#x27;s position as &quot;solo anchor&quot;. During the 2020 presidential election season, she was one of the moderators of the sixth Democratic debate.

In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of her performance on the &quot;NewsHour&quot;: &quot;Ms. Woodruff&#x27;s measured delivery, with her hands clasped and her voice low, stands as a counterweight to a haywire era of American news.&quot;

In May 2022, Woodruff announced that she would step down as the &quot;NewsHour&quot; anchor at the end of the year, but planned to continue contributing to the program as senior correspondent. Her last day anchoring the program was December 30, 2022.

==Other activities and accolades==
Woodruff wrote the book &quot;This Is Judy Woodruff at the White House&quot;, in which she described her experiences as a journalist. It was published by Addison-Wesley in 1982. Over her career, she has advocated women&#x27;s organizations, and was part of a group of journalists that founded the International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation, an organization that internationally supports women in the media, in 1990. She has served on its board of directors, and is part of its advisory council.

Woodruff and her husband, Al Hunt, have actively supported families of children with spina bifida (a condition shared by their eldest son, Jeffrey) with counseling and other necessary services. The couple helped organize the Spina Bifida Association of America&#x27;s annual roast, during which politicians roast journalists to raise funds for the association. The event, broadcast by C-SPAN, was held between 1989 and 2008.

Woodruff has also served on the boards of trustees of a number of other organizations, including the Newseum, the Freedom Forum, the National Museum of American History, Global Rights, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, America&#x27;s Promise, the Urban Institute, The Duke Endowment, and the John S. Knight Journalism Fellowships at Stanford.

Woodruff is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a former member of the Knight Commission.

In August 2023, Woodruff was awarded the Kettering Foundation Katherine W. Fanning Fellowship in Journalism and Democracy.

===Awards===
In 2003, Woodruff was inducted into the Georgia Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Woodruff is married to Al Hunt, a columnist and former reporter, and they live in Washington, D.C., with another residence in nearby Maryland. They met during a softball game between journalists and staff of the Carter presidential campaign in Plains, Georgia, in 1976. Their marriage took place on April 5, 1980, in St. Alban&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. The couple has three children: Jeffrey (1981), Benjamin (1986), and Lauren (1989). Woodruff gave birth to Jeffrey about five hours after appearing on air. Jeffrey was born with a mild case of spina bifida, and became disabled and brain damaged after surgery in 1998, which caused Woodruff to reduce her workload at CNN. Lauren was adopted from Korea when she was four months old.

<doc id="1024688" wikidata="Q465899" url="?curid=1024688" title="Andragogy">
<text>Andragogy refers to methods and principles used in adult education. The word comes from the Greek ἀνδρ- (&quot;andr-&quot;), meaning &quot;adult male&quot;, and ἀγωγός (&quot;agogos&quot;), meaning &quot;leader of&quot;. Therefore, andragogy literally means &quot;leading men (adult males)&quot;, whereas &quot;pedagogy&quot; literally means &quot;leading children&quot;. 
==Definitions==
There are many different theories in the areas of learning, teaching and training. Andragogy commonly is defined as the art or science of teaching adults or helping adults learn. In contrast to pedagogy, or the teaching of children, andragogy is based on a humanistic conception of self-directed and autonomous learners where teachers are defined as facilitators of learning.

Although Malcolm Knowles proposed andragogy as a theory, others posit that there is no single theory of adult learning or andragogy. In the literature where adult learning theory is often identified as a principle or an assumption, there are a variety of different approaches and theories that are also evolving in view of evolving higher education instruction, workplace training, new technology and online learning (Omoregie, 2021).

Malcolm Knowles identified these adult learner characteristics related to the motivation of adult learning.  

#Need to know: Adults need to know the reason for learning something.
# Foundation: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
# Self-concept: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
# Readiness: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
# Orientation: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
# Motivation: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.

Blaschke (2012) described Malcolm Knowles&#x27; 1973 theory as &quot;self-directed&quot; learning. The goals include helping learners develop the capacity for self-direction, supporting transformational learning and promoting &quot;emancipatory learning and social action&quot; (Blaschke, 2019, p. 76).

Although Knowles&#x27; andragogy is a well-known theory in the English-speaking world, his theory has an ancillary role internationally. This is especially true in European countries where andragogy is a term used to refer to a field of systematic reflection. The acceptance of andragogy in European countries, according to St. Clair and Käpplinger (2021) is to accept andragogy as the &quot;scientific study of learning in adults and the concomitant teaching approaches&quot; (p. 485). Further, the definition of andragogy and its application to adult learning is more variable currently due to both the impact of globalization and the rapid expansion of adult online learning.

==History==
The term was originally coined by German educator Alexander Kapp in 1833. Andragogy was developed into a theory of adult education by Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. It later became very popular in the US by the American educator Malcolm Knowles. Knowles asserted that andragogy (Greek: &quot;man-leading&quot;) should be distinguished from the more commonly used term &quot;pedagogy&quot; (Greek: &quot;child-leading&quot;).

Knowles collected ideas about a theory of adult education from the end of World War II until he was introduced to the term &quot;androgogy&quot;. In 1966, Knowles met Dušan Savićević in Boston. Savićević was the one who shared the term andragogy with Knowles and explained how it was used in the European context. In 1967, Knowles made use of the term &quot;andragogy&quot; to explain his theory of adult education. Then after consulting with Merriam-Webster, he corrected the spelling of the term to &quot;andragogy&quot; and continued to make use of the term to explain his multiple ideas about adult learning.

Knowles&#x27; theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:

#Need to know: Adults need to know the reason for learning something. 
#Foundation: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
#Self-concept: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
#Readiness: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
#Orientation: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
#Motivation: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.

In most European countries, the Knowles discussion played at best, a marginal role. &quot;Andragogy&quot; was, from 1970 on, connected with emerging academic and professional institutions, publications, or programs, triggered by a similar growth of adult education in practice and theory as in the United States. &quot;Andragogy&quot; functioned here as a header for (places of) systematic reflections, parallel to other academic headers like &quot;biology&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot;, and &quot;physics&quot;.

Early examples of this use of andragogy are the Yugoslavian (scholarly) journal for adult education, named &quot;Andragogija&quot; in 1969, and the Yugoslavian Society for Andragogy; at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech Republic) the &quot;Katedra sociologie a andragogiky&quot; (Sociology and Andragogy Department) was established in 1990. Also, Prague University has a &quot;Katedra Andragogiky&quot; (Andragogical Department); in 1993, Slovenia&#x27;s &quot;Andragoski Center Republike Slovenije&quot; (Slovenian Republic Andragogy Center) was founded with the journal &quot;Andragoska Spoznanja&quot;; in 1995, Bamberg University (Germany) named a &quot;Lehrstuhl Andragogik&quot; (Androgogy Chair).

On this formal level &quot;above practice&quot; and specific approaches, the term &quot;andragogy&quot; could be used relating to all types of theories, for reflection, analysis, training, in person-oriented programs, or human resource development.

== Principles ==
Adult learning is based upon comprehension, organization and synthesis of knowledge rather than rote memory. Some scholars have proposed seven principles of adult learning:

*Adults must want to learn: They learn effectively only when they are free to direct their own learning and have a strong inner motivation to develop a new skill or acquire a particular type of knowledge, this sustains learning.
*Adults must feel they need to learn: Adults are practical in their approach to learning; they want to know, &quot;How is this going to help me right now? Is it relevant (content, connection, and application) and does it meet my targeted goals?&quot;
*Adults learn by doing: Adolescents learn by doing, but adults learn through active practice and participation. This helps in integrating component skills into a coherent whole. 
*Adult learning focuses on problem solving: Adolescents tend to learn skills sequentially. Adults tend to start with a problem and then work to find a solution. A meaningful engagement, such as posing and answering realistic questions and problems is necessary for deeper learning. This leads to more elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger representations of the knowledge (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972). 
*Experience affects adult learning: Adults have more experience than adolescents. This can be an asset and a liability, if prior knowledge is inaccurate, incomplete, or immature, it can interfere with or distort the integration of incoming information (Clement, 1982; National Research Council, 2000).
*Adults learn best in an informal situation: Adolescents have to follow a curriculum. Often, adults learn by taking responsibility for the value and need of content they have to understand and the particular goals it will achieve. Being in an inviting, collaborative and networking environment as an active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.
*Adults want guidance and consideration as equal partners in the process: Adults want information that will help them improve their situation. They do not want to be told what to do and they evaluate what helps and what doesn&#x27;t. They want to choose options based on their individual needs and the meaningful impact a learning engagement could provide. Socialization is more important among adults.

==Academic discipline==

In the field of adult education during recent decades, a process of growth and differentiation emerged as a scholarly and scientific approach, andragogy. It refers to the academic discipline(s) within university programs that focus on the education of adults; andragogy exists today worldwide. The term refers to a new type of education which was not qualified by missions and visions, but by academic learning including: reflection, critique, and historical analyses.

Dušan Savićević, who provided Knowles with the term andragogy, explicitly claims andragogy as a discipline, the subject of which is the study of education and learning of adults in all its forms of expression&#x27; (Savicevic, 1999, p. 97, similarly Henschke, 2003,), Reischmann, 2003.

Recent research and the COVID 19 pandemic have expanded andragogy into the online world internationally, as evidenced by country and international organizations that foster the development of adult learning, research and collaboration in educating adults. New and expanding online instruction is fostered by national organizations, literacy organizations, academic journals and higher education institutions that are helping adults to achieve learning and skills that will contribute to individual economic improvement.

New learning resources and approaches are identified, such as finding that using collaborative tools like a wiki can encourage learners to become more self-directed, thereby enriching the classroom environment. Andragogy gives scope to self-directed learners and helps in designing and delivering the focused instructions. The methods used by andragogy can be used in different educational environments (e.g. adolescent education).

Internationally there are many academic journals, adult education organizations (including government agencies) and centers for adult learning housed in a plethora of international colleges and universities that are working to promote the field of adult learning, as well as adult learning opportunities in training, traditional classes and in online learning.

In academic fields, andrologists are those who practice and specialize in the field of andragogy. Andragologists have received a doctoral degree from an accredited university in Education (EdD) or a Philosophy (PhD) and focused their dissertation utilizing andragogy as a main component of their theoretical framework.

== Differences in learning: The Pedagogy, andragogy and heutagogy continuum ==
In the 20th century, adult educators began to challenge the application of pedagogical theory and teacher-centered approaches to the teaching of adults. Unlike children, adult learners are not transmitted knowledge. Rather, the adult learner is an active participant in their learning. Adult students also are asked to actively plan their learning process to include identifying learning objectives and how they will be achieved. Knowles (1980) summarized the key characteristics of andragogy in this model: 1) independency or self-directedness 2) using past experiences to construct learning, 3) association with readiness to learn, and 4) changing education perspectives from subject-centered one to performance centered perspectives.

A new educational strategy has evolved in response to globalization that identifies learners as self-determined, especially in higher education and work-place settings: heutagogy, a process where students learn on their own with some guidance from the teacher. The motivation to learn comes from the students&#x27; interest in not only performing, but being recognized for their accomplishment (Akiyildiz, 2019). In addition, in heutagogy, learning is learner-centric - where the decisions relating to the learning process are managed by the student. Further, the student determines whether or not the learning objectives are met.

Differences between pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy include:
== Critique ==
There is no consensus internationally on whether andragogy is a learning theory or a set of principles, characteristics or assumptions of adult learning. Knowles himself changed his position on whether andragogy applied only to adults and came to believe that &quot;pedagogy-andragogy represents a continuum ranging from teacher-directed to student-directed learning and that both approaches are appropriate with children and adults, depending on the situation.&quot; Hanson (1996) argues that the difference in learning is not related to the age and stage of one&#x27;s life, but instead related to individual characteristics and the differences in &quot;context, culture and power&quot; within different educational settings.

In another critique of Knowles&#x27; work, Knowles was not able to use one of his principles (Self-concept) with adult learners to the extent that he describes in his practices. In one course, Knowles appears to allow &quot;near total freedom in learner determination of objectives&quot; but still &quot;intended&quot; the students to choose from a list of 18 objectives on the syllabus. Self-concept can be critiqued not just from the instructor&#x27;s point of view, but also from the student&#x27;s point of view. Not all adult learners will know exactly what they want to learn in a course and may seek a more structured outline from an instructor. An instructor cannot assume that an adult will desire self-directed learning in every situation.

Kidd (1978) goes further by claiming that principles of learning have to be applied to lifelong development. He suggested that building a theory on adult learning would be meaningless, as there is no real basis for it. Jarvis even implies that andragogy would be more the result of an ideology than a scientific contribution to the comprehension of the learning processes. Knowles himself mentions that andragogy is a &quot;model of assumptions about learning or a conceptual framework that serves as a basis for an emergent theory.&quot; There appears to be a lack of research on whether this framework of teaching and learning principles is more relevant to adult learners or if it is just a set of good practices that could be used for both children and adult learners.

The way adults learn is different from the pedagogical approach used to foster learning in K-12 settings. These learning differences are key and can be used to show that the six characteristics/principles of andragogy remain applicable when designing teaching and learning materials, in English as a Foreign Language (EFL), for example.

<text>Jack Cafferty (born December 14, 1942) is a former CNN commentator and occasional host of specials. In the summer of 2005, Cafferty joined &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. He left CNN after November 15, 2012.

==Career==
Cafferty started his career in Reno, Nevada in 1961, as a children&#x27;s show host at KOLO-TV. He later moved to KCRL-TV, where he served as the station&#x27;s production manager, and followed that with daytime talk show &quot;Cafferty &amp; Company&quot; on WDAF-TV in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1974, he became the weeknight co-anchor, and later news director, at WHO-TV in Des Moines, Iowa.

In 1977, Cafferty moved to WNBC-TV in New York City as a weekend, then evening co-anchor on the station&#x27;s 6:00 p.m. news hour. In 1979, Cafferty became co-anchor of WNBC-TV&#x27;s 5:00 p.m weeknight newscast, and the following year he was joined on the program by Sue Simmons. Their show was reformatted as &quot;Live at Five&quot;, and its mix of news, features and celebrity interviews would prove successful for much of the 1980s. Cafferty left WNBC-TV around Thanksgiving 1989 due to a contract dispute and at Christmas, he joined rival WNYW, where he anchored the Fox flagship station&#x27;s 7:00 p.m. news and a short-lived late night show, &quot;Newsline New York&quot;. In 1992, Cafferty moved to then-independent station WPIX, and co-anchored its 10:00 p.m. newscast until joining CNN in 1998.

In the summer of 2005, Cafferty joined &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, CNN&#x27;s weekday afternoon newscast. Cafferty also formerly co-anchored CNN&#x27;s weekday morning broadcast, &quot;American Morning&quot;. On &quot;The Cafferty File&quot;, his nightly segment on &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, he offers commentary and personal opinions.

In October 2006, Cafferty hosted a five-part miniseries on CNN titled &quot;Broken Government&quot; detailing problems with the two political parties, government bureaucracy and the federal court system. Viewer e-mail messages replaced the news crawl that usually appears on the bottom of the screen.

Cafferty has earned many distinctions in his career, including the Edward R. Murrow Award, an Emmy award and the New York Associated Press State Broadcasters Award.

==Books==
Cafferty is the author of the book &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Ugly Out There: The Frauds, Bunglers, Liars, and Losers Who Are Hurting America&quot;, published on September 10, 2007 by John Wiley &amp; Sons. The book is a satirical critique of political and social issues, including the long arm of big business, the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina, expanding on many of themes covered on Cafferty&#x27;s &quot;Situation Room&quot; segment and chastising the growing culture of sensationalism and tabloid journalism in modern news media.

Portions of the book are autobiographical, describing Cafferty&#x27;s childhood and short-lived military career as well as his foray into journalism. According to Cafferty: &quot;Very little of my back story qualifies as Hallmark Card material, but it may help you to make sense of the way I see and interpret what&#x27;s going on around me.&quot;

Cafferty&#x27;s second book, entitled &quot;Now or Never: Getting Down to the Business of Saving Our American Dream&quot; was published by Wiley on March 9, 2009.

==Political positions==

===Bush administration===
Cafferty initially supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He says he &quot;bought the whole song and dance about WMDs. I was caught up in the national hysteria that followed 9/11, and was captive to the political manipulation, if you will, that took place in all of us.&quot; He revised his position when the Downing Street memo was leaked in 2005 and became a harsh critic of the administration.

On the Iraq War, Cafferty stated, &quot;The Bush administration used 9/11 as an excuse to start the war in Iraq. People make a lot of money during wartime – $600 billion we&#x27;ve spent there so far – and a lot of that money has gone to friends of the administration, and of course there is all that oil. I don&#x27;t think for a single second there was anything honorable about the decision to invade a sovereign country. They had nothing to do with 9/11 and had done nothing to the United States. But hey... what do I know?&quot;

On February 15, 2006, when Fox News Channel commentator Brit Hume interviewed Vice-President Dick Cheney after he had shot Harry Whittington in a hunting accident, Cafferty remarked, &quot;I would guess it didn&#x27;t exactly represent a profile in courage for the vice-president to wander over there to the F-word network for a sitdown with Brit Hume. I mean, that&#x27;s a little like Bonnie interviewing Clyde, ain&#x27;t it?&quot; As this is a common euphemism used at CNN to refer to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s network, Cafferty later clarified: &quot;Get your mind out of the gutter. The F-word is Fox.&quot;

Cafferty was reprimanded by the president of CNN when he called Donald Rumsfeld &quot;an obnoxious jerk and war criminal&quot; on the eve of the 2006 midterm election. He made an on-air acknowledgment of having &quot;stepped over the line&quot;, but later told the interviewer, &quot;I will go to my grave as Jack Cafferty, private citizen, believing that these people committed war crimes.&quot;

On August 19, 2008, he wrote an article comparing John McCain to George W. Bush, concluding that &quot;I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.&quot;

===U.S. Democratic Party===
Cafferty repeatedly accused the Democratic Party of failing to honor their campaign promises to end the Iraq War: &quot;The Democrats were handed a golden opportunity to challenge President Bush on the war when they were given control of Congress in the midterm elections in 2006. So far they have done absolutely nothing.&quot; Cafferty once stated that &quot;It seems the Democrats are the greatest thing the Republicans have going for them sometimes.&quot; When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that Republicans were using filibuster tactics to block measures to withdraw American troops from Iraq, Cafferty declared: &quot;Baloney, Madam Speaker. Appropriations bills for the war must pass the House of Representatives by a simple majority. It is completely within your power to stop the funding of the war in Iraq. You have simply chosen not to do so. In fact, I did a little homework. The Speaker of the House of Representatives decides which pieces of legislation even come to the floor of the House debate and/or a vote.&quot;

==Controversial remarks==
Cafferty&#x27;s outspoken and provocative style of commentary has on occasion led to public outcry. Though he acknowledges his habit of &quot;saying some pretty outrageous stuff&quot;, Cafferty has characterized this as part of his job description: &quot;I get paid to ask questions I don&#x27;t know the answers to and to complain about the things that bother me.&quot;

===Air America Radio===
During Cafferty&#x27;s time as a co-anchor of CNN&#x27;s morning program, he reported on March 31, 2004 that &quot;It&#x27;s a red-letter day here in America. Air America, that communist radio network, starts broadcasting in a little while.&quot; Cafferty was unyielding when CNN colleague Soledad O&#x27;Brien responded by saying that the new talk-radio network was not communist but liberal. He replied: &quot;Well. Aren&#x27;t they synonymous?&quot;

===Middle East===
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has accused Cafferty of having a &quot;simplistic&quot; view of the Middle East. Cafferty courted controversy on September 23, 2004 while discussing terrorist demands for the release of two women scientists from an Iraqi prison and remarking: &quot;Given the way these mutants treat women in their societies, the women are probably better off in U.S. custody. They treat women like furniture in those countries. If I was a woman, I think I’d rather be in an American jail cell than I would be living with one of those, whatever they are over there.&quot;

On November 17, 2004, touching on the kidnapping and murder of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s South Asia Bureau Chief Daniel Pearl, Cafferty remarked: &quot;The Arab World is where innocent people are kidnapped, blindfolded, tied up, tortured and beheaded, and then videotape of all of this is released to the world as though they’re somehow proud of their barbarism. Somehow, I wouldn’t be too concerned about the sensitivity of the Arab world. They don’t seem to have very much. It&#x27;s going to come down to them or us.&quot; The next day the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee accused Cafferty of &quot;hateful rhetoric&quot; and stated that he had &quot;a history of insensitive remarks towards many minority groups&quot;.

===China===
On the April 9, 2008 broadcast of CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, asked to comment on the United States&#x27; relationship with China, Cafferty responded: &quot;I think they&#x27;re basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they&#x27;ve been for the last 50 years&quot;. The Legal Immigrant Association started an online petition calling for a formal apology, indicating that Cafferty&#x27;s rant was anti-Chinese and had the effect of exacerbating negative attitudes held by Americans toward Chinese and Chinese Americans. On the April 14, 2008 broadcast of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Situation Room&quot;, Jack Cafferty clarified his remarks: &quot;Last week, during a discussion of the controversy surrounding China&#x27;s hosting of the Olympic Games, I said that the Chinese are basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they have been for the last 50 years. I was referring to the Chinese government, and not to Chinese people or to Chinese Americans.&quot; CNN issued a controversial apology on April 14, to &quot;anyone who has interpreted the comments to be causing offense.&quot; Not satisfied with CNN&#x27;s response, several thousand demonstrators picketed CNN&#x27;s Atlanta, Georgia and Hollywood offices and demanded that CNN remove him from the network.

A protest was held on April 26, 2008 in front of CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
On the same day, a few thousand Chinese and Chinese Americans protested in front of a CNN office in San Francisco.
On May 15, 2008, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang, CNN President Jim Walton sent a letter to Zhou Wenzhong, Chinese ambassador to the United States: &quot;On behalf of CNN I&#x27;d like to apologize to the Chinese people for that. CNN has the highest respect for Chinese people around the world and we have no doubt that there was genuine offense felt by them over the Jack Cafferty commentary.&quot; CNN, however, denies that an apology to the Chinese government was ever made, stating that it was meant for the Chinese people alone.

===Sarah Palin===
On the September 26, 2008 edition of &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, Cafferty criticized Republican presidential candidate John McCain&#x27;s vice presidential nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin after she did what he referred to as a &quot;disastrous interview&quot; with CBS news anchor Katie Couric when she could not clearly answer Couric&#x27;s questions about the federal government&#x27;s intervention into Wall Street. Cafferty went on to say that &quot;if John McCain wins, this woman will be one 72 year old&#x27;s heart beat away from becoming President of the United States, and if that doesn&#x27;t scare the hell out of you, it should!&quot; He went further to say that her interview with Couric was the most pathetic tape he had ever seen. When Wolf Blitzer came to Palin&#x27;s defense, Cafferty snapped back indicating &quot;there&#x27;s no excuse for that, don&#x27;t make excuses for her, that&#x27;s pathetic!&quot;

===Nancy Pelosi===
Cafferty was outspokenly critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for failing to call for an impeachment against President Bush, calling her the &quot;most awful&quot; Speaker Congress has ever had. Cafferty sparked some national controversy among some liberal watchdog groups, particularly Media Matters for America during the January 12, 2010 broadcast of The Situation Room, in which Cafferty called her a &quot;horrible woman&quot; for refusing to disclose the precise cost of her trip to the Copenhagen Climate Summit, that Cafferty felt was a complete waste of tax payer money.

==Reckless driving incident==
Cafferty pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and misdemeanor charges of reckless driving, assault and harassment after striking a cyclist and knocking him off his bike on May 14, 2003. The bicyclist was slightly injured. A traffic officer and several pedestrians ran after Cafferty&#x27;s car, but he ran at least two red lights without stopping, according to a police complaint. Cafferty was sentenced to a $250 fine and 70 hours of community service.

==Personal life==
Cafferty was born in Chicago. He is a recovering alcoholic, an addiction he later attributed to his father&#x27;s influence. &quot;I was actually taught to drink, without even realizing what was going on, by my dad&quot;, he said.

On the September 5, 2008 episode of &quot;The Situation Room&quot; with Wolf Blitzer, it was revealed that Cafferty&#x27;s wife of 35 years, Carol, had died that day of unknown causes. Cafferty acknowledged on his CNN blog that his wife had been responsible for his decision to quit drinking.

Cafferty has been a resident of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.

==Luis Bátiz Sainz==
Luis Bátiz Sainz was born on September 13, 1870. He attended a minor seminary from age 12, and was ordained on January 1, 1894. He worked as spiritual director of the seminary and as parish priest in Chalchihuites, Zacatecas, and was a member of the Knights of Columbus. He was noted for his pastoral zeal and capacity to organize the parish. He founded a workshop for Catholic workers and a school.

Bátiz spent a great part of his time on the catechesis of children and adults, and was very fervent in his Eucharistic adoration. He is reported to have said, &quot;Lord, I want to be a martyr; though I am your unworthy minister, I want to shed my blood, drop by drop, for your name.&quot;

Before the closure of the churches in 1926, a meeting of the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty discussed the possibility of armed rebellion to overthrow the government. Fr. Bátiz spoke at this meeting and was denounced to the government. When the churches were closed, he moved to a private house, where he was captured by government soldiers on August 14, 1926. Although there was a public outcry, the government decided to execute the priest. The next day, on the pretext of transferring him to Zacatecas, soldiers took him and three members of the Mexican Association for Catholic Youth, putting them in a car for transport. Underway, the four men were taken from the car and shot on the side of the road by a firing squad.

==Rodrigo Aguilar Alemán==
Rodrigo Aguilar Alemán was born on May 13, 1875. After his seminary training in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco, he was ordained a priest in 1905. He was known for his literary abilities, writing both prose and poetry. He worked in various parishes. He was a Knight of Columbus and a member of Council 2330. He was the parish priest in Unión de Tula, Mexico. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, he took refuge at the Colegio de San Ignacio in Ejutla, where he continued to celebrate Mass and administer the sacraments. Rather than escape when soldiers arrived, Father Aguilar Alemán remained at the seminary to burn the list of seminary students, and thus protect them from being known.

On October 28, 1927, the day after his arrest, Father Alemán was led to the main plaza of Ejutla for execution by hanging. He blessed his captors and gave them his pardon, giving his rosary to one of the executioners. His captors decided to toy with Father Alemán and put his convictions to the test. After placing the noose on his neck from the rope hanging on a mango tree, they repeatedly asked him, &quot;Who lives?&quot; expecting the answer &quot;Long live the supreme government.&quot; Instead he shouted the Cristero motto: &quot;Long live Christ the King and Blessed Mary of Guadalupe!&quot; They pulled on the rope and suspended him briefly, then lowered him and asked again. This happened three times (with each time Alemán repeating the Cristero motto). The third time he was suspended, Father Alemán died. He was buried in the parish church at Tula.

==Agustín Caloca Cortés==
Agustín Caloca Cortés was born in San Juan Bautista de Teúl on May 5, 1898. He attended the seminary in Guadalajara, Jalisco, but was sent back to his family when the building was sacked during the Mexican Revolution. He continued his studies in a clandestine auxiliary seminary. In 1919, he was able to return to Guadalajara and was ordained on August 15, 1923. His priestly assignment was to the parish of Totatiche and to the prefecture of the seminary.

Government troops closed in to close down the seminary in late May 1927. Fr. Caloca Cortés directed the students to flee to safety and he tried to do the same, but he was captured by a group of soldiers. He was held in the jailhouse of Totatiche, together with Fr. Cristóbal Magallanes. General Goñi ordered his transfer to Colotlán, where Caloca was executed by firing squad in the burned city hall building on May 25, 1927. His heart was found to be incorrupt when his body was returned to the parish of Totatiche in 1933.

==Román Adame Rosales==

Román Adame Rosales was born on February 27, 1859. He studied for the priesthood in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and was ordained on November 30, 1890. He worked in various parishes, showing a profound dedication to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to catechesis, directing spiritual exercises, and parish schools. He founded the association &quot;Daughters of Mary and Nocturnal Adoration&quot;. He built numerous chapels on the ranches. When the Calles Law forced the closing of the churches, he continued his ministry in private houses.

Adame was captured by government forces and tortured. He was taken to Yahualica, where he spent several days tied up, without food and water. On April 21, 1927, he was taken to an open grave, where he was executed by firing squad. His remains were later disinterred and brought to Nochistlán.

==Atilano Cruz Alvarado==
Atilano Cruz Alvarado was born in Teocaltiche on October 5, 1901. He worked as a ranch hand for his family until the parents decided to send him to Teocaltiche to learn to read and write. There he discovered his vocation and entered a clandestine seminary in 1918. Two years later, he was sent to Guadalajara to finish his training. He was ordained on July 24, 1927, and sent to Cuquío a year later, where the parish was being run from a ranch house, &quot;Las Cruces&quot;. There, on June 29, 1928, he joined his pastor, Justino Orona Madrigal, and they prayed and discussed the situation in their parish.

In the early dawn of July 1, he was apprehended by a squad of soldiers. In the jail where he was held, Fr. Orona Madrigal and his brother were there, covered with wounds. While he was praying at the foot of the bed, the soldiers shot Fr. Cruz. His still living body was thrown onto the porch together with Fr. Orona. The two were then taken to Cuquío, where their bodies were dragged through the central square, during which they died.

==Miguel de la Mora==
Father Miguel de la Mora of Colima was a member of the Knights of Columbus, Council 2140. Along with several other priests, he publicly signed a letter opposing the anti-religious laws imposed by the government. He was soon arrested and, with his brother Regino looking on, he was executed without a trial by a single shot from a military officer as he prayed his rosary on Aug. 7, 1927.

==José Dionisio Luis Padilla Gómez==
Luis Padilla Gomez was born on 9 December 1899 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. He was an active member of the Catholic Association of Mexican Youth (ACJM) and worked closely with Anacleto Gonzalez Flores in the activities of the Association, helping the poor children and youth in a special way. The young man, known to all as Luis, spent much time praying before the Blessed Sacrament and had a deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

On the morning of April 1, 1927, Luis was arrested in his home, together with his mother and one of his sisters. He was repeatedly beaten and insulted, then sentenced to execution. After arriving at the Colorado jail, Luis met Anacleto and the others. He told Anacleto that he wanted to go to confession. But Anacleto told the young man, &quot;No, brother, now is not the hour to confess, but to request pardon and to pardon our enemies. God is a Father and not a judge, the One who gives you hope. Your own blood will purify you&quot;. Luis knelt down in prayer, as the executioners&#x27; bullets riddled his prostrate body.

Their traditional colours are royal blue and white, and they are nicknamed &quot;The Stones&quot; or &quot;The Royals&quot;.

Whilst formally established in 1899, the club has roots dating back to 1887 and was created through a series of local team mergers. For most of its existence the club was based at the Lower Mead stadium in Harrow until 1991. After a long period of homelessness and ground sharing with various local clubs, since 2008 they have been based at Grosvenor Vale.

The club were the first to achieve the famed non-League &#x27;double&#x27;, winning both the FA Trophy and the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) in the same season (1984–85). The latter happened two years before automatic promotion to the Football League began; Wealdstone has never been a member of the Football League so far.

==History==
===Early years===

The club was formed at the start of the 1899–1900 season, joining Division Two of the Willesden &amp; District League. A previous &quot;Wealdstone F.C.&quot; existed, for workers at a local gunsmith in Wealdstone, a Middlesex village to the north of Harrow Hill - itself has its origins in a club called The Oaks. An article published by the &quot;Harrow Observer&quot; states that the Wealdstone football club formed in about 1890, playing home games in a field in Hindes Road (present-day Harrow) and meeting at the Railway Hotel, close to Harrow and Wealdstone station. This club merged into another local club called Harrow Athletic F.C. in September 1894, while other clubs bearing the Wealdstone name soon formed. A merger between clubs called Wealdstone Rovers and Wealdstone Juniors resulted in the formation of Wealdstone Albion F.C. for the 1898 season, and using the same blue and white striped colours of the old Wealdstone F.C. A year later, Wealdstone F.C. took its place. At this time their home turf was a field between Headstone Drive and Marlborough Hill, Wealdstone.

Their first game was a friendly match on 7 October 1899 against Northwood, which they won 6–1. They were promoted to the league&#x27;s Division One for the 1900–01 season after Division Two was scrapped. In 1903 they moved to the College Farm Ground in Locket Road, Wealdstone, and soon after another nearby ground in what is now Byron Park. In 1905–06 the club won Division One, but on 20 October 1906 a notice was posted in the local newspaper stating that the club was to be disbanded due to &#x27;a lack of interest&#x27; from players and supporters.

The club was soon reformed in time for the 1908–09 season, rejoining Division One of the Willesden &amp; District League. In 1910 they moved to Belmont Road, and won Division One again in 1912–13. Following World War I the club joined the London League and the Middlesex Senior League.

At the start of the 1922–23 season, Wealdstone F.C. switched to the Spartan League and at the same time moved south to a ground called Lower Mead in what is now central Harrow; this would become the permanent home ground of the club for 69 years. The club had their record win on 13 October 1923, beating the 12th London Regiment 22–0 in an FA Amateur Cup game.

===Athenian League years (1928–1964)===
In 1928–29 they switched leagues again, this time joining the Athenian League. In 1929–30 the club won the Middlesex Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the first time. On Saturday 16 November 1929, Wealdstone played Dulwich Hamlet in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round, with the match ending in a record-breaking 7–7 draw; there has never been a 7–7 scoreline in any other FA Cup match before or since, and none either in the top four divisions of the League Pyramid (including play-offs), the League Cup, League Trophy, FA Community Shield, FA Trophy or FA Vase. Four days later, Dulwich won the replay 2–1.

During World War II the club continued to play, playing at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Middlesex Senior Red Cross Cup in 1942. In December 1944, they recorded their heaviest defeat ever, losing 14–0 to Edgware Town in the London Senior Cup. In 1946 the BBC showed part of Wealdstone&#x27;s Athenian League match at Barnet, the first post-war match to be televised live.

Television cameras followed Wealdstone in the FA Cup qualifying rounds in 1949-50, with a 1-0 success at Edgware Town in the Third Qualifying Round and a home victory against Colchester in the Fourth shown live on the BBC. Wealdstone reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 to Port Vale.

In 1951–52 the club won the Athenian League, and went on to win the Middlesex Senior Cup in 1959, 1963 and 1964.

=== Amateur Cup win and turning professional (1964–1979) ===
In 1964 they switched to the Isthmian League. In 1965–66 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at Millwall, but went on to win the FA Amateur Cup, beating local rivals Hendon 3–1 in the final. The following season saw Wealdstone entered at the first round of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 at home to Nuneaton Borough.

The club joined the Division One North of the Southern League in 1971, turning professional. They were moved to Division One South the following season, and won the division in 1973–74, earning promotion to the Premier Division. In 1977–78 Wealdstone progressed beyond the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Third Division Hereford United 3–2 at Edgar Street in a first round replay, they went on to defeat Fourth Division Reading 2–1 at home in the second round, before losing 4–0 at First Division Queens Park Rangers in the third round.

=== Conference and non-league double (1979–1988) ===
In 1979 the club were founder members of the Alliance Premier League, the new national top division of non-League football. After finishing 19th in 1980–81 they were relegated back to the Southern League, but then made an immediate return after winning the South Division of the Southern League the following season; a play-off ensued against Midland Division champions Nuneaton, with Wealdstone winning on penalties after winning the home leg 2–1 and losing 1–0 away. Wealdstone&#x27;s return to the Alliance Premier League was much more positive than their first stint, finishing 3rd in 1982–83, and then 4th the following season.

In 1984–85 the club had its most successful season to date. Under the management of Brian Hall, Wealdstone won the Alliance Premier League and also the FA Trophy, beating Boston United 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium. This was first occasion that the non-league &quot;double&quot; had been achieved by any team. However, in spite of this, Wealdstone were not promoted to the English Football League; automatic promotion from the Alliance Premier League would not be introduced until two years later, and in any case Lower Mead was deemed not to meet Football League stadium requirements so the club was not eligible to apply for election.

Following the double, a period of sharp decline soon set in; after finishing tenth the season after with an aging team, they finished 19th in 1986–87, and were eventually relegated at the end of the following season.

=== Decline and ground loss (1988–2004) ===
By the end of the 1990–91 season, financial problems caused by boardroom impropriety were seriously exacerbated by the owner selling the club&#x27;s Lower Mead ground for commercial development, for which the club, after protracted legal wrangling, received only a very small share of the proceeds. They then signed up to an expensive ground sharing arrangement at Watford&#x27;s Vicarage Road, and at the end of the 1991–92 season the club were relegated again, dropping from the Southern League Premier Division into the Southern League South Division.

Seeking to reduce expenditure, in 1993 the club began a two-season ground sharing agreement at The Warren, Yeading&#x27;s ground. In June 1995, with the club in administration and only having two players to its name, Gordon Bartlett was appointed manager. Later that year, Wealdstone re-joined the Isthmian League to further reduce their travelling expenses, having to agree to drop a level into Division Three in the process. Yet again, they moved grounds, this time entering into a ground share with Edgware Town at their White Lion ground that was to last ten years.

After winning the Isthmian League Division Three in 1996–97, they finished second in Division Two in 1997–98 and were promoted again, this time to Division One. However, after finishing third in Division One in the 1998–99, the Isthmian League denied the club promotion to the Premier Division because required improvements at the White Lion ground were not completed until six days after a specified deadline.

=== Home search and recovery (2004–2019) ===
The club attempted to redevelop the local disused Prince Edward Playing Fields at Canons Park, owned by the London Borough of Harrow, into a new home ground. Construction of the new stadium started in 2003 but, when over 30% completed, building work was suddenly halted in April 2004 when the private company who were co-financing the project in partnership with the club went into insolvency. Unable to afford to complete the new stadium on their own, Wealdstone had to leave the project unfinished for two years. Eventually, Harrow Council, frustrated that the site remained unused and was falling into dereliction, eventually sold the property lease to Barnet F.C., who used the site as a training centre before later moving permanently in to what became The Hive Stadium in 2013. The terms of the council&#x27;s lease offer indicated that the new owner should complete the stadium for Wealdstone&#x27;s use, but this was ultimately ignored and the club&#x27;s financial investment in the project was lost.

In 2004 Wealdstone were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division as a result of the creation of the Conference North and South. The club faced Dulwich Hamlet in the playoff final, with the game finishing 2–2 before Wealdstone won 5–4 on penalties. The club&#x27;s first two seasons at Premier Division level saw them steer clear of relegation, with back to back 18th-placed finishes. Off the pitch, the club began a further new groundshare arrangement in 2005, this time moving to Northwood&#x27;s Chestnut Avenue ground. In 2006 they were switched under FA reorganisation to the Southern League Premier Division for a single season, before returning to the Isthmian League the following season.

In January 2008, Wealdstone acquired Ruislip Sports and Social club and the associated lease at Ruislip Manor&#x27;s Grosvenor Vale ground, starting the 2008-09 season there. With the ground share agreement at Northwood coming to an end and still no specific completion date in sight for the club&#x27;s Prince Edward Playing Field project, Wealdstone instead decided to invest in the Grosvenor Vale stadium to upgrade the playing facilities as a priority, in order to meet the necessary ground grading requirements to play Isthmian League Premier Division football in the 2008–09 season. The club&#x27;s first 3 seasons at the Vale saw the club fail to reach the playoffs, finishing 7th, 6th and then 12th. They did however reach the first round of the FA Cup in 2009-10, where they lost 3–2 at home to Rotherham United

2011–12 saw Wealdstone embark on a run the FA Trophy which saw them reach the semi-final and knock out three teams from higher divisions. A 2–1 win at home to Conference side Barrow and a 1–0 win in a replay against Dartford of the Conference South set up a quarter-final away at Cambridge United which Wealdstone won 2-1 thanks to a Richard Jolly brace, before eventually losing 3–1 on aggregate to Newport County in the semi-final. They also reached the promotion play-offs in the Isthmian Premier Division that year, but lost 2–1 to Lowestoft Town in the semi-finals. The following season saw them losing in the play-off semi finals again, this time losing 2–1 against Concord Rangers. However, in 2013–14 did win promotion as league champions, with their promotion to the Conference South being secured with a 1–0 win away to Margate.

Wealdstone did not win any of their first 9 games in the Conference South, with the run ended by a 1–0 victory away to Whitehawk. An upturn in form meant that they finished the 2014-15 season in 12th place, and they would go on to finish 13th the following season. The summer of 2016 saw the club change ownership when Peter Marsden, previously chairman of Accrington Stanley, took over the club in late July. The 2016-17 season saw Wealdstone experience a greater degree of success on the pitch, with the club pushing for the playoffs. However, their hopes were dashed when it was announced that they would be ineligible to compete in the playoffs due to missing the cut off point to meet ground grading requirements. Wealdstone&#x27;s eventual 8th-placed finish would not have seen them compete regardless.
On 21 August 2017, Gordon Bartlett stepped down as Wealdstone manager after 22 years. A day later, Bobby Wilkinson, formerly of Hungerford Town, was appointed manager. Wilkinson&#x27;s first season at Wealdstone ended an unremarkable 11th-placed finish in the league, although the club reached the semi-final of the FA Trophy, where they lost 3–0 on aggregate to eventual winners Brackley. In January 2019, chairman Peter Marsden was voted out of his position, and replaced by Rory Fitzgerald. On the final day of the 2018–19 season, Wealdstone rose from 10th to 7th on with a 2–1 win over Hemel Hempstead to ensure a place in the playoffs. Wealdstone began their playoff campaign with a win away at Bath to secure a semi final against Woking, which Wealdstone narrowly lost 3–2. Wilkinson subsequently left the club at the end of the season.

=== Title win and the National League (2019–present) ===
On 21 May 2019 Dean Brennan was appointed as new manager, with Stuart Maynard joining as his assistant. 10 wins in the first 11 games of the 2019–20 season saw Wealdstone rise to the top of the league. On 26 March 2020 the season was suspended due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with Wealdstone still top of the league. On 17 June it was confirmed that the club were to be promoted to the National League as champions of the National League South, on the basis of points won per game.

The club&#x27;s first season in the fifth tier for 32 years started positively, with 5 wins in the first 8 seeing the club rise to 2nd in the league. However, following a slump in form, Brennan departed his role as manager on 2 February 2021. The club subsequently appointed assistant manager Stuart Maynard as manager, with Matthew Saunders as his assistant. On 5 April, Wealdstone defeated local rivals Barnet 5–1. The club ended their first season back at National League level in 19th place.

In their second season in the National League, Wealdstone recorded a 16th-placed finish, their highest league position for 35 years. The season also saw a new attendance record set at Grosvenor Vale, when Wealdstone defeated Barnet 1–0 in front of a crowd of 2,662. The following campaign saw them host 2,817 in a 0–0 draw with Wrexham. The attendance record was broken again, in March 2023, exceeding 3,000 for the first time, when Wealdstone hosted Barnet in a 0–2 away win. In their Third season they finished 13th, exceeding the previous season&#x27;s best league finish.

On 16 November 2023, they announced plans for a new stadium after being allocated land by London Borough of Hillingdon.

On 18 January 2024, Maynard and Saunders left their roles at Wealdstone to join League Two side Notts County. Eight days later, then St. Albans City manager David Noble was named as Maynard&#x27;s successor. His tenure saw only 2 league wins in 15 games, leaving the club in 20th and only above the relegation zone on goal difference. 73 days after their appointment, Noble was relieved of his duties after a 4–0 loss away to relegation rivals Boreham Wood. First team coach Sam Cox took charge for the remainder of the season. He guided the team to 3 wins from their last 5 games, finishing in 16th and 4 points clear of Boreham Wood in 21st.

In May 2024, former Walsall and Shrewsbury boss Matt Taylor was announced as manager. This was coupled with the news that the club would transition to a hybrid training model for the 2024–25 season. Wealdstone made the FA Cup second round for the first time since 1983–84, after beating League Two side Grimsby Town 1–0. They were drawn against League One side Wycombe Wanderers but lost 2–0 in front of a record crowd at Grosvenor Vale of 3,534 attendance.

==Club crest==
The club&#x27;s crest first appeared on team shirts in the 1960s. It contains four quarters representing the traditional colours of the club (royal blue and white); the &quot;Three Lions&quot; representing England; a football representing the club&#x27;s sport; and the emblem of Middlesex, the historic county of the London Borough of Harrow where the club is from.

==Rivalry==
Wealdstone&#x27;s main rivals are often considered to be Barnet. The clubs were both founding members of the Alliance Premier League and played each other regularly throughout the 1980s, although games were rarely played after that with the clubs being in different divisions. The rivalry came back to prominence when Barnet moved into The Hive Stadium which was originally intended for Wealdstone. With the two clubs now playing in the same division, the rivalry has heightened after ex-Stones manager Dean Brennan joined Barnet, originally as Director of Football before becoming manager in late 2021. Other rivals have included Harrow Borough (with whom the &quot;Harrow Derby&quot; is contested), Enfield, and Hendon, with Wealdstone beating the latter in the 1966 Amateur Cup final.

The club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer is George Duck. Duck scored 251 goals for Wealdstone in 370 appearances between 1972 and 1979, and additionally set unmatched scoring records for penalties and hat-tricks. In every season he played for the club Duck was top scorer in league and cup competitions.

Amongst former players who have gone on to notable careers at the highest level of professional football are Stuart Pearce, Vinnie Jones and Jermaine Beckford. Harold Smith was the first ever player to leave Wealdstone FC for a professional career, joining Notts County in 1930.

<text>The American Samoa men&#x27;s national football team () represents American Samoa in men&#x27;s international association football and is controlled by the Football Federation American Samoa, the governing body of the sport in the territory. American Samoa&#x27;s home ground is the Pago Park Soccer Stadium in Pago Pago.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1983, American Samoa entered a football team in the South Pacific Games for the first time. The territory&#x27;s official first match took place in Apia, Western Samoa on August 20, 1983, and ended in a 3–1 defeat to Western Samoa. Two days later, the team recorded their first win with a 3–0 victory against Wallis and Futuna however, they were eliminated from the competition at the group stage following a 3–2 loss to Tonga on August 24.

The following year, the American Samoa Football Association (ASFA) – now known as Football Federation American Samoa (FFAS) – was founded and took over responsibility for organizing the territory&#x27;s national team.

After competing in the 1987 South Pacific Games and the 1994 Polynesia Cup, ASFA became full members of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) allowing them to compete in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time. American Samoa registered their first FIFA-recognized international during the 1998 Polynesia Cup in Rarotonga, Cook Islands when they lost 3–0 to Tonga on September 2.

==== World record for the worst loss in international matches ====
During their first qualifying campaign for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in April 2001, American Samoa was involved in a match which set the record for the largest margin of victory in international football when they lost 31–0 to Australia. The outcome of the match led to debates about the format of qualification tournaments, with the Australian manager Frank Farina and striker Archie Thompson – who scored 13 times in the match – feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches, views shared by the international footballing body FIFA. It eventually led to the introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Since joining FIFA, the team has been regarded as one of the world&#x27;s weakest teams and were, until November 2011, the joint-lowest ranked national team in the FIFA World ranking.

On November 23, 2011, American Samoa recorded their second and first FIFA-recognized win when they defeated Tonga 2–1 in the first round of qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It was also the team&#x27;s first victory after 38 consecutive defeats.

The team&#x27;s efforts to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup were chronicled in a 2014 British documentary, &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot;, directed by Mike Brett and Steve Jamison. In October 2015, the territory achieved its highest position in the FIFA World Rankings when they reached 164th following back-to-back wins against Tonga and the Cook Islands in qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
After playing in the 2019 Pacific Games, American Samoa was removed from the FIFA World Rankings after it had not played a match in over four years. This hiatus was caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced the team out of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification and the cancellation of the 2020 OFC Nations Cup. American Samoa would finally compete again at the 2023 Pacific Games.

====Player pool====
American Samoa has struggled in part because of its small player pool. The territory has a small population, and many potential players move away for education or work or choose to play other sports such as baseball. Another limiting factor is that international competition regulations often require that players hold the nationality of the country that they represent, which in the case of American Samoa is United States nationality. Although people born in American Samoa are United States nationals, foreign nationals who immigrate to American Samoa, who comprise about a third of its population, are ineligible to apply for United States nationality. An option for the team would be to recruit players from the United States, as other teams of Pacific territories have done with their parent countries, such as Tahiti drawing players from Metropolitan France.

=== Home stadium ===
American Samoa&#x27;s home ground is the Pago Park Soccer Stadium, however American Samoa had never played a home match there in their history at the senior level. The stadium featured in the 2023 film &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot; and was a facility used as the national team&#x27;s training ground in the build-up to the 2011 Pacific Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Matches at the stadium must be concluded before 6:30pm because of a village curfew which limits noise and prevents the installation of floodlighting. For this reason, the association began planning to build a new facility in Tafuna in 2023. FIFA president Gianni Infantino promised the association $5 million for the project during his visit around Oceania in summer of that year.

==Competitive record==
===FIFA World Cup===
Following FIFA affiliation in 1998, American Samoa first entered the qualifying competition for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. They have entered the qualifiers for each subsequent edition but have never made it beyond the first stage. The closest they came to reaching the second phase was in qualifying for the 2018 edition when they won two of their three matches and narrowly missed out on progressing on goal difference.

;Notes



===OFC Nations Cup===
Before becoming full members of OFC in 1998, American Samoa entered the 1994 Polynesia Cup which acted as the qualifying round for Polynesian national teams for the 1996 OFC Nations Cup. This was the territory&#x27;s first time competing for a place in OFC&#x27;s flagship competition for senior men&#x27;s national teams.

The OFC Men&#x27;s Nations Cup has often acted as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification process for Oceanian national teams and, as a result, American Samoa have competed in the qualifiers for both competitions in every edition since 1998. They have yet to qualify for either competition.

;Notes



===Pacific Games===
American Samoa first entered the South Pacific Games in 1983. This was the first time a team representing the territory had competed in association football and they recorded one win from their three games in the group stage by beating Wallis and Futuna 3–0 – the only time American Samoa have recorded a win in the competition – but that wasn&#x27;t enough to progress to the next round. American Samoa would go onto enter the 1987 edition where they were again eliminated in the group stage, losing all four of their matches.

It would be another 20 years before they again entered the competition. The 2007 edition was the last known as the South Pacific Games before becoming the Pacific Games four years later and it was also part of the qualification process for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In their third appearance in the competition, American Samoa were again eliminated at the group stage, losing all four matches. The same fate befell American Samoa in the 2011 Pacific Games as they lost all five games to finish bottom of their group.

In 2015, the Pacific Games was an age-restricted tournament that doubled as the OFC Men&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournament and no team representing American Samoa took part. Four years later, they were again eliminated at the group stage however, a 1–1 draw with Tuvalu ended a 32-year losing streak in the competition.

;Notes

==Records and statistics==
American Samoa played their first full international match against Papua New Guinea, which ended in a 20–0 loss. Their national team have suffered the world&#x27;s biggest international defeat, by losing to Australia 31–0. American Samoa have won only against Cook Islands, Tonga, and Wallis and Futuna. American Samoa have also lost to all of these teams at least once.

<doc id="1024707" wikidata="Q1014094" url="?curid=1024707" title="Cash is king">
<text>&quot;Cash is king&quot; is a colloquial phrase sometimes used in analyzing businesses or investment portfolios. It may refer to the importance of cash flow in the overall fiscal health of a business. In corporate finance, the expression refers to the fact that only future free cash flows or dividends are relevant for valuation and not, for example, accounting earnings. For managers and investors, it may also describe the advantage of having a large percentage of cash or short-term debt instruments available either due to falling financial markets or due to the availability of investment opportunities. The phrase has also come to be associated with businesses that only accept cash, rather than card payments.

The concept of &quot;cash is king&quot; describes the importance of sufficient cash as an asset in the business for short term operations, purchases and acquisitions. A company could have a large amount of accounts receivables on its balance sheet which would also increase equity, but the company could still be short on cash with which it can make purchases, including paying wages to workers for labor. Unless it was able to convert its accounts receivable and other current assets to cash quickly, it could fail and be technically bankrupt despite a positive net worth.

==History==
The origin of &quot;cash is king&quot; is somewhat unclear. In George N. McLean&#x27;s 1890 book &quot;How to do Business, or the Secret of Success in Retail Merchandizing&quot;, one of the &quot;Twelve Wise Business Maxims&quot; is &quot;Avoid credit, remembering that cash is king, credit is a slave&quot;.

The phrase became more popular following the global stock market crash of 1987 by Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, then CEO of Swedish car group Volvo.

Since 2000, the expression, &quot;cash is king&quot;, has occasionally appeared in articles on the investing website &quot;Motley Fool&quot;, and is part of radio host Dave Ramsey&#x27;s hourly show introduction

The phrase was frequently used by billionaire property developer Alex Spanos, whose 2002 book, &quot;Sharing the Wealth: My Story&quot;, includes the phrase, used as a chapter title, and later adopted by another NFL team owner of Greek heritage, Jack Welch.

Widely used during the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession that followed, the phrase was also often used to describe companies which could avoid share issues or bankruptcy.

The phrase has been repurposed more recently to indicate opposition to the increasing trend of transactions being made using card rather than physical currency. This meaning is different to the original usage because, from an accountancy perspective, there is no significant distinction between cash held in a bank and physical currency. The original usage suggests the superiority of liquid assets over fixed assets, but in this repurposed usage, the distinction made is between physical currency and cash reserves held digitally with a financial institution.

The phrase has had its resurgence in more recent years in the form of protests over cashless societies, and the right to privacy.

<doc id="1024710" wikidata="Q4633835" url="?curid=1024710" title="2nd New Zealand Parliament">
<text>The 2nd New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. It opened on 15 April 1856, following New Zealand&#x27;s 1855 election. It was dissolved on 5 November 1860 in preparation for 1860–61 election. The 2nd Parliament was the first under which New Zealand had responsible government, meaning that unlike previously, the Cabinet was chosen (although not officially appointed) by Parliament rather than by the Governor-General of New Zealand.

==Historical context==
At this time political parties had not been established (they were not established until after the 1890 election), meaning that anyone attempting to form an administration had to win support directly from individual MPs. This made forming (and retaining) a government difficult. The Sewell Ministry, the first responsible government, led by Henry Sewell, lasted only two weeks. The first Fox Ministry, the second responsible government, led by William Fox, also lasted only two weeks. The third responsible government, the first Stafford Ministry, led by Edward Stafford, was more stable, governing for the remainder of the 2nd Parliament and for the beginning of the 3rd.

==Parliamentary sessions==

Parliament sat for three sessions:

==Electoral boundaries for the 2nd Parliament==
The 2nd Parliament, which initially used the same electoral boundaries as the 1st Parliament, consisted of thirty-seven representatives representing twenty-four electorates. Two regions of the colony (the inland regions of the lower North Island and the north-west corner of the South Island) were not part of any electorate, and so were not represented.

The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 allowed the General Assembly to add or alter electorates whenever this was desired, and this was first done in 1858 as described below. The amendment changed the boundaries to some electorates and supplementary elections were held the following year—held between 7 November and 18 December 1859—to fill vacancies.

==Initial composition of the 2nd Parliament==
==Changes during term==
The turnover of MPs was very high in the 2nd Parliament, with 32 by-elections and a supplementary election being held. This situation was partly the result of a redistribution of boundaries to seven electorates, and the creation of four new electorates – agreed upon in the &quot;Electoral Districts Act, 1858&quot;, with the total number of MPs in Parliament rising from 37 to 41, and the number of electorates rising from 24 to 28. The electorates Bay of Islands and Northern Division were combined and then redivided, with Marsden resulting as a new electorate. The Wairarapa and Hawke&#x27;s Bay electorate was split into two separate components, and . All the previously unincorporated areas in the lower North Island were divided between Wairarapa, County of Hawke, , and .

In the South Island, the southern portion of Wairau electorate, plus part of Christchurch Country, became the new Cheviot electorate. The western portion of Dunedin Country was split off and became the new Wallace electorate. The northwest of the South Island remained the colony&#x27;s only territory not part of an electorate.

Members of Parliament belonging to one of the electorates that was split could choose which of the two new electorates they would want to represent, and by-elections were held during 1859 in the thus unrepresented electorates.

At the opening of the 6th session of the Parliament on 10 April 1858, the speaker read out 14 resignations.

<text>Thermos bomb was the informal name for the AR-4, an air dropped anti-personnel mine used by the Italian Air Force during World War II. Large numbers were used against Malta and in the Middle East. It was named for its superficial appearance to a Thermos bottle, a popular brand of vacuum flask. The bomb was a cylinder long and weighing . It could be fitted with a very sensitive motion-sensitive fuze that would detonate if any attempt was made to move it. It could be lethal in the open to approximately . Because of this, unexploded Thermos bombs were normally destroyed where they fell, either by attaching a long piece of string to them and giving it a jerk, or detonating a small explosive charge near them.

A later variant of the fuze introduced a long time delay, which triggered between 60 and 80 hours after the fuze had armed.

<doc id="1024735" wikidata="Q105849" url="?curid=1024735" title="Tolkien Estate">
<text>The Tolkien Estate is the legal body which manages the property of the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, including the copyright for most of his works. The individual copyrights have for the most part been assigned by the estate to subsidiary entities such as the J. R. R. Tolkien Discretionary Settlement and the Tolkien charitable trust. The various holdings of the Tolkien family, including the estate, have been organized under The Tolkien Company, the directors of which were Christopher Tolkien until August 2017 and his wife Baillie Tolkien, and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s grandson Michael George Tolkien. The executors of the estate were Christopher Tolkien (died 16 January 2020), who was sole literary executor, and (succeeding J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s lawyer Frank Williamson) Cathleen Blackburn of Maier Blackburn, who has been the estate&#x27;s solicitor for many years.

== Rights to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ==
Exclusive worldwide rights to motion picture, merchandising, stage and other rights in certain literary works of J. R. R. Tolkien including &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were sold by Tolkien himself to United Artists in 1969, reportedly for a small amount, and are currently owned by Middle-earth Enterprises (formerly Tolkien Enterprises), inc., an Embracer Group subdivision, although some rights were retained such as television series of eight or more episodes.

== Legal issues ==
=== Film royalties ===
In February 2008, the Tolkien Trust sued New Line Cinema, the studio behind the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, for £75 million claiming they had not received &quot;even one penny&quot; from the films. A request for punitive damages was denied in September. The case was resolved out of court the following year on September 8, with the terms not made public.

In a press release, Christopher Tolkien stated: &quot;The Trustees regret that legal action was necessary, but are glad that this dispute has been settled on satisfactory terms that will allow the Tolkien Trust properly to pursue its charitable objectives. The Trustees acknowledge that New Line may now proceed with its proposed films of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;&quot;.

=== Gambling devices ===
In November 2012 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Fourth Age Limited (later Tolkien Estate, Ltd) and other plaintiffs sued several Warner Bros. affiliates alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, and seeking declaratory relief, arguing that the defendants exceeded the scope of their rights.

The suit alleged that by producing gambling and video games using his characters, the parties had ignored the limitations of the rights purchased more than four decades prior in 1969, contending the original licence to Tolkien&#x27;s works was limited to the right to sell &quot;tangible&quot; products such as &quot;figurines, tableware, stationery items, clothing, and the like&quot;, but did not cover &quot;electronic or digital rights, rights in media yet to be devised or other intangibles such as rights in services&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s estate claimed that the defendants actions had caused &quot;irreparable harm to Tolkien&#x27;s legacy&quot;.

In March 2013, the Saul Zaentz Co. (doing business as Middle-earth Enterprises), the rightsholder for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Hobbit&quot; properties, filed an amended counterclaim against Fourth Age for declaratory relief, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and &quot;quantum meruit&quot;. The Warner Parties filed an amended counterclaim against Fourth Age for breach of contract and declaratory relief.

The Tolkien Estate et al. attempted to block these countersuits under California&#x27;s anti-SLAPP statute, claiming that Warner Brothers was interfering with their right to petition under the First Amendment to the US Constitution. On 11 July 2013, US District Judge Audrey Collins denied a motion to dismiss, disagreeing that what Warner Brothers was doing was making &quot;disguised claims for malicious prosecution&quot; and wrote &quot;these claims arise out of the parties&#x27; divergent understanding of the Warner Parties&#x27; and Zaentz&#x27;s rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. They are routine contract-based claims and counterclaims&quot;. In October 2015 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that ruling.

The lawsuit was confidentially settled in July 2017.

== &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; ==

In November 2017, Amazon acquired the global television rights to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; appendices found at the end of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Amazon committed to a multi-season television series titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. It features stories that are set in the Second Age. Amazon said the deal included potential for spin-off series as well. The press release referred to &quot;previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s original writings&quot;. Amazon is the producer in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and The Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema.

== Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s resignation ==
In August 2017, at age 93, Christopher Tolkien resigned as a director of the Tolkien Estate and the Tolkien Trust, while remaining as the literary executor. He died on 16 January 2020 at the age of 95.

<text>Vox Clamantis (&quot;the voice of one crying out&quot;) is a Latin poem of 10,265 lines in elegiac couplets by John Gower (1330 – October 1408) . The first of the seven books is a dream vision giving a vivid account of the Peasants&#x27; Rebellion of 1381. Macaulay described the remaining books: &quot;The general plan of the author is to describe the condition of society and of the various degrees of men, much as in the latter portion of the &quot;Speculum Meditantis&quot;.&quot; Fisher concludes that books II-V were written in the 1370s while the author was writing similar passages in &quot;Mirour de l&#x27;Omme&quot;.

==Versions==
Wickert divides the manuscripts into two groups: A-text (Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;initial version,&quot; Fisher&#x27;s &quot;b-version&quot;) and B-text (Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;final version,&quot; Fisher&#x27;s &quot;c-version&quot;). The A-text for Book VI condemns the advisors of a young King Richard; the corresponding B-text condemns &quot;the king&#x27;s corrupt and corrupting young associates.&quot; There is a unique manuscript (MS Laud (Misc) 719 SC10601) which omits the &quot;Visio&quot; and numbers the books I–VI. Fisher calls this the a-version. Both Wickert and Fisher agree that the existence of this manuscript is strong evidence that the bulk of Vox was written before the Peasants&#x27; Revolt.

==Genre and purpose==
Book One is a dream-vision. Galloway claims the Gower&#x27;s use of dream-vision contributed to the demolition of the form. He cites only two instances of dream-vision in the fifteenth century. &quot;Gower&#x27;s reassessment of the dream-vision form throughout his career progressively and caustically dissolve its claims to revealing suprahuman powers, while using the form to explore the connections between human thought and interpretation and human needs and appetites.&quot;

Most critics cite the remaining books as an example of estate satire where the author complains about various problems in society. &quot;This universal voice, the voice of the Old Testament prophets, is the mode of perception and expression that distinguishes medieval complaint from classical satire.&quot; Wickert disagrees and argues that these books have the form of a medieval sermon described in Luke 3:7-9.

Fisher summarizes: &quot;What distinguishes Gower&#x27;s views from those of many of his contemporaries, and places him among the progressive thinkers of this day, is his emphasis upon legal justice and regal responsibility for all the estates, defined in terms of &quot;le biencoomue,&quot; &quot;bonus communi,&quot; or &quot;the common good,&quot; depending on the language in which be happened to be writing&quot; Wickert asks the rhetorical question: &quot;Did Gower achieve his goal?&quot; &quot;Mirour&quot; included a call for soul-searching. &quot;Vox&quot; attempted to explain the signs of the times. The poem did not cause changes in society. &quot;After the removal of the immediate danger, the homilist exhorted deaf ears.&quot;

==Sources==
Several scholars have remarked on the quantity of quotations and adaptions from other authors in &quot;Vox&quot;. Macaulay observed &quot;His knowledge of Ovid seems to have been pretty complete, for he borrows from almost every section of his works with the air of one who knows perfectly well where to turn for what he wants&quot;. Fisher observes that in &quot;Vox&quot; the borrowed lines &quot;do not express any experience or sentiment taken from Ovid. ... The quotations come from such a variety of contexts and are so tailored to fit their position that if the passage [in the Vox] has any meaning, it must be that of the immediate author&quot;. Most of the borrowings in &quot;Vox&quot; appear in &quot;Visio Anglie&quot;. Fisher counted 327 lines borrowed or adapted from a total of 2150 for a ratio of about one in seven.

Gower acknowledged one source: &quot;Peter of Riga wrote what I have written in his Aurora, and he will be a true witness and authority in this case. Paul Beichner identified several passages which were taken from the Aurora. Macaulay also found borrowings &quot;from the poem of Alexander Neckam &quot;De Vita Monachomm&quot;, from the &quot;Speculum Stultorum&quot;, or from the Pantheon, so that in many places the composition is entirely made up of such borrowed matter variously arranged and combined. This is evidently a thing to be noted, because if the author, when describing (for example) the vices of monasteries, is found to be merely quoting from Alexander Neckam, we cannot attach much value to his account as a picture of the manners of his own time.&quot; In addition to the major sources listed above, Pouzet believes other material found in the library of the priory St Mary Overie may have influenced Gower. Gower was familiar with Brunetto Latini&#x27;s &quot;Li Livres dou Trésor&quot;. Shrank suggests that portraying the rebels as lower forms was derived from Cicero&#x27;s claims about civilized societies in &quot;De Inventione&quot;.

==Structure and content==
All books are divided into chapters. Each chapter is preceded by a prose heading which summarizes the chapter. Three books have prologues.

===Book I &quot;Visio Anglie&quot;===
The &quot;Visio&quot; has 2150 lines describing the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. The horrors of 1381 are described in allegorical form and the rebels are condemned. Gower recounts the events of the revolt in &quot;the form of a personal nightmare&quot;. Both &quot;Visio&quot; and &quot;Chronica&quot; &quot;represent a thorough re-creation of historical events, reordered and recombined so as to fulfill the poet&#x27;s own artistic vision and political purpose.&quot; Cornelius remarked that &quot;&quot;Visio Anglie&quot; is distinguished from [other] chronicles, however, by Gower&#x27;s unbridled fictive imagination, beside which the inventions of Walsingham and Froissart appear tame.&quot;
Wickert divides Book I into three sections: 
*Beast Vision (Chapters 2-12 ;first week of June)
*Troy Vision (Chapters 13–15; 13–14 June)
*Ship Vision and Epilogue (Chapters 16–21; 13–15 June)

====Prologue====
Gower provides a traditional prologue by stating the author, subject and purpose. Wickert traced this back to Honorius of Autun&#x27;s commentary on the Song of Solomon. The author is identified by a cryptogram. 
Purpose and subject are covered by:
For I shall write nothing in order that I might be praised, and my performance does not intend that I should have a care for my future reputation. I shall enter the recent misfortunes that my country has exhibited, for it is a worthy labor to report the deeds of one&#x27;s native land.

Wickert made several comments about the Prologue and Chapter 1. This is followed by a twelve line passage with several references to tears. The passage is emotional but only in the antepenultimate line does the word &quot;timor&quot; (fear) appear.
&quot;Thus Gower establishes an important coupling of sorrow and fear for the entire vision&quot;.
Chapter One begins with a description of a spring day and segues into darkness where the dream begins. The daylight start is in the literary tradition of early Chaucer and others. In Biblical tradition, bad news tends to arrive at night. Therefore, Gower was obliged to dream by night.

====Beast Vision (Chapters 2–12; first week of June)====
The revolting peasants are transformed into asses, oxen, swine, dogs, cats, foxes, birds, flies and frogs. The typical model in Chapters 2–6 is that the rabble are transformed into rebellious domestic animals. These animals neglect their normal role of pulling a plow or pursuing a stag. There are usually references to classical animals of that species such as the bulls of Colchis and Minos. There may be one especially fearsome individual such as fire-breathing boar of Chapter 4. The animals have insatiate hunger and terrify people. Exodus 8 supplied the frogs and flies. Chapters 9 and 11 associate specific animals, such as the jackdaw, with the leaders of the revolt. Chapter 10 predicts universal ruin. The rebellious peasants are equated to the companions of Ulysses who were transformed to beasts by Circe. Isaiah is incorrectly cited as the source of Gog and Magog, rather than Ezekiel. The arms borne by the rebels are detailed in Chapter 12.

Novak is more sympathetic to the peasants than was Gower. She observes that the revolt was predicted in Book Five, Chapter 9. Some other chroniclers of the Revolt such as Froissart and Henry Knighton gave voice to the rebels. Wat Tyler &quot;speaks out of character, as an enemy to his own cause&quot; in Chapter 9. &quot;Gower cannot enter into their characters any more than he can write a speech for a pig or a goose.&quot;

Wickert summarized the Beast Vision: Both the individuality and the limitation of Gower&#x27;s talent are shown in the Beast Vision. Describing the Peasants&#x27; Revolt as an animal uprising could have been a significant artistic achievement. Only the rebelling peasants become animals. The free men do not. For this and other reasons this vision is not a beast allegory. Man without reason sins against the divine and natural order; thus a social revolution is also a rebellion against a divine institution. The rebels are possessed by demons and thus condemned to eternal damnation.
&quot;Gower is not writing a class critique, ... but a harsh condemnation which divinely sanctions every action against the peasantry. This is understandable ... but in no way accords with the attitude that Gower adopts in the following books of the &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; and in &quot;Mirrour de l&#x27;Omne&quot;.

====Troy Vision (Chapters 13-15; 13–14 June)====
The legend of Britain&#x27;s founding by Brutus of Troy was known to Gower&#x27;s readers. Three important people are hidden behind Trojan figures (Queen Mother=Hecuba; Richard II=Priam; Archbishop Simon Sudbury=Helenus). Gower suggests that New Troy (Britain) might share the fate of the historic Troy. Chapter 14 contains an accurate description of the beheading of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Trojan image is abandoned in Chapter 15 which emphasizes the rapacity of the peasants. There is some exaggeration particularly when Gower falsely claims: &quot;in their madness they reckoned a church and a brothel as one and the same.&quot;.

====Ship Vision (Chapters 16-19; 13–15 June)====
Chapter 17 introduces the ship as a metaphor for the Tower where the royal party had sought refuge. Wickert observed that the prayer to Christ is a substitute for a classical invocation to Neptune when starting a voyage. The ship is not particularly safe as it is beset by violent storms. The description of the storm and the panic of the captain draws heavily upon the account of Ceyx and Alycone told in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, A Christian prayer follows which is answered in the next chapter. Chapter 19 describes the bloody end of Wat. In Chapter 20, the drifting ship finally arrives in a harbor which is &quot;more oppressive than Scylla&quot;. The dreamer meets an old man who has a rather pessimistic view of lawless, quarrelsome Britain.

Wickert offers several reasons for abandoning the Troy metaphor. Most obvious is that Aeneas and his descendant Brutus came to a much better end than did the city of Troy. She supplies other examples of the ship as metaphor for the state especially the poem &quot;Seldom seen is soon forgot&quot; In this poem Edward III and his son steer the ship, the Duke of Lancaster is the hull and the common people provide the mast. Chapter 18 introduces a monster worse than Scylla and Charybdis. The dreamer reflects that his sufferings were caused by his own sin. Wickert observes that this is the Augustinian view of the prodigal son. The City of God Book XI section 28 expresses this view. Wickert observes: &quot;The idea of peace as the unrealized and unrealizable longing of the poet suffuses the entire &quot;Visio&quot;. It is expressed by &quot;pax, concodia, amor&quot;. The dreamer yearns for peace but a celestial voice advises him to stoically accept perpetual strife on this world. This yearning for peace cannot be satisfied because for the Christian author the soul can never find peace in this world. Not can he find peace in the sense of John 14:27 and 16:33. What Gower has the heavenly voice say is strikingly inadequate and can in no way stand as a solution to the problem.&quot;.

====Epilogue (Chapter 21)====
The dreamer awakens, he thanks God and Mary. The revolting oxen of Chapter 3 have returned to their yokes. Further revolts are predicted. The dreamer apologizes for the length of the dream and says he is compelled to write it all down.

===Book II Prologue===
Macaulay observes this is a short prologue to the following books. Gower argues that the problems of the day are the result of sin rather than fortune. Man should have faith and accept its divine order. Hodgson observed the complaints presented in Books III through V are not original. Wyclif and others made these complaints about the three estates throughout the 14th century. Chaucer, William Langland and Gower presented stock material in poetic form.

===Book III Clergymen===
The conduct of various clergymen especially prelates including the pope is criticized. Priests are also accused of misconduct. Of the 29 chapters only Chapter 27 states that some priests have honour. Fisher made two comments on Book Three. The fact that the shortcomings of the clerics themselves receive such disproportionate attention in the Vox is merely another evidence of its clerical audience. Fisher compared the criticism of Book III with similar passages in &quot;Mirour&quot;. The tone here is &quot;much more legalistic&quot;. The remedy is to subject the clergy to the laws of laymen.

===Book IV Religious Orders===
Book IV deals with the failings of various religious orders including monks, Canons regular, nuns, and mendicant friars. Hodgson observes that Chaucer&#x27;s Friar Huberd in GP 208-269 manages to commit all the sins described by Gower in Chapters 16–23. Chapter 5 begins with the commonplace: &quot;The sea is the proper habitat of a live fish, and the monastery is the right home for a monk.&quot;
Contrast with description of the Monk in General Prologue 177-81:
:He yaf not of the text not a pulled hen
:That saith that hunters been not holy men,
:Ne that a monk, whan he is reccheless,
:Is likened til a fish that is waterless
:(This is to sayn, a monk out of his cloistre);

===Book V Knights, Peasant &amp; Townsmen===
Knights, peasants and town-dwellers are discussed here. 
The first chapter looks back to past when a knight performed his deeds for justice rather than for fame. Several chapters condemn knights who are dominated by love for single women. Condemnation of courtly love which Gower considers adulterous is deferred to Book VII. Chapter 6 begins with a paragraph in praise of good women but segues into a long condemnation of bad women. Chapters 7 and 8 return to praise of the good knight who defends other classes and acts for honor rather than love, money or fame.

Agricultural workers are criticized in Chapters 9 and 10 as lazy, greedy and complaining. Stockton notes Gower reworked Genesis 3:19 to obtain &quot;O sinner, the sweat and toil of the world be thine; in them shalt thou eat thy bread.&quot; Gower argues for divinely ordained labour as alternative to the popular verse: 
:When Adam delved and Eve span,
:Who was then the gentleman?
Chapter 9 contains the passage which foreshadows the Revolt of 1381. The unruly serf is compared to a weed in a field of grain. &quot;Unless it is struck down first, the peasant race strikes against freemen, no matter what nobility or worth they possess.&quot;. Like weeds they should be removed.

Wickert observes:
&quot;Of course, one does not expect sympathies for the agricultural worker, be he bound or free, in a country squire of the time -- even before the Peasants&#x27; Revolt.&quot; Subsequent chapters decry the sins of urban workers and money lenders. Novak counted fifty chapters discussing faults of the clergy versus five chapters on workers.
Chapter 15 begins with a condemnation of a mayor who &quot;kindles malice among his fellow citizens&quot;. John Northampton who &quot;was popular with the poorer classes&quot; is the most probable object of Gower&#x27;s disapprobation. The final chapter censors the talebearer who &quot;utters many slanders in abuse of people&quot;.

===Book VI Lawyers &amp; Advice for a Prince===
The first three chapters are a condemnation of lawyers. Stockton observed: &quot;Chapter 2, which is written with real feeling, ironically places Gower on the same side as the peasants, who hated lawyers and attacked them in the Great Revolt.&quot; Scholars are divided on how Gower obtained his legal knowledge. His translator observed: &quot;The first four chapters of Book VI should effectively dispose of the conjecture that Gower was a lawyer. He condemns them uncompromisingly.&quot;
Meindl argues that Gower only condemns false lawyers. Fisher observes that Gower &quot;emphasizes legal justice and regal responsibility&quot;.

What Wickert calls the &quot;Mirror for a Prince&quot; runs from Chapter 7 to Chapter 18. Much of the advice is created from contemporary truisms and thus not need a systematic foundation. The king must govern himself and be governed by law. Much of the advice is a conventional catalog of virtues.
The damage to a kingdom which can be inflicted by a wicked leader is discussed in Chapter 7. The pleas for justice lacks conceptual clarity and is permeated with ideas from the Bible and Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot; Bad counsel from elders given to the boy king was condemned in the first version. The final version blames youthful comrades instead. Ayers asserts the praise of the Black Prince&#x27;s foreign exploits in Chapter 13 contradicts the notion of Gower as a pacifist follower of Christ. Fisher takes a more balanced view than Ayers. The account of the
earlier English successes on the Continent takes on a heroic ring, but Gower concludes that the Black Prince&#x27;s real
accomplishment was that he kept the peace at home: “The land
was quiet under that great prince; no sword terrorized those whom
his hand protected” . So, while “there is a time for
war and a time for peace” , love is a king&#x27;s best
weapon: “Omnia vincit amor, amor est defensio regis” .

The original version (A-text) of Book VI held the boy king blameless for the problems of the kingdom. Gower uses the phrase &quot;high court&quot; which Fisher interprets as a reference to Arundel and the Suffolk. When &quot;Chronica Tripertita&quot; was added in 1397, the introduction and the conclusion were extensively revised. &quot;The King always had an obdurate heart&quot; is the foundation of the revisions. The king is accused of erratic application of the law.

===Book VII 1-8 Sundry Sins===
This sermonizing summary of the preceding five books begins with a reinterpretation of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream of a statue (Daniel 2:31-44) comprising gold, brass, iron and clay segments. In Chapter 2 Gower associates the iron of the statue with misers. A rich man who lacks charity is condemned. The Chapter 3 associates clay with lechery. Stockton observes this is the only place where courtly love (a major theme in Confessio) is mentioned in Vox.
Chapter 8 introduces an idea which Fisher considers a major theme. Man as a &quot;microcosm whose sin taints the cosmos&quot; can be traced back to fourth Lateran Council. This theme first appears in &quot;Mirour&quot;.

===Book VII 9-19 Seven Deadly Sins &amp; Decay of a Corpse===
Chapters 9-17 associate different aspects of the decay of a corpse with the seven deadly sins. The mediation on death which occurs in chapters 9-19 is unusual in medieval literature. Wickert knows of only one other example. The personal and social benefits of righteousness are discussed in Chapters 21 &amp; 22. Chapter 23 summarizes this treatise on the worldly estates.

===Book VII 24-25 Patriotic Conclusion===
Gower&#x27;s &quot;deep love for England&quot; is displayed in Chapter 24. He laments the nations&#x27;s decay due to sin. Chapter 25 is the author&#x27;s apology. The contents are attributed to the &quot;voice of the people&quot; rather than the author&#x27;s ideas. The A-text ended with:
:I am worse than all men; but may the founder 
:of the world grant me relief through a priest. Amen
The B-text replaces this couplet with a prose transition to &quot;Cronica Tripertita&quot;. Macaulay observed that conclusion has been altered to be a fitting form of introduction for the &quot;Chronica Tripertita&quot; which comes in as an appendix added in later years.

==Chronica Tripertita==
Chronica Tripertita is a 1,062 line Latin poem in leonine hexameter. It was published in the manuscripts of Wickert&#x27;s B-text. Fisher summarizes the content as &quot;Lancastrian propaganda under the guise of history.&quot; Three parts deal with different historical events.

The first part treats the events of 1387-88 (Merciless Parliament). &quot;Instead of calling his historical personages by name, Gower follows the literary convention of using heraldic terms, especially those based upon the names of birds and animals.&quot; &quot;the King&#x27;s party are throughout called greedy, treacherous plotters, and the Appellants model Englishmen.&quot;

The second part skips to 1397 where Richard exacted his revenge.

The final parts describes the events of 1399 when Henry supplanted Richard as king. &quot;Gower ... approaches his material directly, with no allegory in his way.&quot;

==Explication==
&quot;Vox Clamantis in Deserto&quot; (&quot;A voice of one crying in the wilderness&quot;) alludes to the Vulgate translation of the Gospel of Mark and of the Gospel of John (where the voice is that of John the Baptist), quoting the Book of Isaiah . The account of this sermon in Luke 3:1-14 provided the outline for Gower&#x27;s original &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; (without &quot;Visio&quot;).

<doc id="1024738" wikidata="Q2047417" url="?curid=1024738" title="Newcastle railway station">
<text>Newcastle station (also known as Newcastle Central and locally as Central Station) is a railway station in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, England, United Kingdom. It is located on the East Coast Main Line, around north of . It is the primary national rail station serving Newcastle upon Tyne and is an interchange for local services provided by the Tyne and Wear Metro network whose Central Station is situated beneath the national rail station. It is the busiest station in Tyne &amp; Wear, as well as the busiest in North East England, and the seventh busiest in Northern England as a whole.

The main line serving the station is the East Coast Main Line from London to Edinburgh via Berwick and Newcastle. TransPennine Express maintains a frequent service to Liverpool and Manchester, and CrossCountry provides services to the West Midlands and South West of England. The station is also on the Durham Coast Line which provides commuter connections to Gateshead, Sunderland, Hartlepool, Stockton, and Middlesbrough. Additionally, the station is served by the Tyne Valley Line to Hexham and Carlisle. Direct destinations from the station include London, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Durham, York, Darlington, Bristol, Reading, Birmingham, Derby and Plymouth.

The station opened in August 1850, as part of the then Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railway and York, Newcastle &amp; Berwick Railway. Now a Grade I listed building, it is located in the city&#x27;s Grainger Town area, to the west of the Castle Keep. In Simon Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot;, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars.

==Construction and opening==

===Conception===
A scheme for a central station was proposed by Richard Grainger and Thomas Sopwith in 1836, but was not built.

The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway had agreed to relinquish their insistence on exclusively using their Redheugh terminus on the south bank of the River Tyne. They agreed with George Hudson on a general station north of the Tyne, near the Spital. Instead of crossing the Tyne by a low level bridge and climbing to the Spital by a rope-worked incline, they would build an extension crossing at Scotswood and approaching on the north bank. They opened this line and a temporary station at Forth, and passenger trains started using that on 1 March 1847.

Hudson, known as the &quot;Railway King&quot; was concentrating on connecting his portfolio of railways so as to join Edinburgh with the English network. His Newcastle and Berwick Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1845, but for the time being it was to use the Newcastle and North Shields Railway&#x27;s station at Carliol Square. Building a crossing of the Tyne was obviously going to be a lengthy process, so that he gave the construction of the general station a low priority. The Tyne crossing became the High Level Bridge.

In February 1846, the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway exerted pressure for the general station to be built, and the architect John Dobson was appointed by Hudson to design it, in association with the engineer T E Harrison, and Robert Stephenson. Gibson Kyle was clerk of works. By now the general alignment of Hudson&#x27;s railways was becoming clear: a main line from the south via Gateshead would approach over the High Level Bridge and enter the general station from the east; the Newcastle and Berwick line would be extended from Carliol Square and also enter from the east; through trains from London to Scotland would reverse in the new station. Newcastle and Carlisle Railway trains would of course enter from the west.

===A definite design===

Dobson produced general plans for the station, now being referred to as the &quot;Central station&quot;, on a broad curve to front Neville Street so as to accommodate the alignment of the approaching railways at east and west. It was to a &quot;Romano-Italien design with ornamental work of the Doric order&quot;. Two through platform lines were shown, with three west end bays and two at the east end. There were to be three train shed roofs with spans of . Extensive offices as well as refreshment facilities were shown, and there was to be a covered carriage drive on the Neville Street side extending from the porte-cochère at each end.

On 7 August 1847 a contract was let for the main part of the work to Mackay and Blackstock, for £92,000 (). A considerable amount of groundworks was necessary on the large site prior to the actual building work.

The work did not progress speedily, and in 1849 Hudson&#x27;s collection of railway companies suffered a financial shock. At a time of more difficult trading and a tighter money market, Hudson&#x27;s personal dealings were exposed as shady. The York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway had been formed by merger of the previous smaller companies, and the YN&amp;BR wished to reduce the financial commitment to the Central Station substantially; hotel accommodation and the covered carriage drive were eliminated. One of the through platforms was also removed from the plan.

As built the site covered three acres and the length of the platform faces was .

===Inaugurated by The Queen===

The train shed proved faster to construct and on 29 August 1850, Queen Victoria visited the station by train and formally opened it. The day was declared a public holiday in Newcastle. The following day YN&amp;BR trains were diverted into the station.

The train shed was, jointly with the Lime Street station in Liverpool, the first to be designed and built in Britain using curved wrought iron ribs to support an arched roof. The large section of the ribs was fabricated using curved web plates specially rolled using bevelled rolls; the novel technique was created by Thomas Charlton of Hawks Crawshay, and was estimated to have saved 14% on the cost of the roof ironwork, compared with cutting rectilinear plates to the curve.

The station was lit by gas; a demonstration of electric arc-lighting was made, but was not at that date a practical possibility for the large station space. The platforms were positioned 15 inches above rail level.

The station was shared from the beginning by the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, which abandoned its earlier terminus at to the east which had operated since 1839. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway started using Central station from 1 January 1851, and also abandoned its earlier terminus at Forth.

In 1861, the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway had already merged with others to form the North Eastern Railway, and now it was desired to amalgamate with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway too. The Corporation of Newcastle used the opportunity of the necessary Parliamentary Bill for the amalgamation to insist on construction of the abandoned porte-cochère, and this was designed by Thomas Prosser and completed in 1863.

===Expansion of the station===
In the 1860s, the passenger train service was increasing considerably, especially as branch lines opened, six platforms were increased to nine in 1871 and to twelve in 1877, and then to fifteen in 1894: an additional through island platform was provided in 1871, occupying space formerly in use for stabling carriages. Increase in traffic continued, as also increasing train lengths and it was clear that a major extension of the station was essential. Newcastle had been given city status in 1882 and was supportive of the work, seeing it as a civic improvement. Forth Street was displaced southwards and two new trainshed roofs covered a southward extension of the station; in addition a large expansion to the east took place, with additional bay platforms there on the north side of the former bays. The original through track was blocked to form east and west bays, so that there were still only three through platform lines. This work was completed in 1894.

The new group of bay platforms at the east end had their own concourse quadrangle, known at the time as the &quot;Tynemouth Square&quot;. There was a separate booking hall for those local services. At this stage the roof covered seven and a half acres in area; there were fifteen platforms with a length of .

===Killingworth Billy===
In 1901 an early steam locomotive was on display at the station:

[The station] is further graced by a pedestal on which stands a curious old locomotive rejoicing in the name of &quot;Billy&quot;. The true early history of &quot;Billy&quot; is well-nigh veiled in the mists of antiquity, and it was only by diligent enquiry that Mr Holliday, the Station Master, was able to learn a little of her antecedents. That &quot;she&quot; was constructed as far back as 1824 – 1826 is however certain, and on that score alone she is entitled to an introduction to such of the readers of the Railway Magazine as have until now been unaware of her existence. For about fifty-five years (until 1879) she performed good service, first at the Springwell, and latterly at the Killingworth colliery, from which place she actually steamed into Newcastle in 1881 to celebrate George Stephenson&#x27;s Centenary.

An image of the locomotive in Bywell&#x27;s article is captioned &quot;Puffing billy&quot; but it is not Puffing Billy of 1814, which is currently on display at the Science Museum in London.

The locomotive in Bywell&#x27;s article is known simply as Billy (Built in 1826). It was presented to Newcastle upon Tyne Corporation for preservation in 1881. Initially it was displayed on a plinth at the north end of the High Level Bridge, but was moved to the interior of Newcastle Central Station in 1896; it remained there until 1945, when it was moved to the city&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry; it was moved again in 1981 to the Stephenson Railway Museum in nearby North Shields, where it is still on display.

The early history of the locomotive is uncertain; it is probably a George Stephenson locomotive, and was probably built at Killingworth Colliery workshops around 1815–1820.

===The twentieth century===

In 1900 the North Eastern Railway started replacing the gas lighting in the station with electric arc equipment. Further use of electricity came from 1904 when several suburban lines were electrified using the third rail system, to form the Tyneside Electrics system, electric trains were introduced, using Central Station from 1 July 1904. The tracks on platforms 1 to 6 were equipped with electrified third rails, and platform 7 was later electrified to handle electric trains to .

Another major development came on 1 October 1906 when the King Edward VII Bridge was opened, crossing the Tyne to the south-west of the station: Since 1850 East Coast Main Line trains had entered Newcastle from the south via the High Level Bridge to the south-east, this meant however that they had to reverse in order to continue their journey, which lengthened journey times and led to congestion at the busy junction east of the station. The four-track King Edward Bridge remedied this by allowing north–south trains to leave or enter from either side of the station. The triangular junction at the Gateshead side also allowed for greater flexibility, allowing trains from to use the new bridge if necessary.

In 1909, Central station became Newcastle&#x27;s only major city-centre station when the former Blyth and Tyne Railway&#x27;s terminus at was closed, and its trains diverted to Central station via a new connection to station.

====Metro station====
The Tyne and Wear Metro system opened in 1980, taking over and improving many of the Tyneside suburban routes that had declined under British Railways management. The underground Central Station for Metro trains was constructed during the late 1970s underneath the main line station, and opened in 1981. Part of the porte-cochère was temporarily dismantled while excavation work took place. The Metro system was a considerable success; Many conventional rail services were transferred there, and several of the east end bays were closed and converted to car parking and other usage. The Carlisle line was diverted in 1982 to enter Newcastle over the King Edward Bridge of 1906, and a large out-of-town shopping development, the Metro Centre, was opened with a station on that line in 1987. The changing pattern of railway services meant that terminating trains were significantly fewer and through trains had increased. The emphasis on bay platforms at the station was no longer appropriate.

The opportunity was taken in conjunction with the East Coast Main Line electrification scheme, inaugurated in 1991 by British Rail, to extend the station southwards to provide more through platforms. This encroached on to land occupied by through tracks previously used by goods trains, which had seen little use since the withdrawal of many goods services in the 1960s. A new island platform was provided, built around the southern wall of the station. The two platform faces are divided so as to provide four numbered platforms, 5 to 8, generally used for local trains.

==Future==
=== Proposed &quot;Northumberland Line&quot; to Ashington ===

Proposals to reintroduce passenger rail services between Newcastle Central Station and the communities of south east Northumberland have been discussed since the 1990s. In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council became interested in the proposals, commissioning Network Rail to complete the first study into the feasibility of the scheme in June 2013. This was followed by a more detailed study, commissioned in June 2015, which confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day-a-week passenger service between Newcastle Central and Ashington was feasible and could provide economic benefits of £70million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034.

Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to develop the project, encouraged by the Department for Transport&#x27;s November 2017 report, &quot;A Strategic Vision for Rail&quot;, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. More detailed plans were announced in July 2019 which would have split the project into four phases to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. The initial phase, at an estimated £90million, would have seen the creation of new or reopened National Rail stations at Northumberland Park (for interchange with the Tyne and Wear Metro), , and and several other infrastructure upgrades undertaken to allow an hourly passenger train to be provided between them and Newcastle. Two further stations, at and Blyth Bebside were to be added in Phase 2 and other infrastructure upgrades would follow in Phases 3 and 4 to enable the frequency to be doubled to half-hourly. In August 2020, it was reported that these four proposed phases might be merged into a single one.

The Department for Transport allocated an initial grant of £1.5million towards the project costs in January 2020 which was supplemented by an allocation of £10million of funds from Northumberland County Council the following month. This funding enabled detailed on-site ground investigation works to begin in October 2020. The allocation of a further £34million of UK Government funding for the project in January 2021 enables the necessary land to be purchased, detailed designs to be prepared and some early preparatory and site works to begin. In January 2021, it was anticipated that the UK Government would fund the remainder of the project cost, estimated at £166million as of January 2021, once the final phase of design works were completed. However, in April 2021, it was reported that government officials were seeking to reduce the cost of the project as part of the Department for Transport&#x27;s &quot;Project SPEED&quot; initiative. It was reported that the cost-saving measures under consideration included and cutting initial service frequencies from two to one trains per hour and dropping the proposed Blyth Bebside station from initial project scope (although the latter option was later publicly ruled out by Minister for Railways Chris Heaton-Harris).

Northumberland County Council submitted a Transport and Works Act Order application to the Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps on 26 May 2021, under which they would be conferred certain additional powers deemed necessary for the new stations to be constructed and the line upgraded to carry regular passenger services. It is anticipated that the main construction phase might begin as early as June 2022, enabling an opening date in 2024.

==Layout and platforms==

The station currently has 11 operational platforms.

*Platform 1: A bay platform facing east, serving terminating Northern Trains services from the East Coast Main Line. Following the May 2019 timetable change, this platform is used less frequently, as most Northern Trains services from Morpeth now continue west along the Tyne Valley line.
*Platform 2: The main through platform for CrossCountry and LNER services heading north along the East Coast Main Line towards Edinburgh Waverley.
*Platforms 3 &amp; 4: The main through platforms for CrossCountry services heading towards Sheffield, Birmingham New Street, the South West and the South Coast, and LNER services heading south along the East Coast Main Line towards London King&#x27;s Cross. These platforms are also (less frequently) used by services heading north along the East Coast Main Line, as well as by services terminating at Newcastle.
*Platforms 5–8: The four platforms all share the newer island platform, mainly used by Northern Trains services heading west along the Tyne Valley line towards Hexham and Carlisle, and east along the Durham Coast Line towards Sunderland, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough.
*Platforms 9–11: Three bay platforms facing west. Platforms 9 &amp; 10 are used by Northern Trains services heading west along the Tyne Valley line. Platform 11 is used by CrossCountry services towards Birmingham New Street, the South West and the South Coast and TransPennine Express services towards Liverpool Lime Street railway station and Manchester stations.

The former Platform 12 was mainly used by CrossCountry services terminating at Newcastle. It was closed in May 2023 to allow track and signalling modifications which enabled longer trains to occupy the adjacent platform 11.

==Station redevelopment==
Plans were revealed on 30 April 2013 for a major redevelopment, including an £8.6million project to regenerate the inside of the station, and a further £11.4million to develop the area surrounding the station. The portico redevelopment was completed in April 2014.

The redevelopment plans contained a number of changes, including:

*New retail space in the portico area, which was glazed to provide weather protection as well as retail units replacing the existing ticket office and travel centre. This double the previous retail space to make it equivalent to that of King&#x27;s Cross Station.
*The travel centre and ticket office were reduced in size and relocated to the area beyond the Sainsbury&#x27;s Local store.
*Improved toilet facilities.
*Clearer signage.
*Increased covered cycle-park space.
*A simpler layout that is claimed to accentuate the grade one listed architecture including the Castle Keep. The line of sight across the concourse was also improved.
*Sand-blasting of the walls and new lighting were fitted.
*Previous access points to the station were moved to make it easier to enter and leave the station.
*Improved waiting rooms.
*Alteration to the existing bridge structure.
*New lifts and escalators.
*New glazed canopies.

The redevelopment plan also included a number of changes to the area surrounding the station, including:

*New taxi rank to the east side of the former portico.
*A two-way cycle track at the west end of Neville Street.
*Change of traffic flow patterns to ease congestion.
*Pedestrian crossings on Neville Street and Grainger Street.
*Pedestrianisation of the car-park space outside the Centurion Pub.
*Wider footways and pavement cafes outside the station.

The work began in May 2013 and was completed during April 2014 by Miller Construction. The station operated as normal throughout the works. The £8.6million funding for the internal station work was provided by the Department for Transport&#x27;s Station Commercial Project Facility Fund. The external works were jointly funded by NE1, Regional Growth Fund and Newcastle City Council.

Writing in his 2017 book &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Stations&quot;, British journalist and author Sir Simon Jenkins described the glazing of the portico and its conversion to retail usage as a “disaster” and ”thoughtless”, saying “What had been epic became anaemic.”

In 2021, a restoration of disused toilet facilities near platform 12, thought to date back to the 1890s, was completed.

==Railway infrastructure==

Trains cross the River Tyne on one of two bridges. The older High Level Bridge south-east of the station, designed by Robert Stephenson opened on 27 September 1849. Its location meant north–south trains had to reverse in the station to continue their journey. The King Edward VII Bridge south-west of the station opened on 10 July 1906 allowing north–south trains to continue without reversing. The two bridges enable the trackwork north and south of the river to form a complete circle, allowing trains to be turned if necessary. The former Gateshead depot, next to the connecting tracks on the south side of the Tyne, mirrored Newcastle station.

The station was noted for its complex set of diamond crossings to the east of the station which facilitated access to the High Level Bridge and northbound East Coast Main Line and was said to be the greatest such crossing in the world. The crossing was the subject of many early-1900s post cards, titled &quot;The Largest Railway Crossing in the World&quot;, photographed from the castle (towards the station), or from the station towards the castle.

The crossing has been simplified in recent years as the opening of the Metro brought about the withdrawal of many heavy-rail suburban services and the closure of the bay platforms they operated from on the north side of the station removing the need for such a complex crossing. Much of this work was carried out in 1988–1989 as part of remodelling and resignalling work associated with ECML electrification. A new island platform on the former goods lines was commissioned as part of this work, with signalling control relocated to the Tyneside IECC on the opposite side of the river. Heaton depot is to the north of the station, on the East Coast Main Line.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 17 August 1951, two electric multiple units experienced a head-on collision after one of them departed against a danger signal. Two people were killed.
*On 19 April 1955, a collision occurred between V2 locomotive 60968 and Fairburn tank locomotive No. 42085 on the diamond crossings. Both locomotives were derailed.
*On 3 July 1961, there was a significant fire inside the station building. The fire, having started in a cable duct at the peak of rush hour, saw the station&#x27;s new signalling system put out of operation, delaying main line trains. Nearly 10,000 square feet of the station&#x27;s roof was destroyed, but luckily no one was hurt.

==Tyne &amp; Wear Metro==

Newcastle station is located above Central metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro, one of five underground stations serving the city centre. Central is an interchange between the Yellow and Green lines, and is the last stop prior to crossing the River Tyne towards Gateshead.

<doc id="1024739" wikidata="Q17143199" url="?curid=1024739" title="Medical examiner">
<text>The medical examiner is an official in some American jurisdictions that investigates deaths that occur under unusual or suspicious circumstances, to perform post-mortem examinations, and in some jurisdictions to initiate inquests. They are necessarily trained in pathology.

In the US, there are two death investigation systems: first, the coroner system based on English law; and second, the medical examiner system, which evolved from the coroner system during the latter half of the 19th century. The type of system varies across jurisdictions, with over 2,000 separate jurisdictions for investigating unnatural deaths. In 2002, 22 states had a medical examiner system, 11 states had a coroner system, and 18 states had a mixed system. Since the 1940s, the medical examiner system has gradually replaced the coroner system and serves about 48% of the US population. The largest medical examiner&#x27;s office in the United States is located in Baltimore, Maryland.

The coroner is not necessarily a medical doctor. They may be a lawyer or a layperson. In the 19th century, the public became dissatisfied with lay coroners and demanded that the coroner be replaced by a physician. In 1918, New York City introduced the office of the Chief Medical Examiner and appointed physicians experienced in the field of pathology. In 1959, the medical subspecialty of forensic pathology was formally certified.

The types of death reportable to the system are determined by federal, state, or local laws. Commonly, these include violent, suspicious, sudden, and unexpected deaths, death when no physician or practitioner was present or treating the decedent, inmates in public institutions, those in custody of law enforcement, deaths during or immediately following therapeutic or diagnostic procedures or deaths due to neglect.

==Duties==
A medical examiner&#x27;s duties vary by location, but typically include:
* investigating human organs like the stomach, liver, and brain
* determining cause of death
* examining the condition of the body
* studying tissue, organs, cells, and bodily fluids
* issuing death certificates
* maintaining death records
* responding to deaths in mass disasters
* working closely with law enforcement
* identifying unknown dead
* performing other functions depending on local law.

In some jurisdictions, a coroner performs these and other duties. It is common for a medical examiner to visit crime scenes or to testify in court. Medical examiners specialize in forensic knowledge and rely on this during their work. In addition to studying cadavers, they are also trained in toxicology, DNA technology and forensic serology (blood analysis). Pulling from each area of knowledge, a medical examiner is an expert in determining a cause of death. This information can help law enforcement solve cases and is crucial to their ability to track criminals in the event of a homicide or other related events.

Within the United States, there is a mixture of coroner and medical examiner systems, and in some states, dual systems. The requirements to hold office vary widely between jurisdictions.

==Qualifications==

===United Kingdom===
In England and Wales, a new statutory Medical Examiner system based in NHS Acute Trusts commenced in 2019 and is expected to be fully operational several years later. A medical examiner is always a medical doctor, whereas a coroner is a judicial officer.

Pilot studies in Sheffield and seven other areas, which involved medical examiners looking at more than 27,000 deaths since 2008, found 25% of hospital death certificates were inaccurate and 20% of causes of death were wrong. Suzy Lishman, president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said it was crucial there was &quot;independent scrutiny of causes of death&quot;.

===United States===
Qualifications for medical examiners in the US vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In Wisconsin, for example, some counties do not require individuals to have any special educational or medical training to hold this office. In most jurisdictions, a medical examiner is required to have a medical degree, although in many there is no requirement for specialized training in pathology. Other jurisdictions have stricter requirements, including additional education in pathology, law, and forensic pathology. Medical examiners are typically appointed officers.

== Education ==
In the United States, medical examiners require extensive training in order to become experts in their field. After high school, the additional schooling may take 11–18 years. They must attend a college or university to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree sufficient for admission to medical school. Biology is usually the most common. A medical degree (MD or DO) is often required to become a medical examiner. To enter medical school, the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) is usually required after which medical school is another four years with the first two dedicated to academics and the rest of the two used to gain clinical experience.

To become experts in pathology, specifically, additional training is required after medical school. The first step is to complete pathological forensic training. This usually consists of anatomic and clinical pathology training which takes anywhere from four to five years to complete. After this, the physician may complete an anatomic pathology residency or a fellowship. Before practicing as a medical examiner, the physician must also become board certified through the American Board of Pathology.

== Career ==
The general job outlook for medical examiners in the United States is considered to be excellent. Remuneration varies by location, but it is estimated to average between $105,000 and $500,000.

==Shortage==

In the United States, there are fewer than 500 board-certified forensic pathologists, but the National Commission on Forensic Science estimates the country needs 1,100–1,200 to perform the needed number of autopsies. The shortage is attributed to the nature of the work and the higher pay in other medical specialties. It has caused long delays in some states and resulted in fewer investigations and less thorough investigations in some cases.

<text>D-Link Systems, Inc. (formerly Datex Systems, Inc.) is a Taiwanese multinational manufacturer of networking hardware and telecoms equipments. It was founded in 1986 and headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan.

== History ==
Datex Systems was founded in 1986 in Taipei, Taiwan.

In 1992, the company changed its name to D-Link.

D-Link went public and became the first networking company on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994. It is now also publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1988, D-Link released the industry&#x27;s first peer-to-peer LANSmart Network Operating System, able to run concurrently with early networking systems such as Novell&#x27;s NetWare and TCP/IP, which most small network operating systems could not do at the time.

In 2007, it was the leading networking company in the small to medium business (SMB) segment worldwide, with a 21.9% market share. In March 2008, it became the market leader in Wi-Fi product shipments worldwide, with 33% of the total market. In 2007, the company was featured in the &quot;Info Tech 100&quot; list of the world&#x27;s best IT companies. It was also ranked as the ninth best IT company in the world for shareholder returns by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;. In the same year, D-Link released one of the first WiFiCertified802.11n draft 2.0 Wi-Fi routers (DIR-655), which subsequently became one of the most successful draft 802.11n routers.

In May 2013, D-Link released its flagship draft 802.11ac Wireless AC1750 Dual-Band Router (DIR-868L), which at that point had attained the fastest-ever wireless throughput as tested by blogger Tim Higgins.

In April 2019, D-Link was named Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Wired and Wireless LAN Access Infrastructure.

In June 2020, D-Link joined the Taiwan Steel Group.

In 2021, D-Link announced that it had become the agent for international information security brand Cyberbit in Taiwan, and it launched the new EAGLE PRO AI series transforming home Wi-Fi experiences.

In 2022, D-Link obtained the TRUSTe Privacy seal, certification of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and BS 10012. It also obtained the GHG Part 1 certification of ISO 14064-1 2018. Moreover, D-Link established the &quot;D-Link Group Scholarship&quot; with National Taiwan University of Science and Technology to encourage foreign students to study in Taiwan.

=== Examples of D-Link products ===

== Controversies ==

=== Backdoors ===

D-Link systematically includes backdoors in their equipment that compromise its users security. One of the prominent examples is xmlset_roodkcableoj28840ybtide, which contains the substring roodkcab, which is the word backdoor written backwards.

In January 2013, version v1.13 for the DIR-100 revA was reported to include a backdoor in the firmware. By passing a specific user agent in an HTTP request to the router, normal authentication is bypassed. It was reported that this backdoor had been present for some time. This backdoor however was closed soon after with a security patch issued by the company.

In 2024-06-17 information about CVE-2024-6045 backdoor was disclosed.

=== Vulnerabilities ===

In January 2010, it was reported that HNAP vulnerabilities had been found on some D-Link routers. D-Link was also criticized for their response which was deemed confusing as to which models were affected and downplayed the seriousness of the risk. However the company issued fixes for these router vulnerabilities soon after.

Computerworld reported in January 2015 that ZynOS, a firmware used by some D-Link routers (as well as ZTE, TP-Link, and others), are vulnerable to DNS hijacking by an unauthenticated remote attacker, specifically when remote management is enabled. Affected models had already been phased out by the time the vulnerability was discovered and the company also issued a firmware patch for affected devices for those still using older hardware.

Later in 2015, it was reported that D-Link leaked the private keys used to sign firmware updates for the DCS-5020L security camera and a variety of other D-Link products. The key expired in September 2015, but had been published online for seven months. The initial investigation did not produce any evidence that the certificates were abused.

Also in 2015, D-Link was criticized for more HNAP vulnerabilities, and worse, introducing new vulnerabilities in their &quot;fixed&quot; firmware updates.

On 5 January 2017, the Federal Trade Commission sued D-Link for failing to take reasonable steps to secure their routers and IP cameras, as D-Link marketing was misleading customers into believing their products were secure. The complaint also says security gaps could allow hackers to watch and record people on their D-Link cameras without their knowledge, target them for theft, or record private conversations. D-Link has denied these accusations and has enlisted Cause of Action Institute to file a motion against the FTC for their &quot;baseless&quot; charges. On 2 July 2019, the case was settled with D-Link not found to be liable for any of the alleged violations. D-Link agreed to continue to make security enhancements in its software security program and software development, with biennial, independent, third-party assessments, approved by the FTC.

On 18 January 2021 Sven Krewitt, researcher at Risk Based Security, discovered multiple pre-authentication vulnerabilities in D-Link&#x27;s DAP-2020 Wireless N Access Point product. D-Link confirmed these vulnerabilities in a support announcement and provided a patch to hot-fix the product&#x27;s firmware.

In April 2024, D-Link acknowledged a security vulnerability that affected all hardware revisions of four models of network attached storage devices. Because the products have reached their end of service life date, the company stated in a release that the products are no longer supported and that a fix would not be offered.

=== Server misuse ===
In 2006, D-Link was accused of NTP vandalism, when it was found that its routers were sending time requests to a small NTP server in Denmark, incurring thousands of dollars of costs to its operator. D-Link initially refused to accept responsibility. Later, D-link products were found also to be abusing other time servers, including some operated by the US military and NASA. However, no malicious intent was discovered, and eventually D-Link and the sites owner Poul-Henning Kamp were able to agree to an amicable settlement regarding access to Kamp&#x27;s GPS.Dix.dk NTP Time Server site, with existing products gaining authorized access to Kamp&#x27;s server.

=== GPL violation ===

On 6 September 2006, the gpl-violations.org project prevailed in court litigation against D-Link Germany GmbH regarding D-Link&#x27;s inappropriate and copyright infringing use of parts of the Linux kernel. D-Link Germany GmbH was ordered to pay plaintiff&#x27;s costs. Following the judgement, D-Link agreed to a cease and desist request, ending distribution of the product, and paying legal costs.

<text>Sundøya is a village in Leirfjord Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The village is located about south of the village of Leland. Sundøya has a population of about 120 people. It is located on the north side of the Vefsnfjorden on the northeastern part of the island of Alsta, east of the Seven Sisters mountains, which isolate it from the rest of the island. Since Sundøy is surrounded by mountains and water, it was only accessible by boat until 2003 when the Sundøy Bridge was built, providing a road connection to the mainland of Leirfjord Municipality.

<text>In Sumerian mythology, a me (; Sumerian: ; ) is one of the decrees of the divine that is foundational to Sumerian religious and social institutions, technologies, behaviors, mores, and human conditions that made Mesopotamian civilization possible. They are fundamental to the Sumerian understanding of the relationship between humanity and the gods.

==Mythological origin and nature==
The &quot;me&quot;s were originally collected by Enlil and then handed over to the guardianship of Enki, who was to broker them out to the various Sumerian centers, beginning with his own city of Eridu and continuing with Ur, Meluhha, and Dilmun. This is described in the poem, &quot;Enki and the World Order&quot; which also details how he parcels out responsibility for various crafts and natural phenomena to the lesser gods. Here the &quot;me&quot;s of various places are extolled but are not themselves clearly specified, and they seem to be distinct from the individual responsibilities of each divinity as they are mentioned in conjunction with specific places rather than gods. After a considerable amount of self-glorification on the part of Enki, his daughter Inanna comes before him with a complaint that she has been given short shrift on her divine spheres of influence. Enki does his best to placate her by pointing out those she does in fact possess.

There is no direct connection implied in the mythological cycle between this poem and that which is our main source of information on the &quot;me&quot;s, &quot;Inanna and Enki: The Transfer of the Arts of Civilization from Eridu to Uruk&quot;, but once again Inanna&#x27;s discontent is a theme. She is the tutelary deity of Uruk and desires to increase its influence and glory by bringing the &quot;me&quot;s to it from Eridu. She travels to Enki&#x27;s Eridu shrine, the &quot;E-abzu&quot;, in her &quot;boat of heaven&quot;, and asks the &quot;me&quot;s from him after he is drunk, whereupon he complies. After she departs with them, he comes to his senses and notices they are missing from their usual place, and on being informed what he did with them attempts to retrieve them. The attempt fails and Inanna triumphantly delivers them to Uruk.

The Sumerian tablets never actually describe what any of the &quot;mes&quot; look like, but they are clearly represented by physical objects of some sort. Not only are they stored in a prominent location in the &quot;E-abzu&quot;, but Inanna is able to display them to the people of Uruk after she arrives with them in her boat. Some of them are indeed physical objects such as musical instruments, but many are technologies like &quot;basket weaving&quot; or abstractions like &quot;victory&quot;. It is not clarified in the poem how such things can be stored, handled, or displayed.

Not all of the &quot;me&quot;s are admirable or desirable traits. Alongside functions like &quot;heroship&quot; and &quot;victory&quot; are &quot;the destruction of cities&quot;, &quot;falsehood&quot;, and &quot;enmity&quot;. The Sumerians apparently considered such evils and sins an inevitable part of humanity&#x27;s experience in life, divinely and inscrutably decreed, and not to be questioned.

==List of &quot;me&quot;s==
Although more than one hundred &quot;me&quot;s appear to be mentioned in the latter myth, and the entire list is given four times, the tablets upon which it is found are so fragmentary that we have only a little over sixty of them. In the order given, they are:

<text>A laborer (or labourer) is a person who works in manual labor typed within the construction industry. There is a generic factory laborer which is defined separately as a factory worker. Laborers are in a working class of wage-earners in which their only possession of significant material value is their labor. Industries employing laborers include building things such as roads, road paving, buildings, bridges, tunnels, pipelines civil and industrial, and railway tracks. Laborers work with blasting tools, hand tools, power tools, air tools, and small heavy equipment, and act as assistants to tradesmen as well such as operators or cement masons. The 1st century BC engineer Vitruvius writes that a good crew of laborers is just as valuable as any other aspect of construction. Other than the addition of pneumatics, laborer practices have changed little. With the introduction of field technologies, the laborers have been quick to adapt to the use of this technology as being laborers&#x27; workforce.

==Tools and equipment==
The following tools are considered a minimum for a laborer to keep with them: hammer, pliers w/ side-cutters, utility knife, tape measure, locking pliers, crescent wrench, screwdriver, margin trowel, carpenter&#x27;s pencil or soapstone, tool belt and one pouch (bag). In addition: a five gallon bucket with additional tools, toolbelt suspenders, water jug and lunchbox are recommended.

Most safety equipment that is consumed or work specific, for example hard hat, safety glasses, hearing protection, gloves, fall protection, high-visibility clothing, concrete boots, respirator/dust mask and toe guards are provided by the employer as part of construction site safety.

Personal safety equipment, for example, full leather boots (some long-time laborers believe steel toes are dangerous on the construction site; it is better to have crushed toes than toes cut off by the crushed steel - a belief proven wrong by several studies), high-strength pants - canvas or denim (some modify thighs with a sacrificial second layer of jean fabric cut from an old pair) - socks, lip balm, and climate-specific outerwear, are provided by the individual (unless laborers are instructed to work in a climate different from what they typically reside in, for example, high elevation).

==Types of work==
Some of the work done by laborers includes:

*concrete – shotcrete, gunite, grouting and formwork
*demolition – concrete cutting, pavement breaking, cutting and removal of interior building parts (framing members, doors, windows, wiring, piping, etc.)
*environmental remediation and hazardous waste
*fences and landscaping
*Mowing and keeping construction site free of weeds
*street sweeping
*Cleaning of the construction site and trash removal
*Setting up temporary lights, heaters and other things needed on site
*hod carrier – masonry, plasterers and fireproofing
*paving – white paving formwork, traffic control, striping, signs
*piping – water pipe, sewer and storm drain
*field technology
*general digging and grading
*tunnels – drilling and blasting
*Dry utilities – Electrical and communications conduit
*loading and offloading – handling of physical goods, such as construction materials

==Pay==

As a manual labor occupation, to attract free workers the wages paid to laborers are higher than those paid in general to other types of unskilled workers (see dirty, dangerous and demeaning). In the United States, a union laborer earns equal or greater than most work available to anyone with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. This is one of a few fields where someone without a high school diploma can still earn a living wage. Union, heavy construction and highway construction laborers earn on average (2008 US) $25.47/h compared to 13.72/h for non-union laborers. In addition to paid earnings, union laborers enjoy the benefits of medical insurance, vacation pay, pension plans, representation and vocational schools; totaling $45/hr (2012 US) and some with special skills earn &#x27;over-rate&#x27; wages. It is not uncommon for young civil engineers, construction managers and construction engineers typical salary of (2007 US$) 40,000 to 60,000 to fall short of their union laborers average wages of 50,000 to 80,000.

However, unlike engineers, laborers are not usually employed full-time year-round and face significant hazards. The additional pay laborers receive is often balanced out by the lesser unemployment checks they receive while out of work and the disability checks they receive while injured—often debilitated for life. That is if unemployment and injury insurance is provided, which is often not the case unless they are labor union members. Engineers are also not immune to being out of work. In heavy civil work, some are employed on a project basis and mental injuries due to stress are a different but debilitating hazard. Because of the wide range of skills and ability to simply provide muscle, laborers often earn side-work as independent contractors and &quot;under-the-table&quot; work.

In construction, the pay for laborers is low enough that planning problems can be solved by &quot;throwing laborers at it.&quot; This can become a toxic and dangerous brew of unplanned work that slides forward on the blood and sweat of hard-working laborers—injury rates often soar. The value of work put in place by laborers and the value of avoided rework and increased efficiencies produced by the engineers&#x27; planning is a balance of resource utilization on any large project.

==Hazards and conditions==
There are dangers associated with laboring. Many laborers are severely injured or killed in accidents each year while performing work duties. Many who work as laborers for even a short period of time will suffer from permanent work injuries such as: hearing loss, arthritis, osteoarthritis, back injuries, eye injury, head injury, chemical burn (lime sensitivity), lung disease, missing fingernails and skin scars. Alcoholism, drug use, and drug abuse are common although most companies require drug screening for all new hires. If a laborer is injured on the job they are immediately given a drug test. If the test results are positive then they are ineligible for any Workers&#x27; compensation benefits. There is a gray area for the use of marijuana due to medical marijuana prescriptions. Some who have been dismissed for failing a drug test while possessing a prescription have been later reinstated with pay as having been wrongfully terminated.

== Collective bargaining ==

The Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America (LIUNA) represents laborers on public and private projects in North America. Some of the business representatives are laborers who have been so severely injured they can no longer labor. With a phone call and a good reason they will be on-site the next morning asking questions and demanding apologies for mistreatment of laborers.

<text>Sir Rudolf Ernst Peierls, (; ; 5 June 1907 – 19 September 1995) was a German-born British physicist who played a major role in Tube Alloys, Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapon programme, as well as the subsequent Manhattan Project, the combined Allied nuclear bomb programme. His 1996 obituary in &quot;Physics Today&quot; described him as &quot;a major player in the drama of the eruption of nuclear physics into world affairs&quot;.

Peierls studied physics at the University of Berlin, at the University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld, the University of Leipzig under Werner Heisenberg, and ETH Zurich under Wolfgang Pauli. After receiving his DPhil from Leipzig in 1929, he became an assistant to Pauli in Zurich. In 1932, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, which he used to study in Rome under Enrico Fermi, and then at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge under Ralph H. Fowler. Because of his Jewish background, he elected to not return home after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, but to remain in Britain, where he worked with Hans Bethe at the Victoria University of Manchester, then at the Mond Laboratory at Cambridge. In 1937, Mark Oliphant, the newly appointed Australian professor of physics at the University of Birmingham recruited him for a new chair there in applied mathematics.

In March 1940, Peierls co-authored the Frisch–Peierls memorandum with Otto Robert Frisch. This short paper was the first to set out that one could construct an atomic bomb from a small amount of fissile uranium-235. Until then it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium, and consequently was impractical to build and use. The paper was pivotal in igniting the interest of first the British and later the American authorities in nuclear weapons. He was also responsible for the recruitment of his compatriot Klaus Fuchs to work on Tube Alloys, as the British nuclear weapons project was called, which resulted in Peierls falling under suspicion when Fuchs was exposed as a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950.

After the war, Peierls returned to the University of Birmingham, where he worked until 1963, and then was the Wykeham Professor of Physics and a Fellow of New College at the University of Oxford until he retired in 1974. At Birmingham he worked on nuclear forces, scattering, quantum field theories, collective motion in nuclei, transport theory and statistical mechanics, and was a consultant to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. He received many awards, including a knighthood in 1968, and wrote several books including &quot;Quantum Theory of Solids&quot;, &quot;The Laws of Nature&quot; (1955), &quot;Surprises in Theoretical Physics&quot; (1979), &quot;More Surprises in Theoretical Physics&quot; (1991) and an autobiography, &quot;Bird of Passage&quot; (1985). Concerned with the nuclear weapons he had helped to unleash, he worked on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was President of the Atomic Scientists&#x27; Association in the UK, and was involved in the Pugwash movement.

==Early life==
Rudolf Ernst Peierls was born in the Berlin suburb of Oberschöneweide, the youngest of three children of Heinrich Peierls an electrical engineer, from a family of Jewish merchants. His father was the managing director of a cable factory of Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), and his mother was his father&#x27;s first wife, Elisabeth ( Weigert). Rudolf had an older brother, Alfred, and an older sister, Annie. His mother died from Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in 1921, and his father married Else Hermann, the sister-in-law of the playwright Ludwig Fulda. The family was Jewish, but assimilated, and Peierls and his siblings were baptised as Lutherans. When he came of age, Peierls left the church.

Peierls commenced school a year late because he needed glasses, and his parents did not trust him not to lose them or break them. After two years at the local preparatory school, he entered his local &quot;gymnasium&quot;, the , where he spent the next nine years, passing his &quot;abitur&quot; examinations in 1925. He wanted to study engineering, but his parents, who doubted his practical abilities, suggested physics instead. He entered the University of Berlin, where he listened to lectures by Max Planck, Walther Bothe and Walther Nernst. Fellow students included Kurt Hirsch and Käte Sperling. The physics laboratory classes were overcrowded, so the first year students were encouraged to take theoretical physics courses instead. Peierls found that he liked the subject.

In 1926 Peierls decided to transfer to the University of Munich to study under Arnold Sommerfeld, who was considered to be the greatest teacher of theoretical physics. Fellow students there included Hans Bethe, Hermann Brück and William V. Houston. At the time, the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was being overturned by the new quantum mechanics of Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac. In 1928, Sommerfeld set off on a world tour. On his advice, Peierls moved to the University of Leipzig, where Heisenberg had been appointed to a chair in 1927.

Heisenberg set Peierls a research project on ferromagnetism. It was known that this was caused by the spin of the electrons in the metal aligning; but the reason for this was unknown. Heisenberg suspected that it was caused by a quantum mechanical effect, caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. Peierls was unable to develop the theory, but work on Hall effect was more productive. The anomalous Hall effect could not be explained with the classical theory of metals, and Heisenberg sensed an opportunity to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could explain it. Peierls was able to do so, resulting in his first published paper.

Heisenberg left in 1929 to lecture in America, China, Japan and India, and on his recommendation Peierls moved on to ETH Zurich, where he studied under Wolfgang Pauli. Pauli set him a problem of investigating the vibration of atoms in a crystal lattice. Peierls explored—and named—the phenomenon of umklapp scattering. He submitted this work as his DPhil thesis, &quot;Zur kinetischen Theorie der Wärmeleitung in Kristallen&quot; (On the Kinetic Theory of Heat Conduction in Crystals), which was accepted by the University of Leipzig in 1929. His theory made specific predictions of the behaviour of metals at very low temperatures, but another twenty years would pass before the techniques were developed to confirm them experimentally.

==Early career==
Peierls accepted an offer from Pauli to become his assistant in place of Felix Bloch. Lev Landau was there at this time on a scholarship from the government of the Soviet Union, and Peierls and Landau became friends. They collaborated on deriving a series of wave equations similar to the Schrödinger equation for photons. Unfortunately, their equations, while complicated, were nonsensical. In 1930, Peierls travelled to the Netherlands to meet Hans Kramers, and to Copenhagen to meet Niels Bohr.

In August 1930 Pauli and Peierls attended a physics congress in Odessa and met a young physics graduate, Eugenia (Genia) Nikolaievna Kannegiesser, who, like Landau, came from Leningrad. Since he did not speak Russian and she did not speak German, they conversed in English. During a subsequent visit by Peierls to lecture in Leningrad they were married on 15 March 1931. However, she had to wait for a passport and exit visa. They finally left for Zürich that summer. They had four children: Gaby Ellen (b.1933), Ronald Frank (b.1935), Catherine (Kitty; b.1948), and Joanna (b.1949).

Peierls assisted Egon Orowan in understanding the force required to move a dislocation which would be expanded on by Frank Nabarro and called the Peierls–Nabarro force. In 1929, he studied solid-state physics in Zurich under the tutelage of Heisenberg and Pauli. His early work on quantum physics led to the theory of positive carriers to explain the thermal and electrical conductivity behaviours of semiconductors. He was a pioneer of the concept of &quot;holes&quot; in semiconductors. He established &quot;zones&quot; before Léon Brillouin, despite Brillouin&#x27;s name being currently attached to the idea, and applied it to phonons. Doing this, he discovered the Boltzmann equations for phonons and the umklapp process. He submitted a paper on the subject for his &quot;habilitation&quot;, acquiring the right to teach at German universities. &quot;Physics Today&quot; noted that &quot;His many papers on electrons in metals have now passed so deeply into the literature that it is hard to identify his contribution to conductivity in magnetic fields and to the concept of a hole in the theory of electrons in solids&quot;.

==Academic in exile==
In 1932, Peierls was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship to study abroad, which he used to study in Rome under Enrico Fermi, and then at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England under Ralph H. Fowler. In Rome, Peierls completed two papers on electronic band structure, in which he introduced the Peierls substitution, and derived a general expression for diamagnetism in metals at low temperatures. This provided an explanation of the hitherto mysterious properties of bismuth, in which diamagnetic properties were more pronounced than in other metals.
Due to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany, he elected to not return home in 1933, but to remain in Britain. He declined an offer from Otto Stern of a position at the University of Hamburg. Granted leave to remain in Britain, he worked at the Victoria University of Manchester with funding from the Academic Assistance Council, which had been set up to help academic refugees from Germany and other fascist countries. Most of his immediate family also left Germany; his brother and his family settling in Britain, and his sister and her family, along with his father and stepmother, moved to the United States, where his uncle Siegfried lived.

Peierls collaborated with Bethe on photodisintegration and the statistical mechanics of alloys when challenged by James Chadwick. Their results still serve as the basis for mean-field theories of structural phase changes in complete alloys. Although most of his work continued to be about the electron theory of metals, he also looked at Dirac&#x27;s hole theory, and co-wrote a paper with Bethe on the neutrino. The University of Manchester awarded him a D.Sc. degree. Moving back to Cambridge, he worked with David Shoenberg at the Mond Laboratory on superconductivity and liquid helium. To allow him to lecture, in accordance with its rules, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, awarded him an &quot;ex officio&quot; M.A. degree.

In 1936, Mark Oliphant was appointed the professor of physics at the University of Birmingham, and he approached Peierls about a new chair in applied mathematics that he was creating there. (Applied mathematics being what would today be called theoretical physics.) Peierls got the job despite competition from Harrie Massey and . The appointment at last gave Peierls a secure, permanent position. His students included Fred Hoyle and P. L. Kapur, a student from India. With Kapur he derived the dispersion formula for nuclear reactions originally given in perturbation theory by Gregory Breit and Eugene Wigner, but now included generalising conditions. This is now known as the Kapur–Peierls derivation. It is still used, but in 1947 Wigner and Leonard Eisenbud developed a more widely used alternative method. In 1938, Peierls paid visits to Copenhagen, where he collaborated with Bohr and George Placzek on a paper on what is now known as the Bohr–Peierls–Placzek relation. The Second World War broke out before it could be published; but drafts were circulated for comment, and it became one of the most cited unpublished papers of all time.

==Second World War==
===Frisch–Peierls memorandum===
After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Peierls started working on nuclear weapons research with Otto Robert Frisch, a fellow refugee from Germany. Ironically, they were excluded from the work on radar at the University of Birmingham because it was considered too secret for scientists who were enemy aliens. Peierls was naturalised as a British subject on 27 March 1940. He was eager to participate in the fight against fascism and militarism, but the only organisation that would accept him was the Auxiliary Fire Service. He accepted an offer from the University of Toronto to send his two children to live with a family in Canada.

In February and March 1940, Peierls and Frisch co-authored the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which Peierls typed. This short paper was the first to establish that an atomic bomb could be created from a small amount of fissile uranium-235. Based on the information at hand, they calculated that less than 1 kg would be required. The true figure for the critical mass is about four times as large; but until then it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium, and consequently was impractical to build and use. They went on to estimate the size of the explosion, and its physical, military and political effects.

The Frisch–Peierls memorandum was pivotal in igniting the interest of first the British and later the American authorities in atomic weapons. In 1941 its findings made their way to the United States through the report of the MAUD Committee, an important trigger in the establishment of the Manhattan Project and the subsequent development of the atomic bomb. With the Frisch-Peierls memorandum and the MAUD Committee report, the British and American scientists were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible.

As enemy aliens, Frisch and Peierls were initially excluded from the MAUD Committee, but the absurdity of this was soon recognised, and they were made members of its Technical Subcommittee. This did not mean that they were cleared for radar work. When Oliphant made the services of his secretary available for typing up the Peierl&#x27;s and Frisch&#x27;s papers for the MAUD Committee in September 1940, they were not allowed to enter the Nuffield Building where she worked, so Peierls submitted them for typing by dictaphone on wax cylinders. Frisch and Peierls thought at first that uranium enrichment was best achieved through thermal diffusion, but as the difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion, bringing in a fellow refugee from Germany, Franz Simon, as an expert on the subject. Peierls also recruited yet another refugee from Germany, Klaus Fuchs, as his assistant in May 1941.

===Manhattan Project===

As a result of the MAUD Committee&#x27;s findings, a new directorate known as Tube Alloys was created to coordinate the nuclear weapons development effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys. Peierls, Chadwick and Simon were appointed to its Technical Committee, which was chaired by Akers. Its first meeting, in November 1941, was attended by two American visitors, Harold Urey and George B. Pegram. Later that year, Peierls flew to the United States, where he visited Urey and Fermi in New York, Arthur H. Compton in Chicago, Robert Oppenheimer in Berkeley, and Jesse Beams in Charlottesville, Virginia. When George Kistiakowsky argued that a nuclear weapon would do little damage as most of the energy would be expended heating the air, Peierls, Fuchs, Geoffrey Taylor and J. G. Kynch worked out the hydrodynamics to refute this.

The signing of the Quebec Agreement on 19 August 1943 merged Tube Alloys with the Manhattan Project. Akers had already cabled London with instructions that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Simon should leave immediately for North America to join the British Mission to the Manhattan Project, and they arrived the day the agreement was signed. Simon and Peierls were attached to the Kellex Corporation, which was engaged in the K-25 Project, designing and building the American gaseous diffusion plant. While Kellex was located in the Woolworth Building, Peierls, Simon and Nicholas Kurti had their offices in the British supply mission on Wall Street. They were joined there by Tony Skyrme and Frank Kearton, who arrived in March 1944. Kurti returned to England in April 1944 and Kearton in September. Peierls moved on to the Los Alamos Laboratory in February 1944; Skyrme followed in July, and Fuchs in August.

At Los Alamos, the British Mission was fully integrated into the laboratory, and British scientists worked in most of its divisions, being excluded only from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. When Oppenheimer appointed Bethe as the head of the laboratory&#x27;s prestigious Theoretical (T) Division, he offended Edward Teller, who was given his own group, tasked with investigating Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; bomb. Oppenheimer then wrote to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, requesting that Peierls be sent to take Teller&#x27;s place in T Division. Peierls arrived from New York on 8 February 1944, and subsequently succeeded Chadwick as head of the British Mission at Los Alamos.

Peierls also became leader of T-1 (Implosion) Group, and so was responsible for the design of the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon to focus an explosion onto a spherical shape. He sent regular reports to Chadwick, the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project, in Washington, DC. When Groves found out, he asked Peierls to send him reports too. Peierls was one of those present at the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945. He returned to England in January 1946. For his services to the nuclear weapons project, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours, and was awarded the US Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm in 1946.

===Espionage allegations===

Peierls was responsible for the recruitment of Fuchs to the British project, an action which was to result in Peierls falling under suspicion when Fuchs was exposed as a Soviet spy in 1950. In 1999, &quot;The Spectator&quot; garnered outrage from Peierls&#x27;s family when it published an article by journalist Nicholas Farrell that alleged that Peierls was a spy for the Soviet Union. The article was based on information supplied by intelligence historian Nigel West, who identified Peierls as the spy codenamed &quot;Fogel&quot; and later &quot;Pers&quot; in the Venona intercepts, and his wife Genia as the spy codenamed &quot;Tina&quot;. However, the association of Tina with Genia did not fit with what was known about Tina, and she was conclusively revealed to be Melita Norwood in 1999. Nor did Peierls fit Pers, as the latter worked at the Clinton Engineer Works, whereas Peierls did not. In 2009, Vogel/Pers was outed as being actually Russell A. McNutt, a civil engineer employed by the company Kellex to work on facilities at Oak Ridge, who was recruited as a spy by Julius Rosenberg.

There were good reasons for the postwar intelligence agencies to suspect Peierls. He not only had recruited Fuchs, and served as his &quot;sponsor&quot; on recruitment and security matters, but had pressed the authorities for Fuchs to be given a full security clearance without which he could not have assisted Peierls in his work. Fuchs lived with the Peierls family for a time. Peierls had a Russian wife, as did his brother, and he maintained close contact with colleagues in the Soviet Union before and after the Second World War.

While not a communist like Fuchs, Peierls was known to have left-wing political views, and had colleagues with similar views. He was denied a visa to visit the United States to attend a Nuclear Physics Conference in Chicago in 1951. A similar request the following year was granted, but in 1957 the Americans expressed concerns about him, indicating that they were unwilling to share information with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell while he remained as a consultant.

==Post-war==
Physicists were in demand after the war, and Peierls received offers from several universities. He seriously considered an offer of a position at Cambridge from William Lawrence Bragg, but decided to return to Birmingham. He worked on nuclear forces, scattering, quantum field theories, collective motion in nuclei, transport theory, and statistical mechanics. Peierls had largely left solid state physics behind when, in 1953, he began collecting his lecture notes on the subject into a book. Reconsidering the way that the atoms in metal crystals are arranged, he noted an instability. This became known as the Peierls transition.

Peierls built up the physics department at Birmingham by attracting high quality researchers. These included Gerald E. Brown, Max Krook, Tony Skyrme, Dick Dalitz, Freeman Dyson, Luigi Arialdo Radicati di Brozolo, Stuart Butler, Walter Marshal, Stanley Mandelstam and Elliott H. Lieb. An undergraduate school of mathematical physics was created. Peierls delivered the lectures on quantum mechanics, a subject that had not been taught at Birmingham before the war.

In 1946 Peierls became a consultant to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. After Fuchs was dismissed from his position there as head of the Theoretical Physics Division in 1950, Maurice Pryce acted in the position in a part-time capacity, but when he went to America for a year on sabbatical, Peierls took his place. The position was finally filled permanently by Brian Flowers. Peierls resigned from Harwell in 1957 due to what he saw as a lack of openness in security vetting at the request of the Americans, which he felt indicated a lack of trust in him on the part of senior staff; but he was invited to rejoin in 1960, and did so in 1963, remaining as a consultant for another 30 years.

Peierls became the Wykeham Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford in 1963. He remained there until he retired in 1974. He wrote several books including &quot;Quantum Theory of Solids&quot; (1955), &quot;The Laws of Nature&quot; (1955), &quot;Surprises in Theoretical Physics&quot; (1979), &quot;More Surprises in Theoretical Physics&quot; (1991) and an autobiography, &quot;Bird of Passage&quot; (1985). Concerned with the nuclear weapons he had helped to unleash, he worked on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, was President of the Atomic Scientists&#x27; Association in the UK, and was involved in the Pugwash movement, and FREEZE, now known as Saferworld.

Genia died on 26 October 1986. Peierls remained active, although his eyesight deteriorated. In 1994, he suffered a combination of health problems, including heart, kidney and lung problems, and relocated himself to Oakenholt, a nursing home near Farmoor, Oxfordshire. He liked to read scientific papers in enlarged script on a computer screen. During 1995, his health continued to decline, and he required regular kidney dialysis sessions at Churchill Hospital, where he died on 19 September 1995.

==Honours==
Peierls was knighted in the 1968 Birthday Honours. He was awarded the Rutherford Memorial Medal in 1952, the Royal Medal in 1959, the Lorentz Medal in 1962, the Max Planck Medal in 1963, the Guthrie Medal and Prize in 1968, the Matteucci Medal in 1982, and the Enrico Fermi Award from the United States Government for exceptional contribution to the science of atomic energy in 1980.

In 1986, he was awarded the Copley Medal, and delivered the Rutherford Memorial Lecture, and in 1991 he was awarded the Dirac Medal and Prize. On 2 October 2004, the building housing the sub-department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Oxford was formally named the &quot;Sir Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics&quot;.

<text>Winchester &#x27;73 is a 1950 American Western film noir directed by Anthony Mann and starring James Stewart, Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea and Stephen McNally. Written by Borden Chase and Robert L. Richards, the film is set in 1876 in a variety of famed Western locations and follows the journey of a prized rifle from one ill-fated owner to another, as well as a cowboy&#x27;s search for a murderous fugitive. It is the first Western film collaboration between Mann and Stewart, the first of eight films that they made together, and was filmed in black and white. It is also the first film from which an actor received a percentage of the receipts, a practice known as &quot;points&quot;, as compensation.

Among the film&#x27;s cast of supporting actors, Rock Hudson portrays a Native American, and Tony Curtis plays a besieged cavalry trooper, both in minor roles at the beginning of their careers.

The film received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Written American Western. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Lin McAdam and Frankie Wilson are searching for Dutch Henry Brown, with whom Lin has a personal score to settle. They find him in a saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, but cannot fight due to the presence of Sheriff Wyatt Earp. Lin enters the town&#x27;s Centennial shooting contest for a prized Winchester 1873 rifle. Lin wins and goes to his room at the boarding house to pack. There, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and rides away with two cohorts.

Arriving at Riker&#x27;s Bar, they find Native American trader Joe Lamont, who sees the prized Winchester and becomes determined to own it. He raises the prices of his guns and ammunition supply so high that Dutch and his men cannot afford to buy any. Dutch&#x27;s only option is to trade the rifle for Lamont&#x27;s three hundred dollars in gold, plus their pick of weapons. Dutch makes the trade and tries to get the rifle back by gambling the three hundred in a poker game against Lamont, but loses.

Lamont takes his guns to meet Native American buyers, but their leader Young Bull prefers the prized Winchester. When Lamont refuses to sell it, he is robbed and scalped.

Meanwhile, former saloon girl Lola is in a wagon with her fiancé Steve Miller traveling toward a new home. Pursued by Young Bull and his warriors, they realize that they will not be able to outrun them. Panicking, Steve jumps on his horse and rides off to find help. Not far ahead, Steve sees a small encampment of soldiers. He races back for Lola, and together they make it into the soldiers&#x27; camp. That night, Lin and Wilson, chased by the same Native Americans, also ride into the encampment.

The soldiers are new to the territory. Lin gives their sergeant tactical advice for fighting Native Americans, and they prepare for an attack expected early the next morning. After a fierce battle in which Young Bull is killed, the Native Americans leave, and Lin and High-Spade depart to continue searching for Dutch. Unknowingly, they ride past the coveted Winchester where Young Bull had dropped it when he fell. It is found by a trooper, and the Sergeant gives it to Steve.

Steve and Lola reach the Jameson house, which is set to become theirs. He wants her to stay with the Jamesons while he goes to meet outlaw Waco Johnny Dean, but Waco and his men arrive unexpectedly, chased by a posse that surrounds the house. When Waco sees the Winchester, he too covets it. He provokes Steve into a gunfight and kills him. Waco and Lola escape the posse and ride to Dutch&#x27;s hideout. Dutch claims that the rifle is his and forces Waco to return it.

The gang goes to Tascosa, Texas, to commit a robbery. They are joined by Lin and Wilson. Waco attempts to shoot Lin and is killed, while around them, the robbery goes awry and Lola is wounded. Wilson reveals to Lola that Dutch is Lin&#x27;s brother, and that Dutch had robbed a bank and a stagecoach and returned to the family home, hoping to hide out. When their father refused to help him, Dutch shot him in the back, and Lin has sworn revenge.

Lin confronts Dutch on a rocky hill and calls him by his real name, Matthew. They shoot it out on the hill, and Lin kills him, reclaiming the Winchester.

==Cast==

==Production==

The film was originally intended to have been directed by Fritz Lang, but Universal did not want Lang to produce the film through his own company, Diana Productions. Lang&#x27;s idea was for the rifle to be Stewart&#x27;s character&#x27;s only source of strength and his only excuse for living, making the quest for his rifle a matter of life and death.

With Lang out of the picture, Universal produced the film with up-and-coming Anthony Mann, Stewart&#x27;s choice (he had admired &quot;The Furies&quot;), directing. Mann had Borden Chase rewrite the script to instead make the rifle a bone of contention, showing it passing contentiously through the hands of a variety of people.

Mann said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the property; I didn&#x27;t like Winchester at all. This was Lang&#x27;s version. I was working at Metro and everybody was pressuring me to make the film and I said, &#x27;T&#x27;d like to make the film, if you let me rewrite it completely. I want a new writer, new everything; I don&#x27;t want the property the way it is.&#x27; Finally, after a lot of haranguing, they agreed that I could do that and I brought in Borden Chase and we started from scratch on the script and it developed day by day.&quot;

Stewart had wished to make &quot;Harvey&quot; for Universal-International, but the studio could not afford his $200,000 salary ($ in today&#x27;s dollars), so studio head William Goetz offered to allow Stewart to make both &quot;Harvey&quot; and &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; for a percentage of the profits, spread over some time and at a lower capital gain tax rate than a single payment to Stewart would be. Stewart&#x27;s agent Lew Wasserman was able to get his client 50 percent of the profits, eventually amounting to $600,000 from the film&#x27;s unexpected success. Stewart&#x27;s deal also gave him control of the director and co-stars. It is acknowledged as the first confirmed time in the sound era that a film actor received some of the movie&#x27;s receipts as compensation, a practice now called &quot;points&quot;.

===Casting===
Stewart was already cast in the part of Lin McAdam and spent a lot of time practicing with the rifle so that he would look like an authentic Westerner. As Mann later related, &quot;[Stewart] was magnificent walking down a street with a Winchester rifle cradled in his arm. And he was great too actually firing the gun. He studied hard at it. His knuckles were raw with practicing... It was those sorts of things that helped make the film look so authentic, gave it its sense of reality.&quot; An expert marksman from the Winchester company, Herb Parsons, did the trick shooting required for the film and assisted Stewart with his training.

Shelley Winters was cast as a dance-hall girl. Winters did not understand the film, nor think much of her part in it, saying, &quot;Here you&#x27;ve got all these men... running around to get their hands on this goddamn rifle instead of going after a beautiful blonde like me. What does that tell you about the values of that picture? If I hadn&#x27;t been in it, would anybody have noticed?&quot;

The part of Wyatt Earp was given to Will Geer, who was not alone by feeling that he was miscast for the role. Millard Mitchell was cast as High-Spade Frankie Wilson. That same year, Mitchell appeared in &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; starring Gregory Peck. He would appear in another Stewart-Mann Western &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953) as a grizzled old prospector.

Jay C. Flippen appears as cavalry sergeant Wilkes. He would also appear in the second Stewart-Mann Western &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952) with Rock Hudson, who appears in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; as a Native American.

The Stewart and Mann collaboration established a new persona for Stewart, more violent and disillusioned than ever before, but still likable.

=== Locations ===
&quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; was filmed at:
* Mescal, Arizona, U.S.
* Old Tucson, 201 S. Kinney Road, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.
* Backlot, Universal Studios, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, U.S.

==Reception==
As part of the publicity campaign for the release of the film, Universal Pictures sponsored a contest, by placing magazine ads, to find some of the rare remaining &quot;One of One Thousand&quot; Model 1873 Winchester rifles. This resulted in many previously unknown original rifles being brought into the spotlight, and drew public interest to the field of antique gun collecting. The winner of the contest received a new Winchester Model 1894 rifle, for the Model 1873 was out of production at that time.

The film was a financial success, turning a significant profit. It has since gained a reputation as a classic of the Western genre, and durably helped to redefine the public perception of James Stewart.

Contemporary reviews have been enthusiastic. Writing for the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, Martin Chilton gave the movie five stars out of five, and described the film as &quot;the first in a series of Western masterpieces&quot;. In &quot;Empire&quot;, William Thomas calls the film &quot;the marvellously-scripted story of a man and a gun&quot;. He also awarded five stars out of five. The film holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews, with an average of 8.5/10.

==Honors==
The film received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Written American Western. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Remake==
&quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; was remade as a made-for-TV film in 1967 featuring Tom Tryon, John Saxon, Dan Duryea, John Drew Barrymore, Joan Blondell, John Dehner and Paul Fix. The remake was directed by Herschel Daugherty, with cinematography by Bud Thackery.

<text>Middle-earth Enterprises, formerly known as Tolkien Enterprises, is a subdivision of the Embracer Freemode division of Embracer Group and formerly a trade name for a division of The Saul Zaentz Company. The subdivision owns the worldwide exclusive rights to certain elements of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s two most famous literary works: &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. These elements include the names of characters contained within as well as the names of places, objects and events within them, and certain short phrases and sayings from the works.

In 2022, Embracer Group purchased Middle-earth Enterprises from The Saul Zaentz Company.

==Background and history==
J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, sold the film, stage and merchandising rights of those works to United Artists in 1969. They in turn sold them to The Saul Zaentz Company in 1976, which in turn formed Tolkien Enterprises, now named &quot;Middle-earth Enterprises&quot;, in 1977. United Artists retained distribution rights.

In 1977, Rankin/Bass licensed the rights to produce an animated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which was broadcast on NBC. In 1978, Tolkien Enterprises and the distributor United Artists funded and released an animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; directed by Ralph Bakshi, which covered approximately the first half of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

In 1999, the company severed their licensing agreement with Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) for role-playing games set in Middle-earth after ICE ceased developing new products for this line. This contributed to ICE filing for bankruptcy in 2001. Tolkien Enterprises then made a new licensing agreement with Decipher Inc. for their &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot;, which published content from 2002 to 2006.

Initially, Miramax was backing the production of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films in 1997, but was restricted by then-owner Disney, who demanded that they turn the story into one film instead of two films, thus Jackson brought the project to New Line Cinema, who acquired the rights to develop &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; from Miramax for about $12 million (Miramax retained a 5% stake in the gross). Principal photography for Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy was conducted concurrently in New Zealand from 11 October 1999 through to 22 December 2000. Produced under license from Tolkien Enterprises and released by New Line in 2001, 2002, and 2003, the films met critical and commercial success, but in August 2004, Tolkien Enterprises sued New Line for $20 million in unpaid royalties based on the difference between gross and net profits. An out-of-court settlement was reached in August 2005, though details were not released.

Video game rights to Tolkien&#x27;s literary works were first licensed to Vivendi, which produced &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 2002 and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 2003. At around the same time licensing agreements for products relating to the films produced by Peter Jackson were obtained by Electronic Arts (EA), leading to the release of a series of games, starting with &quot;The Two Towers&quot; in 2002. In 2005, EA acquired the rights to produce games based on the literary works as well, producing further titles up to the release of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Conquest&quot; in 2009, when the licensing agreement expired. Video game rights then passed to Warner Brothers.

In 2010, the name was changed to &quot;Middle-earth Enterprises&quot;.

In 2011, Cubicle 7 produced &quot;The One Ring Roleplaying Game&quot;, a licensed role-playing game set in Middle-earth, in collaboration with Sophisticated Games. While the game featured its own unique rules, Cubicle 7 revealed in 2016 that it would create an adaptation using tabletop gaming rules compatible with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In 2020, Cubicle 7 lost the rights, which were then relicensed to Free League Publishing, which published the second edition of &quot;The One Ring&quot; in 2021 and later a D&amp;D-compatible version in late 2022.

In 2022, Middle-earth Enterprises was purchased by Embracer Group, the parent company of THQ Nordic.

===Legal disputes===

In March 2012, it was reported that The Hobbit, a pub in Southampton, England, had been served with papers by Middle-earth Enterprises outlining breach of copyright over its name. The Hobbit pub continues to trade under that name as of October 2020. The Hungry Hobbit café in Birmingham, near where J. R. R. Tolkien grew up, was also threatened with legal action in 2011.

In November 2012, the Tolkien Estate, trustee and publishers sued Middle-earth Enterprises, Warner Bros., and New Line Cinema for infringing Tolkien&#x27;s copyrights by producing casino and video games using his characters. The original license to Tolkien&#x27;s works was limited to the right to sell &quot;tangible&quot; products such as &quot;figurines, tableware, stationery items, clothing, and the like&quot;, but did not cover &quot;electronic or digital rights, rights in media yet to be devised or other intangibles such as rights in services&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s estate claimed that the defendants&#x27; actions had caused &quot;irreparable harm to Tolkien&#x27;s legacy&quot;. The lawsuit spent five years in discovery and was settled &quot;amicably&quot; out of court in July 2017, before a trial was held.

<text>Broadway Shopping Centre is a shopping centre in Sydney, located in the Broadway locality. It features a 500-seat Food Court and Hoyts 12-screen cinema complex along with major retailers Kmart, Coles, Target, Aldi, H&amp;M, JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman, Harris Farm Markets, Rebel Sport, and over 100 specialty shops.

== History ==
The Broadway shopping centre is located in one of the two former Grace Bros buildings on Broadway which opened in 1923, the other building now housing university student accommodation. Walker Corporation undertook the restoration of the buildings to include university student accommodation and a shopping centre in 1997. The shopping centre opened in 1998 and was owned and managed by Walker Corporation until its sale to Mirvac in December 2006. In 2007, an additional floor was added to the original centre.

In 2015, major upgrades to the centre commenced, costing $55 million. The upgrades, completed in August 2016, added a revamped food court, and new fashion stores.

==Incidents==
On 12 February 2008, just after 1:30 pm a fire was reported due to an electrical substation fire in the lower levels of the shopping centre. No one was injured, however emergency services rescued shoppers trapped in lifts, which had no power due to the fire.

On 17 June 2012, 69 year-old centre security guard Hans Schulz (a German native) was kicked to death after disturbing two intruders - a 32-year-old man from Randwick and a woman aged 27 from Maroubra - who had broken into a Wendy&#x27;s Ice Cream Kiosk on the ground floor of the building. The pair were charged with manslaughter.

On 29 April 2016, hundreds of shoppers and workers had to be evacuated, after a fire broke out on level three.

<text>James Chalmers (2 February 1782 – 26 August 1853) was a Scottish inventor (buried on 1 September 1853) who it was claimed, by his son, was the inventor of the adhesive postage stamps.

== History ==
He trained as a weaver, before he moved to Dundee in 1809 on the recommendation of his brother. He established himself as a bookseller, printer and newspaper publisher on Castle Street. He is known to have been the publisher of &quot;The Caledonian&quot; as early as 1822. Later he served as a Burgh Councillor and became Convener of the Nine Incorporated Trades.
His most burning enthusiasm, however, was postal reform, and from 1825 he campaigned the authorities to speed up the mail between Edinburgh and London by convincing them that this is possible and could be done without an extra cost. After several years he managed to induce a time saving of nearly a day in each direction.

In December 1837, he sent a letter outlining his proposals to Robert Wallace, MP for Greenock. Furthermore, he submitted an essay for a proposal for an adhesive postage stamp and cancelling device which was dated 8 February 1838. This also contained illustrations of one penny and two-pence values. He did not favour the use of an envelope for a letter, as each additional sheet incurred an additional charge. Instead, he proposed that a &quot;slip&quot; or postage stamp could seal a letter.
His son, Patrick Chalmers (born Dundee, 26 July 1819 – died Wimbledon, Surrey, 3 October 1891), wrote many articles that attempted to evince his father&#x27;s share in the work of postal reform and as inventor of the adhesive postage stamp. His book &quot;Robert Wallace MP and James Chalmers, the Scottish Postal Reformers&quot; was published in 1890. Patrick Chalmers&#x27;s daughter, Leah Chalmers, wrote a book &quot;How the adhesive postage stamp was born&quot; which was published in 1939. In 1971 a further book was published about James Chalmers &quot;James Chalmers Inventor of the adhesive postage stamp&quot;. The co-author William J Smith was a director of David Winter &amp; Sons Ltd (successor to the James Chalmers printing company). Charles Chalmers had succeeded his father James in the printing business in 1853. Charles took David Winter into partnership in 1868 and left him the business on his death in 1872. The printing company was renamed to David Winter &amp; Son. All these books claim that James Chalmers first produced an essay for a stamp in August 1834 but no evidence for this is provided in any of the books.

<text>Organic computing is computing that behaves and interacts with humans in an organic manner. The term &quot;organic&quot; is used to describe the system&#x27;s behavior, and does not imply that they are constructed from organic materials. It is based on the insight that we will soon be surrounded by large collections of autonomous systems, which are equipped with sensors and actuators, aware of their environment, communicate freely, and organize themselves in order to perform the actions and services that seem to be required.

The goal is to construct such systems as robust, safe, flexible, and trustworthy as possible. In particular, a strong orientation towards human needs as opposed to a pure implementation of the technologically possible seems absolutely central. In order to achieve these goals, our technical systems will have to act more independently, flexibly, and autonomously, i.e. they will have to exhibit lifelike properties. We call such systems &quot;organic&quot;. Hence, an &quot;Organic Computing System&quot; is a technical system which adapts dynamically to exogenous and endogenous change. It is characterized by the properties of self-organization, self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, self-protection, self-explaining, and context awareness. It can be seen as an extension of the Autonomic computing vision of IBM.

In a variety of research projects the priority research program SPP 1183 of the German Research Foundation (DFG) addresses fundamental challenges in the design of Organic Computing systems; its objective is a deeper understanding of emergent global behavior in self-organizing systems and the design of specific concepts and tools to support the construction of Organic Computing systems for technical applications.

<doc id="1024776" wikidata="Q2183588" url="?curid=1024776" title="Double Cola Company">
<text>The Double Cola Company is a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based manufacturer of soft drinks.

Their primary product, Double-Cola, is predominantly distributed east of the Mississippi River in the US. It is also available in select international markets.

==History==

The Good Grape Company was founded in 1922 by former Chero-Cola employees Charles D. Little and Joe S. Foster in Huntsville, Alabama, primarily to market the product Good Grape. The company moved to Chattanooga that same year. With Little&#x27;s creation of Marvel Cola in 1924, Good Grape Company changed its name to Seminole Flavor Company. Marvel Cola was reformulated and renamed Jumbo Cola. The Double-Cola product was developed in 1933 and soon became the company&#x27;s flagship product. The product was named Double-Cola because its 12-ounce (350 ml) bottles were twice the size of other soda bottles being sold at the time. It was soon followed by flavored Double-Orange, Double-Lemon, and Double-Grape and &quot;Double-Dry&quot; ginger ale.

During World War II&#x27;s sugar rationing, Seminole continued bottling Double-Cola in the larger bottles, which hurt production. PepsiCo was in the same position, and Little had a chance to buy them and refused as he preferred just going forward with the cola Seminole had. Pepsi escaped bankruptcy and moved ahead of Seminole. In 1953 Seminole changed its name to The Double Cola Company as it is today though for a period known as the Double-Cola Co. USA.

In 1956, the company developed Ski, a soda pop comparable to Sun Drop. Ski is a citrus soda made with real orange and real lemon juice. The drink received its name when company asked employees to submit a name for their new product. Inspired by a weekend-long ski trip on Chickamauga Lake, then-employee Dot Myers submitted the names &quot;Ski&quot; and &quot;Skee&quot; into the contest. Management liked the name and it&#x27;s been Ski ever since.

In 1957 Double-Cola made history by becoming the first major soft drink to be marketed in a 16-ounce (470 ml) returnable bottle. In 1962, the year Diet Double Cola was launched, Little sold the company to Fairmont Foods, which drained the company of resources. It was purchased in 1980 by K.J. International, Inc., from Canadian firm Pop Shops International, which acquired it from a consortium of private investors. It remains wholly privately held. Pop Shops had allowed the company to flounder as they focused on their existing brands.

In summer of 1960, Double Cola used a Chinese name as &quot;(得寶可樂)&quot;, a locally made super king size with much more carbon dioxide for only 40 Hong Kong cents for a 16-ounce bottle which could serve three then-typical beverage cups.

==Since 2010==
In 2010 Diet Double-Cola was reformulated with Splenda to make it taste more like regular Double-Cola. Two years later the Double Cola was given new branding and packaging though the ingredients stayed exactly the same.

In 2013 The Double Cola Company expanded its product line outside of that of just soft drinks. Quad Energy was released in 2012 in five different flavors all with energy-boosting ingredients. The same year The Double Cola Company tapped into the ever-growing coconut water market with MINŌKU Coconut Water. MINŌKU Coconut Water is ethically sourced in Thailand and is sold nationally in the US.

The Double Cola Company has plans to release their newest product ZILI Tea in the near future in five different flavors. The Double Cola Company website says, &quot;ZILI Teas are all natural teas that harness the power of Mother Nature to hydrate, nourish, and satisfy.&quot;

<doc id="1024777" wikidata="Q1760342" url="?curid=1024777" title="Mitsubishi Raider">
<text>The Mitsubishi Raider is a pickup truck from Mitsubishi Motors that debuted in the fall of 2005 as a 2006 model for the United States market and is based largely on the Dodge Dakota. The name is recycled from the Dodge Raider SUV sold from 1987 to 1990, which was a rebadged Mitsubishi Montero. 

The Raider filled the gap in the Mitsubishi lineup since the discontinuation of the Mighty Max in 1996. Though Mitsubishi was still building their own Triton at the time, it would have been subject to the chicken tax, while an American-built pickup was not. Chrysler manufactured the Raider alongside the Dakota at their Warren Truck Assembly plant in Warren, Michigan, but they were sent to Normal, Illinois, for installation of some Mitsubishi-specific parts and for distribution. Engine choices had included a 4.7 L PowerTech V8 making and and a 3.7 L PowerTech V6 which produced and , though by the 2008 model year, only the 3.7 L V6 remained available.

Early sales were disappointing, at only one tenth of the Dakota&#x27;s. As Mitsubishi dealers reportedly had a six-month supply of Raiders on their lots the company was obligated to request that DaimlerChrysler cut production. 9,861 Raiders were built in 2005, and just 297 more were built from the first of the year through March 11, 2006. New for 2006 was the &quot;slammed&quot; DuroCross version, which has lower suspension and an aggressive body kit. The DuroCross had a low payload, of only and lost most of its off-roading abilities. Approximately 8,200 Raiders were sold in 2007.

A concept truck was rebadged as the Street Raider and designed by Mitsubishi&#x27;s California design studio. It first appeared at the 2005 SEMA automotive show and since then has been shown at various automotive shows around the United States. It includes 22 inch custom wheels, custom dual exhaust, and a lowered stance among other features not found on a stock Raider. The Street Raider carries a mooted price tag of $60,000, although there are no current plans to sell it.

<doc id="1024788" wikidata="Q4689037" url="?curid=1024788" title="Affranchi">
<text>Affranchi (, ) is a former French legal term denoting a freedman or emancipated slave, but also a pejorative term for free people of color. It is used in the English language to describe the social class of freedmen in Saint-Domingue, and other slave-holding French territories, who held legal rights intermediate between those of free whites and enslaved Africans. In Saint-Domingue, roughly half of the &quot;affranchis&quot; were &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color; &quot;Mulatto&quot;) and the other half African slaves.

The term is derived from the French word for emancipation—, or enfranchisement in terms of political rights. But, the &quot;affranchis&quot; were barred from the franchise (voting) prior to a 1791 court case, which followed the French Revolution. The decision in their favor prompted a backlash from the French white planter class on Saint-Domingue, who also exerted power in France. These elements contributed to the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution.

The &quot;affranchis&quot; had legal and social advantages over enslaved Africans. They became a distinct class in the society between whites and slaves. They could get some education, were able to own land, and could attend some French colonial entertainments. Planters who took slave women or free women of color as concubines, often sent their sons to France for education. In some cases these sons entered the French military. The parents were more likely to settle property on them as well. Because of such property and class issues, some free men of color considered themselves to have status above that of the &quot;petits blancs&quot;, shopkeepers and workers. Nonetheless, the latter had more political rights in the colony until after the Revolution.

The colonists passed so many restrictions that the &quot;affranchis&quot; were limited as a separate caste: they could not vote or hold colonial administrative posts, or work in professional careers as doctors or lawyers. There were sumptuary laws: the free people of color were forbidden to wear the style of clothes favored by the wealthy white colonists. In spite of the disadvantages, many educated &quot;affranchis&quot; identified culturally with France rather than with the enslaved population. A social class in between, the free people of color sometimes had tensions with both whites and enslaved Africans.

Ambitious mulattoes worked to gain acceptance from the white colonists who held power in that society. As they advanced in society, &quot;affranchis&quot; often also held land and slaves. Some acted as creditors for planters. One of their leaders in the late 18th century, Julien Raimond, an indigo planter, claimed that &quot;affranchis&quot; owned a third of all the slaves in the colony at that time. In the early years of the French Revolution and Haitian Revolution, many gens de couleur were committed to maintaining the institution of slavery. They wanted political equality based on class—that is, extended for men of property, regardless of skin color.

<doc id="1024792" wikidata="Q1144956" url="?curid=1024792" title="Supercop">
<text>Police Story 3: Supercop (), released as Supercop in the United States and also known as Jackie Chan&#x27;s Supercop, is a 1992 Hong Kong action film directed by Stanley Tong. It is the third installment in the &quot;Police Story&quot; series, with Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung and Bill Tung reprising their roles from the first two films, and Michelle Yeoh introduced as a new co-lead alongside Chan.

In &quot;Supercop&quot;, series protagonist Chan Ka-kui (Chan) is selected as Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;supercop&quot; to work undercover with elite Chinese policewoman Jessica Yang (Yeoh) and take down a drug cartel. It is the last film in the series to feature Cheung, and the first not directed by Chan, although he returns as action director and is now also a producer.

Chan, Tung and Tong would return for the direct sequel &quot;First Strike&quot; (1996), which would conclude the original series before two reboots in 2004 and 2013; Yeoh would also receive her own spin-off film &quot;Supercop 2&quot; in 1993, again directed by Tong.

==Plot==
Ka-Kui is the &quot;supercop&quot; of the Hong Kong police with amazing martial arts skills. He is sent to Guangzhou, where the Chinese police force&#x27;s Interpol director, Superintendent Jessica Yang, briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat&#x27;s organization, Ka-Kui must get close to Panther, Chaibat&#x27;s henchman, who is being held in a Chinese prison camp. Ka-Kui, posing as a fellow prisoner, aids Panther&#x27;s escape. A grateful Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat&#x27;s gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.

On the way, they pass through Ka-Kui&#x27;s supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. After a confrontation with local police - who are unaware of the undercover operation - in a restaurant, Ka-Kui and Yang (who is also a skilled martial-artist) escape after a big fight, which concludes with Yang faking the killing of a policeman. This secures Panther&#x27;s trust in the pair.

In Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big opium grower&#x27;s fortified compound in the Golden Triangle military camp of Thailand, for a meeting of big-time heroin traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat&#x27;s gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat&#x27;s gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat&#x27;s price.

In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Chaibat&#x27;s wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is sentenced to death for drug trafficking. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, as only she knows the codes to his Swiss bank account, and will not reveal them unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.

A new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. After seeing Ka-Kui accompanying Yang at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat&#x27;s gang are staying, May jealously confronts Ka-Kui, nearly blowing his cover. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation. She manages to prevent him from inadvertently blowing his own cover, but is then overheard recounting the tale to a co-worker by one of Panther&#x27;s men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang – their cover now blown – to help free Chen as ransom.

Chen&#x27;s jailbreak is successful, but May&#x27;s release turns sour when Chaibat pushes her from his helicopter. May survives, and a furious Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. Atop a moving train, Chaibat is killed when his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui recapture Chen, with the trio collectively saving themselves from falling beneath the moving train. Chen decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat&#x27;s bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.

==Production==
A significant aspect of this film is that it was the first Jackie Chan film from Hong Kong to use sync sound, allowing all the actors&#x27; voices to be recorded as they spoke on scene, rather than dubbed over by different actors later.

Exterior scenes were filmed in Hong Kong Island, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. Interior scenes were shot in Kuala Lumpur.

In one scene of the film, Michelle Yeoh and a crewman were almost killed when she jumped onto a car while Jackie Chan was driving and accidentally slipped off the side. Chan grabbed Yeoh and attempted to lift her back onto the car while a crewman also jumped onto the car to help, but Yeoh slipped from Chan’s grasp and both Yeoh and the crewman fell into incoming traffic, prompting the entire crew to rush to help. Yeoh was almost run over but escaped with only minor injuries, while the crewman was knocked unconscious but recovered a few minutes later. The shot is included in the outtakes of the film.

According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action&quot;, Chan dislocated his cheekbone during a stunt scene.

===Dimension version===
The Dimension Films version, which was distributed theatrically in North America in 1996, was dubbed into American English with the participation of Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh.

Among the changes was the addition of a new score composed and conducted by composer Joel McNeely. Tom Jones&#x27; rendition of &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; plays over the end credits, followed by a song specially written and performed for the film by the band Devo, entitled &quot;Supercop&quot;.

This release was cut by approximately 10 minutes. These cuts include:
* Scenes of the police superiors getting a briefing about drug-related crimes.
* The police superiors discussing a plan to send Jackie Chan&#x27;s character on an undercover mission.
* A scene where Yeoh tries to teach Chan about Mainland China.
* A longer version of the meeting with Chaibat in which the sexy women lounging about his mansion are revealed as drug addicts.

==Home media==
The film was given a theatrical and VHS release in the United Kingdom.

===DVD and Blu-ray releases===

* In Hong Kong, the film was initially released by Mega Star Video Distribution (Megastar), and later Deltamac. In 2004, it was re-released by Intercontinental Video Limited (IVL). This version was contained within a Police Story trilogy DVD boxset (Region 0 NTSC). All Hong Kong DVDs contain the original cut.
* In January 2009, the film was re-released in the west by Dragon Dynasty and the Weinstein Company. Although it has the original Hong Kong Cantonese soundtrack, it is cut to fit the visuals of the included Dimension &quot;Supercop&quot; version. It does not contain any of the scenes specific to the Hong Kong version.

===Critical reception===

James Berardinelli of website ReelViews wrote:
&quot;As is usual in a Chan film, the end credits (which show out-takes of failed stunts) are one of &quot;Police Story 3&quot;″s highlights. There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of &quot;Kingpin&quot;. I can&#x27;t think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan&#x27;s stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace&quot;.

In the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington said:
&quot;Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Yeoh&#x27;s credited name], Asia&#x27;s top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don&#x27;t rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones. Connoisseurs will find Chan&#x27;s helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;&quot;.

Furthermore, in 2009, director Quentin Tarantino named &quot;Police Story 3&quot; as one of his favorite films of the past seventeen years. He said that &quot;Supercop&quot; features the &quot;greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever&quot;. In 2016 during a roundtable discussion, when asked which movie scene he would love to save for the last of humanity to see, he named the final scene of the movie as his choice.
In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Supercop&quot; was listed at 75th place on this list.

==Spin-off==

Michelle Yeoh went on to star in a 1993 spin-off called &quot;Supercop 2&quot; or &quot;Project S&quot;. Though it features a cameo appearance by Jackie Chan and Bill Tung reprises his role as &quot;Uncle&quot; Bill, this film is not a proper part of the &quot;Police Story&quot; series.

==Popular culture==
The film inspired two missions in the 2004 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, both of which were taken from the film&#x27;s final scenes. The game&#x27;s last mission, &quot;End of the Line&quot;, in which C.J must chase a firetruck with a red open-top car and catch Sean &quot;Sweet&quot; Johnson, was taken from the scene in which Jackie must chase a van using a red open-top car to catch Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh). That mission in turn inspired the final mission of , which has a similar design.

The mission &quot;Wrong Side of the Tracks&quot;, in which the player must follow a train from a dirt bike, was taken from the scene in which Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh) follows the train on a similar dirt bike.

The film briefly appears in a scene in British police comedy film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; in which Danny Butterman sees the film in a supermarket&#x27;s bargain bin and reads it while Nicholas Angel pursues a shoplifter.

==Music==

Two songs &quot;I Have My Way&quot; (我有我路向) sung by Jackie Chan and &quot;I Just Want You to Understand&quot; (我只想你懂) sung by Taiwanese musician Jonathan Lee, both lyricized by Hong Kong songwriter James Wong and composed by Lee, are featured as theme songs for the Asian versions of the film.

A soundtrack containing alternative rock and hip hop song was released on 30 July 1998 by Interscope Records. It peaked at #133 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<text>Moment of Truth is a anthology series of made-for-television films produced for and aired by NBC from 1993 until 1998. As with most films of the time, the series specifically targeted women and mainly featured everyday women, including their daughters, in some kind of peril, danger or other situation, which were often adapted from real-life events, promoted as &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot;. The films also had a second life, airing often on Lifetime and its sister made-for-TV movie channel.

The TV movies produced in the series are as follows:

<text>Turn the Radio Off is the second album by ska punk band Reel Big Fish. It was released in the U.S. in 1996 on Mojo Records.

The single &quot;Sell Out&quot; both received extensive radio airplay and had mainstream success during 1997. &quot;Sell Out&quot; also appeared on the soundtrack to the video games &quot;FIFA 2000&quot;, &quot;Aggressive Inline&quot;, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Extreme Skate Adventure&quot;. KROQ air personality Jed the Fish appears on the album cover held at gunpoint by frontman Aaron Barrett&#x27;s then-girlfriend. The album has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Reel Big Fish later released a song titled &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot; on their album &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot;, named after this album.

A limited press of the album was released on Vinyl on 13 May 2014. The rerelease was exclusive to Enjoy The Ride Records, with copies also being available through Hot Topic.

==Track listing==
===Songs From &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;===
Over half of the songs are re-recorded versions of songs from RBF&#x27;s first album &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;:
*&quot;Cool Ending&quot; (an acoustic version of &quot;I&#x27;m Cool&quot;)
*&quot;Join the Club&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;
*&quot;Trendy&quot;
*&quot;Skatanic&quot;
*&quot;Say Ten&quot;
*&quot;Beer&quot;
*&quot;All I Want is More&quot; (originally titled &quot;Fuck Yourself&quot;)
*&quot;Snoop Dog, Baby&quot;
*&quot;S.R.&quot; (appeared on the original pressing of &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, but not the Mojo re-release)
Oddly, the song &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was not on the album &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; and may have been written after &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was released. Similarly, a song titled &quot;Turn The Radio Off&quot; would appear on the band&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot;. Aaron Barrett has stated that he had planned to have a song on each album named for the previously released album. He claims that this idea eventually fell apart.

==Notes==
*The album lists the song &quot;In The Pit&quot; under the Writer&#x27;s credits section, although &quot;In The Pit&quot; is not on the album. This song would later appear on the &quot;Teen Beef&quot; split 7-inch with Goldfinger and later on &quot;Why Do They Rock So Hard?&quot; as &quot;Thank You For Not Moshing&quot; with some minor lyrical changes.
*The cover of a &quot;clean&quot; version of the album is a blank white field with just the band&#x27;s name, the name of the album and the text of the First Amendment, incorrectly identified as &quot;Article 1&quot; with a typographic error: &quot;readiness of grievances&quot;.

<text>Goldhawk Road is a London Underground station located in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, on the south side of Goldhawk Road, about west of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green. It is on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, between Hammersmith and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market stations. It is located in Travelcard Zone 2.

Although the line here was opened on 13 June 1864, a station was not opened at this location until 1 April 1914 when Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station (now Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market) was moved from its original location between Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road to a location on the north side of Uxbridge Road.

==Station amenities==

The station currently benefits from a ticket office and two Passenger Operated Machines (or POM&#x27;s). The larger POM, called a Multi Fare Machine (MFM) accepts UK Sterling notes, up to the value of £20 and gives change consisting of 10p, 50p, £1 and £2 coins. The smaller machine known as an Advance Fare Machine (AFM) does not give change and accepts overpayment up to 30p. Both machines accept most major Credit and Debit cards, however to help combat fraud, individual cards can only be used once a day. These machines are the standard London Underground installation at all LU operated stations.
The station also benefits from the use of Electric Service Update Boards or ESUBS. These large screen advertise service information which is updated from the Network Operations Centre, located at London Underground&#x27;s head office above St James Park Tube station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 94 and 237 serve the station.

==Local amenities==
There is one business operating on the station premises , a speciality coffee house.

Directly across Goldhawk Road is the south entrance to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market. A traditional pie and mash shop operates almost opposite the station on the other side of the Goldhawk Road, as do various other eating and drinking establishments.

The station is a short walk to and from Queens Park Rangers football club on Loftus Road.

The historic music venue currently known as the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire is a short walk from the station, originally opened in 1903 for impresario Oswald Stoll, designed by theatre architect Frank Matcham.

<doc id="1024810" wikidata="Q296416" url="?curid=1024810" title="Jermaine Pennant">
<text>Jermaine Lloyd Pennant (born 15 January 1983) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a winger. Pennant made over 350 league appearances for 15 clubs, and scored 25 league goals.

Born in Nottingham, Pennant played for his local side Notts County as a teenager. He earned promising reviews in the youth team at County and Arsenal signed him in 1999. He struggled to make much of an impact at the North London club and spent time on loan at Watford, Leeds United and Birmingham City before joining the latter permanently. While an Arsenal player, he won 24 caps for the England under-21 team. He gained notoriety in 2005, when he had to play a match while on probation – he played while wearing an electronic tag following a drink-driving conviction. Following Birmingham&#x27;s relegation in 2006, Pennant signed for Liverpool for a fee of £6.7 million. He won the 2006 FA Community Shield and also played a vital role in the club&#x27;s run to the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, where Liverpool lost 2–1 to AC Milan.

However, off-field problems continued to affect Pennant and consequently led to him being left out of the side. He joined Portsmouth on loan before leaving to join Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 2009. His time in Spain was overshadowed by disciplinary problems. He returned to the Premier League for the 2010–11 season signing on loan at Midlands club Stoke City. Following a successful loan spell, he signed a permanent contract at Stoke in December 2010. He played in the 2011 FA Cup Final, Stoke losing 1–0 to Manchester City, and also played in the UEFA Europa League the following season. Pennant fell out of favour with Tony Pulis in 2012–13 and spent time out on loan at Wolverhampton Wanderers. With his Stoke career looking to be coming to an end, new manager Mark Hughes gave Pennant a new contract. However, after failing to make an impact, he left Stoke in January 2014. He then spent time playing in India with Pune City before returning to England to sign a short-term contract with Wigan Athletic. In January 2016, he signed a one-year deal with Singapore S.League club Tampines Rovers. Pennant returned to England once more signing for EFL League Two side Bury, before retiring in non-league football with Billericay Town in 2017.

==Early years==
Pennant was born in The Meadows area of Nottingham. His father Gary was a semi-professional footballer who inspired Pennant to play. Pennant recalls how as a child his favourite toy was a football and how it rarely left his side.

Pennant, who grew up in a crime and drug-infested neighbourhood, credits football for saving him from a life of crime. When he was 14, he moved away from home and was living with Youth Training Scheme players who were 16, 17 and 18.

==Club career==
===Arsenal===
Pennant was signed at age 15 by Arsenal from Notts County for £2 million, a record transfer fee for a trainee at the time.

Pennant&#x27;s career seemed promising following his move to Arsenal. He made his debut aged 16 years and 319 days against Middlesbrough in the League Cup on 30 November 1999, making him Arsenal&#x27;s youngest-ever first team player, surpassing Gerry Ward&#x27;s long-standing record by two days; Pennant&#x27;s record has since been surpassed by Cesc Fàbregas. He continued to make League Cup appearances over the next few seasons, but had to wait years for his league debut, as a substitute against West Ham United on 24 August 2002 in the Premier League.

At first, Pennant became homesick. After that subsided, he began to get sick from not playing. It affected him greatly. He played for Arsenal for seven years and only made five starts, including a hat-trick on his full league debut against Southampton on 7 May 2003. He said in 2018 that he did not expect to start that match, and had been drinking until 6 in the morning the night before. However, these were also his only Arsenal league goals and he did not manage to secure a regular place in an Arsenal side that went on a run of 49 consecutive games without defeat. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger appeared to have eventually lost patience with Pennant, who had a history of turning up late to training. Between 2002 and 2004, Pennant spent time on loan at Watford and Leeds United. Pennant received regular first-team action at Leeds, who were relegated at the conclusion of the 2003–04 season.

===Birmingham City===
Pennant was loaned to Birmingham City for the second half of the 2004–05 season. He made a good start at St Andrew&#x27;s, providing Walter Pandiani with the winning goal against Southampton on his debut. Pennant then stated he wanted to make his loan move permanent. On 1 March 2005, he was arrested and convicted for drink-driving, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. He was handed a three-month prison sentence by the courts. Despite this, Birmingham manager Steve Bruce and chairman David Gold vowed to stand by Pennant once his sentence was over. He was released from prison after serving 30 days and wore an electronic tag in a match against Tottenham Hotspur.

Pennant signed a permanent contract with Birmingham on 25 April 2005 for a fee of £3 million. He again struggled with discipline problems in 2005–06 as the club battled against relegation. Ultimately, Birmingham were relegated to the Championship after they drew 0–0 with Newcastle United. Following Birmingham&#x27;s relegation, Liverpool made a bid for Pennant.

===Liverpool===
On 26 July 2006, Pennant signed for Liverpool on a four-year contract for a £6.7 million transfer fee, potentially rising to £8 million with add-ons. After impressing in pre-season, Pennant made his Liverpool debut against Maccabi Haifa in a UEFA Champions League third round qualifying match at Anfield, where he went on to win the fans&#x27; Star Man award. On 20 January 2007, he scored his first goal for Liverpool in their 2–0 home victory over Chelsea in the Premier League. On 31 March, Pennant participated in a 4–1 win against his former club Arsenal. After not being chosen for the England squad to play Israel and Andorra in March 2007, Pennant expressed the lack of recognition from England manager Steve McClaren as &quot;frustrating&quot;.

Pennant started the 2007–08 season in good form, putting in strong performances on either flank as Liverpool reached the top of the Premier League table in the first month. However, he was again ignored by McClaren for the England team in their European Championship qualifying matches against Israel and Russia, despite the backing of Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez. As Liverpool struggled to regain their early season form following the international break, Pennant too could not maintain his form.

On 18 September 2007, Pennant was sent off against Porto in Liverpool&#x27;s opening UEFA Champions League match of the season.

In January 2009, Pennant was loaned out to Portsmouth, where he spent the second half of the 2008–09 season. He played 13 league matches for Portsmouth without scoring a goal. Pennant was not offered a new contract by Liverpool following his return, and he subsequently became a free agent when his contract expired on 1 July 2009.

===Real Zaragoza===
On 9 July 2009, Pennant passed a medical and signed a three-year deal at Real Zaragoza. He made his La Liga debut on the first matchday of the season, playing 71 minutes in Zaragoza&#x27;s 1–0 win over Tenerife. On 24 February 2010, he was reprimanded by coach José Aurelio Gay after turning up late for training three times in the space of two weeks; he was sent home on the third occasion and disciplined. He never played for Real Zaragoza again.

===Stoke City===
On 31 August 2010, the final day of the summer transfer window, Pennant agreed a four-month loan deal with Premier League side Stoke City. He made his Stoke debut as a substitute in the home match against Aston Villa on 13 September 2010. Manager Tony Pulis indicated he would look to make Pennant&#x27;s loan switch permanent in the January transfer window. Pennant also expressed his desire to stay at Stoke after his loan spell.

Pennant joined Stoke on a permanent transfer on 29 December 2010, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract for an initial fee of £1.725 million which could eventually rise to £2.8 million.

Following his transfer, Pulis stated that Pennant must not become complacent. He scored his first goal for Stoke in a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in March 2011, contributed an assist in their 5–0 defeat of Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup semi-final, and scored his second goal of the season as they defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 3–0 a week later. He also scored against his former club Arsenal. Pennant played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City.

Pennant was handed the number 7 shirt prior to the start of the 2011–12 season. However, he reverted to number 16 as a large number of fans had already purchased a replica shirt with his name and old number. Pennant went on to have an up-and-down season as he played in 40 of the club&#x27;s 59 fixtures (starting in 23), helping the side reach the round of 32 of the UEFA Europa League and the quarter-final of the FA Cup. But off-the-pitch problems dominated Pennant&#x27;s season as he broke a club curfew twice, before matches against Everton and Crawley Town. This led to speculation over his future at the club, but Pennant insisted he was not looking to leave the Britannia Stadium.

However, with the arrival of Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Michael Kightly, Pennant was unable to force his way back into Tony Pulis&#x27; plans, and on 12 October 2012, he moved to Wolves on an emergency three-month loan deal. He did not have the best of spells at Molineux, making just ten starts and was jeered by some of the Wolves support for some poor performances, and returned to Stoke in January 2013. After returning to Stoke, Pennant found himself out of the first team and looked to be leaving at the end of the 2012–13 season after the deadline for an appearances-related contract extension expired, and he was included on Stoke&#x27;s released list. However, new Stoke manager Mark Hughes offered Pennant a one-year contract, which he accepted.

Pennant returned to the side for the 2013–14 season, and on 31 August 2013, he scored a free-kick against West Ham United in a 1–0 victory. However, after making little impact under Hughes, his contract was terminated on 24 January 2014.

===Pune City===
On 6 November 2014, Pennant joined Indian Super League side Pune City. He played seven times for Pune as they finished in sixth position.

=== Wigan Athletic ===
Pennant returned to England and joined Championship club Wigan Athletic on 21 February 2015 until the end of the season on a free transfer. He played 13 times and scored three goals, all of which were free-kicks, but was unable to help prevent Wigan suffering relegation to the third tier. He was offered a new contract with the club, but chose not to accept.
=== Tampines Rovers ===
After failing a trial with Thailand club Muangthong United, Pennant had a trial in January 2016 with the Singapore-based Tampines Rovers, which led to a 12-month contract. According to the local media, he was to take a 70% pay cut from his salary at Wigan. On 26 February 2016, he scored his first goal in a friendly match against Hougang United from a free-kick. Pennant went on to score against Home United and against Warriors .

=== Bury ===
Pennant returned to English football in January 2017 on a short-term contract with League One club Bury.

===Billericay Town and retirement===
Pennant had a trial spell with Scottish Premiership club Hibernian during July 2017, but the club decided against offering him a contract.

He then signed a two-year deal with Isthmian League Premier Division side Billericay Town. On 28 December 2017, Pennant left Billericay Town, after just four months, having made 13 appearances league (1 goal) and 2 in the FA Cup.

After failing to find a new club upon leaving Billericay, Pennant subsequently retired.

==International career==
While on the England under-21 team, Pennant was sent home by head coach David Platt for breaking a curfew before an important match against Turkey. He later apologised for his actions. He was also sent off for punching Niko Kranjčar in a match against the Croatia under-21s. However, he did manage to make 24 appearances for the U21s in total, making him one of the ten most-capped Englishmen at this level.

Despite being of Jamaican and Irish descent, he opted to represent England internationally; although he played at under-21 level, he did not play for the senior team. In March 2011, Pennant revealed that though he would still &quot;love to play for England&quot;, he had made the Football Association of Ireland aware he was interested in representing the Republic of Ireland, saying, &quot;If I&#x27;ve got a chance to play international football with Ireland, I&#x27;m going to take it with both hands.&quot;

Pennant is one of only two English players to have played in a UEFA Champions League Final, but never to have represented England at senior level, the other being Jamie Gittens.

==Style of play==
Pennant played as a right winger. He had been described by former Newcastle United left-back José Enrique as a player with similar style to that of Aaron Lennon and Theo Walcott. Pennant was also able to use skill to beat opponents&#x27; full backs.

==Personal life==
In February 2004, Pennant was given a 16-month driving ban after being caught drink-driving in Paddington, West London. On 23 January 2005, he was arrested and again charged with drink-driving, and driving while uninsured, after crashing his Mercedes into a lamp-post in Aylesbury while still serving the ban for the first offence. During questioning, Pennant initially identified himself as his friend Ashley Cole. Pennant pleaded guilty to drink-driving and driving while disqualified, and was sentenced to 90 days in prison on 1 March. He was released on parole after 30 days and immediately returned to playing for Birmingham City, although he had to wear an electronic tag at all times, including while on the pitch. It emerged during the trial that he was illiterate.

In January 2011, Pennant&#x27;s Porsche Turbo with his personal number plate was found abandoned at a railway station in Zaragoza with five months&#x27; worth of parking tickets. He was reported to have forgotten he owned the car. In April 2012, Pennant was arrested for drink driving, driving while disqualified and without insurance after being involved in a traffic collision. The following month, he was banned from driving for three years and given an eight-week jail sentence, suspended for a year.

In 2007, Pennant began dating glamour model Amii Grove. Following a domestic disturbance in July 2007, he was arrested for a Section 5 public order offence – using words or behaviour likely to cause distress – for which he had to pay a fixed penalty fine. According to Grove, she ended the relationship upon finding CCTV footage of Pennant cheating, and &quot;took revenge by destroying £200,000 of his designer gear&quot;. In December 2008, Pennant&#x27;s front gates at his home in Cheshire were ram-raided by burglars in an attempted robbery.

Until January 2008, Pennant was dating &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; actress Jennifer Metcalfe. In October 2008, he reunited with former girlfriend Amii Grove following the death of her brother and became engaged. Soon afterwards, Pennant&#x27;s father Gary was convicted on drug dealing charges and sentenced to four years imprisonment. In early 2009, Pennant and Grove broke up and Pennant began dating Metcalfe again.

In May 2010, Pennant became engaged to Lara Murphy, with whom he had a son named Trey who was born in August 2010. The relationship with Murphy ended when his son was one year old, when Pennant left her for glamour model Alice Goodwin. He married Goodwin in May 2014.
In October 2018, the couple appeared on &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot;, with an appearance on comedy gameshow Your Face or Mine? following in 2019.

Pennant&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Mental: Bad Behaviour, Ugly Truths and the Beautiful Game&quot;, was released in 2018. In the same year, he was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

For Season Two of the Apple TV series Ted Lasso, assistant director Sophie Worger hired former professional player Kasali Casal to manage the soccer choreography. Casal enlisted a team of former professional players to play for the opposition teams facing AFC Richmond during game scenes, these included Pennant and fellow former Premier League players and Lee Hendrie, Jay Bothroyd and George Elokobi.

Since his retirement, Pennant has worked as a pundit, and can often be heard on talkSPORT.

<text>Limburg mijn Vaderland (&quot;Limburg my Fatherland&quot;) or Limburg, mijn vaderland (&quot;Limburg, my fatherland&quot;) is the official anthem of the two provinces of Limburg, Dutch Limburg and Belgian Limburg.

== History ==

The anthem was written by the schoolteacher Gerard Krekelberg in 1909. The music was composed by . Tijssen also wrote the anthem of the city of Roermond, &quot;Oud en trouw Roermond&quot;.

The fact that Krekelberg&#x27;s lyrics are in Dutch can be seen as surprising. It is all the more surprising that he put quite a lot of emphasis on Limburg being united, which was not the case at the time - and arguably still is not. The Limburgish language was - and still is - very much a unifying factor in a culturally diverse area. Around the time that Krekelberg wrote his poem, Dutch was of little importance in daily life in Limburg. Everything was done in Limburgish. In the 19th century this was even more the case. Newspapers were either in German or French. In various parts of Limburg, German was the language used in churches and schools. In Maastricht, a largely Francized city due to its historic ties with Liège, education, theatre and &#x27;polite&#x27; conversation and correspondence were in French.

== Lyrics ==
The lyrics describe the natural beauty of Limburg and the noble nature of its people. Usually only the first stanza is sung, sometimes also the second one. The third stanza talks about the &quot;beautiful language of the ancestors&quot;, &quot;despising foreign pomp&quot; and &quot;preferring our own way of life&quot;. The last stanza, about the strong ties with the Netherlands and the House of Orange, is for obvious reasons never sung in Belgium.

<doc id="1024815" wikidata="Q3271142" url="?curid=1024815" title="CYP2D6">
<text>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CYP2D6&quot; gene. &quot;CYP2D6&quot; is primarily expressed in the liver. It is also highly expressed in areas of the central nervous system, including the substantia nigra.

CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, is one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. In particular, CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolism and elimination of approximately 25% of clinically used drugs, via the addition or removal of certain functional groups – specifically, hydroxylation, demethylation, and dealkylation. CYP2D6 also activates some prodrugs. This enzyme also metabolizes several endogenous substances, such as N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, hydroxytryptamines, neurosteroids, and both &quot;m&quot;-tyramine and &quot;p&quot;-tyramine which CYP2D6 metabolizes into dopamine in the brain and liver.

Considerable variation exists in the efficiency and amount of CYP2D6 enzyme produced between individuals. Hence, for drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 (that is, are CYP2D6 substrates), certain individuals will eliminate these drugs quickly (ultrarapid metabolizers) while others slowly (poor metabolizers). If a drug is metabolized too quickly, it may decrease the drug&#x27;s efficacy while if the drug is metabolized too slowly, toxicity may result. So, the dose of the drug may have to be adjusted to take into account of the speed at which it is metabolized by CYP2D6. Individuals who exhibit an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype, metabolize prodrugs, such as codeine or tramadol, more rapidly, leading to higher than therapeutic levels. A case study of the death of an infant breastfed by an ultrarapid metabolizer mother taking codeine impacted postnatal pain relief clinical practices, but was later debunked. These drugs may also cause serious toxicity in ultrarapid metabolizer patients when used to treat other post-operative pain, such as after tonsillectomy. Other drugs may function as inhibitors of CYP2D6 activity or inducers of CYP2D6 enzyme expression that will lead to decreased or increased CYP2D6 activity respectively. If such a drug is taken at the same time as a second drug that is a CYP2D6 substrate, the first drug may affect the elimination rate of the second through what is known as a drug-drug interaction.

== Gene ==

The gene is located on chromosome 22q13.1. near two cytochrome P450 pseudogenes (CYP2D7P and CYP2D8P). Among them, CYP2D7P originated from CYP2D6 in a stem lineage of great apes and humans, the CYP2D8P originated from CYP2D6 in a stem lineage of Catarrhine and New World monkeys&#x27; stem lineage. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

== Genotype/phenotype variability ==

CYP2D6 shows the largest phenotypical variability among the CYPs, largely due to genetic polymorphism. The genotype accounts for normal, reduced, and non-existent CYP2D6 function in subjects. Pharmacogenomic tests are now available to identify patients with variations in the CYP2D6 allele and have been shown to have widespread use in clinical practice.
The CYP2D6 function in any particular subject may be described as one of the following:
* poor metabolizer – little or no CYP2D6 function
* intermediate metabolizers – metabolize drugs at a rate somewhere between the poor and extensive metabolizers
* extensive metabolizer – normal CYP2D6 function
* ultrarapid metabolizer – multiple copies of the &quot;CYP2D6&quot; gene are expressed, so greater-than-normal CYP2D6 function occurs

A patient&#x27;s CYP2D6 phenotype is often clinically determined via the administration of debrisoquine (a selective CYP2D6 substrate) and subsequent plasma concentration assay of the debrisoquine metabolite (4-hydroxydebrisoquine).

The type of CYP2D6 function of an individual may influence the person&#x27;s response to different doses of drugs that CYP2D6 metabolizes. The nature of the effect on the drug response depends not only on the type of CYP2D6 function, but also on the extent to which processing of the drug by CYP2D6 results in a chemical that has an effect that is similar, stronger, or weaker than the original drug, or no effect at all. For example, if CYP2D6 converts a drug that has a strong effect into a substance that has a weaker effect, then poor metabolizers (weak CYP2D6 function) will have an exaggerated response to the drug and stronger side-effects; conversely, if CYP2D6 converts a different drug into a substance that has a greater effect than its parent chemical, then ultrarapid metabolizers (strong CYP2D6 function) will have an exaggerated response to the drug and stronger side-effects. Information about how human genetic variation of CYP2D6 affects response to medications can be found in databases such PharmGKB, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).

== Genetic basis of variability ==

The variability in metabolism is due to multiple different polymorphisms of the &quot;CYP2D6&quot; allele, located on chromosome 22. Subjects possessing certain allelic variants will show normal, decreased, or no CYP2D6 function, depending on the allele. Pharmacogenomic tests are now available to identify patients with variations in the CYP2D6 allele and have been shown to have widespread use in clinical practice. The current known alleles of CYP2D6 and their clinical function can be found in databases such as PharmVar.

== Ethnic factors in variability ==

Ethnicity is a factor in the occurrence of CYP2D6 variability. The reduction of the liver cytochrome CYP2D6 enzyme occurs approximately in 7–10% in white populations, and is lower in most other ethnic groups such as Asians and African-Americans at 2% each. A complete lack of CYP2D6 enzyme activity, wherein the individual has two copies of the polymorphisms that result in no CYP2D6 activity at all, is said to be about 1-2% of the population. The occurrence of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers appears to be greater among Middle Eastern and North African populations. In Ethiopia, a particularly high percentage (30%) of the population are ultrametabolizers. As a result, the analgesic codeine is banned in Ethiopia due to the high rate of adverse events associated with ultrarapid metabolism of codeine in this population.

Caucasians with European descent predominantly (around 71%) have the functional group of CYP2D6 alleles, producing extensive metabolism, while functional alleles represent only around 50% of the allele frequency in populations of Asian descent.

This variability is accounted for by the differences in the prevalence of various &quot;CYP2D6&quot; alleles among the populations–approximately 10% of whites are intermediate metabolizers, due to decreased CYP2D6 function, because they appear to have the one (heterozygous) non-functional &quot;CYP2D6*4&quot; allele, while approximately 50% of Asians possess the decreased functioning &quot;CYP2D6*10&quot; allele.

== Ligands ==
Following is a table of selected substrates, inducers and inhibitors of CYP2D6. Where classes of agents are listed, there may be exceptions within the class.

Inhibitors of CYP2D6 can be classified by their potency, such as:
* Strong inhibitor being one that causes at least a 5-fold increase in the plasma AUC values of sensitive substrates metabolized through CYP2D6, or more than 80% decrease in clearance thereof.
* Moderate inhibitor being one that causes at least a 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC values of sensitive substrates metabolized through CYP2D6, or 50-80% decrease in clearance thereof.
* Weak inhibitor being one that causes at least a 1.25-fold but less than 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC values of sensitive substrates metabolized through CYP2D6, or 20-50% decrease in clearance thereof.

<doc id="1024817" wikidata="Q1929" url="?curid=1024817" title="Gaël Clichy">
<text>Gaël Dimitri Clichy (born 26 July 1985) is a French former professional footballer who played as a left-back. He is currently the assistant manager of the France national under-21 team. Predominantly left-footed but naturally right-footed, he was described earlier in his career as a player who possesses &quot;almost unrivaled stamina&quot; that is &quot;quick in the tackle and willing to drive forward&quot;.

Clichy was born in the city of Toulouse and began his football career playing for a host of amateur clubs in the Haute-Garonne département such as JS Cugnaux, AS Muret, and Tournefeuille. In 2001, he moved to the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region to play for professional club Cannes. Clichy made his professional debut for the club in the 2002–03 season while the club was playing in the Championnat National, the third level of French football. After three seasons with Cannes, in 2003, he was convinced by manager and countryman Arsène Wenger to join Arsenal in England.

In Clichy&#x27;s first season with the club, he was a member of the squad, dubbed the Invincibles, that went undefeated in the league season. As a result of the title, at 18 years and 10 months, Clichy became the youngest player to win a Premier League medal. After three seasons of backing up Ashley Cole, in the 2006–07 season, Clichy took over the starters&#x27; role permanently. In the 2007–08 season, he appeared in all 38 league matches. His performances during the season earned him an appearance on the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) Team of the Year. Aside from the 2003–04 league title, he has also won the 2004 FA Community Shield in with Arsenal. Clichy moved on in 2011 to more success with Manchester City, adding two more Premier League titles (2011–12 and 2013–14) and two League Cups (2014 and 2016). He left England after 14 years for Turkish side İstanbul Başakşehir in 2017, with whom he won the national league in 2020.

Clichy is a former French youth international and has represented his nation at every level for which he was eligible. Prior to playing for the senior team, he played on the under-17 team that finished runners-up to Switzerland at the 2002 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. Clichy made his senior international debut in September 2008 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Serbia. He made his first major international tournament appearance for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Clichy made one appearance in the competition against South Africa in the final group stage match. He additionally featured in the UEFA Euro 2012 squad, before making his last international appearance in 2013.

==Early life==
Clichy was born and raised in Toulouse, in southwestern France. His mother, Jacqueline, is a medical nurse, while his father, Claude, was an educator in the city. While Clichy was beginning his football career, his father often served as a part-time coach and referee. At the age of 15 while playing for Cannes, Clichy nearly died. After climbing over a metal fence while crossing a ground at the club&#x27;s facility, a ring he was wearing got caught in the fence, which resulted in the skin and tissue from the fourth finger of his right hand being completely torn off. During the seven-hour operation to repair the finger, Clichy&#x27;s heart stopped beating due to a problem with his lungs. It restarted after 15 seconds. The doctor who led the operation described Clichy&#x27;s survival as &quot;a miracle&quot;, while the player himself admitted that the ordeal changed his attitude towards life stating &quot;It made me realise that life can go quick. You could leave tomorrow so you have to enjoy it to the maximum so you don&#x27;t regret anything the next day. You can look forward to the future but not too far ahead&quot;.

==Club career==

===Early career===

Clichy began his football career at the age of five playing for his hometown club AS Hersoise. He, initially, was a predominantly right-footed player, but through decisive coaching from his father, Clichy&#x27;s left foot eventually became his primary. One such example of his father&#x27;s coaching came during a regional youth cup match, which his father was refereeing. The younger Clichy was informed by his father that if he scored a goal with his right foot, he would disallow it. Following this, Clichy developed his left foot &quot;to the point where he eventually forgot his right foot&quot;. After five seasons with Hersoise, Clichy joined JS Cugnaux, a local club based in nearby Cugnaux. He spent only one year at the club before moving to AS Muret.

In 1998, Clichy joined AS Tournefeuille and began attending secondary at the Collège Leonardo da Vinci. During his stint at Tournefeuille, he was selected to attend the Pôle Espoirs de Castelmaurou, a regional academy located in the Midi-Pyrénées region that trained players similarly to the Clairefontaine academy in Île-de-France. Clichy spent three years at the center training there during the weekdays and playing with Tournefeuille on the weekends. In 2000, after developing at both Tournefeuille and Castelmaurou, Clichy was linked to a host of professional clubs, including Auxerre, Bordeaux, and Toulouse who were seeking to obtain his services. The young player ultimately decided to move to the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region to play for professional club Cannes.

Clichy arrived to Cannes in 2000 while the club was playing in Ligue 2, the second division of French football. While at the club, Clichy primarily played as a central midfielder and was supervised by former French international and Saint-Étienne player Christian Lopez. He began his career with the club playing in its youth academy alongside Julien Faubert. During the latter part of the 2001–02 season, Clichy spent time playing on the club&#x27;s reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur 2, the fifth level of French football. In the following season, with the club now playing in the Championnat National, the third level of French football, he was promoted to the senior team on a permanent basis by Lopez, who was now managing the club. Clichy later played under Robert Buigues following the sacking of Lopez and appeared in 15 matches with the team assisting on two goals.

===Arsenal===

====2003–2006====
Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had noticed Clichy&#x27;s talents when the player first arrived at Cannes at the age of 16. Following the 2002–03 season, Wenger contacted Clichy directly in an attempt to sign the player. In June 2003, the Arsenal manager visited the Clichy household in Tournefeuille and offered him a professional contract with the club. Wenger informed Clichy that &quot;you&#x27;ll play&quot;, which was enough to convince both the player and his family.

As promised by Wenger, Clichy began the season on the club&#x27;s senior team primarily as the backup to England international Ashley Cole. He made his club debut on 28 October 2003 alongside fellow débutant Cesc Fàbregas in a League Cup encounter with Rotherham United. Arsenal won the tie 9–8 on penalties with Clichy converting his spot kick. On 22 November, Clichy made his league debut in a 3–0 win over Birmingham City. Following an injury to Cole in December, Clichy appeared in nine straight matches; six of them as a starter. On 24 February 2004, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in the first leg of the team&#x27;s 3–2 knockout round victory over Spanish club Celta de Vigo. Clichy finished the campaign appearing in seven more matches. On 9 May 2004, he appeared as a substitute in Arsenal&#x27;s 1–0 league win over Fulham. A week later, Clichy appeared on the bench in the team&#x27;s final league match of the season; a 2–1 win over Leicester City. The victory assured Arsenal an undefeated league season, which resulted in the club becoming the second first division team in English football history to finish a league season unbeaten. As a result of the title, at 18 years and 10 months, Clichy became the youngest player to win a Premier League medal.

Clichy remained second-choice to Cole for the 2004–05 season. Wenger did install the young defender as first-choice for FA Cup matches. Clichy appeared as a starter for every round until Arsenal reached the semi-finals when he was replaced by Cole. The club ultimately won the competition defeating Manchester United 5–4 on penalties to give Clichy his first domestic cup honour. In the Premier League, Clichy appeared in 15 matches, seven as a starter. In the UEFA Champions League, he only made two appearances; a 5–1 group stage victory over Norwegian club Rosenborg and a 3–1 knockout round defeat to German outfit Bayern Munich. Clichy&#x27;s season ultimately ended prematurely in April due to a recurring foot injury.

In the 2005–06 season, Clichy was handed an opportunity to earn a regular place in the starting line-up after Cole suffered a fractured foot in October 2005. The injury seemed to signify that Clichy would earn some valuable first-team action during Cole&#x27;s time out, however, after appearing six straight matches as a starter, Clichy suffered a similar injury in November, which ruled him out for four months. He returned to the team on 25 April 2006 in a Champions League semi-final tie against Spanish outfit Villarreal coming on as a substitute for the injured Mathieu Flamini. In the late stages of the match, Clichy was adjudged to have committed a foul in the box on striker José Mari, which resulted in a penalty taken by Juan Román Riquelme, which was saved by Jens Lehmann. Had Riquelme converted, the game would have gone to extra time. After appearing in a 3–0 win over Sunderland in the league the following week, Clichy suffered a re-occurrence of his foot injury. The relapse resulted in the player missing the 2006 Champions League final, sitting on the bench for the whole match. Arsenal lost the match 2–1 to Barcelona.

====2006–2011====
During the 2006 off-season, Clichy struggled to rehab his foot injury. The injury became so agitating for the player that Wenger was forced to intervene on the rehabilitation process. Wenger, subsequently, recommended Clichy visit Dr. Mark Myerson, an orthopaedic and medical director for the Institute for Foot and Ankle Reconstruction at the Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Clichy visited Myerson in June 2006 and was forced to undergo another surgery. The operation resulted in the player missing the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, as well as three months of domestic football with Arsenal. In August 2006, Cole departed the club for rivals Chelsea, a transfer which paved the way for Clichy to take over as the permanent starter. In three seasons as Cole&#x27;s understudy, Clichy made a total of 24 league appearances for Arsenal and 57 overall.

Clichy made his return to the team on 14 October 2006 in a 3–0 league victory over Watford appearing as a substitute. He returned to the starting line-up ten days later playing the entire match in a League Cup win over West Brom. Clichy, subsequently, featured as a starter in the next 19 matches. On 3 March 2007, Clichy assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Júlio Baptista in a 2–1 win over Reading.

In the 2007–08 season, Clichy had arguably the best season of his career. He appeared in a career-high and team-best 49 matches and was the only player in the team to appear in all 38 league matches. Clichy also posted a career-high in assists delivering six with two of them coming in back-to-back league wins over Everton and West Ham in December and January. On 28 April 2008, he assisted on two goals in a 6–2 hammering of Derby County. For his performances during the season, Clichy was named to the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) Team of the Year alongside teammates Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, and Fàbregas. He also finished second in the Arsenal fans&#x27; poll for the club&#x27;s Player of the Season. However, despite the impressive individual season, Arsenal, for the third consecutive season, failed to win any trophies. On 16 May 2008, Arsenal awarded Clichy with a two-year contract extension until June 2012.

During Arsenal&#x27;s pre-season campaign ahead of the 2008–09 season, Clichy captained the team for the first time in its 2–1 win over Barnet. He remained a fixture within the starting eleven during the season despite the emergence of youngster Kieran Gibbs. On 1 November 2008, Clichy scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 defeat to Stoke City. After consistently appearing with the team for the majority of the campaign, in April 2009, Clichy began missing matches due to an unspecified injury. After being sidelined for several weeks, it was announced in early May that the defender would miss the remainder of the 2008–09 season due to a back injury. Similar to his foot injury three seasons ago, during the high note of the 2009–10 season, Clichy&#x27;s back injury relapse after it was revealed that the player suffered a stress fracture of the lower back in the team&#x27;s 3–0 win over North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Despite being initially ruled out for a month, Clichy missed ten weeks and returned to the team in January 2010. He appeared in all of the club&#x27;s remaining matches excluding one.

A healthy Clichy started the 2010–11 campaign as the starting left-back domestically and internationally for the first time. On 30 October, he assisted on the only goal scored by Alex Song in the team&#x27;s league win over West Ham. Clichy scored his second career goal on 2 March 2011 in the team&#x27;s 5–0 win over Leyton Orient in a FA Cup replay tie.
Altogether Clichy made a sum of 264 appearances and scored twice for Arsenal.

===Manchester City===
On 4 July 2011, it was confirmed that Manchester City had completed the signing of Clichy from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £7 million, on a four-year deal. Clichy made his first appearance for City on the club&#x27;s US Tour. He then made his first competitive appearance against Manchester United in the 2011 FA Community Shield and his first Premier League appearance against Swansea City. He was sent off during a league game against Chelsea for picking up a second yellow card for a challenge on Ramires. Clichy established himself as first choice left-back after beginning the season as backup to Aleksandar Kolarov. On 13 May 2012, the final day of the Premier League season, Clichy started and played the full 90 minutes against Queens Park Rangers at the City of Manchester Stadium in a 3–2 victory, on his 37th appearance of the campaign which ultimately handed City the title at the expense of rivals Manchester United. Clichy collected the second Premier League winner&#x27;s medal of his career having won the other one with Arsenal after an Invincible 2003–04 season.

Clichy agreed a new four-year deal with City in May 2013 after penning a contract to keep him at the Etihad until 2017. &quot;I&#x27;m really happy to have agreed a new deal with City and I&#x27;m already looking forward to next season&quot;, said Clichy. &quot;Things didn&#x27;t go the way we wanted them to this year but we&#x27;ll come back stronger next season and learn from this experience.&quot;
Clichy won another Premier League winner&#x27;s medal in May 2014 as Manchester City held off the challenge of Liverpool to regain the Premier League title on the final day of the season. Clichy scored his first goal for Manchester City on 30 November 2014 in a 0–3 victory against Southampton FC at St Mary&#x27;s Stadium.

On 25 May 2017, Manchester City announced that Clichy would be leaving the club.

===İstanbul Başakşehir===
On 7 July 2017, İstanbul Başakşehir announced that Clichy had passed the medical earlier that day, following which he signed a 3-year contract to play for the Turkish club.

On 19 July 2020, Clichy helped Başakşehir secure their first ever league title, providing the assist for the game&#x27;s only goal in the club&#x27;s win over Kayserispor on the penultimate day of the season.

===Servette===
On 2 December 2020, Clichy joined Servette of the Swiss Super League on a free transfer and a 18-month contract.

==International career==

===Youth===

Clichy has earned caps with all of France&#x27;s youth teams for which he was eligible. He was a late participant at under-15 level under coach Luc Rabat. Clichy made his youth international debut on 13 March 2001 in a 3–0 friendly win over Italy. He remained with the team for the rest of the campaign appearing in three matches at the 2001 edition of the Montaigu Tournament which France won. Clichy also played in all three matches at an international tournament in Salerno, Italy. At under-17 level, Clichy appeared in ten matches as France attempted to qualify for the 2002 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship. He made his debut with the team on 19 September 2001 in its opening league match of the season; a 1–0 win over Yugoslavia. In qualifying for the UEFA-sanctioned tournament, Clichy appeared in two of the three qualification matches. In the tournament, he appeared in all six matches as the starting left-back. France reached the final, but were defeated by a resilient Switzerland, who were led by future Arsenal teammate Philippe Senderos.

Due to increased playing time at his parent club Cannes, Clichy&#x27;s stint with the under-18 team was uneventful appearing in only three matches. He returned to the team as a regular for under-19 duty as the team was attempting to qualify for the 2004 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. In qualifying, France were surprisingly eliminated in the first round after finishing third in its first qualifying round group. Following the team&#x27;s elimination, France only played in three more matches. Clichy played in the last two against Ukraine. He earned his first call up to the under-21 team under coach Raymond Domenech in the team&#x27;s first match following the team&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship against Belgium, which was a 1–0 victory. Despite featuring in the team as a starter early on, which included playing in every match in the team&#x27;s triumph at the 2004 Toulon Tournament, as the season wore on, Clichy lost his starting left-back spot to Lyon prospect Jérémy Berthod. His last appearance with the team came on 15 November 2005 in the team&#x27;s first leg playoff round tie against England, which determined which team would earn a berth in the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. Clichy started the first leg, but was substituted out for Berthod at half-time. France defeated England 3–2 on aggregate to earn a place in the tournament. However, due to his fractured foot injury suffered while playing with Arsenal, Clichy missed the competition.

===Senior===
On 31 January 2008, Clichy was called up to the senior national team for the first time for the team&#x27;s February 2008 match against Spain. However, he instead played for the B team in its friendly match against the Congo DR, held the day before the Spain friendly. After receiving several more call ups in 2008, Clichy finally earned his first cap on 10 September 2008 in a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Serbia. The following month, he appeared as a starter in 3–1 victories over Tunisia and Austria, the former match being a friendly and the latter being a World Cup qualifier. In the next year and a half, Clichy failed to represent France internationally. Despite this, he was named in Domenech&#x27;s 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Clichy was later named in the 23-man team to serve as the backup for the incumbent starter Patrice Evra. At the competition, France endured a disastrous campaign as the players went on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. In the team&#x27;s final group stage match against hosts South Africa, with several veteran players missing from the squad, Clichy was inserted as a starter and played the entire match in the team&#x27;s 2–1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition. As a result of the players&#x27; mutiny, Clichy, along with the 22 other members of the team, were suspended for the team&#x27;s friendly match against Norway.

Due to the five-match suspension of Evra, new national team manager Laurent Blanc inserted Clichy as the starter. Following his first match since the World Cup against Belarus, Clichy was criticised for his defending; following a mix-up with Yann M&#x27;Vila, he failed to prevent Vyacheslav Hleb from providing the assist for the only goal of the match as France lost 1–0. Despite this setback, Clichy remained first-choice and featured in the team&#x27;s next three matches. In November 2010, Clichy was benched in favour of Eric Abidal. Following Abidal&#x27;s diagnosis of a tumor on his liver, Evra returned to the team and was given the starting left-back spot in his first match back. Clichy later admitted that he was frustrated by the decision, but respected the manager&#x27;s choice. In June 2012, he was named in the 23-man France squad and given the number 22 shirt to compete at UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine as a substitute for Evra. He played the last two group matches against Ukraine and Sweden, as well as the 2–0 loss against Spain in the quarter final at the tournament.

==Coaching career==
===France U-21===
In August 2023, Clichy was appointed assistant coach to his former teammate Thierry Henry at the head of the French junior team and the French Olympic team.

==Sponsorship==
In 2012, Gaël Clichy signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and footwear supplier, Puma SE. He followed the likes of former teammates Sergio Agüero and Yaya Touré wearing the evoSPEED range of football boots. Clichy was formerly with British brand Umbro and its Stealth silo.

<text>Lenin Volga–Don Shipping Canal (Russian: Волго-Донской судоходный канал имени, &quot;В. И. Ленина, Volga-Donskoy soudokhodniy kanal imeni V. I. Lenina&quot;, abbreviated ВДСК, &quot;VDSK&quot;) is a ship canal in Russia. It connects the Volga and the Don at their closest points. Opened in 1952, its length is , of which is through rivers and reservoirs.

The canal forms a part of the Unified Deep Water System of European Russia. Together with the lower Volga and the lower Don, the canal provides the shortest navigable connection between the Caspian Sea and the world&#x27;s oceans via the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

==History==

There has been a trade and military route between the Volga and Don rivers since early human history.

The presence of the fortified settlement Tanais in the Don River delta since the time of the Bosporan Kingdom, 438 BC–
370 AD, strongly suggests the route was sufficiently notable to be fortified for over two thousand years. The Sarkel fortress on the left bank of the lower Don was the main control of this Volga trade route.
The Don–Volga portage got its name from its trade importance 1000 years ago. There were several attempts to build a canal to replace the portage after 1500, first by the Ottomans during the 16th century, then by the Russian Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries, and finally, more successfully, by the Soviet Union in the 20th.

In 1569, the Ottoman Empire attempted to connect the Volga and Don rivers via a canal. The Ottomans wanted to create a maritime link to Central Asia (especially the cities of Bukhara, Khwarazm and Samarkand) to facilitate trade. Together with a proposed Suez Canal, the Volga–Don canal would also allow Central Asian Muslims to perform pilgrimage to Mecca. According to most historians, the Ottomans managed to dig one-third of the canal before work was abandoned because of adverse weather. Other historians argue that the Ottomans merely leveled the ground so they could haul ships between the two rivers. In the end, the Ottomans retreated from the area and Russia promised to respect trade and pilgrimage routes to Central Asia.

Peter the Great ordered the earliest Russian attempts to connect the Volga and Don rivers. After capturing Azov in 1696, he decided to build a canal — later named Petrov Val — on the Ilovlya River (a left tributary of the Don) and the Kamyshinka river (right tributary of the Volga). It was much shorter than the modern canal, connecting a gap of just 4 kilometers (2.5 mi), but was abandoned in 1701 because of a lack of resources and other problems. He initiated a second attempt, the so-called Ivanovsky Canal between Yepifan and Ivan-Ozero, under the administration of Knyaz Matvey Gagarin. However it was too shallow, as it linked the upper Don and the upper Volga via the tributaries Oka River, Upa River, and Shat River in present-day Tula Oblast. Between 1702 and 1707, twenty-four locks were constructed, and in 1707, about 300 ships passed through with difficulty. In 1709 owing to financial difficulties from the Great Northern War, the project was halted.

In 1711 Russia left Azov under the terms of the Treaty of the Pruth, and Peter the Great lost all interest in the canal, which was abandoned and fell into ruin. Over time, other projects for connecting the two rivers were proposed, but none were attempted. However, the horse-drawn Dubovsko-Kachalinsky railway and the Volga–Don railway — now part of the South Eastern Railway — were built in 1846 and 1852, respectively, to link the Volga and the Don at the shortest distance. They were 68km and 73km long respectively.
The construction of today&#x27;s Volga–Don Canal, designed by Sergey Zhuk&#x27;s Hydroproject Institute, began prior to the Second World War, which interrupted the process. In late 1948, the Volga–Don Canal was among the first projects to partake in the reform of the Soviet forced labour system, notably alongside Dalstroy. After these projects introduced a wage for prisoners and other measures to stimulate productivity, they managed to become fully self-financing.

Construction works continued from 1948 to 1952 and the canal was opened on 1 June 1952. The canal and its facilities were built by about 900,000 workers including some 100,000 German POWs and 100,000 gulag prisoners. A day spent at the construction yard was counted as three days in prison, which spurred the prisoners to work. Several convicts were even awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour upon their release.

Upon completion, the Volga–Don Canal became an important link in the Unified Deep Water Transportation System of the European part of the USSR.

==Operation==
The canal begins at the Volga&#x27;s Sarepta backwater (, the location of Lock No. 1 and the gateway arch), south of Volgograd. It ends in the Tsimlyansk Reservoir of the Don at the town of Kalach-na-Donu. The canal&#x27;s highest elevation is the Varverovskoye (Barbarian) Reservoir between locks 9 and 10, above the Volga and above the Don river. It uses nine single-chamber canal locks on the Volga slope to raise and lower ships , and four canal locks of the same kind on the Don slope that raise/lower ships from river height. The locks are smaller overall than those on the Volga River, but can handle ships of up to 5,000 tonnes cargo capacity.

The smallest locks are long, wide, and deep. The maximum allowed vessel is length, beam, and draught (the &quot;Volgo–Don Max Class&quot;).

The canal is filled from the Don, with three powerful pumping stations to maintain water levels. Water is also taken from the canal for irrigation.

Cargo transported from the Don region to the Volga includes coal from Donetsk in Ukraine, minerals, building materials, and grain. From the Volga to the Don, cargo includes lumber, pyrites, and petroleum products (carried mostly by Volgotanker boats).

Tourist cruisers travel in both directions.


The canal and the Tsimlyansky water-engineering system (whose chief architect was Leonid Polyakov), form part of an architectural ensemble dedicated to the battles for Tsaritsyn during the Russian Civil War and for Stalingrad during the German-Soviet War.

The Russian classical composer Sergei Prokofiev wrote the tone poem &quot;The Meeting of the Volga and the Don&quot; to celebrate its completion.

According to the Maritime Board (&quot;Morskaya Kollegiya&quot;) of the Russian government, 10.9 million tonnes of cargo were carried over the Volga–Don Canal in 2004. An alternative source claims 8.05 million tonnes of cargo was transported through the canal in 2006. Most of the cargo was moved from the east to the west: 7.20 million tonnes, and only 0.85 million tonnes the other way. Just over half of all cargo was oil or oil products (4.14 million tonnes), predominantly shipped from the Caspian region.

It was reported in 2007 that in the first 55 years of the canal&#x27;s operations 450,000 vessels had passed through carrying 336 million tonnes of cargo. Recent cargo volume stood at 12 million tonnes per year.

In 2016, the core of Belarusian nuclear power plant VVER-1200, which weighed 330 tonnes, was 13 meters high, and 4.5 meters in diameter, was transferred to its destination by exploiting Tsimlyansk Reservoir, the Volga–Don Canal, the Volga–Baltic Waterway, and two other connections.

==Future options==
In the 1980s, construction started on a second canal between the rivers. The new canal, dubbed Volga–Don 2 (; ) was to have started from the township of Yerzovka on the Volgograd Reservoir, north (upstream) of the Volga Dam, as opposed to the existing Volga–Don Canal that starts south (downstream) of the dam. This would have reduced the number of locks traversed by ships coming from the Volgograd Reservoir, or from other Volga or Kama ports farther north, on their way to the Don. The project was abruptly cancelled to cut expenditure on 1 August 1990, by which time more than 40 percent of its funds had already been spent. Since then most of the stone and metal in the abandoned canal and locks has been looted.

As of 2007–2008, Russian authorities were considering two options for increasing the throughput of navigable waterways between the Caspian basin and the Black Sea. One option, which reuses the name &quot;Volga–Don 2&quot;, is to build a second parallel channel (&quot;second thread&quot;) of the Volga–Don Canal, equipped with larger locks long. This approach would have allowed for an increase in the canal&#x27;s annual cargo throughput from 16.5 million tonnes to 30 million tonnes. The other option—which had greater support from Kazakhstan, which would be either canal&#x27;s major customer—was to build the so-called Eurasia Canal along a more southerly route in the Kuma–Manych Depression, some of which is the much-shallower but existing Manych Ship Canal. The southern route would require less earthwork than the first option and would provide a speedier connection between the Caspian and the Sea of Azov. It would also require fewer locks than the Volga–Don, as elevation differences to be engineered in the Kuma–Manych Depression are smaller.

<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s late string quartets are:
:*Opus 127: String Quartet No. 12 in E major (1825)
:*Opus 130: String Quartet No. 13 in B major (1825)
:*Opus 131: String Quartet No. 14 in C minor (1826)
:*Opus 132: String Quartet No. 15 in A minor (1825)
:*Opus 133: &quot;Große Fuge&quot; in B major (1825; originally the finale to Op. 130; it also exists in a piano four-hands transcription, Op. 134)
:*Opus 135: String Quartet No. 16 in F major (1826)

These six works are Beethoven&#x27;s last major completed compositions. Extremely complex and largely misunderstood by musicians and audiences of Beethoven&#x27;s day, the late quartets are now widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time, and have inspired many later composers.

==Overview==

Prince Nikolai Galitzin commissioned the first three quartets (12, 13 and 15) and in a letter dated 9 November 1822, offered to pay Beethoven &quot;what you think proper&quot; for them. Beethoven replied on 25 January 1823 with his price of 50 ducats for each opus. He composed the quartets in the sequence 12, 15, 13, 14, 16, writing 13 and 15 simultaneously.

Beethoven wrote these last quartets in failing health. In April 1825, he was bedridden and remained ill for about a month. His recovery from the illness inspired the modal slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet, which Beethoven called &quot;Holy song of thanks () to the divinity, from one made well&quot;. He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth. The last work Beethoven completed was the substitute final movement of the thirteenth quartet, which replaced the extremely difficult &quot;Große Fuge&quot;.

==The &quot;ABC&quot; quartets==

Opp. 132, 130 and 131 are sometimes called the &quot;ABC&quot; quartets because of their keys: A minor, B major, and C minor. They are thematically linked by the four notes of the harmonic minor scale&#x27;s second tetrachord. In his notes for the Quartetto Italiano&#x27;s recording of all six quartets, A. David Hogarth writes:


Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;obsession at that time with the upper four notes of the harmonic minor scale&quot; (Hogarth) predates these works. For an early example, see the first movement of his string trio, opus 9, no. 3.

==Appraisal==

Beethoven&#x27;s late quartets went far beyond the comprehension of musicians and audiences of his time. One musician said, &quot;we know there is something there, but we do not know what it is.&quot; Composer Louis Spohr called them &quot;indecipherable, uncorrected horrors&quot;.

Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception: these six quartets (including the &quot;Große Fuge&quot;) are widely considered to be among the greatest musical compositions of all time. The Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor W. Adorno, in particular, thought highly of them, and Igor Stravinsky called the &quot;Große Fuge&quot; &quot;an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever&quot;. Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Richard Wagner and Béla Bartók. Wagner said that Op. 131&#x27;s first movement &quot;reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music&quot;. Schubert&#x27;s last musical wish was to hear Op. 131, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death. Afterward, he remarked, &quot;After this, what is left for us to write?&quot; Beethoven also considered Op. 131 his single most perfect work.

==Other versions==
Arturo Toscanini and Felix Weingartner, among others, transcribed some of the late quartets for string orchestra.

<doc id="1024827" wikidata="Q147589" url="?curid=1024827" title="Kolo Touré">
<text>Kolo Abib Touré (born 19 March 1981) is an Ivorian professional football manager and former player. He most recently managed Championship club Wigan Athletic.

Beginning his career as a defender with ASEC Mimosas, Touré moved to English team Arsenal in 2002, where he made 326 appearances for the club and was a member of the 03–04 &#x27;invincibles&#x27; side. In 2009, he moved to Manchester City, where he was joined a year later by his younger brother, Yaya Touré, helping City earn their first league title in 44 years. In 2013, Touré signed for Liverpool. He is one of the ten players who have won the Premier League with two clubs, having won it with Arsenal and City. He also won the Scottish Premiership and Scottish League Cup with Celtic. He remains to date the African player with the most Premier League appearances (353 in total).

Touré is the second-most capped player for the Ivory Coast, with 120 appearances from 2000 to 2015. He represented the team at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup tournaments. Touré also represented the Ivory Coast at seven Africa Cup of Nations tournaments between 2002 and 2015, helping them finish runner-up in 2006 and 2012, while winning in 2015.

==Club career==
===Arsenal===
Born in Bouaké, Touré joined Premier League team Arsenal from ASEC Mimosas on a long-term contract for a fee of £150,000 on 14 February 2002 after a short trial. His status as a full international meant that he was able to secure a British work permit.

Touré made his debut for the first team on 11 August 2002, in the 1–0 win over Liverpool in the FA Community Shield, in which he played the final five minutes as a substitute for Dennis Bergkamp. Initially regarded as a utility player, he started his Arsenal career as a defensive midfielder as well as at right-back. He scored his first Arsenal goal at Stamford Bridge in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea on 1 September, having replaced the injured Edu after half an hour. Arsenal won the FA Cup, with Touré an unused substitute in the final against Southampton.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Wenger began using Touré as a central defender alongside Sol Campbell. Touré inherited his position from veteran Martin Keown, whom he praised as a mentor; Arsenal won the league without losing a game that season.

Touré was in and out of the Arsenal team during the 2004–05 season, battling for a first team place with the likes of Philippe Senderos and Pascal Cygan to play alongside Campbell in defence. Touré ended the season with a FA Cup winners medal playing 50 times for Arsenal that season and scoring one goal. His only goal of the 2004–05 season came in the 90th minute of Arsenal&#x27;s UEFA Champions League last 16 round tie against Bayern Munich of Germany. Arsenal lost the game 3–1.

Touré established himself as a permanent fixture in the Arsenal starting XI. In the 2005–06 season, he established a formidable defensive partnership with Senderos. Both centre-backs helped the Arsenal team reach the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final after keeping 10 consecutive clean sheets (a European competition record).

Touré scored his second European goal on 19 April 2006, the winner in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Villarreal CF. It was the final European goal scored at Highbury and the goal that effectively decided the tie (Arsenal won 1–0 on aggregate), to send Arsenal through to their first ever Champions League Final, in Paris, France.

In October 2006, Touré signed a new contract of undisclosed &quot;long-term&quot; length. The following 9 January, he captained the club for the first time in the absence of Gilberto Silva and Thierry Henry, in a 6–3 victory away to Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. He led Arsenal out for the final against Chelsea on 25 February, which his team lost 2–1. His challenge on Mikel John Obi caused a mass brawl which led to both players and Arsenal&#x27;s Emmanuel Adebayor being sent off, as well as a £100,000 fine for both London rival clubs.

On 13 April 2009, Touré demanded a move away from Arsenal after a reputed bust-up with defensive partner William Gallas. He reportedly handed in a transfer request which was later turned down by Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood. However, Touré temporarily reversed his decision and committed to the Gunners at least until the summer.

===Manchester City===
After much transfer speculation, it was announced on 28 July 2009 that Manchester City had agreed a fee of £14 million for Touré. After he successfully passed a medical in Manchester on 29 July 2009, Touré signed a four-year contract with the club which had the option of extending it to five years. City, who had finished 10th the previous season, had made a number of high-profile signings in preparation for the 2009–10 season, and Touré hoped to help make City a top four team. He was appointed the club captain by Mark Hughes. He scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 2–1 League Cup win over Fulham on 23 September 2009. He scored his first league goal for City against Burnley on 7 November 2009. Manchester City finished the season in fifth position, losing out to Tottenham Hotspur by just three points. On 2 July 2010, Kolo Touré was joined by his brother Yaya at Manchester City following a transfer believed to be worth around £24 million.

At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, Roberto Mancini took away the captain&#x27;s armband from Touré and gave it to Carlos Tevez. However, he remained part of Mancini&#x27;s plans and was a first team regular in defence. He was sent off in Manchester City&#x27;s 2–1 defeat to Everton on 20 December 2010, helping to deny City the chance to top the Premier League table on Christmas. On 15 January 2011, Touré scored the first goal in a 4–3 win for the Citizens against Wolves which sent them to the top of the league table.

On 3 March 2011, it was revealed that Touré had failed a drug test and had been suspended. The World Anti-Doping Agency imposed a 6-month suspension from football effective 2 March 2011.

In the 2011–12 season, Touré was used as a squad player, making 14 league appearances as Manchester City won a league title for the first time in 44 years.

===Liverpool===
On 28 May 2013, Liverpool announced that an agreement had been reached in principle to sign Touré on a free transfer from Manchester City. On 2 July he was unveiled as Liverpool&#x27;s first signing of the window and was handed the number 4 shirt. He signed a two-year contract. He made his Premier League debut for Liverpool on 17 August 2013 in a 1–0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield. On 2 February 2014, in a match against West Bromwich Albion he passed straight to opponent Victor Anichebe, who scored an equaliser. Twelve days later, he scored an own-goal in a match against Fulham, which eventually Liverpool won thanks to a late penalty from skipper Steven Gerrard. Liverpool were in contention to win the league title in 2013–14, which eventually went to Manchester City; had he won, Touré would have been the first player in English football since World War II to win the league with three clubs.

On 1 March 2015, he came on as an 83rd-minute substitute against Manchester City, marking the first time he and his brother Yaya, who started the match for City, faced each other in a competitive match. Liverpool won the match 2–1.

Touré scored his first Liverpool goal on 14 February 2016, heading in Jordan Henderson&#x27;s corner kick to confirm a 6–0 win away to bottom side Aston Villa. It was his first goal in any match since January 2011, and he celebrated wildly. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Touré was released.

===Celtic===
On 24 July 2016, Touré reunited with former manager Brendan Rodgers when he joined Celtic on a one-year contract. He made his debut on 3 August 2016, coming on as a substitute in the second half of Celtic&#x27;s 2–1 win over FC Astana in a Champions League qualifier. He made 20 appearances as Celtic completed an unbeaten domestic season, winning a treble of League, Cup and League Cup. Touré was not offered a new playing contract at the end of the season.

In September 2017, Touré announced his retirement and took up a coaching role with Celtic.

==International career==

Touré made his debut for Ivory Coast in April 2000 against Rwanda. He played in all five games for the Ivory Coast as they finished runners up to the hosts in the African Cup of Nations in Egypt in January 2006.

He was named in the 23-man squad taken by coach Henri Michel to the 2006 FIFA World Cup and made his first appearance in a FIFA World Cup on 11 June 2006 in a 2–1 loss to Argentina. He was also called up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was the captain in the team&#x27;s first game against Portugal due to Didier Drogba&#x27;s injury. On 10 August 2010, Touré headed the only goal of a friendly win over Italy at West Ham United&#x27;s Boleyn Ground.

In December 2014, Touré announced his intention to retire from international football after the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. He played his final game in the final of the tournament on 8 February 2015, where Ivory Coast beat Ghana 9–8 on penalties after the game ended 0–0. He took the seventh penalty for Ivory Coast, which he scored. On 15 February 2015, he confirmed his retirement from international duty.

==Coaching career==
On 9 August 2017, the Ivorian Football Federation appointed Touré as a new member of their coaching staff for the African Nations Championship and under-23 team. He joined Celtic&#x27;s coaching staff as a technical assistant in September 2017. In February 2019, Brendan Rodgers left Celtic for Leicester City, and Touré also joined Leicester as a first team coach.

=== Wigan Athletic ===
On 29 November 2022, Wigan Athletic appointed Touré as first team manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal. On 2 January 2023, Touré&#x27;s team lost their third consecutive game by the scoreline of 4–1, and dropped to last place in the Championship as a result. Toure was sacked by Wigan on 26 January 2023, with the club bottom of the Championship and failing to win any of his nine games in charge.

==Personal life==
He is the older brother of Ibrahim Touré and Yaya Touré. Ibrahim died of cancer in 2014, aged 28. They also have a sister, Belinda.

Touré is a Muslim and observes fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan, stating that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t affect me physically. It makes me stronger. You can do it when you believe so strongly in something. A normal human can be without water for much longer than one day.&quot;

Touré is married to Awo. As of 2011, they had a son and a daughter. His son, Yassine, is also pursuing a football career, having signed a two-year scholarship with Leicester City in December 2021.

<text>Cytochrome P450 2E1 (abbreviated CYP2E1, ) is a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, which is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. This class of enzymes is divided up into a number of subcategories, including CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3, which as a group are largely responsible for the breakdown of foreign compounds in mammals.

While CYP2E1 itself carries out a relatively low number of these reactions (~4% of known P450-mediated drug oxidations), it and related enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the breakdown of many toxic environmental chemicals and carcinogens that enter the body, in addition to basic metabolic reactions such as fatty acid oxidations.

CYP2E1 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is induced by ethanol, the diabetic state, and starvation. The enzyme metabolizes both endogenous substrates, such as ethanol, acetone, and acetal, as well as exogenous substrates including benzene, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene glycol, and nitrosamines which are premutagens found in cigarette smoke. Due to its many substrates, this enzyme may be involved in such varied processes as gluconeogenesis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, and cancer.

== Function ==
CYP2E1 is a membrane protein expressed in high levels in the liver, where it composes nearly 50% of the total hepatic cytochrome P450 mRNA and 7% of the hepatic cytochrome P450 protein. The liver is therefore where most drugs undergo deactivation by CYP2E1, either directly or by facilitated excretion from the body.

CYP2E1 enzyme metabolizes mostly small, polar molecules, including toxic laboratory chemicals such as dimethylformamide, aniline, and halogenated hydrocarbons &quot;(see table below)&quot;. While these oxidations are often of benefit to the body, certain carcinogens and toxins are bioactivated by CYP2E1, implicating the enzyme in the onset of hepatotoxicity caused by certain classes of drugs &quot;(see disease relevance section below).&quot;

CYP2E1 also plays a role in several important metabolic reactions, including the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde and to acetate in humans, where it works alongside alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. In the conversion sequence of acetyl-CoA to glucose, CYP2E1 transforms acetone via hydroxyacetone (acetol) into propylene glycol and methylglyoxal, the precursors of pyruvate, acetate and lactate.

CYP2E1 also carries out the metabolism of endogenous fatty acids such as the ω-1 hydroxylation of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, involving it in important signaling pathways that may link it to diabetes and obesity. Thus, it acts as a monooxygenase to metabolize arachidonic acid to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE) (see 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). However, it also acts as an epoxygenase activity to metabolize docosahexaenoic acid to epoxides, primarily 19&quot;R&quot;,20&quot;S&quot;-epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid and 19&quot;S&quot;,20&quot;R&quot;-epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid isomers (termed 19,20-EDP) and eicosapentaenoic acid to epoxides, primarily 17&quot;R&quot;,18&quot;S&quot;-eicosatetraenoic acid and 17&quot;S&quot;,18&quot;R&quot;-eicosatetraenoic acid isomers (termed 17,18-EEQ). 19-HETE is an inhibitor of 20-HETE, a broadly active signaling molecule, e.g. it constricts arterioles, elevates blood pressure, promotes inflammation responses, and stimulates the growth of various types of tumor cells; however the &quot;in vivo&quot; ability and significance of 19-HETE in inhibiting 20-HETE has not been demonstrated. The EDP (epoxydocosapentaenoic acid) and EEQ (epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid) metabolites have a broad range of activities. In various animal models and in vitro studies on animal and human tissues, they decrease hypertension and pain perception; suppress inflammation; inhibit angiogenesis, endothelial cell migration and endothelial cell proliferation; and inhibit the growth and metastasis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. It is suggested that the EDP and EEQ metabolites function in humans as they do in animal models and that, as products of the omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, the EDP and EEQ metabolites contribute to many of the beneficial effects attributed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids. EDP and EEQ metabolites are short-lived, being inactivated within seconds or minutes of formation by epoxide hydrolases, particularly soluble epoxide hydrolase, and therefore act locally. CYP2E1 is not regarded as being a major contributor to forming the cited epoxides but could act locally in certain tissues to do so.

=== Substrates ===
Following is a table of selected substrates of CYP2E1. Where classes of agents are listed, there may be exceptions within the class.
== Structure ==
CYP2E1 exhibits structural motifs common to other human membrane-bound cytochrome P450 enzymes, and is composed of 12 major α-helices and 4 β-sheets with short intervening helices interspersed between the two. Like other enzymes of this class, the active site of CYP2E1 contains an iron atom bound by a heme center which mediates the electron transfer steps necessary to carry out oxidation of its substrates. The active site of CYP2E1 is the smallest observed in human P450 enzymes, with its small capacity attributed in part to the introduction of an isoleucine at position 115. The side-chain of this residue protrudes out above the heme center, restricting active site volume compared to related enzymes that have less bulky residues at this position. T303, which also protrudes into the active site, is particularly important for substrate positioning above the reactive iron center and is hence highly conserved by many cytochrome P450 enzymes. Its hydroxyl group is well-positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to potential acceptors on the substrate, and its methyl group has also been implicated in the positioning of fatty acids within the active site. A number of residues proximal to the active site including L368 help make up a constricted, hydrophobic access channel which may also be important for determining the enzyme&#x27;s specificity towards small molecules and ω-1 hydroxylation of fatty acids. 

==Regulation==

=== Genetic regulation ===
In humans, the CYP2E1 enzyme is encoded by the &quot;CYP2E1&quot; gene. The enzyme has been identified in fetal liver, where it is posited to be the predominant ethanol-metabolizing enzyme, and may be connected to ethanol-mediated teratogenesis. In rats, within one day of birth the hepatic CYP2E1 gene is activated transcriptionally.

CYP2E1 expression is easily inducible, and can occur in the presence of a number of its substrates, including ethanol, isoniazid, tobacco, isopropanol, benzene, toluene, and acetone. For ethanol specifically, it seems that there exist two stages of induction, a post-translational mechanism for increased protein stability at low levels of ethanol and an additional transcriptional induction at high levels of ethanol.

=== Chemical regulation ===
CYP2E1 is inhibited by a variety of small molecules, many of which act competitively. Two such inhibitors, indazole and 4-methylpyrazole, coordinate with the active site&#x27;s iron atom and were crystallized with recombinant human CYP2E1 in 2008 to give the first true crystal structures of the enzyme. Other inhibitors include diethyldithiocarbamate (in cancer), and disulfiram (in alcoholism).

== Disease relevance ==
CYP2E1 is expressed in high levels in the liver, where it works to clear toxins from the body. In doing so, CYP2E1 bioactivates a variety of common anesthetics, including paracetamol (acetaminophen), halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane. The oxidation of these molecules by CYP2E1 can produce harmful substances such as trifluoroacetic acid chloride from halothane or NAPQI from paracetamol (acetaminophen) and is a major reason for their observed hepatotoxicity in patients.

CYP2E1 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes can inadvertently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in their active site when catalysis is not coordinated correctly, resulting in potential lipid peroxidation as well as protein and DNA oxidation. CYP2E1 is particularly susceptible to this phenomenon compared to other P450 enzymes, suggesting that its expression levels may be important for negative physiological effects observed in a number of disease states.

CYP2E1 expression levels have been correlated with a variety of dietary and physiological factors, such as ethanol consumption, diabetes, fasting, and obesity. It appears that cellular levels of the enzyme may be controlled by the molecular chaperone HSP90, which upon association with CYP2E1 allows for transport to the proteasome and subsequent degradation. Ethanol and other substrates may disrupt this association, leading to the higher expression levels observed in their presence. The increased expression of CYP2E1 accompanying these health conditions may therefore contribute to their pathogenesis by increasing the rate of production of ROS in the body.

According to a 1995 publication by Y Hu et al., a study in rats revealed a 8- to 9-fold elevation of CYP2E1 with fasting alone, compared to a 20-fold increase in enzyme level accompanied by a 16-fold increase in total catalytic capacity in rats who were both fasted and given large quantities of ethanol for 3 consecutive days. Starvation appears to upregulate CYP2E1 mRNA production in liver cells while alcohol seems to stabilize the enzyme itself post-translation and thus protect it from degradation by normal cellular proteolytic processes, giving the two an independent synergistic effect.

==Applications==
Trees have been genetically engineered to overexpress rabbit CYP2E1 enzyme. These transgenic trees have been used to remove pollutants from groundwater, a process known as phytoremediation.

<doc id="1024840" wikidata="Q6457208" url="?curid=1024840" title="LA Symphony">
<text>L.A. Symphony is an independent hip hop group from Los Angeles, California. Current members of L.A. Symphony are FLYNN (also known as Flynn Adam), UNO Mas, CookBook, Joey the Jerk (formerly Joey&#x27;s Dream), Sareem Poems (fka Sharlock Poems), Pigeon John and bTwice (collectively known as Brainwash Projects), and J-Beits a.k.a. Great Jason. Past members include Trendi MC (who compose Halieyoos Fishermen with Sharlok Poems and J-Beits), Coy (Paul &quot;Coy&quot; Allen), Xpress, Gaja and Beond of Acid Reign.

==History==
Formed in 1997, the band released their first album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Composition No. 1&quot; on independent record label Eartube Empire. They then recorded an album entitled &quot;Call It What You Want&quot; between 1999 and 2001 for Squint Entertainment. It contained tracks produced by the band and by Mario C, will.i.am and Prince Paul. It was slated to be released in April 2001 and was sold as a bootleg copy at live shows and online until unofficially released as &quot;CIWYW&quot;, in addition to a release a promotional EP titled &quot;Big Broke L.A.&quot; that contained tracks from &quot;Call It What You Want&quot;. The lead single was &quot;Broken Tape Decks&quot; and was released as a limited edition 12&quot; vinyl and CD single, with B-Side &quot;What You Say?!?&quot;. The album was never released due to issues with the label.

LA Symphony independently released the &quot;Baloney&quot; EP in 2002. Originally, 1000 limited edition copies were pressed, hand-numbered and shipped in resealable sandwich bags. &quot;Baloney&quot; was later re-pressed.

Following the &quot;Baloney&quot; EP, L.A. Symphony was signed to Gotee Records. They then released &quot;The End Is Now&quot; in 2003, &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Disappear Here&quot; in 2005. 2005 was also a year of personal tragedies for the band. &quot;CCM&quot; reported that immediately after re-signing to Gotee, three members experienced personal traumas—UNO came down with Guillain–Barré syndrome, CookBook&#x27;s father suffered from a stroke, and Joey&#x27;s grandfather also died.

In 2007, the group released a mixtape, &quot;Unleashed&quot;. Guests on the album include Posdnuos and Awol One.

In 2009, the members decided to put the group on hiatus. Since then several members have continued with solo projects.

On December 19, 2011, rumors started circulating (via bTwice&#x27;s Twitter account) about a reunion of the group. The group would likely welcome back former members bTwice, Pigeon John, J-Beits (aka Great Jason), and J-BoogiE. On February 15, 2012 it was announced by bTwice via Twitter that the group would play the 2012 Paid Dues festival. It was also said that former members Pigeon John, J-Beits (Great Jason), and bTwice will return to the group for this show.

In December 2014, released their first record together with all 8 members since 2003 in honor of their 15th anniversary called You Still on Earth!?!.

<doc id="1024843" wikidata="Q2605292" url="?curid=1024843" title="David Hahn">
<text>David Charles Hahn (October 30, 1976 – September 27, 2016), sometimes called the &quot;Radioactive Boy Scout&quot; and the &quot;Nuclear Boy Scout&quot; was an American nuclear radiation enthusiast who built a homemade neutron source at the age of seventeen.

A scout in the Boy Scouts of America, Hahn conducted his experiments in secret in a backyard shed at his mother&#x27;s house in Commerce Township, Michigan. Hahn&#x27;s goal was to build and demonstrate a homemade breeder reactor. While he never managed to build a reactor, in August 1994, Hahn&#x27;s progress attracted the attention of local police when they found concerning material in his vehicle during a stop for a separate matter. When Hahn warned them that the material was radioactive, the police contacted federal authorities, worried that he may have an atomic bomb. His mother&#x27;s property was cleaned up by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ten months later as a Superfund cleanup site. Hahn attained Eagle Scout rank shortly after his lab was dismantled.

While the incident was not widely publicized initially, it became better known following a 1998 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article by journalist Ken Silverstein. Hahn was also the subject of Silverstein&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;The Radioactive Boy Scout&quot;. As an adult, Hahn served in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. He was subsequently treated for mental illness, and his death at age 39 was related to drug and alcohol use.

==Early life==

Hahn was born on October 30, 1976, in Royal Oak, Michigan. His father, Ken Hahn, was a mechanical engineer. His mother, Patty Hahn, suffered from alcoholism and was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia and sent to a mental hospital when David was four. His parents divorced when he was nine, and his father gained custody. He had a stepmother, Kathy Missig, and a step-sister Kristina after his father remarried.

David&#x27;s stepgrandfather John Sims gave him &quot;The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments&quot; and encouraged his experiments in chemistry and science. David mowed other people&#x27;s lawns to help fund his experiments. With one experiment, he created chloroform and as the book encouraged him to sniff the chemical, he did so and was passed out for more than an hour, according to his recollection. David also loved to build fireworks and model rockets, which he altered with his own designs. As the experiments at home were becoming a problem and increasingly dangerous, David was encouraged by his father to join up with the Boy Scouts to provide discipline and distraction from his scientific endeavors.

==Creation of the neutron source==
Hahn was fascinated by chemistry and spent years conducting amateur chemistry experiments, which sometimes caused small explosions and other mishaps. He was inspired in part by reading &quot;The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments&quot; and tried to collect samples of every element in the periodic table, including the radioactive ones. He later received a merit badge in Atomic Energy and became fascinated with the idea of creating a breeder reactor in his home. Hahn diligently amassed radioactive material by collecting small amounts from household products, such as Americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping lantern mantles, radium from old clocks he had obtained from an antique store, and tritium from gunsights. His &quot;reactor&quot; was a bored-out block of lead, and he used lithium from $1,000 worth of purchased batteries to purify the thorium ash using a Bunsen burner.

Hahn ultimately hoped to create a breeder reactor, using low-level isotopes to transform samples of thorium and uranium into fissile isotopes.

His homemade neutron source was often incorrectly referred to as a nuclear reactor, but it did emit measurable levels of radiation, likely exceeding 1,000 times normal background radiation. Alarmed by this, David Hahn began to dismantle his experiments, but in a chance encounter, police discovered his activities, which triggered a Federal Radiological Emergency Response Team involving the FBI and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On June 26, 1995, the EPA, having designated Hahn&#x27;s mother&#x27;s property a Superfund hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and placed its contents in steel barrels, which were later buried as low-level radioactive waste in Utah. Unbeknownst to officials, his mother, fearful that she would lose her house if the full extent of the radiation were known, had already collected the majority of the radioactive material David Hahn had hidden in the house and thrown it away in the conventional garbage. Hahn refused medical evaluation for radiation exposure. EPA scientists believed that Hahn&#x27;s life expectancy may have been shortened due to his exposure to radioactivity, particularly since he spent long periods in the small, enclosed shed with large amounts of radioactive material and only minimal safety precautions, but he refused their recommendation that he be examined at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station.

==Career==
Hahn became depressed after the scandal, a problem exacerbated by the breakup with his then-girlfriend and the suicide of his mother in early 1996. While he did graduate from high school, he lacked any direction or plans thereafter. His father and stepmother first encouraged him to attend Macomb Community College. He enrolled in a metallurgy program there, but frequently skipped classes. He was then encouraged to join the military, so he enlisted in the Navy, assigned to the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier as an undesignated seaman (pay grade E-3). After a four-year tour, he achieved interior communications specialist with a rank of petty officer, third class (pay grade E-4).

After his time on USS &quot;Enterprise,&quot; Hahn enlisted in the Marine Corps and was stationed in North Carolina. After a few years, Hahn achieved the rank of lance corporal (E-3). Shortly after returning from a rotation in Japan, he was honorably discharged on medical grounds and returned to Michigan.

==FBI investigation==
On April 23, 2007, the FBI received a lead regarding Hahn&#x27;s alleged possession of a second neutron source in his freezer. Contacted via telephone, Hahn insisted that he was not in possession of radioactive material. The FBI decided no imminent terrorist threat was present but decided to attempt a personal interview. During an interview at an FBI office on May 16, 2007, investigators&#x27; questions touched on a variety of topics, such as flyers that Hahn had distributed promoting his book and upcoming film, theft of tires and rims from a vehicle prior to his Navy service, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, and a few less significant topics. FBI agents then interviewed an individual (whose identity was not released) who stated that Hahn was using cocaine heavily, was not taking his prescribed medication, was paranoid about people who he claimed &quot;had the ability to &#x27;shock&#x27; his genitals with their minds&quot;, and had possibly been visited by prostitutes. The individual also stated that he believed that Hahn was still trying to build a reactor and was collecting radium. He stated that he did not believe Hahn had any intentions of hurting anyone but was concerned about his mental state.

==Larceny of smoke detectors==
On August 1, 2007, Hahn was charged with larceny in Clinton Township, Michigan for allegedly removing a number of smoke detectors from the halls of his apartment building. His intention was to obtain americium from them. In his mug shot, his face was covered with sores, which investigators believed could have been from exposure to radioactive materials. During a Circuit Court hearing, Hahn pleaded guilty to attempted larceny of a building. The court&#x27;s online docket said prosecutors recommended that he be sentenced to time served and enter an inpatient treatment facility. Under terms of the plea, the original charge of larceny of a building would be dismissed at sentencing, scheduled for October 4. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for attempted larceny. Court records stated that his sentence would be delayed by six months while Hahn underwent medical treatment in the psychiatric unit of Macomb County Jail.

==Death==
On September 27, 2016, at the age of 39, Hahn died in his hometown of Shelby Charter Township, Michigan. His death was ruled an accidental result of intoxication from the combined effects of alcohol, fentanyl, and diphenhydramine. The medical examiner&#x27;s report indicated a blood alcohol concentration of 0.404 g/dL.

== In popular culture ==
The incident received scant media attention at the time, but was widely disseminated after writer Ken Silverstein published an article about the incident in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1998. In 2004 he expanded it into a book, &quot;The Radioactive Boy Scout&quot;, which was optioned for a feature film in 2016.

In 1999, University of Chicago physics majors Justin Kasper and Fred Niell, as part of a scavenger hunt that had as one of its items &quot;a breeder reactor built in a shed,&quot; successfully built a similar nuclear reactor that produced trace amounts of plutonium.

In the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;&quot;, the character Lawrence Wagner is based on Hahn.

A television documentary, &quot;The Nuclear Boy Scout&quot;, aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in 2003. In it, Hahn reenacted some of his methods for the camera.

Hahn&#x27;s experiments inspired others to attempt similar feats, particularly Taylor Wilson, who at age 14 became the youngest person to produce nuclear fusion.

Michael Stevens featured Hahn&#x27;s story in his Vsauce YouTube video &quot;Cruel Bombs&quot;.

StarQuest Production Network(SQPN)&#x27;s mystery program &quot;Jimmy Akin Mysterious World&quot;, dedicated episode #92 on Hahn called &quot;The Radioactive Boy Scout&quot;.

An episode of the CBS series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; features the protagonist attempting to build a nuclear reactor by extracting americium from smoke detectors.

Episode 6 of season 6 of &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; features a segment about Hahn&#x27;s nuclear experiment entitled &quot;Radioactive Boy Scout&quot; which originally aired October 24, 2014.

Duncan Jones claimed that the villain in his sci-fi film &quot;Source Code&quot; was inspired by the documentary &quot;The Nuclear Boy Scout&quot;.

Episode 20 of The Dollop Podcast covers Hahn&#x27;s exploits.

The song &quot;Baby Criminal&quot; by Swedish post-punk band Viagra Boys from their 2022 studio album &quot;Cave World&quot; is loosely based on Hahn&#x27;s life.

<text>Carl Axel Setterberg (1812-1871) was a Swedish-born Finnish architect. Setterberg provided much of the urban design for the city of Vaasa, Finland.
==Biography==
Setterberg was born at Bogsta parish in Södermanland, Sweden. He studied to become an architect at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm from 1834–1841. In May 1841, he got a job as building contractor in Gävleborg province, where he worked the following ten years. In this position he led many important building projects in Gävle and designed several public buildings. 

When he heard that the city of Vaasa in Finland had burned down to the ground in 1852, he became interested in the opportunities surrounding the rebuilding of the city. He travelled to Vaasa where the job as county architect was open, and in January 1853 he was temporarily appointed for the job after impressing the county governor Berndt Federley (1799–1863). In 1855, he permanently became county architect after he had becoming citizen of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

In 1854, he became the city architect and was commissioned with drawing up the new city plan on the isthmus of Klemetsö, about seven kilometres (4.3 miles) to the northwest from the old town. The new town of Nikolaistad (Finnish: &quot;Nikolainkaupunki&quot;), named after the late Tsar Nicholas I, rose in 1862. The new city had a modern square layout and was divided by wide streets. Setterberg also designed many of the city&#x27;s public and private buildings, like the Holy Trinity Church in 1869. In 1871, Setterberg died at Nikolaistad (renamed Vaasa during 1917).

In year 2000, Setterberg was voted the most significant person from Vaasa of all time. The poll was a part of Vaasa&#x27;s 400th anniversary celebration.

<doc id="1024848" wikidata="Q432343" url="?curid=1024848" title="Slack tide">
<text>Slack tide or slack water is the short period in a body of tidal water when the water is completely unstressed, and there is no movement either way in the tidal stream. It occurs before the direction of the tidal stream reverses. Slack water can be estimated using a tidal atlas or the tidal diamond information on a nautical chart. The time of slack water, particularly in constricted waters, does not occur at high and low water, and in certain areas, such as Primera Angostura, the ebb may run for up to three hours after the water level has started to rise. Similarly, the flood may run for up to three hours after the water has started to fall. In 1884, Thornton Lecky illustrated the phenomenon with an inland basin of infinite size, connected to the sea by a narrow mouth. Since the level of the basin is always at mean sea level, the flood in the mouth starts at half tide, and its velocity is at its greatest at the time of high water, with the strongest ebb occurring conversely at low water.

==Implications for seafarers==
For scuba divers, the absence of a flow means that less effort is required to swim and there is less likelihood of drifting away from a vessel or shore. Slack water following high tide can improve underwater visibility, as the previously incoming tide brings clear water with it. Following low tide, visibility can be reduced as the ebb draws silt, mud, and other particulates with it. In areas with potentially dangerous tides and currents, it is standard practice for divers to plan a dive at slack times.

For any vessel, a favourable flow will improve the vessel&#x27;s speed over the bottom for a given speed in the water. Difficult channels are also more safely navigated during slack water, as any flow may set a vessel out of a channel into danger.

==Combined tidal stream and current==
In many locations, in addition to the tidal streams there is also a current causing the tidal stream in the one direction to be stronger than, and last for longer than the stream in the opposite direction six hours later. Variations in the strength of that current will also vary the time when the stream reverses, thus altering the time and duration of slack water. Variations in wind stress also directly affect the height of the tide, and the inverse relationship between the height of the tide and atmospheric pressure is well understood (1 cm change in sea level for each 1 mb change in pressure) while the duration of slack water at a given location is inversely related to the height of the tide at that location.

==Misconceptions==
Slack water is different from the &#x27;stand of the tide&#x27;, which is when tide levels &#x27;stand&#x27; at a maximum or minimum (i.e., at that moment in time, not rising or falling).

==Dodge tides==
Some localities have unusual tidal characteristics, such as Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, where the amplitudes of the main semi-diurnal tide constituents are almost identical. At neap tides the semi-diurnal tide is virtually absent, resulting in the phenomenon known as a &quot;dodge tide&quot;—a day-long period of slack water—occurring twice a month; this effect is accentuated near the equinoxes when the diurnal component also vanishes, resulting in a period of 2–3 days of slack water.

<text>San Fernando Hill (officially known as Naparima Hill, and frequently referred to by the locals as simply The Hill) is a 192-m hill which lies at the centre of the city of San Fernando in Trinidad and Tobago. The hill, an outcrop of Argillite is the highest point in the Naparima Plains. Originally nearly dome-shaped with a flattened top, the size was reduced by more than a third as a result of unrestricted quarrying in the 1970s. The Hill originally supported semi-evergreen forest, but this was largely replaced by cultivated species prior to the devastation of the Hill by quarrying.

Quarrying on the Hill was not a new phenomenon, but the increase in demand for Argillite aggregate (for construction) during the oil boom of the 1970s led to an expansion of quarrying to the point where it appeared that the entire Hill would be removed. Protests by citizens&#x27; groups led to a halt to quarrying and the Hill was included in the National Parks and Protected Areas plan of 1980. The Forestry Division of Trinidad and Tobago Forestry Division took over management of the Hill and have since constructed a visitor centre and recreation area on the Hill. When visiting the centre, one can look out over a commanding view of south and central Trinidad, the Gulf Of Paria, and on a clear day, the coast of nearby Venezuela. Several World War II-era bunkers also exist on the Hill, but they are not readily accessible to the public.

During the late 1980s the then mayor of San Fernando, Dr. Romesh Mootoo suggested that the City Hall be removed to the Hill, calling it &quot;the Acropolis of the Caribbean&quot;. Nothing came of these plans, however. With the development of the Hill as a recreation area, the burgess of San Fernando and surrounding have re-connected with the Hill. During the Christmas season, a large star, lit electrically, can be seen all over the surrounding area, from its place on the San Fernando Hill.

Based on the Masters research of Tyrone Kalpee, (now of BP), an innovative plan for the restoration of the bare-rock surface of the formerly quarried areas (which make up about 3/4 of the Hill) was developed based on &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;, a fast-growing leguminous tree species. The Forestry Division incorporated Kalpee&#x27;s plans into its restoration plan for the Hill, and as a result many areas support relatively lush vegetation.

<text>Olodum is a &quot;bloco-afro&quot; from Salvador&#x27;s carnival, in Bahia, Brazil. It was founded by the percussionist Neguinho do Samba.

== Banda Olodum (Olodum&#x27;s Band) ==
The name comes from the Yoruba word Olodumare. Olodum is widely credited with developing the music style known as samba reggae and for its active participation in &quot;carnaval&quot; each year. Neguinho do Samba, the lead percussionist, created a mix of the traditional Brazilian samba beat with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms for the Bahian Carnival of 1986; this became known as samba reggae. This &quot;bloco afro&quot; music is closely tied to its African roots, as seen through its percussion instruments, participatory dancing and unique rhythm. It also directly draws from many Caribbean cultures, like Cuba and Puerto Rico. Olodum gained worldwide notoriety as an African-Brazilian percussive group and performed in Europe, Japan, and almost all of South America. Olodum&#x27;s performing band (or &quot;Banda&quot;) has released records in its own right and has been featured on recordings by Brazilian stars such as Simone and Daniela Mercury. In 1988, Simone recorded &quot;Me ama mô&quot; live, in Pelourinho, featuring Neguinho do Samba and Olodum, for Simone&#x27;s album, &quot;Simone&quot;.

In 1990, Olodum performed on Paul Simon&#x27;s album &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, appearing on the song &quot;The Obvious Child,&quot; as well as in its accompanying music video. On November 17 of that year, they performed the song with Simon on the American variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and subsequently appeared in Simon&#x27;s Central Park concert the following year.

In 1996, the band appeared on heavy metal band Sepultura&#x27;s album &quot;Roots&quot;. Later that year, they participated in the music video and music for &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot; Michael Jackson&#x27;s, from his ninth studio album &quot;&quot;. The first video clip was recorded in Pelourinho and featured Jackson collaborating with the 200 members of Olodum, who played music in the video. The media interest surrounding the video exposed Olodum to 140 countries around the world, bringing them worldwide fame and increasing their credibility in Brazil. After this, Olodum recorded with famous artists from Brazil and abroad, such as Wayne Shorter, Jimmy Cliff, Herbie Hancock, Pet Shop Boys and Caetano Veloso.

In 2013, the band played live with Kimbra on Rock in Rio&#x27;s sunset stage, performing a cover of &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot;. The following year, they participated in &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola),&quot; the official song of the FIFA World Cup 2014, with rapper Pitbull and singers Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte. On June 12, they performed the song at the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, along with Pitbull, Lopez and Leitte, in Arena Corinthians, São Paulo, prior to the Brazil v. Croatia match.

==Causes (Olodum School) ==

Olodum develops activism to combat social discrimination, boost the self-esteem and pride of Afro-Brazilians, and defend and fight to secure civil and human rights for marginalized people in Bahia and Brazil. It developed a social project called Escola Olodum (Olodum School).

Annually, since 1980, in Salvador&#x27;s Bahian Carnival, Olodum discusses topics related to the importance of African culture in the construction of society, as in the 2014 carnival theme, &quot;Ashanti - The Golden Throne and the Queen Yaa Asantewaa.&quot; The theme song is chosen in a songwriter competition called FEMADUM (in English, Olodum&#x27;s Music and Arts Festival).

==Notable deaths==
Olodum percussionist Neguinho do Samba died of heart failure on October 31, 2009, at the age of 54. On June 13, 2011, Olodum&#x27;s ex-vocalist and songwriter Germano Meneghel, author of hits like &quot;Avisa lá,&quot; &quot;Vem, Meu Amor,&quot; &quot;Alegria Geral,&quot; and the posthumous &quot;Várias Queixas,&quot; was found dead in his home at age 49; the cause of death is still unknown.

<doc id="1024859" wikidata="Q1964681" url="?curid=1024859" title="Methven Castle">
<text>Methven Castle is a privately owned 17th-century house situated east of Methven, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland.

==History==
The lands of Methven were owned by the Mowbray family from the 12th century. The Mowbrays supported the claim of John Balliol against Robert the Bruce, and on the latter&#x27;s victory Methven was confiscated by the crown, and given to Walter Stewart, the Bruce&#x27;s son-in-law. His descendant, Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, was deprived of the lands following his involvement in a plot to kill King James I. The castle sustained a siege in 1444, and was visited by King James II in 1450. King James IV visited several times in the 1490s.

Methven Castle was given to Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), queen of James IV, King of Scots, and daughter of Henry VII of England, on 29 May 1503 as part of her marriage gift. She lived at Methven after her third marriage to Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, in 1528. Margaret Tudor died here on 18 October 1541. After the third Lord Methven died without heir in 1584, King James VI gave Methven to his favourite, the Duke of Lennox. In 1664 the estate was purchased by Patrick Smythe of Braco.

The present building is dated 1664, and was designed and built by the mason-architect John Mylne. It may incorporate older work including the central spine wall. An early drawing for Methven by Patrick Smythe shows a plan with similarities to Pitreavie Castle near Dunfermline. The architect James Smith may have been involved in the project.

The Smythe family remained in possession throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, making additions to the castle and the grounds. In 1923 the castle was sold, and changed hands several times until 1984, when owner and architect Kenneth Murdoch began extensive restoration work. The east wing was demolished, following the west wing which was pulled down in the 1950s, leaving only the 17th-century house, which was given a new roof. The castle is currently owned by David Murdoch, and is a category A listed building.

==Architecture==
It comprises a square, four-storey main block, with narrow circular towers at each corner. These have ogee-shaped roofs, and the whole building is harled. The north front has a pair of crow-stepped gables, linked by a balustrade. An east wing was added first, then a western extension with a bay window, built around 1815, probably by James Gillespie Graham. Graham produced designs for rebuilding the whole structure, but this was never carried out. The building also had a clock tower, but this was demolished around 1965. Inside, the building was remodelled in 1800, and only a stair remains of the original interiors.

==Grounds==
Parkland was laid out around the castle from the late 18th century. David Smythe, Lord Methven planted many of the woodlands, and a walled garden was constructed in 1796. In 1830 a pinetum, an arboretum consisting of conifers, was established, and is considered the first in Scotland. David&#x27;s son William continued to expand the estate and constructed glasshouses. Although the woodlands continued to be managed into the 20th century, the gardens were neglected and numerous trees felled, including much of the pinetum, in the 1950s. The largest surviving tree is the Pepperwell Oak, with a girth of , as measured in 1985. In 1883 this tree was thought to be already 400 years old. The parks and gardens are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens.

<text>Christian tradition is a collection of traditions consisting of practices or beliefs associated with Christianity. Many churches have traditional practices, such as particular patterns of worship or rites, that developed over time. Deviations from such patterns are sometimes considered unacceptable by followers, or are regarded as heretical. There are certain Christian traditions that are practiced throughout the liturgical year, such as praying a daily devotional during Advent, erecting a nativity scene during Christmastide, chalking the door on Epiphany Day, fasting during Lent, waving palms on Palm Sunday, eating easter eggs during Eastertide, and decorating the church in red on Pentecost.

Tradition also includes historic teaching of the recognized church authorities, such as Church Councils and ecclesiastical officials (e.g., the Pope, Patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop of Canterbury, etc.), and includes the teaching of significant individuals like the Church Fathers, the Protestant Reformers, and the founders of denominations. Many creeds, confessions of faith, and catechisms generated by these bodies, and individuals are also part of the traditions of various bodies.

==Tradition and ecclesial traditions==
The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Persian churches distinguish between what is called Apostolic or sacred tradition and ecclesiastical traditions. In the course of time ecclesial traditions develop in theology, discipline, liturgy, and devotions. These the Church may retain, modify or even abandon. Apostolic tradition, on the other hand, is the teaching that was handed down by the Apostles by word of mouth, by their example and &quot;by the institutions they established&quot;, among which is the apostolic succession of the bishops: &quot;this living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition&quot;. &quot;And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God, which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit.&quot;

&quot;Prima scriptura&quot; is upheld by the Anglican and Methodist traditions, which teach that Scripture is the primary source for Christian doctrine, but that &quot;tradition, experience, and reason&quot; can subordinately inform Christian practice as long as they are in harmony with the Bible. In Methodism, sacred tradition refers to &quot;church&#x27;s consensual interpretation of the Bible&quot; and in view of the &quot;prima scriptura&quot; perspective, informs doctrine, such as that regarding infant baptism for example, in which Methodist teaching appeals to Scripture chiefly, along with the teachings of the Church Fathers and early Methodist divines for support of the practice.

For many denominations of Christianity, included in sacred tradition are the writings of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, Nicene Fathers and Post-Nicene Fathers.

In his book, James F. Keenan reports studies by some Catholic academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are &quot;simply not true&quot;. After examining seven medieval texts about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, &quot;far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible&quot;. He calls the tradition&#x27;s teaching of the Church &quot;incoherent&quot;. Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that tradition itself is &quot;not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching.&quot; Keenan, however, says that studies of &quot;manualists&quot; such as John T. Noonan Jr. has demonstrated that, &quot;despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition.&quot; Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at &quot;areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not&quot;.

==Branches==
In the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, sacred tradition, but not &quot;ecclesial traditions&quot;, is considered official doctrine and of equal authoritative weight to the Bible. In the Anglican and Methodist traditions, sacred tradition, along with reason and experience, inform Christian practice at a level subordinate to Sacred Scripture (see &quot;prima scriptura&quot;). Among the Lutheran and Reformed traditions of Christianity, the Bible itself is the only final authority (see &quot;sola scriptura&quot;), but tradition still plays an important supporting role. All three groups generally accept the traditional developments on the doctrine of the Trinity, for instance, and set bounds of orthodoxy and heresy based on that tradition. They also have developed creedal and confessional statements which summarize and develop their understanding of biblical teaching. For instance, the Nicene Creed.

<text>The Morocco national football team (Arabic: المنتخب المغربي لكرة القدم) represents Morocco in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Morocco.

One of Africa&#x27;s most successful national football teams, Morocco won the 1976 African Cup of Nations, two African Nations Championships, and a FIFA Arab Cup while participating in the FIFA World Cup six times. In 1986, they made history as the first African team to top a World Cup group and advance to the knockout stage, where they lost 1–0 to West Germany. Thirty-six years later, at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Morocco once again defied expectations, topping a group that included Croatia, Canada and Belgium. They then went on to defeat Spain and Portugal, becoming the first African and first Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final. They were the third World Cup semi-finalist not from Europe or South America.

Morocco is set to become the second African nation, the second MENA nation, and the first North African nation to host the World Cup when it was chosen as a co-host for the 2030 edition alongside Portugal and Spain.

The Atlas Lions were ranked 10th in the FIFA World Rankings in April 1998. They were ranked as the top African national team for three consecutive years, from 1997 to 1999, and again since December 2022. As of December 2024, Morocco is ranked as the 14th-best national team in the world.

== History ==
===Pre-independence period===

The Moroccan national team was founded in 1928 and played its first game on 22 December of that year against France&#x27;s B team, losing 2–1. This team, formed by the best footballers of the LMFA, or the Moroccan Football League (settlers or natives), was active in friendly matches against other North African teams such as Algeria and Tunisia. These associations of settler clubs and local footballers, in addition to having their own championship, clashed with each other in a tournament that Morocco won several times, such as in 1948–1949. The LMFA also faced other club teams such as NK Lokomotiva Zagreb in January 1950, as well as France A and France B.

On 9 September 1954, an earthquake struck the Algerian region of Orléansville (now Chlef), destroying the city and killing 1,400 people. On 7 October 1954, the French Football Association and the Maghreb inhabitants organized a charity match to raise funds for the families of the victims of the earthquake. In the match, held at the Parc de Princes in Paris, a team made up of Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians played against France. Led by star Larbi Benbarek, the Maghreb selection managed to win 3–2, a month before the Toussaint Rouge attacks by the Algerian National Liberation Front which marked the beginning of the Algerian War.

===Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)===

In 1955, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation was established, at the end of the French protectorate of Morocco, which had lasted since 1912.

On 19 October 1957, at the second edition of the Arab Games in Lebanon, Morocco made its debut as an independent country against Iraq, at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, and drew 3–3. At the tournament, Morocco recorded their first-ever win, defeating Libya 5–1, then beat Tunisia 3–1 to reach the semi-finals. After a 1–1 draw with Syria, lots were drawn to decide who would progress to the final, and Syria were selected at Morocco&#x27;s expense. Morocco withdrew from the third-place play-off against Lebanon and finished fourth overall.

Between 1957 and 1958, Morocco held numerous friendly matches against the National Liberation Front team, the representative of Algeria before its independence in 1958. In 1959, the team took part for the first time in an international competition, the qualifying rounds of the 1960 Rome Olympics. Drawn into a group with Tunisia and Malta, Morocco finished second on goal difference and failed to progress. That same year, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation joined FIFA.

In 1960, Morocco competed in World Cup qualification for the first time. Drawn against Tunisia in the first round, Morocco won the first leg 2–1, while Tunisia won the second leg by the same score. A play-off held in Palermo, Italy finished in a draw, so a coin toss was used to determine who progressed. Morocco won the toss, and beat Ghana 1–0 on aggregate to reach the inter-continental play-offs. Drawn against Spain, Morocco lost 4–2 on aggregate and thus failed to qualify.

The following year, Morocco held the Pan-Arab Games and won the football tournament, winning all five of their matches. Their third match, against Saudi Arabia, resulted in Morocco&#x27;s biggest-ever victory, winning 13–1. They also claimed their first two wins against a European team, beating East Germany 2–1 and 2–0.

In 1963, the Moroccan team came close to qualifying for the African Cup of Nations; in the decisive play-off against Tunisia, they were defeated 4–1 in Tunis and won 4–2 at home, therefore being eliminated. At the 1963 Mediterranean Games in Naples, they finished fourth after a 2–1 defeat in the final for third place against Spain&#x27;s reserve team.

===First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)===

Morocco participated in the final phase of an international competition for the first time at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Having qualified under the leadership of manager Mohamed Massoun, the Moroccans were included in a group of three teams due to the withdrawal of North Korea. Morocco lost both their matches, against Hungary (6–0, the team&#x27;s worst-ever defeat) and Yugoslavia (3–1, despite taking the lead in the second minute via Ali Bouachra).

In 1966, the Moroccan Football Association joined the Confederation of African Football, and the team participated in qualifying for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Their debut eliminated Senegal (1–0) and Tunisia after a draw. In the final round of the preliminaries, against Sudan and Nigeria, Morocco obtained five points, finishing ahead of Nigeria. Shortly after, Morocco lost the decisive play-off against Algeria to enter the final stage of the 1970 Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco thus became the first African national team to qualify for the World Cup after having played in an elimination tournament. The Moroccan team, coached by the Yugoslav Blagoje Vidinić, consisted entirely of players in the Moroccan league, including Driss Bamous and Ahmed Faras.

On 3 June 1970, against West Germany, Morocco opened the scoring with a goal in the 21st minute of the game scored by Houmane Jarir. In the second half, however, the Germans scored twice and won 2–1. The Atlas Lions then played against Peru, conceding three goals in ten minutes to lose 3–0. On 11 June 1970, the eliminated Moroccans drew with Bulgaria 1–1. It was the first point obtained by an African national team at the World Cup.

In 1972 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, the Atlas Lions ousted Algeria, then faced Egypt, defeating them 3–0 in the first leg and suffering a 3–2 defeat on the way back. However, the aggregate win meant they qualified for the final phase of the continental tournament for the first time. In the group stage, they accumulated three 1–1 draws against Congo, Sudan and Zaire and were eliminated in the first round. All three Moroccan goals were scored by Ahmed Faras.

Qualifying for the 1972 Olympics in Munich with two wins and two draws, Morocco debuted in Group A with a goalless draw against the United States, then lost 3–0 against hosts West Germany and defeated Malaysia 6–0 with a Faras hat-trick, thereby advancing to the second round. Due to defeats against USSR (3–0), Denmark (3–1) and Poland (5–0), they were eliminated from the tournament; finishing bottom of their group. To date, this result remains the best performance of the Atlas Lions at the Olympic football tournament.

In the 1974 World Cup qualifiers, Morocco successfully passed three qualifying rounds before entering the final stage alongside Zambia and Zaire. Losing 4–0 away against Zambia, the Moroccans bounced back in the second game, defeating the same opponent 2–0 at home. They then went to Zaire for their third game but lost 3–0, conceding all three goals in the second half, with Faras leaving the field due to injury. Morocco filed an appeal, trying to get the match to be replayed; it was dismissed by FIFA. In protest, Morocco withdrew from the qualifiers causing the Atlas Lions to miss their final game at home against Zaire which had already qualified for the finals, with FIFA awarding Zaire a 2–0 win on walkover. For the same reason, Morocco also decided not to take part in the 1974 African Cup of Nations qualification. As a result, in 1974, Morocco played only two games, both against Algeria, achieving a 2–0 win and a 0–0 draw. Morocco then resumed playing in FIFA and CAF competitions, qualifying for the 1976 Africa Cup of Nations by eliminating Ghana in the last round, but failed to qualify for the 1976 Olympics, being eliminated by Nigeria.

===Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)===
Morocco, coached by the Romanian Virgil Mărdărescu and captained by Faras, took the continental throne at 1976 African Cup of Nations, in only the country&#x27;s second participation in the competition. Ahmed Makrouh scored in the final to equalize at 1–1, which gave Morocco the first, and to date, only cup in its history.

After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, they also missed the 1978 and 1982 tournaments. At the 1978 Africa Cup of Nations, they were eliminated in the first round, while in 1980 they finished in third place, beating Egypt 2–0. They then won the 1983 Mediterranean Games, played at home, after a 3–0 win in the final against Turkey B.

Morocco did not qualify for either the 1982 or 1984 Africa Cup of Nations. Two years later, they finished fourth, losing 3–2 in the third-place play-off to Ivory Coast.

===Difficult Years (1986–2000)===

Morocco qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, and topped a group consisting Portugal, England and Poland, thanks to two draws against the English and Polish and a 3–1 win against the Portuguese. However, they were narrowly eliminated by West Germany in the first knockout round, thanks to a goal from Lothar Matthäus one minute from the end of regulation time. Morocco became the first African and Arab national team to advance from the first round of the World Cup.

Two years later, the Moroccan team presented itself at the 1988 African Cup of Nations as a host country with high expectations. After winning in the first round, they were eliminated in the semifinals by Cameroon and finished in fourth place after losing the third-place play-off against Algeria 1–1 after extra time, 4–3 after penalties.

Failure to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup opened a period of crisis. In the 1992 African Cup of Nations, the team was eliminated in the first round. They then did not participate in the 1994 or 1996 African Cup tournaments. They, however, did qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the United States and the 1998 tournament in France.

At the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations, after winning their group, Morocco were defeated by South Africa 2–1.

===Golden Generation (2006–present)===
Morocco took part in the 2004 African Cup of Nations, drawn into Group D defeating Nigeria 1–0, defeating Benin 4–0 and drawing 1–1 with South Africa. Morocco qualified to the knockout stages, facing Algeria; they eventually won 3–1 in extra time, and 4–0 against Mali in the semi-final. They lost the 2004 African Cup of Nations Final against Tunisia 2–1.

In 2012, the national team won the Arab Cup, topping their group, defeating Iraq in the semi-final and Libya in the final.

In 2014, Morocco debuted in the African Nations Championship after failing to qualify in the 2009 and 2011 editions. Led by coach Hassan Benabicha, Morocco were eliminated in the second round after losing 4–3 to Nigeria in the quarter-finals. They managed to qualify for the 2016 African Nations Championship, but were eliminated in the group stages. Morocco hosted the 2018 African Nations Championship, which included a victory for the home nation, the third North African country to win the competition&#x27;s title.
Morocco returned to the World Cup after a 20-year absence in 2018. The North Africans were drawn in Group B with World Cup favourites Spain, Portugal, and Iran. In their opening game against Iran, Morocco showed full dedication but lost 10 in the final minutes of the match, scored by an own goal. In their second game, Morocco faced Portugal but ended losing 1–0 by a goal scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. In the last match against Spain they took a 2–1 lead, with goals scored by Khalid Boutaïb and Youssef En-Nesyri, but the match eventually ended 2–2.

Morocco entered the 2019 AFCON with high confidence and players claiming them to be the favourite to win. However, in spite of three straight group stage wins, Morocco were shockingly knocked out by Benin in the round of sixteen.

At the 2020 African Nations Championship in Cameroon, Morocco won their second CHAN title, in its second consecutive final appearance. Captained by Ayoub El Kaabi, they defeated Togo (1–0), Rwanda (0–0), the Uganda (5–2), Zambia (3–1), and Cameroon (4–0) on the way to a final against Mali in Yaoundé. Morocco won 2–0, with both goals scored late into the second half by Soufiane Bouftini and Ayoub El Kaabi. Morocco thus became the first team to win back-to-back titles. Soufiane Rahimi went on to be named Total Man of the tournament after an astonishing performance scoring a total of 5 goals.

In December 2021, Morocco started its venture at the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup&#x27;s Group C, along with Jordan, Palestine and Saudi Arabia. Morocco opened the tournament with a 4–0 win against Palestine, and then managed to overcome a highly defensive Jordan with another 4–0 triumph, before winning their final match in a 1–0 victory against Saudi Arabia. They were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a penalty-shootout against Algeria.

After easily topping their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification group which consisted of Mauritania, Burundi, and Central African Republic, Morocco entered the tournament in Cameroon. Morocco were drawn into group E alongside Gabon, Ghana and Comoros, and won their first game against Ghana scored by Sofiane Boufal in the final minutes of the game. In their second game against Comoros, they claimed a 2–0 victory. Their final match against Gabon ended in a draw, making Morocco reach the round of 16 after ending up first in the group. They defeated Malawi 2–1 in the round of 16, before being eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 2–1 loss against Egypt.
After qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by winning the third round of CAF qualifiers, the team was drawn in Group F along with Croatia, Belgium, and Canada. After holding previous runners-up Croatia to a 0–0 draw and defeating Belgium 2–0, a 2–1 win over Canada meant they finished top of the group and advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1986. In the round of 16, they met Spain, drawing 0–0. In the subsequent penalty shootout, goalkeeper Yassine Bounou saved two penalties, and Achraf Hakimi scored the decisive penalty with a panenka penalty for Morocco to advance to the quarter-finals for the first time. They advanced further to the semi-finals winning against favourite Portugal, 1–0, with a powerful header by Youssef En-Nesyri. Morocco therefore became the first African and Arab team to qualify for the semi-finals.

However, they lost to France in the semi-final, 2–0 on 14 December at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, putting an end to Morocco&#x27;s World Cup run. They played Croatia in the third place play-off on 17 December at the Khalifa International Stadium in Al-Rayyan, a rematch of the earlier group stage meeting. They lost 2–1 to the latter, and ended their World Cup campaign at fourth place. The team would go on to donate their entire World Cup earnings from the tournament to charities within Morocco that help with poverty that affects children and families in the country.

==Home stadium==
From 2011, the Atlas Lions played most of their matches in the new Marrakesh Stadium, which has a capacity of 45,240 seats.

<text>Joseph Adolphe Rovan (born Joseph Adolph Rosenthal in Munich, Germany on July 25, 1918, died July 27, 2004), was a French philosopher and politician, and is considered a spiritual father of post-war Europe. Initially born into the Jewish faith, on Whitsunday 1944 he was received into the Catholic Church.

Rovan was active in the French Resistance during World War II and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance for his services. In 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo and survived 10 months in the Dachau concentration camp. It was during this time that he converted to Catholicism. In 1945, after his return to France, he wrote in the magazine &quot;Esprit&quot; the article &quot;L&#x27;Allemagne de nos mérites,&quot; where he suggested that the creation of a democratic Germany on the ruins of the Third Reich was the responsibility of the Allies.

Rovan has also been awarded the Legion d&#x27;Honneur, the Ordre National du Mérite, the German Order of Merit with Star, and the Bavarian Order of Merit. He died in a swimming accident in France.

<text>Air Botswana Corporation is Botswana&#x27;s state-owned national flag carrier, with its headquarters located in Gaborone. It operates scheduled domestic and regional flights from its main base at Sir Seretse Khama International Airport. Air Botswana has been loss-making for several years, and there have been various attempts to privatise the company, and frequent changes to the corporation&#x27;s management and board, so far without reducing the losses.

==History==

===Formative years (1972–1986)===
Air Botswana (Pty.) Limited was founded on 2 July 1972 to succeed two failed former national airlines: Botswana National Airways (1966–1969) and Botswana Airways Corporation (1970–1971). Air Botswana Holdings was responsible for the ownership and leasing of aircraft, and served as the holding company for Air Botswana. During the early years, Air Botswana (Pty.) Limited acted as a contractor for numerous flight services, which were contracted to South African Protea Airways, via a local subsidiary, Air Services Botswana.

Flight operations began on 1 August 1972 utilising the only aircraft of the company: a Fokker F-27 Friendship. Throughout the 1970s, Air Botswana operated a round-trip route from Gaborone-Manzini-Johannesburg-Harare-Gaborone, in addition to domestic services to Francistown, Maun and Selebi-Phikwe. By the late 1970s, Air Botswana operated one HS 748, one Douglas DC-3 and one Vickers Viscount 754, the latter on lease from Protea Airways.

The contract with Air Services Botswana for operation of the airline was not renewed, and in 1981 British Airways was awarded a contract for the operation of the airline for a six-year period. Also in 1981, &quot;Botswana Development Corporation&quot; was formed as a part of Air Botswana Holdings, with the corporation being tasked to acquire an aircraft for the airline to lease. The Fokker F27 was again chosen, and because of a lack of their own trained crews, the airline seconded crews from Comair and contracted maintenance out to Safair Freighters. In 1983 a Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules was leased and Air Botswana Cargo was formed to operate cargo charters, and when South African Airways ended services to Lesotho and Swaziland, a second F27 was acquired and services to Maseru and Manzini were inaugurated. A sixteen-seat Dornier 228-200 was leased in December 1984 from Kalahari Air Service, with the latter flying and maintaining the aircraft for Air Botswana. The 57 million pula Sir Seretse Khama International Airport opened on 10 December 1984, seeing Air Botswana operating from the airport. By the end of 1986, the route network included Gaborone, Francistown, Johannesburg, Harare, Lusaka, Manzini, Maseru, Maun, Selebi-Phikwe and Victoria Falls.

===Government corporation===

On 1 April 1988, Air Botswana was absorbed by the Botswana government as a parastatal corporation under the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications as a result of the &quot;Air Botswana Act (1988)&quot;, and became the nation&#x27;s flag carrier. Also in April 1988, Air Botswana became the first airline from the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) to establish air links with Namibia. Air Botswana operations are regulated by the &quot;Botswana Department of Civil Aviation&quot;, under the &quot;Civil Aviation Act (1977)&quot;.

Two ATR 42–230 arrived in 1988, leading to the sale of the Fokkers, and the first BAe 146 arrived in November 1989. The BAe 146 entered service on 12 November on the Gaborone-Harare route, operated five times per week in conjunction with Air Zimbabwe, along with other destinations of the network of the airline in southern Africa. The airline also entered into block-seat arrangements with international airlines, including an agreement with British Caledonian which provided seats on the Lusaka-Gaborone sector of the London-Lusaka-Gaborone service.

In December 1992, the government enacted the &quot;Control of Smoking Act (1992)&quot;, and Air Botswana became the first company in Botswana to respond to the act by banning smoking on all domestic flights in 1993, which was extended to all flights in the Southern African Development Community region in 1995. Whilst the years 1988 to 1993 saw Air Botswana incurring financial losses, in 1994 the government wrote off P74 million of the airline&#x27;s losses and converted them into equity.

===Destruction of fleet (1999)===
On 11 October 1999, the airline was crippled when one of its pilots, Chris Phatswe, crashed an empty ATR 42 aircraft into Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, destroying the aircraft and two more Air Botswana ATR 42s. Phatswe had stolen the aircraft in the early morning, and once in the air had informed the air traffic control tower that he intended to kill himself; and requested by radio to speak to several people, including President Festus Mogae and the airline&#x27;s general manager. As Mogae was out of the country, arrangements were made for Phatswe to speak to Vice President Seretse Ian Khama, who expressed willingness to speak to Phatswe.

After the aircraft circled Gaborone for two hours, Phatswe crashed it at a speed of into the airline&#x27;s two other ATR 42s, which were parked on the apron, destroying all three aircraft. The incident left the company with only a single BAe 146, which had been non-operational for a year because of technical problems, forcing the airline to lease an aircraft to operate scheduled flights. It was revealed that Phatswe had been grounded for medical reasons, was refused reinstatement, and was regrounded until February 2000.

===Privatisation attempts===
Because the airline had been regularly posting financial losses, which was in part is due to overstaffing, the operation of an ageing, fuel-inefficient fleet, increasing operational costs, inadequate management expertise and an inability to retain and attract qualified pilots, the government earmarked Air Botswana to be the first of the parastatals to be privatised. The costs which the airline incurs, in conjunction with low quality of service, poor marketing, high insurance premiums and a slow uptake on new technology, has restricted growth potential for the airline. However, in the five years to 2003, the government had not had to subsidise Air Botswana, and in the previous six years had made a profit.

The privatisation process began on 19 April 2000, when the government signed a consultancy agreement with World Bank-affiliated International Finance Corporation, which saw IFC being appointed as the government&#x27;s main adviser in the privatisation process.

In 2003, the government attempted to privatise the airline, with Air Mauritius and Comair put forward as strategic partners. The process would have seen the winning bidder receiving a 45 percent stake in Air Botswana, with the government holding a further 45 percent, and employees holding the remaining 10 percent. It was planned that once the airline has firmed its position under new ownership, it would be listed on the Botswana Stock Exchange. Air Mauritius withdrew from the process in September 2003, citing the downturn in global air travel markets since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City. Comair withdrew in December 2003, due in part to increased competition by low-cost airlines in the South African market. The government suspended the search for a strategic partner in February 2004.

Following a P300 million loss in the first quarter of 2006, the &quot;Sunday Standard&quot; reported that the government hurriedly began efforts to privatise the airline before it became insolvent. The newspaper also revealed that the airline defaulted on its US$42,000 – 45,000 payments for the lease of the BAe 146 from April — July 2006, and that the arrears were paid once the airline&#x27;s secretary and corporate counsel warned that non-compliance with the contracts could lead to the termination of the lease of the aircraft and expose the corporation to claims for damages, which would affect its image during the privatisation process. In September 2006 it was announced that three potential investors had placed bids for the tender to take over the airline: Airlink of South Africa, African World Airways Ltd, and Lobtrans (Ltd), a local truck fuel transporter. Shortlisted companies which did not submit bids included Ethiopian Airlines, Comair, Tourism Empowerment Group, ExecuJet, and Interair South Africa. In November 2006, the Public Enterprises Evaluation and Privatisation Agency announced that Airlink has been put forward by the Ministry of Works and Transport as the preferred bidder for Air Botswana.

It was revealed by the press that Nico Czypionka, the man responsible for leading negotiations between the government and Airlink, had convinced the government as early as April 2006 to go into partnership with the South African airline. It was alleged that the deal with Airlink was a foregone conclusion from the beginning of the process, and that other airlines had been invited to submit bids to create an illusion of fair and equitable processes. The Sunday Standard also revealed that the blueprint for the privatisation of the airline was written by Airlink CEO Roger Foster, and was used by Botswana in its negotiations with the airline, in contravention of the &quot;Botswana Privatisation Policy of 2003&quot;.

As part of the proposed deal with Airlink, it announced that Air Botswana would be wound up, and a new airline to be known as &quot;Botswana Airlink&quot; would be formed, with the government holding a controlling 50.1 percent share and the South African airline holding the remaining 49.9 percent. The new airline would have disposed of the 46-seat ATR 42s, and would instead operate 29-seat BAe Jetstream 41s, which are more suited to low traffic domestic routes. The deal would also have seen the retrenchment of all 300 employees of Air Botswana, with approximately 180 being rehired by the new airline.

The Government ceased negotiations with Airlink in October 2007, when the Cabinet reached a decision that the deal was no longer viable. A major sticking point, according to Mmegi, was that Airlink was adamant in replacing the national colours of blue, black and white, with those of South Africa. The Cabinet also believed the proposal didn&#x27;t meet requirements for air transport for the country, and didn&#x27;t address government objectives for the further development of transport and tourism sectors in Botswana, although the tourism industry regards Air Botswana&#x27;s monopoly of air transport in Botswana, and the resultant high fares and limited schedules, to be a major constraint for the development of tourism in Botswana.

The government then began the search for a management company to operate the company for a three-year period, and also announced that the government would recapitalise the airline by injecting P100 million to improve performance and to make it more attractive for privatisation. The government entered into negotiations with Comair, but following disagreements over terms, negotiations continued with reserve bidder International Development Ireland, in conjunction with Aer Arann.

According to press reports in August 2008, Alexander Lebedev, a Russian oligarch, expressed interest in investing in the airline, and the Ministry of Works and Transport confirmed that Lebedev was invited to travel to Gaborone to present his bid to the government. Part of the bid reportedly included extending Air Botswana&#x27;s route network to Düsseldorf Airport; the base of Blue Wings which is 48 percent owned by Lebedev&#x27;s &quot;National Reserve Corporation&quot;. At the end of 2008, it was reported that Lebedev had abandoned plans for investment in Air Botswana.

===Recent history===
In December 2008, Air Botswana signed a deal with ATR for two 68-seat ATR 72–500 regional airliners worth US$37 million. The aircraft were delivered in March 2009, and it was announced that routes linking Kasane and Francistown with Johannesburg would be restarted. The aircraft were delivered at the time of Air Botswana facing increased competition from South African Airways which had re-entered the Johannesburg-Gaborone market. In July 2009, Air Botswana signed a codeshare agreement with Kenya Airways, which began flights to Gaborone on 6 September with three flights per week.

The airline left the International Air Transport Association because of its inability to meet the December 2008 deadline of the IATA Operational Safety Audit, but has since been re-admitted as a full member in 2012, under the leadership of the general manager, Sakhile Nyoni-Reiling.

In December 2012, Nyoni-Reiling resigned, and press reports in May 2013 indicated internal conflicts and that two directors had been suspended for gross mismanagement pending investigations.

In late 2015, Tshenolo Mabeo, the minister responsible for transport, sacked the then general manager Ben Dahwa together with his entire board of directors, following allegations of corruption. General Tebogo Carter Masire, former Botswana Defence Force (BDF) Commander, was appointed in February 2016 to lead Air Botswana as board chairman, replacing Nigel Dixon-Warren.

In November 2019, the EastAfrican newspaper reported that Air Botswana was in the process of cutting its staff numbers from 450 to 210 people. The airline has been running at a loss for more than a decade, reportedly due to high maintenance costs for its planes. The plans also include outsourcing ground handling services to a new company, yet to be formed. It is expected that the majority of the retrenched workers will be hired by the new ground handling outfit.

In December 2023, Lulu Rasebotsa was hired to replace Agnes Khunwana who relocated to CEIBA Intercontinental. During the first six months of her tenure, Rasebotsa oversaw the expansion of the company fleet with the introduction of new aircraft and the expansion of the destinations network. The Botswana government pumped in new money to expand the enterprise.
