<doc id="1037551" wikidata="Q1259393" url="?curid=1037551" title="Disjoint-set data structure">
<text>In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them with their union), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation makes it possible to determine efficiently whether any two elements belong to the same set or to different sets.

While there are several ways of implementing disjoint-set data structures, in practice they are often identified with a particular implementation known as a disjoint-set forest. This specialized type of forest performs union and find operations in near-constant amortized time. For a sequence of addition, union, or find operations on a disjoint-set forest with nodes, the total time required is , where is the extremely slow-growing inverse Ackermann function. Although disjoint-set forests do not guarantee this time per operation, each operation rebalances the structure (via tree compression) so that subsequent operations become faster. As a result, disjoint-set forests are both asymptotically optimal and practically efficient.

Disjoint-set data structures play a key role in Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The importance of minimum spanning trees means that disjoint-set data structures support a wide variety of algorithms. In addition, these data structures find applications in symbolic computation and in compilers, especially for register allocation problems.

== History ==

Disjoint-set forests were first described by Bernard A. Galler and Michael J. Fischer in 1964. In 1973, their time complexity was bounded to formula_1, the iterated logarithm of formula_2, by Hopcroft and Ullman. In 1975, Robert Tarjan was the first to prove the formula_3 (inverse Ackermann function) upper bound on the algorithm&#x27;s time complexity. He also proved it to be tight. In 1979, he showed that this was the lower bound for a certain class of algorithms, that include the Galler-Fischer structure. In 1989, Fredman and Saks showed that formula_4 (amortized) words of formula_5 bits must be accessed by &quot;any&quot; disjoint-set data structure per operation, thereby proving the optimality of the data structure in this model.

In 1991, Galil and Italiano published a survey of data structures for disjoint-sets.

In 1994, Richard J. Anderson and Heather Woll described a parallelized version of Union–Find that never needs to block.

In 2007, Sylvain Conchon and Jean-Christophe Filliâtre developed a semi-persistent version of the disjoint-set forest data structure and formalized its correctness using the proof assistant Coq. &quot;Semi-persistent&quot; means that previous versions of the structure are efficiently retained, but accessing previous versions of the data structure invalidates later ones. Their fastest implementation achieves performance almost as efficient as the non-persistent algorithm. They do not perform a complexity analysis.

Variants of disjoint-set data structures with better performance on a restricted class of problems have also been considered. Gabow and Tarjan showed that if the possible unions are restricted in certain ways, then a truly linear time algorithm is possible.

== Representation ==

Each node in a disjoint-set forest consists of a pointer and some auxiliary information, either a size or a rank (but not both). The pointers are used to make parent pointer trees, where each node that is not the root of a tree points to its parent. To distinguish root nodes from others, their parent pointers have invalid values, such as a circular reference to the node or a sentinel value. Each tree represents a set stored in the forest, with the members of the set being the nodes in the tree. Root nodes provide set representatives: Two nodes are in the same set if and only if the roots of the trees containing the nodes are equal.

Nodes in the forest can be stored in any way convenient to the application, but a common technique is to store them in an array. In this case, parents can be indicated by their array index. Every array entry requires bits of storage for the parent pointer. A comparable or lesser amount of storage is required for the rest of the entry, so the number of bits required to store the forest is . If an implementation uses fixed size nodes (thereby limiting the maximum size of the forest that can be stored), then the necessary storage is linear in .

== Operations ==

Disjoint-set data structures support three operations: Making a new set containing a new element; Finding the representative of the set containing a given element; and Merging two sets.

=== Making new sets ===

The codice_1 operation adds a new element into a new set containing only the new element, and the new set is added to the data structure. If the data structure is instead viewed as a partition of a set, then the codice_1 operation enlarges the set by adding the new element, and it extends the existing partition by putting the new element into a new subset containing only the new element.

In a disjoint-set forest, codice_1 initializes the node&#x27;s parent pointer and the node&#x27;s size or rank. If a root is represented by a node that points to itself, then adding an element can be described using the following pseudocode:

 function MakeSet(&quot;x&quot;) is
 if &quot;x&quot; is not already in the forest then
 &quot;x&quot;.parent := &quot;x&quot;
 &quot;x&quot;.size := 1 &quot;// if nodes store size&quot;
 &quot;x&quot;.rank := 0 &quot;// if nodes store rank&quot;
 end if
 end function

This operation has linear time complexity. In particular, initializing a
disjoint-set forest with nodes requires 
time.

Lack of a parent assigned to the node implies that the node is not present in the forest.

In practice, codice_1 must be preceded by an operation that allocates memory to hold . As long as memory allocation is an amortized constant-time operation, as it is for a good dynamic array implementation, it does not change the asymptotic performance of the random-set forest.

=== Finding set representatives ===

The codice_5 operation follows the chain of parent pointers from a specified query node until it reaches a root element. This root element represents the set to which belongs and may be itself. codice_5 returns the root element it reaches.

Performing a codice_5 operation presents an important opportunity for improving the forest. The time in a codice_5 operation is spent chasing parent pointers, so a flatter tree leads to faster codice_5 operations. When a codice_5 is executed, there is no faster way to reach the root than by following each parent pointer in succession. However, the parent pointers visited during this search can be updated to point closer to the root. Because every element visited on the way to a root is part of the same set, this does not change the sets stored in the forest. But it makes future codice_5 operations faster, not only for the nodes between the query node and the root, but also for their descendants. This updating is an important part of the disjoint-set forest&#x27;s amortized performance guarantee.

There are several algorithms for codice_5 that achieve the asymptotically optimal time complexity. One family of algorithms, known as path compression, makes every node between the query node and the root point to the root. Path compression can be implemented using a simple recursion as follows:

 function Find(&quot;x&quot;) is
 if &quot;x&quot;.parent ≠ &quot;x&quot; then
 &quot;x&quot;.parent := Find(&quot;x&quot;.parent)
 return &quot;x&quot;.parent
 else
 return &quot;x&quot;
 end if
 end function

This implementation makes two passes, one up the tree and one back down. It requires enough scratch memory to store the path from the query node to the root (in the above pseudocode, the path is implicitly represented using the call stack). This can be decreased to a constant amount of memory by performing both passes in the same direction. The constant memory implementation walks from the query node to the root twice, once to find the root and once to update pointers:

 function Find(&quot;x&quot;) is
 &quot;root&quot; := &quot;x&quot;
 while &quot;root&quot;.parent ≠ &quot;root&quot; do
 &quot;root&quot; := &quot;root&quot;.parent
 end while
 while &quot;x&quot;.parent ≠ &quot;root&quot; do
 &quot;parent&quot; := &quot;x&quot;.parent
 &quot;x&quot;.parent := &quot;root&quot;
 &quot;x&quot; := &quot;parent&quot;
 end while
 return &quot;root&quot;
 end function

Tarjan and Van Leeuwen also developed one-pass codice_5 algorithms that retain the same worst-case complexity but are more efficient in practice. These are called path splitting and path halving. Both of these update the parent pointers of nodes on the path between the query node and the root. Path splitting replaces every parent pointer on that path by a pointer to the node&#x27;s grandparent:

 function Find(&quot;x&quot;) is
 while &quot;x&quot;.parent ≠ &quot;x&quot; do
 (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;.parent) := (&quot;x&quot;.parent, &quot;x&quot;.parent.parent)
 end while
 return &quot;x&quot;
 end function

Path halving works similarly but replaces only every other parent pointer:

 function Find(&quot;x&quot;) is
 while &quot;x&quot;.parent ≠ &quot;x&quot; do
 &quot;x&quot;.parent := &quot;x&quot;.parent.parent
 &quot;x&quot; := &quot;x&quot;.parent
 end while
 return &quot;x&quot;
 end function

=== Merging two sets ===


The operation codice_14 replaces the set containing and the set containing with their union. codice_15 first uses codice_5 to determine the roots of the trees containing and . If the roots are the same, there is nothing more to do. Otherwise, the two trees must be merged. This is done by either setting the parent pointer of &#x27;s root to &#x27;s, or setting the parent pointer of &#x27;s root to &#x27;s.

The choice of which node becomes the parent has consequences for the complexity of future operations on the tree. If it is done carelessly, trees can become excessively tall. For example, suppose that codice_15 always made the tree containing a subtree of the tree containing . Begin with a forest that has just been initialized with elements formula_6 and execute codice_18, codice_18, ..., codice_18. The resulting forest contains a single tree whose root is , and the path from 1 to passes through every node in the tree. For this forest, the time to run codice_21 is .

In an efficient implementation, tree height is controlled using union by size or union by rank. Both of these require a node to store information besides just its parent pointer. This information is used to decide which root becomes the new parent. Both strategies ensure that trees do not become too deep.

====Union by size====

In the case of union by size, a node stores its size, which is simply its number of descendants (including the node itself). When the trees with roots and are merged, the node with more descendants becomes the parent. If the two nodes have the same number of descendants, then either one can become the parent. In both cases, the size of the new parent node is set to its new total number of descendants.

 function Union(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is
 &quot;// Replace nodes by roots&quot;
 &quot;x&quot; := Find(&quot;x&quot;)
 &quot;y&quot; := Find(&quot;y&quot;)
 if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; then
 return &quot;// x and y are already in the same set&quot;
 end if
 &quot;// If necessary, swap variables to ensure that&quot;
 &quot;// x has at least as many descendants as y&quot;
 if &quot;x&quot;.size &lt; &quot;y&quot;.size then
 (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) := (&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)
 end if
 &quot;// Make x the new root&quot;
 &quot;y&quot;.parent := &quot;x&quot;
 &quot;// Update the size of x&quot;
 &quot;x&quot;.size := &quot;x&quot;.size + &quot;y&quot;.size
 end function

The number of bits necessary to store the size is clearly the number of bits necessary to store . This adds a constant factor to the forest&#x27;s required storage.

====Union by rank====

For union by rank, a node stores its , which is an upper bound for its height. When a node is initialized, its rank is set to zero. To merge trees with roots and , first compare their ranks. If the ranks are different, then the larger rank tree becomes the parent, and the ranks of and do not change. If the ranks are the same, then either one can become the parent, but the new parent&#x27;s rank is incremented by one. While the rank of a node is clearly related to its height, storing ranks is more efficient than storing heights. The height of a node can change during a codice_5 operation, so storing ranks avoids the extra effort of keeping the height correct. In pseudocode, union by rank is:

 function Union(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is
 &quot;// Replace nodes by roots&quot;
 &quot;x&quot; := Find(&quot;x&quot;)
 &quot;y&quot; := Find(&quot;y&quot;)
 if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; then
 return &quot;// x and y are already in the same set&quot;
 end if
 &quot;// If necessary, rename variables to ensure that&quot;
 &quot;// x has rank at least as large as that of y&quot;
 if &quot;x&quot;.rank &lt; &quot;y&quot;.rank then
 (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) := (&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)
 end if
 &quot;// Make x the new root&quot;
 &quot;y&quot;.parent := &quot;x&quot;
 &quot;// If necessary, increment the rank of x&quot;
 if &quot;x&quot;.rank = &quot;y&quot;.rank then
 &quot;x&quot;.rank := &quot;x&quot;.rank + 1
 end if
 end function

It can be shown that every node has rank formula_7 or less. Consequently each rank can be stored in bits and all the ranks can be stored in bits. This makes the ranks an asymptotically negligible portion of the forest&#x27;s size.

It is clear from the above implementations that the size and rank of a node do not matter unless a node is the root of a tree. Once a node becomes a child, its size and rank are never accessed again.

== Time complexity ==

A disjoint-set forest implementation in which codice_5 does not update parent pointers, and in which codice_15 does not attempt to control tree heights, can have trees with height . In such a situation, the codice_5 and codice_15 operations require time.

If an implementation uses path compression alone, then a sequence of codice_1 operations, followed by up to codice_15 operations and codice_5 operations, has a worst-case running time of formula_8.

Using union by rank, but without updating parent pointers during codice_5, gives a running time of formula_9 for operations of any type, up to of which are codice_1 operations.

The combination of path compression, splitting, or halving, with union by size or by rank, reduces the running time for operations of any type, up to of which are codice_1 operations, to formula_10. This makes the amortized running time of each operation formula_11. This is asymptotically optimal, meaning that every disjoint set data structure must use formula_4 amortized time per operation. Here, the function formula_13 is the inverse Ackermann function. The inverse Ackermann function grows extraordinarily slowly, so this factor is or less for any that can actually be written in the physical universe. This makes disjoint-set operations practically amortized constant time.

=== Proof of O(m log* n) time complexity of Union-Find ===

The precise analysis of the performance of a disjoint-set forest is somewhat intricate. However, there is a much simpler analysis that proves that the amortized time for any codice_5 or codice_15 operations on a disjoint-set forest containing objects is , where denotes the iterated logarithm.

Lemma 1: As the find function follows the path along to the root, the rank of node it encounters is increasing.

Lemma 2: A node which is root of a subtree with rank has at least formula_14 nodes.


Lemma 3: The maximum number of nodes of rank is at most formula_15

At any particular point in the execution, we can group the vertices of the graph into &quot;buckets&quot;, according to their rank. We define the buckets&#x27; ranges inductively, as follows: Bucket 0 contains vertices of rank 0. Bucket 1 contains vertices of rank 1. Bucket 2 contains vertices of ranks 2 and 3. 
In general, if the -th bucket contains vertices with ranks from interval formula_16, then the (B+1)st bucket will contain vertices with ranks from interval formula_17
For formula_18, let formula_19. Then
bucket formula_20 will have vertices with ranks in the interval formula_21.
We can make two observations about the buckets&#x27; sizes.

# The total number of buckets is at most .
#: Proof: Since no vertex can have rank greater than formula_2, only the first formula_23 buckets can have vertices, where formula_24 denotes the inverse of the formula_25 function defined above.
# The maximum number of elements in bucket formula_26 is at most formula_27.
#: Proof: The maximum number of elements in bucket formula_26 is at most formula_29

Let represent the list of &quot;find&quot; operations performed, and let

formula_30
formula_31
formula_32

Then the total cost of finds is formula_33

Since each find operation makes exactly one traversal that leads to a root, we have .

Also, from the bound above on the number of buckets, we have .

For , suppose we are traversing an edge from to , where and have rank in the bucket and is not the root (at the time of this traversing, otherwise the traversal would be accounted for in ). Fix and consider the sequence formula_34 that take the role of in different find operations. Because of path compression and not accounting for the edge to a root, this sequence contains only different nodes and because of Lemma 1 we know that the ranks of the nodes in this sequence are strictly increasing. By both of the nodes being in the bucket we can conclude that the length of the sequence (the number of times node is attached to a different root in the same bucket) is at most the number of ranks in the buckets , that is, at most formula_35

Therefore, formula_36

From Observations 1 and 2, we can conclude that formula_37

Therefore, formula_38

== Other structures ==

===Better worst-case time per operation===
The worst-case time of the codice_5 operation in trees with Union by rank or Union by weight is formula_39 (i.e., it is formula_5 and this bound is tight). 
In 1985, N. Blum gave an implementation of the operations that does not use path compression, but compresses trees during formula_41. His implementation runs in formula_42 time per operation, and thus in comparison with Galler and Fischer&#x27;s structure it has a better worst-case time per operation, but inferior amortized time. In 1999, Alstrup et al. gave a structure that has optimal worst-case
time formula_42 together with inverse-Ackermann amortized time.

===Deletion===
The regular implementation as disjoint-set forests does not react favorably to the deletion of elements,
in the sense that the time for codice_5 will not improve as a result of the decrease in the number of elements. However, there exist modern implementations that allow for constant-time deletion and where the time-bound for codice_5 depends on the &quot;current&quot; number of elements

== Applications ==

Disjoint-set data structures model the partitioning of a set, for example to keep track of the connected components of an undirected graph. This model can then be used to determine whether two vertices belong to the same component, or whether adding an edge between them would result in a cycle. The Union–Find algorithm is used in high-performance implementations of unification.

This data structure is used by the Boost Graph Library to implement its Incremental Connected Components functionality. It is also a key component in implementing Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

The Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm uses a Union-Find in the algorithm.

<text>Tracy Kristine Nelson (born October 25, 1963) is an American actress. From a long line of entertainers, she is the daughter of musician Ricky Nelson and actress and painter Kristin Nelson.

== Early life ==
Nelson was born in Santa Monica, California. She is a fourth-generation performer. Her great-grandparents were vaudeville performers Hazel Dell (née McNutt) and Roy Hilliard Snyder. Their daughter was her paternal grandmother Harriet Nelson, the star of the ABC-TV sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; from 1952 to 1966. Her parents were musician and film actor Ricky Nelson and actress/artist Kristin Nelson (née Harmon). She has three younger siblings: Matthew Nelson and Gunnar Nelson of the 1990s rock group Nelson, and Sam Nelson. Her paternal grandparents were Ozzie and Harriet Hilliard Nelson. Nelson&#x27;s maternal grandparents were football star Tom Harmon, a Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Michigan, and actress Elyse Knox. She is also the niece of actors David Nelson, and her mother&#x27;s siblings Mark Harmon and Kelly Harmon.

She went to The Buckley School and graduated in 1981 from the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School) in Los Angeles. She attended Bard College in upstate New York, studying Dance and European History.

== Career ==
At age four Nelson played one of Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball&#x27;s daughters in &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968). Her future co-star Tom Bosley also appeared in that film.

Nelson is a professional dancer, having studied ballet for 17 years with Tania Lachine and toured throughout California in a dance company while still in grammar school. Nelson studied theater with Kim Stanley and Nina Foch and briefly in the United Kingdom, performing in The Edinburgh Fringe Festival after graduation from high school. In 1982, she played &quot;valley girl&quot; Jennifer DeNuccio on the television series &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, and in 1986 she landed the role of the anorexic daughter in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s film &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;.

Nelson co-starred in the television series &quot;The Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; as &quot;Sister Stephanie&quot; for its three seasons. She was also a series regular on Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Glitter&quot;, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, and the Australian television series &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Nelson made guest appearances on television series including &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Will and Grace&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. She was in the touring company and on Broadway as &quot;Rizzo&quot; in &quot;Grease&quot; in 1995. Nelson has appeared in several theatrical releases and over 20 television movies, including &quot;The Perfect Nanny&quot; in 2000, &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;, &quot;Kate&#x27;s Secret&quot;, &quot;The Fight for Jesse&quot; and &quot;The Rival&quot; in 2006.

She has written a book about her personal experience and a movie script about her family, &quot;The Nelsons&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Nelson has survived three kinds of cancer. She was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma a month after her 1987 marriage to Moses, and one year after her father was killed in an aircraft crash on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1985 in a field in DeKalb, Texas. Nelson went into remission after surgery, chemotherapy (ABVD) and radiation at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.

Having suffered trauma from radiation, Nelson was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2005 and breast cancer in 2010. She fully recovered from a bilateral mastectomy and complete reconstruction.

Nelson is active in cancer research advocacy and was the spokesperson for The Lymphoma Research Foundation of America. She received the &quot;Lifesaver Award&quot; from that organization and the &quot;Jill Ireland Award&quot; from the Amie Karen Cancer Fund for Children.

<text>Certified Health Physicist is an official title granted by the American Board of Health Physics, the certification board for health physicists in the United States. A Certified Health Physicist is designated by the letters CHP or DABHP (Diplomate of the American Board of Health Physics) after his or her name.

A certification by the ABHP is not a license to practice and does not confer any legal qualification to practice health physics. However, the certification is well respected and indicates a high level of achievement by those who obtain it.

Certified Health Physicists are plenary or emeritus members of the American Academy of Health Physics (AAHP). In 2019, the AAHP web site listed over 1600 plenary and emeritus members.

==Professional responsibilities==
A person certified as a health physicist has a responsibility to uphold the professional integrity associated with the certification to promote the practice and science of radiation safety. It is expected that such a person will always give health physics information based on the highest standards of science and professional ethics. A certified individual has a responsibility to remain professionally active in the health physics field and remain technically competent in the scientific, technical and regulatory developments in the field.

==General requirements required to receive the certification==
The requirements for prospective candidates for certification are 
#Academics. At least a bachelor&#x27;s degree from an accredited college or university in physical sciences, engineering, or in a biological science, with a minimum of 20 semester hours in physical science.
#Experience. At least six years of professional experience in health physics. By permission of the Board, advanced degrees may substitute for one year (master&#x27;s degree) or two years (doctorate) of the required experience.
#References. A reference from the immediate supervisor and from at least two other individuals, including one from a currently certified Health Physicist.
#Written Report. A written report that reflects a professional health physics effort.
#Examination. A two-part exam, which is currently given during one week of the year. 
#*Part I consists of 150 multiple choice questions in fundamental aspects of health physics. This portion of the test is three hours long, and can be taken without most of the above requirements. It is given at Pearson Vue testing centers throughout the world in the week before the Health Physics Society&#x27;s annual meeting. 
#*Part II consists of open-ended written questions, which determine competency in applied health physics. This portion of the exam is six hours long, and can only be taken after having passed Part I, or immediately after having taken Part I the week before. It is given on the Monday of the Health Physics Society&#x27;s annual meeting, and on the same day at other locations throughout the country.
#*After passing Part I, the applicant must pass Part II within a period of seven years, or retake both parts. 
#*If a candidate scores particularly poorly on Part II, he or she will be barred from taking it the following year. 
#*Both parts include all of the topics below, but Part II requires candidates to answer only six mandatory questions and four of eight topic area questions.

===Examination topics===
*Atomic structure/Radioactivity/Radioactive decay
*Interaction of radiation with matter
*Internal dosimetry/Internal dose calculations

<doc id="1037558" wikidata="Q6664350" url="?curid=1037558" title="Local education authorities in England and Wales">
<text>Local education authorities (LEAs) were defined in England and Wales as the local councils responsible for education within their jurisdictions. The term was introduced by the Education Act 1902, which transferred education powers from school boards to existing local councils.

There have been periodic changes to the types of councils defined as local education authorities. Initially, they were the councils of counties and county boroughs. From 1974 the local education authorities were the county councils in non-metropolitan areas and the district councils in metropolitan areas. In Greater London, the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Inner London Education Authority existed from 1965 to 1990. Outer London borough councils have been LEAs since 1965 and inner London borough councils since 1990. Unitary authorities created since 1995 have all been LEAs. 

The functions of LEAs have varied over time as council responsibilities for local education have changed. On 1 April 2009, their powers were transferred to directors of children&#x27;s services. The Children Act 2004 required every London borough, metropolitan district, top-tier local authority (county) or UA in England to appoint a director of children&#x27;s services. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 includes a clause that allows for the future renaming of LEAs as local authorities in all legislation, removing the anomaly of one local authority being known as an LEA and a children&#x27;s services authority.

==History==
===Creation===
The term was introduced by the Education Act 1902 (2 Edw. 7. c. 42). The legislation designated each local authority; either county council and county borough council; would set up a committee known as a &quot;local education authority&quot; (LEA). The councils took over the powers and responsibilities of the school boards and technical instruction committees in their area. 

Municipal boroughs with a population of 10,000 and urban districts with a population of 20,000 were to be local education authorities in their areas for elementary education only. 

In 1904 the London County Council became a local education authority, with the abolition of the London School Board. The metropolitan boroughs within London were not education authorities, although they were given the power to decide on the site for new schools in their areas, and provided the majority of members on boards of management.

The LEAs&#x27; role was further expanded with the introduction of school meals in 1906 and medical inspection in 1907.

===Reform===
The Education Act 1944 changed the requirements for delegation of functions from county councils to districts and boroughs. The population requirement for excepted districts became 60,000 or 7,000 pupils registered in elementary schools. The Local Government Act 1958 permitted any county district to apply for excepted district status.

In 1965 the London County Council, Middlesex County Council and the councils of the county boroughs of Croydon, East Ham and West Ham were replaced by the Greater London Council. The twenty outer London boroughs became local education authorities, while a new Inner London Education Authority, consisting of the members of the GLC elected for the twelve inner London boroughs covering the former County of London was created.

In 1974 local government outside London was completely reorganised. In the new metropolitan counties of England and Wales, metropolitan boroughs became LEAs. In the non-metropolitan counties the county councils were the education authorities.

In 1986, with the abolition of the Greater London Council, the Inner London Education Authority became directly elected. This however only lasted until 1990, when the twelve inner London boroughs assumed responsibility for education.

In 1989, under the Education Reform Act 1988, the LEAs lost responsibility for higher education, with all polytechnics and colleges of higher education becoming independent corporations.

A further wave of local government reorganisation during the 1990s led to the formation of unitary authorities in parts of England and throughout Wales, which became local education authorities.

===Redefinition===
The Children Act 2004 defined each local education authority as additionally a children&#x27;s services authority, with responsibility for both functions held by the director of children&#x27;s services.

=== Ending ===

==== England ====
The &quot;Local Education Authorities and Children&#x27;s Services Authorities (Integration of Functions) Order 2010&quot; removed all reference to local education authorities and children&#x27;s services authorities from existing legislation, replacing them with the term &#x27;local authority&#x27;. A local authority for the purposes of the Education Act 1996 and the Children Act 2004 was defined as the county council, metropolitan district council, unitary authority, London borough council and the Common Council of the City of London. Schedule 1 of the order inserted in the Education Act 1996 a list of &#x27;education functions&#x27; for the relevant local authorities. Despite the term becoming obsolete, &#x27;local education authority&#x27; continues to be used to distinguish local authorities with education functions from those without them.

==== Wales ====
In Wales the councils of the counties and county boroughs are responsible for education. Since 5 May 2010, the terms local education authority and children&#x27;s services authority have been repealed and replaced by the single term &#x27;local authority&#x27; in both primary and secondary legislation.

==Functions==
Local education authorities had some responsibility for all state schools in their area.

*They are responsible for distribution and monitoring of funding for the schools
*They are responsible for co-ordination of admissions, including allocation of the number of places available at each school
*They are the direct employers of all staff in community and VC schools
*They have a responsibility for the educational achievement of looked-after children, i.e. children in their care
*They have attendance and advisory rights in relation to the employment of teachers, and in relation to the dismissal of any staff
*They are the owners of school land and premises in community schools.

Until recently, local education authorities were responsible for the funding of students in higher education (for example undergraduate courses and PGCE) whose permanent address is in their area, regardless of the place of study. Based on an assessment of individual circumstances they offer grants or access to student loans through the Student Loans Company.

===Education functions===
Statutory education functions for local authorities in England are as follows:
* Making of byelaws relating to the employment of children. 
* Payment of injury benefit to or in respect of teachers. 
* Powers and duties relating to careers services 
* Duty to provide information to the Secretary of State.

* Powers and duties relating to parenting orders and parenting contracts. 
* Duty to make available to the Secretary of State appropriate accommodation for enabling the Secretary of State to arrange for medical inspections in schools. 

==Relevant local authority==
England has several tiers of local government and the relevant local authority varies. Within Greater London the 32 London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London are the local authorities responsible for education; in the metropolitan counties it is the 36 metropolitan borough councils; and in the non-metropolitan counties it is the 21 county councils or, where there is no county council, the councils of the 62 unitary authorities. The Council of the Isles of Scilly is an education authority. There are 153 local education authorities in England.

<doc id="1037566" wikidata="Q6570253" url="?curid=1037566" title="List of Escheators of Munster">
<text>This is a list of the Members of Parliament appointed as Escheator of Munster, a notional &#x27;office of profit under the crown&#x27; which was used to resign from the Irish House of Commons, and after the Union, that of the United Kingdom.

The escheator was originally responsible for the administration of escheat , a common law doctrine that transfers the real property of a person who has died without heirs to the crown or state.

The office was formerly substantive. It was founded in 1605, when the escheatorship for Ireland was divided among the provinces of Connaught, Leinster, Munster, and Ulster.

<doc id="1037570" wikidata="Q1574163" url="?curid=1037570" title="Mario vs. Donkey Kong">
<text>is a 2004 puzzle-platform game developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. The game is the spiritual successor to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which was released in 1994 for the Game Boy.

The gameplay resolves around a combination of platform and puzzle elements. Players control Mario through small sets of challenge to find a key and rescue Mini-Marios from Donkey Kong.

&quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; received positive reviews, particularly for its gameplay and graphics. It spawned a franchise of the same name with the first sequel, &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis&quot;, was released on Nintendo DS in September 2006. A remake for the Nintendo Switch was released in February 2024.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;, the player assumes the role of Mario, who is pursuing Donkey Kong through a toy factory in order to retrieve several stolen Mini-Mario toys. The game, a puzzle platform game, plays similarly to the Game Boy &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game, giving Mario a vast set of different athletic moves, including a handstand, a sideways somersault, and a triple jump, all of which can be used to maneuver platforming stages in various different ways. There are several different environments, ranging from a lava environment to the classic construction site, and there are five different types; in the first, and most common, Mario has to pick up a key and take it to the locked door, and then find and pick up the Mini-Mario toy at the end of the level. The second type is where Mario must guide six Mini-Mario toys to the Toy Box, while protecting them from dangerous environments. The third type is the boss level, where Mario must fight Donkey Kong in order to proceed to the next world. The fourth type is the Plus Level, where Mario must activate one Mini-Mario in the level, which is holding a key, and take it to the door. The Plus levels are overall designed to be more difficult than the main levels. The fifth type of level is the Expert levels. The Expert levels can be accessed after beating the main worlds, and after collecting enough stars in the main and Plus levels. In the Expert levels, Mario must get the key and lead it to the door, much like the main levels, but the Expert levels are the hardest levels in the game. Getting through the door beats the level in Plus and Expert modes, rather than sending Mario to a second part.

==Plot==
Mario is the owner of Mario&#x27;s Toy Company, a toy enterprise in which he sells a series of small wind-up toys called &quot;Mini-Marios&quot;. After seeing a television advertisement for the Mini-Marios, Donkey Kong immediately falls in love with the toys and sets out to the toy store to get one for himself, only to find that they are sold out. Furious, Donkey Kong breaks into Mario&#x27;s toy factory across the street and steals all of the Mini-Marios, prompting Mario to chase after Donkey Kong to get his toys back.

Mario travels in pursuit of Donkey Kong, rescuing the Mini-Marios and battling Donkey Kong several times along the way before retrieving all of the toys. Upon realizing that all the stolen toys are now gone, Donkey Kong kidnaps all of Mario&#x27;s Toad workers and imprisons them on the tower of a big building. Mario climbs to the top of the tower, rescues the Toads, and battles Donkey Kong once more, after which Donkey Kong falls onto a truck containing a shipment of new Mini-Marios. Donkey Kong then promptly steals this set of toys as Mario pursues him once again to reclaim them.

Following another cat-and-mouse chase, Mario gets back all but six of the captured Mini-Marios, which Donkey Kong holds captive and guards with a large robot mech. Mario fights Donkey Kong one last time, destroying Donkey Kong&#x27;s mech and finally getting back the rest of the toys. Upon noticing Donkey Kong upset, Mario decides to give Donkey Kong a free Mini-Mario toy. After finally getting what he has wanted all along, Donkey Kong, Mario, and the remaining Mini-Marios all rejoice together.

==Development==
The game is an evolution of &quot;Donkey Kong Plus&quot;, a title on display at E3 2002. During the show, &quot;Plus&quot; had a feature that allowed players to design and save their own levels on the GameCube, then copy them to the Game Boy Advance using a link cable. It was essentially an updated version of &quot;Donkey Kong &#x27;94&quot;, but the game had disappeared by the following year. It was replaced with the pre-rendered graphics and gameplay additions of &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;. The &quot;Create-a-Level&quot; feature was removed from this version but appears in its sequel. The level editor still exists within the game&#x27;s programming and can be enabled through a modification.

The game has hidden e-Reader support. Nintendo held a competition in Japan in which cards were distributed to 1,000 winning participants. Five level cards were released by &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot;, and another card was given away at the 20th World Hobby Fair. The game can save up to 12 extra levels.

==Limited re-release==
&quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;, as well as nine other Game Boy Advance games, was available to Nintendo 3DS owners who purchased their systems before the August 11, 2011, price cut via Virtual Console as part of the ambassador program. This offer was available in all territories, and only to those who became eligible in the Ambassador program (by accessing the Nintendo eShop before the date of the price-cut). Although the game was released on December 16 the same year, to Ambassador users, Nintendo never released it to the general public in paid form on Nintendo 3DS unlike the Wii U version, which was later released in 2017.

==Remake==

A remake of &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; was released on the Nintendo Switch on February 16, 2024. It features enhanced graphics and local co-op multiplayer with Toad as the second player character. Players can select between two &quot;Play Styles&quot;, Casual and Classic. Casual removes the time limit, adds checkpoints to levels, and lets Mario take five hits before losing a life, while Classic is akin to the original game. Two new worlds have been added: Merry Mini-Land, taking place in an amusement park, and Slippery Summit, an icy mountain. These worlds also receive Plus counterparts, making for 30 new levels, and pushing the total beyond 130. After finishing the game, &quot;Time Attack&quot; becomes available, challenging players to beat each level as fast as they can. This game was also the first Mario game to reuse Charles Martinet&#x27;s voice as Mario after stepping away from the role in August 2023.

==Reception==
&quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the video game review aggregator website Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best Game Boy Advance game of May 2004. It received a runner-up position in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Puzzle/Rhythm Game&quot; award category across all platforms, losing to &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot;. In March 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; listed it as #25 in their list of the top 25 Game boy Advance games of all time, calling it &quot;a great game that fits the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s pick-up-and-play environment since players could whip out the system, solve a puzzle, and put it away for later&quot;. The game sold 1.37 million copies worldwide.

===Remake===
The remake for Nintendo Switch also received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, though lower than the original.

&quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot; felt that the majority of the game is &quot;far too easy&quot;, with the only truly satisfying challenge to be found in the Expert levels, of which the critic said there could have been more in the game. Conversely, &quot;Destructoid&quot; said that the game was surprisingly &quot;demanding&quot; for a 2D Mario platformer, particularly the levels in which Mario must guide Mini-Mario toys to a Toy Box.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; both praised the controls. The former said that &quot;it&#x27;s a blast to move from one side of the stage to another&quot; and the latter called the movement &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;intuitive&quot;. While they said that it doesn&#x27;t feel as good to play as other 2D Mario platformers, they acknowledged the need to make a moveset that can facilitate complex puzzles, and concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s a very well-made middle-ground&quot;.

&quot;Digital Trends&quot; lamented the exclusion of the original&#x27;s &quot;e-Reader&quot; levels, the majority of which were never made officially playable. The &quot;Time Attack&quot; feature was also criticized, which functionally replaces the high score system from the 2004 release; the reviewer considered it &quot;an attempt to squeeze more replay value&quot; out of a short game with a high price tag. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, on the other hand, praised the amount of content, calling it a &quot;lovely package&quot; that &quot;unroll[s] before you&quot;.

The remake performed well commercially, topping the UK physical video game charts. As of March 2024, the game has sold 1.12 million copies, with 210,000 sold in Japan and 910,000 internationally.

==Early life and education==
Derricks was born at East Chattanooga, Tennessee, second of five children of stove-factory moulder John T. Derricks and Ora Mae, née Kinamore, who worked as a domestic servant for a family in Chattanooga. He studied at Cadek Conservatory of Music in Chattanooga, A &amp; I State University and American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville.

==Career==
At age 21, Derricks directed a gospel choir of more than 100 voices in Washington, D.C. at the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church. Derricks counted among his friends many well-known artists, one of whom was Mahalia Jackson. He was the pastor at churches throughout Tennessee at Dayton, Knoxville and Jackson; also in Beloit, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. Along with being a pastor, Derricks was a church builder, choir director, poet, musician, and composer of note, having written more than 300 songs and several song books. Among his more famous songs are the much-recorded and performed &quot;Just a Little Talk with Jesus,&quot; &quot;When God Dipped His Love In My Heart,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll Soon Be Done With Troubles and Trials,&quot; and &quot;When He Blessed My Soul.&quot; He was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1984.

Derricks had been a warrant officer in the United States Army, having enlisted in 1942. His term of service ended October 1945.

<doc id="1037574" wikidata="Q1163285" url="?curid=1037574" title="Ohio State Route 8">
<text>State Route 8 (SR 8) is a road in the U.S. state of Ohio. SR 8 stretches from the eastern junction of Interstate 76 (I-76) and I-77 in Akron to Public Square in Cleveland. It is one of nine routes to enter downtown Cleveland at Public Square. The route&#x27;s first few miles are as a limited-access freeway from I-76 and I-77, heading north. The freeway section of the highway has 17 interchanges, and is cosigned with SR 59 for a short distance from Perkins Street in Akron to Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls. The freeway portion ends at I-271 in Macedonia.

==Route description==
SR 8 begins at an interchange with I-76 and I-77 southeast of downtown Akron. The Akron Expressway, as the freeway is known within the city limits, heads up the east side of Akron. SR 8&#x27;s first interchange is the main access to the central business district and the University of Akron. Just before leaving central Akron, an interchange with Perkins Street begins a concurrency with SR 59. The road continues over the North Expressway Viaduct, which crosses over several railroads and the Little Cuyahoga River, before continuing to the north side of Akron. Between exits 3B and 4, SR 8/59 cross into Cuyahoga Falls. Those two exits connect with the same stretch of road but have different names and are on different sides of the city limit.

The freeway continues north through Cuyahoga Falls, parallel to the Cuyahoga River; the freeway crosses the river just before exit 6. SR 59 leaves the freeway at exit 6 to head east toward Kent. SR 8, which until now has been heading slightly northeast, turns north and northwest after exit 6, interchanging with Graham Road in the process. The road continues through a relatively rural area on the eastern edge of Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Exits 10, 12, 14A-B and 15 are normally only used as a connection to Hudson or Blossom Music Center and other points in the national park, as their immediate areas are sparsely populated and underdeveloped. Once it passes the Ohio Turnpike, SR 8 continues through a wooded area. The route&#x27;s last exit is with I-271, after which it enters Cleveland&#x27;s southeastern suburbs.

Now known as Northfield Road, SR 8 continues parallel to I-271, intersecting SR 82, SR 14, and SR 17. Following its intersection with SR 17, SR 8 enters a brief concurrency with SR 43, during which it intersects I-480. SR 43 splits off, and SR 8 continues northward before joining US 422 and turning to the west. The new road is briefly known as Chagrin Boulevard before becoming Kinsman Road. SR 8/US 422 continues to the northwest through the immediate Cleveland area; during its approach to downtown Cleveland, SR 87 joins the concurrency, followed by an interchange with I-77.

For its final mile, SR 8/SR 87/US 422 picks up a concurrency of SR 14/SR 43, after which the road becomes known as Ontario Street and turns toward Public Square, the northern terminus of SR 8. SR 8&#x27;s northern terminus is shared with six other roads: SR 3, SR 14, SR 43, SR 87, US 42, and US 422.

==History==
SR 8 was one of the original state highways in Ohio. It went from Marietta all the way to Cleveland. Over time, though, parts of the route were renumbered or reassigned, especially south of Akron. In 1926 the portion from Marietta to Newcomerstown became U.S. Route 21. The same year the section from Newcomerstown to Uhrichsville became State Route 16 and SR 8 was rerouted from the Ohio River town of Fly to Uhrichsville. In 1969, the section from Fly to Canton was renumbered to State Route 800, the portion from Canton to Akron was deleted, and the southern end of the highway was truncated at Akron, at U.S. Route 224.

On August 6, 1954, the portion of the North Expressway in Akron opened from Perkins Street to Cuyahoga Falls Avenue. By 1962, it had been extended south to the Central Interchange and numbered Route 8B; it became mainline SR 8 in 1969 north of Market Street, and in its entirety by 1971. A section of freeway between Front Street (SR 59) and Graham Road in Cuyahoga Falls and Stow opened by 1972, with the connecting section opening in 1974. The freeway carried only the SR 59 designation between Tallmadge Avenue in Akron and Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls and had no posted number north of there until 1983, when the SR 8 designation was transferred to the freeway. The final section of freeway opened on May 20, 1988, reaching State Route 303.

SR 8 from Interstate 77 to Perkins Street was rebuilt from 2003 to 2005. The freeway in that stretch previously had onramps and offramps built closely together, creating the danger of weaving traffic. Several ramps were removed and service roads were built on both sides of the freeway.

Route 8 from SR 303 north to Interstate 271 was converted to a full freeway without at-grade intersections between 2008 and 2011. The ramp between State Route 8 northbound and I-271 northbound opened July 24, 2009, and the opposite ramp opened on September 4. The new Turnpike interchange opened in December 2010, well ahead of the projected date of fall 2011.

An interchange was opened at Seasons Road in 2010 to serve the area near the borders of Cuyahoga Falls, Stow, and Hudson. Although the interchange was completed on January 25, 2010, it was not initially scheduled to open until one month later, on February 26, when an official ribbon-cutting could take place. Two weeks before the scheduled opening, an editorial in the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; lambasted the ribbon-cutting, calling the ceremony a mere &quot;photo op&quot;, and questioning why a finished project should sit unused for 31 days. On February 21, the government of Stow, which had been responsible for holding the ceremony, announced the interchange would open in the morning of the next day without a ribbon-cutting.

In 2015 SR 8 was rerouted slightly in Shaker Heights due to a six-leg intersection being converted to a four-leg one.

Long-term plans for the road include a complete replacement of the North Expressway Viaduct between the Perkins Street and Glenwood Avenue exits, which is currently forecast to begin in 2023.

===Interstate proposal===
In January 2014, the Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS) metropolitan planning organization proposed to designate the section between the central interchange in Akron (at I-76/77) to Macedonia (at I-271) as Interstate 380. ODOT declined the proposal for financial reasons. The letter was resubmitted in April 2014 with support from additional local officials, including Akron mayor Don Plusquellic, but no further discussion has taken place on the proposal.

<doc id="1037577" wikidata="Q7143844" url="?curid=1037577" title="Pat O'Brien's Bar">
<text>Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar is a bar located in New Orleans, Louisiana that began operation as a legal liquor establishment on December 3, 1933, at the intersection of Royal and St. Peter streets in the French Quarter. Before that, during Prohibition the bar was known as Mr. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Club Tipperary; the password &quot;storm&#x27;s brewin&#x27;&quot; was required to gain entrance to the establishment. In December 1942 it moved to its present location at 718 St. Peter Street, into a historic building dating from 1791.
Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s is home to the original flaming fountain (located in the courtyard) and the hurricane cocktail. There is also a piano bar, featuring twin &quot;dueling&quot; pianos where local entertainers take song requests. The dueling piano bar is thought to be the first of its kind.
O&#x27;Brien is reported to have invented the hurricane cocktail in the 1940s. The story of the drink&#x27;s origin holds that, due to difficulties importing scotch during World War II, liquor salesmen forced bar owners to buy up to 50 cases of their much-more-plentiful rum in order to secure a single case of good whiskey or scotch. The barmen at Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s came up with an appealing recipe to reduce their bulging surplus of rum. When they decided to serve it in a hurricane glass, shaped like a hurricane lamp, the hurricane was born.

<doc id="1037590" wikidata="Q3180317" url="?curid=1037590" title="Joey Harrington">
<text>John Joseph Harrington (born October 21, 1978) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons. He played college football for the Oregon Ducks, where he earned Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, and was selected third overall by the Detroit Lions in the 2002 NFL draft. Unable to duplicate his collegiate success, he left the Lions after four seasons. He spent his final three seasons as the primary starter for the Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons and a backup with the New Orleans Saints.

==Early life==
Harrington was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Central Catholic High School in Portland, and finished his high school career with more than 4,200 yards and 50 touchdowns rushing and passing.

Harrington&#x27;s grandfather and father played quarterback for the Universities of Portland and Oregon, respectively, and upon hearing of Joey&#x27;s birth, legendary Oregon Ducks&#x27; coach Len Casanova jokingly sent his parents a letter-of-intent.

==College career==
Harrington is a graduate of the University of Oregon, and was a three-year starter on the Oregon Ducks football team. In his senior season at Oregon, he threw for 2,415 yards and 23 touchdowns, and he finished his college career with a 25–3 record (including bowl wins against #12 Texas and #3 Colorado), 512 completions in 928 attempts (55.2%), 6,911 passing yards, 59 touchdowns, 23 interceptions, and 210 rushing yards and 18 scores on 145 carries. A business administration major with a 3.23 GPA (twice earning honors with a 3.34 GPA), Harrington&#x27;s 7,121 yards of total offense rank sixth in University of Oregon history.

Harrington finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy in 2001, following a campaign for the award that included a billboard in Times Square promoting him as &quot;Joey Heisman.&quot; He earned numerous honors, including first-team All-American, Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year, and second-team honors from The Sporting News. He was one of five finalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award in 2001. EA Sports selected him for the cover of the 2003 edition of their NCAA Football video game series. Harrington was given the nickname &quot;Captain Comeback&quot; among fans for his ability to lead Oregon to victory in late game situations, accumulating a record of 11–2 in games in which the Ducks trailed or were tied in the fourth quarter.

Harrington&#x27;s best collegiate game was arguably the 2002 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona when he threw for 350 yards and four touchdowns and helped lead the Ducks to a 38–16 victory over Colorado. Harrington was named offensive player of the game.

Harrington&#x27;s worst game was arguably the 2000 Civil War game in which he passed 24–36 for 333 yards, but threw five interceptions. Three of those interceptions were by Oregon State defensive back Jake Cookus. #8 Oregon State ultimately won 23–13 over then-#6 Oregon.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Detroit Lions===
Harrington was selected by the Detroit Lions with the third pick overall in the 2002 NFL draft. Harrington took over for incumbent Mike McMahon late in the Lions&#x27; Week 1 loss against the Miami Dolphins and became the Lions&#x27; starting quarterback shortly thereafter, finishing that year with a 50.1 completion percentage, a ratio of 12 touchdowns to 16 interceptions, and a 59.9 quarterback rating; the Lions finished the season with a 3–13 record. He was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award.

Harrington&#x27;s career in Detroit was largely unsuccessful. Front office mismanagement, woeful offensive line protection, lack of talent at other skill positions, and an erratic philosophical change in the team&#x27;s identity to a conservative West Coast offense-oriented attack under head coach Steve Mariucci may have played a factor in Harrington not realizing his potential professionally, as well as his own play and lack of talent. During the 2003 season, Harrington joked that being &quot;the quarterback of the Lions and the goalie of the Red Wings&quot; were the hardest jobs in Detroit.

Harrington&#x27;s best season as a Lion came in 2004, when he threw for 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Lions started the season with a 4–2 record, but Harrington led the team to only two more wins the rest of the season. The Lions finished 6–10 and missed the playoffs for the fifth season in a row.

On October 23, 2005, Mariucci chose to bench Harrington in favor of veteran Jeff Garcia for the team&#x27;s game against the Cleveland Browns to try to provide a spark to the team&#x27;s 2–3 start. The Lions won 13–10, and Garcia rushed for Detroit&#x27;s only touchdown. After yet another dismal offensive performance, Mariucci declared that Garcia would remain the starter. That marked the first time since the 2002 season that Harrington did not appear in a Lions&#x27; game, breaking a string of 37 consecutive appearances. Harrington regained the starting role the week after Garcia threw a game-ending interception returned for a touchdown in overtime against Chicago. Harrington started again for Detroit on November 13, 2005, against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for three touchdowns without an interception in the Lions&#x27; 29–21 win. Harrington was voted by Lions fans as their Offensive Player of the Year, according to the Lions&#x27; official website.

Despite his difficult times in Detroit, he remained unwaveringly optimistic. In response, sarcastic Lions&#x27; fans and beat writers, who were critical of his predictable and upbeat post-game commentary as the losses continued to mount, dubbed him &quot;Joey Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;Joey Sunshine&quot;.

===Miami Dolphins===
After the 2005 season, Detroit signed free agents Jon Kitna and Josh McCown, and traded Harrington to the Miami Dolphins on May 12, 2006, for a fifth-round draft pick in 2007, after meeting performance stipulations in Miami (the pick was later traded to the New Orleans Saints). Harrington started the 2006 season as a backup behind new Dolphins quarterback Daunte Culpepper. During his tenure with the Lions, Harrington started 55 games and had a record of 18 wins and 37 losses.

In 2006, Harrington did not play in the Dolphins&#x27; first four games, backing up Culpepper. Culpepper injured his shoulder prior to Miami&#x27;s fifth game against the New England Patriots, forcing Harrington into the starting role. Harrington lost his first three starts, before leading Miami to a 31–13 win over the previously unbeaten (7–0 at the time) Chicago Bears. Harrington followed that game with four consecutive victories. Harrington capped off this winning streak in front of a national television audience on Thanksgiving Day in Detroit with a 27–10 victory at Ford Field against his former team. Harrington passed for 3 touchdowns and 213 yards against Detroit, compiling a passer rating of 107.4, his highest single game rating for 2006. Harrington struggled after the Lions&#x27; game. Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 15, Harrington went 5-for-17 for 20 yards, throwing two interceptions. His passer rating for the game was 0.0, the minimum possible under the complex NFL formula. Harrington was pulled midway through Miami&#x27;s next game against the New York Jets, replaced in the 13–10 Christmas night loss by Cleo Lemon. Harrington did not appear in Miami&#x27;s Week 17 finale against the Indianapolis Colts. Overall, Harrington played in and started eleven games, leading Miami to a 5–6 record (Miami finished 6–10 for the season as a whole).

===Atlanta Falcons===
On April 9, 2007, Harrington agreed to a two-year, $6 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons to compete with D. J. Shockley and Chris Redman to be the backup quarterback to Michael Vick.

Harrington was elevated to starting quarterback after the suspension of Vick for the 2007 NFL season. Harrington performed well in the preseason, but after going 0–2, Atlanta signed quarterback Byron Leftwich as a possible replacement for Harrington. During the Week 3 Atlanta home opener against the division rival Carolina Panthers, Harrington completed 31-of-44 passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions for a 110.1 passer rating in a 27–20 loss. In Week 4, Harrington improved on his numbers with a 121.7 passer rating, completing 23-of-29 passes for two touchdowns with no interceptions, leading the Falcons to their first win of the 2007 season.

On March 5, 2008, the Falcons released Harrington in a salary cap move. He was re-signed by the team seven days later but was again released in August after the Falcons completed their preseason schedule.

===New Orleans Saints===
Harrington signed with the New Orleans Saints on September 19, 2008. He was the third-string quarterback behind Drew Brees and Mark Brunell for one game against the Denver Broncos. He was released only five days later on September 24, 2008, due to increasing injuries on the Saints roster. After the Saints&#x27; injury situation became more manageable, Harrington was re-signed on October 1, but was cut again on October 6. He once again re-signed with the Saints on October 12, 2008, as an inactive third-string quarterback.

On March 30, 2009, Harrington was re-signed to a one-year deal by the Saints. He was released by the team again on September 5, 2009.

After being cut by the Saints, Harrington would not sign with another NFL team.

===Performance assessment===
Harrington was first given the label of &quot;Savior&quot; by fans and media in Detroit - then deemed a &quot;bust&quot; when he did not meet high expectations. Many speculate that his premature start in the NFL, along with lack of surrounding talent, poor coaching, and questionable offensive lines have affected his performance severely. Many other quarterbacks, such as Tim Couch and David Carr, were also drafted highly and eventually lost their starting jobs.

In 2005, former quarterback Troy Aikman wrote that Harrington &quot;can still be a really good quarterback in this league,&quot; and does not deserve the blame for what happened in Detroit: &quot;The focus on Joey&#x27;s play has given every other player a hall pass, and that&#x27;s not right.&quot;

Former quarterback Phil Simms said in 2006 that Harrington got a bad rap in Detroit. &quot;I am not a Joey Harrington basher. The quarterback can&#x27;t overcome bad coaching and bad players.&quot; Former quarterback Dan Marino said that he did not believe that Harrington had the necessary pieces around him in Detroit to be successful, but that he might be OK in a different place.

When Lions head coach Steve Mariucci was fired by general manager Matt Millen, Lions cornerback Dré Bly told analyst Rich Eisen in an NFL Total Access interview that he blamed Harrington for the dismissal of Mariucci. Bly later apologized to the Lions, but not to Harrington.

Some fingers were also pointed at the Lions&#x27; management and coaching staff. Fellow Lions quarterback Jeff Garcia publicly questioned the team&#x27;s front office, saying on WXYT that &quot;You start to question whether the organization has the people in place who can go about making the proper selections.&quot; Former defensive end Howie Long said that Millen made a mistake by drafting Harrington, along with signing Garcia instead of Brad Johnson.

==Personal life==
Harrington married Emily Hatten on March 10, 2007. They have two sons, born in 2009 and 2012. Emily is a nurse practitioner, and Harrington spoke about them opening a medical clinic to serve the homeless in Portland, after he retired from football. Harrington is an accomplished jazz pianist who has occasionally performed with artists such as Jason Mraz, Blues Traveler, and Third Eye Blind. On February 1, 2008, Harrington appeared as a guest chef on a special Super Bowl episode of &quot;The Rachael Ray Show&quot;. Harrington is a distant cousin of professional golfer Pádraig Harrington and professional poker player Dan Harrington. Harrington&#x27;s brother, Michael, played football at the University of Idaho, and was also a quarterback.

Harrington was the guest on the February 2, 2008, episode NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait, Wait...Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, as a guest during the &#x27;Not My Job&#x27; segment.

Harrington and his family moved back to Portland after his release from the Saints in September 2009. He is spending more time with his wife and family, and the numerous charities in which he is involved. He co-owned the Pearl Tavern, a restaurant in Portland&#x27;s Pearl District, which opened in 2016 and closed in 2018. 

On July 31, 2011, Harrington was struck by an SUV while riding his bicycle in Portland, Oregon. Harrington suffered a broken collarbone and a punctured lung and fractured his first two ribs below his collarbone and also got six staples in his head behind his right ear due to the accident.

===Broadcasting===
In 2009, Harrington worked as an NFL and college football commentator for Fox Sports Radio. In 2010, he served as a color analyst for Oregon Ducks football games on Oregon Sports Network.
Currently, Harrington is a college football analyst for Fox College Football on FX and Fox. He is also a general assignment reporter with KGW Television on a part-time basis in Portland, Oregon.

===Philanthropy===
Harrington established the Harrington Family Foundation in 2003 as a nonprofit organization with the goal of supporting youth education and activities as well as other miscellaneous benefits. Harrington&#x27;s parents, John and Valerie Harrington, run the foundation.

The foundation began with a portion of Joey&#x27;s signing bonus with the Detroit Lions. It raises further money by selling memorabilia items and booking events. After being given the New York Times Square &quot;Joey Heisman&quot; billboard by the former Oregon Ducks Athletic Director Bill Moos, he proceeded to cut it up and sell the pieces for charity. All the proceeds from the sales went toward scholarships for the University of Oregon.

<doc id="1037598" wikidata="Q427050" url="?curid=1037598" title="Witchaven">
<text>Witchaven (usually pronounced ) is a dark fantasy first-person shooter video game developed by Capstone Software and published by Intracorp Entertainment in 1995. Its sword-and-sorcery themed story tasks the knight Grondoval with a quest to seek out and destroy a lair of witches in their titular fortress, fighting hordes of hostile monsters along the way. &quot;Witchaven&quot; features action role-playing elements such as leveling, as well as an emphasis on melee combat. Its code was based upon an early version of the nascent Build engine. The game received overall mixed reviews, such as praise for its atmosphere and gory combat, but criticism for some aspects of gameplay. It was followed by a sequel titled &quot;Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance&quot; in 1996.

==Gameplay==

Although the game is considered a first-person shooter (FPS), the game has several role-playing video game (RPG) elements, including character progression by acquiring experience points (EXP) (gained by defeating enemies and finding gold) and level advancement with an increasing number of hit points, damage modifiers and weapons proficiency, and access to more powerful spells at higher levels. The game also has a focus on close-quarters combat, requiring more tactical thinking, unlike the standard run-and-gun gameplay of most first-person shooters at the time. As a result, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; classified it as an action role-playing game, albeit an unconventional one, while &quot;The CRPG Book Project&quot; maintained that it &quot;is not a full-fledged RPG - it&#x27;s a first-person shooter (or rather, hack &amp; slasher) with RPG elements.&quot; The game is similar to many FPS games of its era in that the player must look for color-coded keys to open closed doors. There are also options to adjust the game&#x27;s difficulty and gore levels.

There are eleven weapons in &quot;Witchaven&quot;, each with a different attack range and other characteristics: bare fists, a dagger, a short sword, a morning star, a broadsword, a battle axe, a bow and arrows, throwing axes, a pike axe, a two-handed longsword and a halberd. With the exceptions of the fists, weapons will break down with repeated use and replacements must be found in order to continue fighting. The player can also find different types of armor (only one of which may be worn at a time), each with various values of starting armor points, number of armor points that are subtracted with each hit, and chance of deflecting the attack completely. There is also a shield that acts as additional armor with a chance to deflect an attack entirely, while helmets add armor points and also double the damage the player inflicts for a while.

There are several types of scroll-based spells which can be cast by the player, such as the Fireball, Fly, Freeze, Scare, Unlock, and Nuke invocations. The player can drink various potions for restoring health, curing poison status, or gaining supernatural strength (increased damage), invincibility or invisibility for a half minute. Other items are the ankh symbol that gives the player the maximum number of 250 health points, a crystal staff that gives the maximum number of 300 armor points, magic amulets activating invisibility or scare magic for one minute, horns that enable the player to steal the enemies&#x27; health points, various magic rings providing different types of protection such as fire resistance, and scepters enabling the player character to walk on either water or lava.

The enemies the player must contend with include goblins, ogres, imps, skeletons, willow wisps and fire drakes. Some of them are prone to fighting against other types of enemies (for instance, rival goblin tribes will attack each other if put in close proximity). Treasure chests can contain wealth or traps. Illwhyrin the witch is the only boss of the game but she appears repeatedly through the game, teleporting away when losing, until the final battle at the 25th level where she can summon monsters; the game ends with her death.

The game also offers a LAN-based deathmatch-style multiplayer mode, with 10 additional multiplayer-only maps. It was made available for up to 16 players, as the first 3D game to feature that many players simultaneously.

==Plot==
In &quot;Witchaven&quot;, the player is cast in the role of Grondoval, a hardy knight in service of his homeland Stazhia, been chosen by his master, Lord Verkapheron, for a mission to rid the world of the threat posed by the evil Illwhyrin. In her lair, known as the realm of Witchaven and hidden in a massive subterranean maze under the forbidding Isle of Char, Illwhyrin performs sinister rituals seeking to lift a dimensional barrier, known as the Veil, that separates the game&#x27;s universe from the chaotic Nether Reaches. If she succeeds, she might access unlimited dark powers to draw upon and gather a vast horde of demonic minions to use as armies for conquest. Grondoval arrives at Char by boat, armed only with a dagger. He needs to fight his way through the hordes of monsters dwelling in a labyrinth of dark caves and dungeons so he can reach Illwhyrin&#x27;s inner sanctum in time and put an end to her before it is too late.

==Development==
&quot;Witchaven&quot; was adapted from Wyrm Works&#x27; 1992 tabletop role-playing game supplement &quot;Witchaven&quot; created by Mike Pitts, who is credited for &quot;original story and maps&quot; in the video game. The concept &quot;violent, first-person action game set in a fantasy universe ruled by a coven of evil witches who must be eradicated from their lairs&quot; was created after the team attended Gen Con &#x27;93. The development began in 1994, following the completion of &quot;Operation Body Count&quot;. At first, the protagonist character was said to be split into two classes for the player to choose: spellcaster or warrior, and an early design called for the player to choose a class and a gender (these features were later seemingly abandoned in favor of a predefined male hero character capable of using both weapons and spells). An early version of the game&#x27;s story, which was featured in early promotional materials, involved three witches &quot;older than time itself&quot;. One advertisement also mentions how &quot;it is rumored that deep beneath dwells the volcano a powerful demon, giving the witches enormous power in return for human sacrifice.&quot;

Along with &quot;William Shatner&#x27;s TekWar&quot;, also made by Capstone Software in 1995, &quot;Witchaven&quot; was one of the first games released to use the Build engine, which did not yet allow sloped ceilings and floors, a feature that 3D Realms added later in 1995. The games used a blue-screen technology during the production. Generic enemies are actually clay-made models, first photographed at every angle, then turned into computer sprites; Illwhyrin was played by the game&#x27;s product manager Judy Melby. In-game weapon models were also created by using digitization, based on the weapons provided by the BlackSword Armoury Inc. Some of the grotesque stoneworks were based on photographs in Stephen King&#x27;s book Nightmares in the Sky. The game&#x27;s intro sequence was created by Shadows in Darkness (then known as &quot;Animation Factory&quot;) as their first work. &quot;Witchaven Official Strategy Guide&quot; published by Brady Games features original artwork and behind-the-scenes with the game&#x27;s creators.

The game&#x27;s three-level demo version included features that differed from the full version. The demo version only included five weapons to wield and only six spells. Instead of a potion that cured poison, the demo version used an armor potion that increased armor value. Similarly, the fire resistance potion was replaced with a fire walk potion. The demo version&#x27;s story told of a group of &quot;Death Magic&quot; practicing witches and their plan to activate the volcano of Char that has been dormant for two centuries, causing it to erupt and threaten the surrounding areas, and the yet-unnamed &quot;brave Stazhian&quot; hero&#x27;s quest was to break this curse by vanquishing them. Although the story changed before the game&#x27;s release, the sequel still mentions an eruption of the Char&#x27;s volcano and speaks about the destruction of plural &quot;witches in their wretched lair&quot; while telling the game&#x27;s backstory; similarly, the official website includes the phrase the &quot;Witches of Char&quot; in its description of the game.

==Reception==

&quot;Witchaven&quot; was met with a mixed critical reception. Nevertheless, the sales were satisfactory enough to create a sequel.

&quot;PC Zone%&quot; gave &quot;Witchaven&quot; a score of 88/100 and recommended it as &quot;packed with lots of spells and potions to play with, the usual network/modem options, triggers and traps, impressive graphical effects - and if you&#x27;re looking for gore you&#x27;ve found it. Sick, twisted and violent - we like it.&quot; Lim Choon Wee of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote &quot;I love &quot;Witchaven&quot;,&quot; especially praising the game&#x27;s &quot;bewitching&quot; graphics. Polish magazines &quot;Gambler&quot; and &quot;Top Secret&quot; gave it their overall review scores of 90% and 29/40, respectively. In Germany, &quot;Power Play&quot; gave it two scores of 71% each for both single-player and multiplayer modes, while &quot;PC Player&quot; scored it a 74%. Other positive reception included a 79 from Spain&#x27;s &quot;Micromanía&quot; and a 90% from Slovenia&#x27;s &quot;Svet Kompjutera&quot;.

On the other hand, Petra Schlunk of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the game &quot;less than spellbounding&quot; despite the &quot;eye-popping gore and a few cosmetic RPG elements&quot; and very disappointing for its lack of real gameplay immersion, concluding it to be &quot;just another&quot; &quot;Doom&quot; clone. According to Jim Varner of GameSpot, &quot;&quot;Witchaven&quot; is certainly not a bad game, but it&#x27;s not that great either,&quot; as &quot;in-your-face combat is novel at first, but after a few hours of play, you&#x27;ll be praying for a BFG-9000.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a direct sequel titled &quot;Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance&quot;, released in 1996, Grondoval&#x27;s enemy is the slain witch&#x27;s vindictive sister. The gameplay of &quot;Witchaven II&quot; is based on its predecessor, the only differences being in some additional weapon selection and enemy variance.

A third game in the series was briefly considered, possibly to keep with the original game&#x27;s ending text premise of Grondoval eventually becoming a king, but Intracorp bankrupted and Capstone was shut down before any work on it started. The game was scheduled to be made after &quot;Corridor 8&quot;, which was never finished.

Around 2006, a former Capstone programmer Les Bird released the source code of &quot;Witchaven&quot; and &quot;Witchaven II&quot;; the derived EGwhaven patches were included in the game&#x27;s Steam and GOG.com re-releases. The game is supported by the BuildGDX source port, as well as JFWitchaven.

In addition, a black metal band Witchaven took its name from the series, and Techland&#x27;s video game &quot;Hellraid&quot; was described as a spiritual successor to &quot;Witchaven&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The indie game &quot;Arthurian Legends&quot; has been compared to &quot;Witchaven&quot;.

<doc id="1037604" wikidata="Q5717443" url="?curid=1037604" title="Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour">
<text>Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour, PC (bef. 23 February 1607/828 December 1694) was a Peer of England during the 17th century, and the most famous of the Lords Arundell of Wardour. He served as Lord Privy Seal and Lord High Steward, and was appointed to the Privy Council. During the Popish Plot he suffered a long period of imprisonment, although he was never brought to trial.

==Early life==
He was baptised on 23 February 1607/8 at St Andrew, Holborn, London. On the death of his father, who had been mortally wounded at the Battle of Stratton, on 19 May 1643 he succeeded to his estates and to his titles, which included that of Count of the Holy Roman Empire. Throughout his life a devoted Roman Catholic, he fought like his father on the side of Charles I in the First English Civil War. In May 1643 the parliamentarians wrested his ancestral home Wardour Castle, in Wiltshire, from his mother Lady Blanche Arundell who was defending it. In the following September Arundell laid siege to the castle and its new occupiers and fought in the re-taking from the rebels. By springing a mine and ruining the building, he finally dislodged the enemy under General Edmund Ludlow in March 1644, partly destroying it to prevent it being used as a fortress.

==Career==

On 13 May 1652 he acted as one of the seconds of his brother-in-law Colonel Henry Compton, in a duel with George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos. Compton was killed, and a warrant was issued by the council of state to arrest Arundell with others who had taken part. On 17 May 1653, he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to be burned &quot;in the hand&quot;. In that year Arundell appears to have petitioned Oliver Cromwell for pardon, and in 1656 to have received permission to take refuge in France. At the Restoration of Charles II, Arundell, on paying £35,000, was confirmed in all his family estates, many of which had been sold by the Commonwealth to Humphrey Weld. He regained possession of Wardour, but never had the money to properly rebuild it. On 7 March 1663 he was nominated and held the office of Master of the Horse to the Queen-Mother, Henrietta Maria.

In January 1669 he was summoned by Charles II of England, with other Roman Catholic peers, to a secret council, and was commissioned to proceed to France to inform Louis XIV of the English king&#x27;s desire to be reconciled to Roman Catholicism, and of his want of ready money. In June 1669 Arundell returned with Louis&#x27;s assent to the secret Treaty of Dover with Charles, which was signed in the following year.

==Popish Plot==
In 1678 Titus Oates and his associates announced that Arundell was a chief mover in the Popish Plot against Charles II, which they professed to have discovered; it was a complete fabrication. According to the evidence of these informers, attempts had been made by the Catholics of England, in league with Louis XIV, to raise an army of 50,000, which was to be placed under the command of Lord Arundell, William Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, and John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. Some of the witnesses asserted that the Pope had issued a commission to Arundell to be Lord Chancellor as soon as the present ministers had been removed, and that Arundell had for many years been actively employed in arranging the details of the plot. Between October 1678 and February 1684 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, along with other &quot;Popish&quot; peers, on the accusation of Titus Oates.

The charges were patently absurd: among other unlikely accusations, Arundell was alleged to have conspired with his fellow Catholic peer, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford (who was executed in 1680 for his supposed part in the Plot), although it was common knowledge that following a bitter quarrel they had not spoken to each other for some 25 years. Far from having any motive to kill the King, both were well aware of how much they had gained from his policy of religious tolerance. As Stafford sensibly remarked, simple self-interest dictated that the Catholic peerage should remain loyal to Charles ll, who in his later years was an all but open Catholic himself, whereby: &quot;we have no interest but to be quiet&quot;. Arundell was friendly with Lord Belasyse, who like Arundell suffered a term of imprisonment as a supposed Plotter, and with the civil servant Edward Colman, an ardent Catholic who was executed for his supposed part in the Plot in December 1678, but there is no reason to think that there was anything sinister about these friendships. During his imprisonment in 1679, Arundell wrote five short religious poems, published in a single folio sheet in 1679, and reissued in &quot;A Collection of Eighty-six Loyal Poems&quot; in 1685.

==Later years==
After the death of Charles II, his successor, James II, admitted Arundell, although he was a Roman Catholic, to the Privy Council (PC), to which he was admitted on 17 July/August 1686, and appointed him Keeper of the Privy Seal or Lord Privy Seal in place of Lord Clarendon on 11 March 1686/87, office he held. By royal dispensation, he was relieved of the necessity of taking the customary oaths on accepting office. In the following June Arundell presented an address to the King on behalf of the Roman Catholics, thanking him for the Declaration of Indulgence; uncharacteristically, he strongly opposed the admission of the Jesuit Edward Petre to the privy council. He received, on 24 June 1687, a bounty of £250 from the king for secret service. In 1688 he was one of the five Lords to whom King James II committed the administration of his affairs.

After the deposition of King James II, Arundell retired to his house at Breamore, Hampshire, and took no further part in public life. He died at Breamore on 28 December 1694, at the age of eighty-eight. He was buried with his ancestors at Tisbury, Wiltshire. He was a noted gambler and sportsman, and kept at Breamore a celebrated pack of hounds, which became the property of the Earl of Castlehaven, and subsequently of Hugo Meynell. From them, the Quorn Hunt&#x27;s pack is descended.

==Family==
He was the only son of Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, by his wife, Blanche Somerset, daughter of Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and his wife Elizabeth Hastings; Blanche was noted for her staunch defence of Wardour Castle during the Civil War.

He married Cicely Compton (24 March 1675/76), daughter of the Hon. Sir Henry Compton, Knt., of Brambletye, Sussex, invested as a Knight of the Order of the Bath (KB) on 25 July 1603, and his first wife Lady Cicely Sackville, and widow of Sir John Fermor. She was a granddaughter of Sir Henry Compton, 1st Baron Compton and of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset through her mother (herself a half-sister of Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset and Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset). Her stepmother was Mary Browne, daughter of Sir George Browne, also a widow, of Thomas Paston, of Thorpe, Surrey.

Their children were:
# Thomas Arundell, 4th Baron Arundell of Wardour, b. 1633, d. 10 Feb 1711/12 He became the fourth Lord Arundell of Wardour, and was in the retinue of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine on his visit to Pope Innocent XI as James II&#x27;s ambassador.
# Hon. Henry Arundell. A settlement for the marriage between him and Mary Scrope was made on 10 February 1675. They had no issue.
# Hon. Cicely Arundell, d. 1717, a nun at Rouen, Caux, France. She entered the order of Poor Clares of Rouen in 1662, and died at Rouen on 13 June 1717, at the age of eighty-two.

<text>The Battle of Lwów or Battle of Lesienice or Battle of Lviv refers to a battle between the armies of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
and Ottoman Empire that took place near the city of Lwów (Lviv, western Ukraine) on August 24, 1675.

==History==
===Before the battle===
In the early summer of 1675 the Ottoman forces of Ibrahim Şişman (&quot;Abraham the Fat&quot;) crossed the Polish border into Podolia and started its rapid march towards Lwów along the banks of the Dniester. The army numbered some 20,000 men and was composed of Ottoman infantry and cavalry with significant Crimean Tatar detachments. The Polish king John III Sobieski decided to concentrate his troops in and around Lwów and face the assaulting Muslim army after more reinforcements arrived. The Ottoman commander was notified of the concentration and moved his army to Lwow.

Sobieski decided to split his forces. A unit of 180 infantrymen, 200 light cavalry and several cannons was placed in the easternmost of the ravines leading to the road to Lwów. Most of the heavy cavalry were placed on the road itself, directly behind the valleys and the plain. The left flank of his forces was guarded by 200 Hussars stationed in the village of Zboiska, while the rest of the light cavalry and infantry guarded all other approaches towards the city in case the Ottomans outflanked the defenders and attacked the city from other directions. The remaining taborites and civilians were ordered to group on the hills surrounding the plains. They were given spare lances of the Hussars in order to give the impression that the number of Polish troops was much higher.

===Battle===
The Ottomans advance along the route exactly as Sobieski predicted. Convinced that a large group of Hussars were hiding in the woods on the hills, Ibrahim Shyshman ordered a strong group of cavalry to reach the road through one of the ravines. They were stopped by the Polish infantry and then pushed back by a counter-attack of light cavalry. At the same time, Sobieski ordered all troops guarding other approaches towards the city to join the main forces located along the road.

The 1700-strong group of Polish hussars was joined by three banners (300 men) of Lithuanian light cavalry under hetman Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł. Sobieski ordered the cavalry group to advance through the unguarded western gorge. The ravine was relatively narrow and the Ottomans could not outflank the Polish and Lithuanian cavalry while on the move.

The battle was soon over with Sobieski personally leading. The Pole&#x27;s pursuit of the Ottoman cavalry lasted until the dusk.

===Aftermath===
Sobieski liberates the rest of Poland, and returns to Kraków for his coronation.

The Battle of Lwow is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;LWOW 24 VIII 1675&quot;.

<doc id="1037610" wikidata="Q69246" url="?curid=1037610" title="Paul Flechsig">
<text>Paul Emil Flechsig (29 June 1847, Zwickau, Kingdom of Saxony – 22 July 1929, Leipzig) was a German neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and neuropathologist. He is mainly remembered today for his research of myelinogenesis.

==Biography==
Born in Zwickau, he received his education at the University of Leipzig and in 1884 became professor of psychiatry there. In 1882, he became director of the Clinical Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology at Leipzig. He made personal investigations of the European systems for the treatment of the insane, on which he was a recognized authority. He spent over fifty years of his medical career at Leipzig.

Although Flechsig contributed much in his study of neurological disorders, he is mainly remembered today for his research of myelinogenesis. Among his students were Emil Kraepelin and Oskar Vogt (mentor to Korbinian Brodmann). Flechsig was the treating psychiatrist for Daniel Paul Schreber, whose memoir inspired Sigmund Freud to publish a detailed analysis of the case in 1911. Flechsig&#x27;s work has still not been rediscovered widely but his map was reprinted and discussed in Fuster&#x27;s &quot;Cortex and Mind&quot;.
Myelinogenesis is a technique he pioneered in which he studied brains of the late term fetus and newborn by staining for myelin. Between about two months before and after birth, most of the cerebral cortex becomes myelinated. The order in which this happens appears to reflect the evolutionary order of mammals from less to more complex. He derived a map of the cerebral cortex divided not by histology (as Korbinian Brodmann did) but by order of myelination.

Flechsig divided the cortical regions into:
# an early myelinating primitive zone, which includes the motor cortex and the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortex;
# a field bordering the primitive zone that myelinates next;
# a late-myelinating zone, which he called “association”.
The last area of the human cerebral cortex to myelinate is the Dorsolateral Prefrontal cortex. (Flechsig #45, Brodmann areas 9 &amp; 46). This region continues to develop in adolescence and adulthood it is related to executive function and working memory.

In a 1927 review in the Journal of The American Medical Association (JAMA) of his last monograph one finds the following:

The &quot;Paul-Flechsig-Institute of Brain Research&quot; at the University of Leipzig is an institution established in 1974 in tribute to Flechsig. The institute&#x27;s scientific emphases is on cellular and molecular aspects of neurodegenerative diseases and glial reactions in the brain and the retina.

Flechsig&#x27;s fasciculus or Flechsig&#x27;s tract is a neurological structure which conveys proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebellum.

<text>Built in 1716–17 as a charity school, Bluecoat Chambers in School Lane is the oldest surviving building in central Liverpool, England. Following the Liverpool Blue Coat School&#x27;s move to another site in 1906, the building was rented from 1907 onwards by the Sandon Studios Society. Based on the presence of this art society and the subsequent formation of the Bluecoat Society of Arts in 1927, the successor organisation laid claim to being the oldest arts centre in Great Britain, now called the Bluecoat.

==History==
The school was founded in 1708 by the Reverend Robert Styth (died 1713), rector of Liverpool, and Bryan Blundell, a sea captain and later twice Mayor of Liverpool (1721–22 and 1728–29). Originally constructed in 1716–17, the building was extended until 1718 to function as a boarding school. By the following year, it had 50 children, with room for 100 more, and construction was finally completed in 1725.

After the school moved to a new site in Wavertree in 1906, the building was threatened with demolition. It was rented out from 1907 to the Sandon Studios Society, an independent art school and art society. The building&#x27;s future still unsecured, it took the intervention of the architect Charles Herbert Reilly, head of the Liverpool School of Architecture. He convinced the industrialist William Lever to rent Bluecoat Chambers in 1909 and subsequently buy it, renaming it Liberty Buildings. Sharing the space with the Sandon Society, Reilly moved in with his School of Architecture from 1909 until shortly after World War I. In 1913–14, Lever entertained the thought of a larger building scheme to transform Liberty Buildings into an art centre but, by 1918, got tired with the idea. 
Lever&#x27;s death in 1925 again led to proposals for demolition. A successful campaign to raise money for the purchase of Bluecoat Chambers resulted in the establishment of the Bluecoat Society of Arts in 1927 as a charitable trust to run the building.

On 3 May 1941, during the Liverpool Blitz, the concert hall and adjoining rooms were severely damaged by an incendiary bomb and during the following night the rear wing was destroyed by a bomb blast. 
Restoration took place after the war, being completed by 1951. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, having been designated on 28 June 1952.

The Bluecoat Display Centre, a contemporary craft gallery, opened in the rear courtyard in 1959. Being known as the Bluecoat Arts Centre from the 1980s, it is now simply called the Bluecoat. 
From 2005, the building was further restored and a new wing added. It was reopened in March 2008 to coincide with Liverpool&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture.

==Architecture==
The Bluecoat is built in brick with painted stone dressings and a slate roof. H-shaped in plan, originally the rear of the school resembled the front but in 1821 it was remodeled giving it a convex-shaped elevation. The front encloses three sides of a quadrangle and is separated from School Lane by a low wall with railings and gatepiers. The central block of five bays has two storeys with round-arched windows; the central three bays project forwards under a pediment containing a clock which has only an hour hand. On the roof is an octagonal cupola with round-arched openings, attached Ionic columns and a copper cap with a finial. The wings have three storeys; they are eleven bays long and one bay wide. On the ground and first floor the windows are square-headed while those on the top floor are oval. The end elevations have arched windows which match the central block. All the large windows have keystones with cherubs&#x27; heads. The main door in the centre of the central block has Ionic columns with a broken pediment containing a cartouche of the arms of Liverpool. Each wing has three square-headed doors approached by steps. The wall, railings and gate piers on School Lane are also listed at Grade I.

The 2005-2008 renovation at a cost of £14 million also included a new 2250 square metre extension, the architects being BIQ Architecten. The architects found that there were 32 different floor levels in the old building. They carried out much structural change to produce exhibition areas with better accessibility. The new extension is built mainly in brick to link with the old building, although it has a copper roof and more modern materials internally. The new wing houses a flexible performance area and four art galleries. In addition, the complex provides studios for artists and craftspeople, a restaurant and a café and a number of retail outlets. On 13 May 2008, a fire broke out in a kitchen on the first floor of the west wing causing significant damage, although 80% of the building was unaffected.

==Arts Centre==
Over the years the Bluecoat hosted a range of cultural and arts-associated events. These included art exhibitions, debates, discussions, public meetings and campaigns, poetry readings, musical concerts and recitals, and cultural lectures. It held book, record, and antiques fairs and became a centre for working artists and craftspeople.

Some of the events have continued to hold a place in history. The 1908 exhibition of works mostly by members of the Sandon Society also included the first showing in Liverpool of Claude Monet who received a special invite. In 1911, the Sandon Society took on parts of Roger Fry&#x27;s London Post-Impressionist exhibition, showing works by Picasso, Matisse, Cézanne, and Van Gogh for the first time in the UK outside the capital. In 1967 Yoko Ono appeared at the Bluecoat, at a time before she met John Lennon.
The Bluecoat was also visited by performing artists as Stravinsky, Michael Nyman, Doris Lessing and the Last Poets.

==Bluecoat today==
The Bluecoat was reopened on 15 March 2008, during Liverpool&#x27;s year as a European Capital of Culture, by Andy Burnham, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The opening exhibition, entitled &quot;Now Then&quot;, showed work by five artists, including Yoko Ono. During the early summer a display entitled &quot;Mr Roscoe&#x27;s Garden&quot;, comprising part of Liverpool&#x27;s Botanic Collection, was held.

The Bluecoat organises exhibitions, events, education programmes and concerts. It also contains 22 artists studios. The Bluecoat Cafe serves a variety of homemade and locally sourced food and drink.

Since the reopening, the galleries have held major exhibitions by John Akomfrah, Mark Leckey, Sonia Boyce, Jonathan Baldock, Bruce Asbestos Keith Piper, Siobhan Davies Dance &amp; Niamh O&#x27;Malley, amongst others.

<doc id="1037643" wikidata="Q7315289" url="?curid=1037643" title="Reserved occupation">
<text>A reserved occupation (also known as essential services) is an occupation considered important enough to a country that those serving in such occupations are exempt or forbidden from military service.
In a total war, such as the Second World War, where most fit men of military age were conscripted into the armed forces, exceptions were given to those who performed jobs vital to the country and the war effort which could not be abandoned or performed by others. Not only were such people exempt from being conscripted, they were often prohibited from enlisting on their own initiative, and were required to remain in their posts. Examples of reserved occupations include medical practitioners and police officers, but what is or is not a reserved occupation will depend on war needs and a country&#x27;s particular circumstances.

== Reserved occupations in the UK in World War I ==

Some of the reserved occupations included clergymen, farmers, doctors, teachers and certain industrial workers such as coal miners, dock workers and train drivers and iron and steel workers. Young workers were not immediately exempt, as, for example, a blacksmith would become exempt at the age of 25, and an unmarried mining or textiles worker would become exempt at the age of 30. Married men had a lower age before they became exempt. By 1915, 1.5 million men were in reserved occupations and by November 1918 this reached 2.5 million men.

==Reserved occupations in the UK in World War II==
In 1938, a &quot;Schedule of Reserved Occupations&quot; was created with the goal of exempting skilled workers from being conscripted into service. This idea was drawn up because of lessons learned during World War I when many skilled labourers were drawn into service, which created problems where positions needed filling. Examples of reserved occupations in the Second World War included coal mining, ship building, railway and dockworkers, farmers, teachers, doctors and lighthouse keepers. Not all of these fields were immediately exempt from duty. For example, a lighthouse keeper was exempt from being conscripted from the age of 18, whilst a trade union official was not exempt until he reached 30. Married men in these occupations also had lower exemption ages. The engineering sector had the most reserved occupations.

The idea was constantly reviewed throughout the war, as women, again, began to work more in industries such as munitions. This meant that men were free to join other organisations such as the Special Constabulary, the Home Guard or the ARP. It also allowed for men to join up and give them responsibilities towards the war effort, as well as allowing for them to be less stressed about not being able to directly be involved in the action. Also, many pacifists and conscientious objectors worked in reserved occupations as a compromise or to avoid call-up. Harper Adams Agricultural College saw a huge demand for places during the Second World War, as both agricultural students and farmers were exempt from conscription.

In the UK, coal mining was not a reserved occupation at the start of the war, and there was a great shortage of coal miners. Consequently, starting in December 1943, one in ten men conscripted was chosen at random to work in the mines. These men became known as &quot;Bevin Boys&quot; after the creator of the scheme, Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour and National Service.

A schedule of Reserved Occupations also existed in Canada during World War II.

<text>Wild Strawberries is a Canadian pop rock band consisting of married couple Roberta Carter-Harrison (vocals) and Ken Harrison. They have released a number of albums, their latest being &quot;dear post haste&quot; (2020).

==History==
Wild Strawberries was established during the couple&#x27;s time at university, during which they would hold jam sessions with friends. In 1988, the band submitted the song &quot;Crying Shame&quot; to Toronto radio station CFNY for its new music search contest; it won the contest, and received airplay from the station.

Harrison established a studio, enabling the band to produce its early releases independently, and led to the founding of the Strawberry Records label. The album &quot;Grace&quot; drew the attention of record label A&amp;M Records of Canada, which would distribute the band&#x27;s next release, the album &quot;Bet You Think I&#x27;m Lonely&quot;.

The success of &quot;Bet You Think I&#x27;m Lonely&quot; resulted in a national concert tour and a contract with Nettwerk, a Vancouver-based independent record label, for the production of their albums. Two albums were released under that label; a third album, &quot;Twist&quot;, was initially sponsored by Nettwerk, but creative differences resulted in the dissolution of the partnership.

The band has since eliminated all dependence on record labels, preferring instead independent production and promotion; the band adopted a strategy to promote themselves directly to fans. With the release of &quot;Deformative Years&quot;, the band simultaneously released an extended web film utilizing music from the album. The costs of producing this video were substantially lower than a music video production for television music stations, such as MTV or MuchMusic.

The success of &quot;Bet You Think I&#x27;m Lonely&quot; also earned the band a 1995 Juno Award nomination for Best New Group. Other early hits for the duo included &quot;Life-Sized Marilyn Monroe&quot; and &quot;Crying Shame&quot;.

The song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Think About It&quot; is part of the soundtrack of the 1996 film &quot;Foxfire&quot;. Other songs by the band have been included in the soundtrack for the films &quot;At Sachem Farm&quot;, &quot;The Highwayman&quot; (2000), &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; (1999), &quot;Suspicious River&quot; (2000), and &quot;Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms&quot; (1998).

The song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Think About It&quot; is found on Now! 2 which was distributed in Canada circa 1997.

===Collaborations===
One of the band&#x27;s most-heard songs, &quot;Wrong to Let You Go&quot;, was preceded and followed by collaborations with other musicians. The concept for the track was defined by Alan Fletcher, executive producer at Warner Music Canada, after Roberta Carter-Harrison sang at his wedding alongside flamenco guitarist Robert Michaels. It was then recorded with Michaels for volume 3 of the &quot;Women &amp; Songs&quot; compilation album series and later appeared as an unnumbered track on the Twist album.

Subsequently, Alan Fletcher from Warner put the band in contact with German electronic dance producer and DJ André Tanneberger (ATB). Tanneberger produced a remix of the song, released as an ATB single re-titled &quot;Let U Go&quot;. This popularized the song on both continents, as the single reached number 18 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts and number 7 on the German Singles Chart. The song also marked the point in ATB&#x27;s musical output when he began to produce songs with full vocal tracks, as opposed to sampled and looped vocals.

The Wild Strawberries and ATB went on to collaborate on further songs, including the subsequent ATB single &quot;Hold You&quot; and album tracks from the 2002 ATB album &quot;Dedicated&quot;, and multiple subsequent singles (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Stop&quot;, &quot;Long Way Home&quot;) and album tracks from the 2003 ATB album &quot;Addicted to Music&quot;. All songs were co-written between Ken and Tanneberger, with vocals by Roberta.

Tanneberger later produced a new recording of &quot;Let U Go&quot; for the 2005 greatest hits compilation &quot;Seven Years: 1998–2005&quot;, with new male vocalist Jan Löchel.

Sarah McLachlan played guitar on and appeared in the video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Think About It&quot;. The band participated in all three years of the Lilith Fair music festival, which McLachlan founded.

<doc id="1037665" wikidata="Q1970604" url="?curid=1037665" title="Duracell Bunny">
<text>The Duracell Bunny is an anthropomorphic pink rabbit powered by Duracell batteries and trademarked for use in all parts of the world except Turkey, The United States and Canada. Advertisements, which may feature one Duracell Bunny, or several, usually feature the bunnies competing in some way; for example, in a game of football, a drumming competition or a race. In advertisements, the Duracell Bunny is either a standard battery-powered toy, a stop-motion puppet, or a CGI-animated character.

==History== 
Mallory Duracell launched the Duracell Bunny campaign in 1973, with the &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; television advertisement, created by the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency. The ad depicted several pink toy bunnies drumming. By the end of the spot, only one was still running – that being the one powered by a Duracell alkaline battery. The advertisement claimed that Duracell batteries ran several times longer than other batteries, adding as a small footnote that it was being compared to older technology zinc-carbon batteries.

When the Duracell Bunny debuted in North America in 1973, it was slated to be just a one-shot character in the &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; advertisement. Duracell purportedly trademarked their bunny, but by 1988, that trademark had lapsed. Sensing an opportunity, Duracell&#x27;s North American rival Energizer created a parody of the &quot;Drumming Bunny&quot; in 1988. Energizer&#x27;s parody ad began much as Duracell&#x27;s original 1973 ad did, except that midway through the discussion of which drumming rabbit would last longest, it was interrupted by the Energizer Bunny, a different pink rabbit wearing sunglasses, flip-flops, and beating a bass drum. Energizer created a multi-year campaign around the Energizer Bunny. There are significant differences in appearance between the two companies&#x27; mascots — the Energizer Bunny wears sunglasses, has larger ears, is a different shade of pink, and has a different body shape. Also, while the Energizer Bunny is a single rabbit, the Duracell Bunnies are a species. The Duracell Bunny advertising campaign has evolved, and Duracell Bunnies are usually depicted as doing something other than beating a drum as they did in the original 1973 advertisement. In 2019, the bunny spoke for the first time, with its voice being provided by American voice actor and writer Miles Luna.

==Legal issues==

===1990 trademark dispute===

When Energizer&#x27;s 1988 parody became an advertising success and Energizer trademarked its bunny, Duracell decided to revive the Duracell Bunny campaign and filed for a new United States trademark of its own, referencing the original use of the character more than a decade earlier. The resulting dispute resulted in a confidential out-of-court settlement on January 10, 1992, whereby Energizer took exclusive trademark rights in the United States and Canada, and Duracell took exclusive rights in all other places in the world.

===2016 distribution lawsuit===
In February 2016, Energizer filed a trademark infringement and contract violation lawsuit against Duracell. Energizer alleged that Duracell was using a pink bunny in its advertising in the United States, did not have any trademark rights in the United States for a pink bunny, and had violated an agreement between Energizer and Duracell governing the use of a pink bunny trademark in the U.S. Duracell replied that the cases Energizer cited came from overseas distributors importing packages from abroad, and that Duracell did not have the specific power to stop those distributors from doing so. In November 2017, a United States District court judge threw out most of Energizer&#x27;s claims in a summary judgement, but leaving the breach of the 1992 territorial contract dispute active with respect to the two companies&#x27; bunny trademarks.

<doc id="1037668" wikidata="Q1194037" url="?curid=1037668" title="Salad Fingers">
<text>Salad Fingers is a British adult animated web series created by David Firth in 2004. It revolves around the eponymous Salad Fingers; a thin, green, mentally troubled man who inhabits a desolate world. As of September 2023, thirteen episodes have been published on YouTube and Newgrounds. Since its debut, &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; has amassed a cult following and has been described as a viral phenomenon.

==Background==
Salad Fingers was conceived as an in-joke when one day, while Firth was playing the guitar, his friend and frequent collaborator Christian Webb commented that he had &quot;salad fingers&quot;, referring to the way Firth played the C-chord. In 2004, Firth posted the first episode via Flash to entertainment website Newgrounds, where it was initially unpopular. However, the video quickly gained traction once it was featured on the website&#x27;s front page. Later, once the series transitioned to video-sharing platform YouTube, Firth turned to crowdfunding because he was unable to monetize videos due to the platform&#x27;s content policy.

In addition to writing and animating the series, Firth voices the titular character himself. Firth says the character&#x27;s voice was inspired by that of his grandmother&#x27;s and Michael Jackson&#x27;s speaking voice. The softness of Salad Fingers&#x27;s voice is due to the circumstance that Firth did not want to wake up his parents while recording. While the first episode took Firth &quot;one day and one night&quot; to produce, others took him six months and up to one year. He has cited the works of David Lynch, Tim Burton, and Chris Morris, as well as &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; as sources of inspiration. Music featured in &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; episodes includes work credited to Sigur Rós, Aphex Twin, and Boards of Canada.

In 2007, the series, then spanning seven episodes, had its theatrical debut at Sydney Underground Film Festival, where all episodes were shown back to back. In 2009, episodes were screened at Glimmer, &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot;″s international short film festival. In 2020, a &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; tour throughout the United Kingdom was announced. The tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was ultimately held in 2021 and 2022. Events featured back-to-back screenings of all episodes released thus far, followed by an in-person interview with Firth.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
&quot;Salad Fingers&quot; has become the subject of a cult following and has generated a number of memes, having &quot;captured the comically demented and strange underbelly of the internet&quot; according to Elijah Watson of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot;. The series&#x27;s characters, themes, and setting have inspired extensive discussions and theories online. In 2005, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; ranked it among its &quot;Top 10&quot; pop culture phenomena. &quot;Wired&quot; considers &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; to be one of the most memorable Flash animations, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes it as one of the first to go &quot;fully viral&quot;. Writing for the academic journal &quot;Convergence&quot;, Jessica Balanzategui and César Albarrán-Torres describe &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; as &quot;a significant stylistic and generic contribution to the early period of participatory digital cultures&quot; and the character as a &quot;patron saint of the digital uncanny&quot;. In 2020, the series had been viewed 110 million times in total on YouTube, with the first episode alone receiving 36 million video views.

Jon Mendelsohn of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; observes that the series has &quot;terrified audiences&quot; by means of its &quot;post-apocalyptic setting and crypticness&quot; and compares it to the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Tanner Fox of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; describes it as &quot;nothing short of haunting&quot; due to its &quot;weird premises, nails-on-chalkboard background music, and shocking moments of gore and depravity&quot;. Devon Maloney of &quot;The Verge&quot; remarks its emphasis on gore and bodily fluids, calling it &quot;basically ASMR for psychopaths&quot;. Will Ramsey of &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot; calls it &quot;comic, horrifying and strangely endearing&quot;. Emma Garland of &quot;Vice&quot; notes that the series has caused both fascination and dread in its viewers, and deems it &quot;one of the bleakest comedies to ever come out of the UK&quot;. The series&#x27;s landscapes, figures, dream sequences, and open-ended nature of episodes have drawn comparisons to the works of David Lynch.

In 2019, a Canadian high school teacher was temporarily suspended after showing his class a range of videos that students described as &quot;weird, creepy and inappropriate&quot; including &quot;Salad Fingers&quot;. The teacher ultimately resigned from his job at the school and attended a disciplinary program. In response, Firth commented on Twitter that viewings of &quot;Salad Fingers&quot; should be &quot;mandatory&quot; for children.

<text>Grand Teton is the highest mountain of the Teton Range in Grand Teton National Park at in Northwest Wyoming. Below its north face is Teton Glacier. 
The mountain is a classic destination in American mountaineering via the Owen-Spalding route (II, 5.4), the North Ridge and North Face.

== Geography ==

Grand Teton, at , is the highest point of the Teton Range, a subrange of the Rocky Mountains, which extend from northern British Columbia to northern New Mexico. It is the second highest peak in the U.S. state of Wyoming after Gannett Peak, the parent peak. The mountain is entirely within the Snake River drainage basin, which it feeds by several local creeks and glaciers. 
It is considered part of the Cathedral Group next to Teewinot Mountain and Mount Owen (Wyoming) and Middle Teton. Below its north face is Teton Glacier.

The mountain began its uplift 9 million years ago, during the Miocene. Several periods of glaciation have carved Grand Teton and the other peaks of the range into their current shapes.

=== Climate ===
== History ==

=== Name ===
Grand Teton&#x27;s name was first recorded as Mount Hayden by the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition of 1870. However, the name &quot;the Grand Teton&quot; had early currency. The edition of April, 1901 of the USGS 1:125,000 quadrangle map of the area shows &quot;Grand Teton&quot; as the name of the peak. A United States National Park named &quot;Grand Teton National Park&quot; was established by law in 1929. By 1931, the name Grand Teton Peak was in such common usage that it was recognized by the USGS Board on Geographic Names. Another shift in usage led the Board to shorten the name on maps to Grand Teton in 1970.

In terms of etymology for the mountain&#x27;s naming, the most common explanation is that &quot;Grand Teton&quot; means &quot;large teat&quot; or &quot;large breast&quot; (&quot;téton&quot;) in French, named by either French-Canadian or Iroquois members of an expedition led by Donald McKenzie of the North West Company. Unsubstantiated claims exist that the mountain was named after the Teton Sioux tribe of Native Americans, even though this tribe lived about 200 miles (320 km) away in the Dakotas, not Wyoming. Moreover, in terms of etymology studies, the Teton Sioux tribe&#x27;s name is stated as being &quot;not related&quot; to the Grand Teton.

==Climbing ==
=== First ascent ===
There is a disagreement over who first climbed Grand Teton. Nathaniel P. Langford and James Stevenson claimed to have reached the summit on July 29, 1872 while serving as members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. A party organised by William O. Owen also claimed the first ascent when they reached the summit of Grand Teton on August 11, 1898.

Some believe that Langford/Stevenson&#x27;s description and sketches match the summit of The Enclosure, a side peak of Grand Teton (the Enclosure is named after a man-made palisade of rocks on its summit, probably constructed by Native Americans). Langford himself suggested that the Enclosure was probably first climbed by Native Americans. Mountaineer and author Fred Beckey believes that Langford/Stevenson climbed the Enclosure because their description better matches it and does not accurately describe the true summit, nor does it mention the formidable difficulties found just above the Upper Saddle. Beckey also believes that they summited the Enclosure because it was traditional with members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 to build a cairn in such a place, but no such cairn was found when Owen reached the summit of Grand Teton in 1898. 

Supporters of Owen&#x27;s claim included The Wyoming Legislature and Paul Petzoldt, former pioneer American climber. Ironically among Langford&#x27;s supporters was Franklin Spalding, who led Owen&#x27;s ascent to the summit and tossed the rope that allowed Owen and the others to follow.

Mountaineer and author Leigh Ortenburger researched the controversy in depth, using original source material, for his 1965 climber&#x27;s guidebook. Ortenburger concluded: &quot;Since historical &#x27;proof&#x27; is extremely unlikely to be forthcoming for either side of the argument, perhaps the best way of regarding the problem, short of a detailed analysis of the probabilities, is to state that in 1872 Langford and Stevenson may have climbed the Grand Teton, in 1893 Kieffer, Newell, and Rhyan may have climbed it, and in 1898 Spalding, Owen, Peterson, and Shive definitely did succeed in reaching the summit.&quot;

===Routes===
Grand Teton can be climbed via the Owen-Spalding route (II, 5.4). A short section of the route is highly exposed and previous alpine climbing experience is recommended before attempting an ascent; nonetheless, athletes with no prior climbing experience regularly reach the summit. The Owen-Spalding route is named for the climbers who claim to have made the first ascent: William Owen, Franklin Spalding, Frank Peterson, and John Shive. There is some debate as to which group made the first ascent; see that discussion. Notwithstanding the first-ascent controversy, this climbing route has been firmly named after William Owen and Franklin Spalding. The Owen-Spalding route begins at the Lower Saddle which is reached by walking from the Lupine Meadows Trailhead to Garnet Canyon and then up to the Lower Saddle on a trail that&#x27;s fairly well defined. The more technical &amp; exposed part of the climb begins at the Upper Saddle. 
* The most popular route up the mountain is via the Upper Exum Ridge Route (II, 5.5) on the Exum Ridge, an exposed route first climbed by Glenn Exum, co-founder of Exum Mountain Guides. Much of the climbing is fourth class, with one wide step from the end of Wall Street Ledge to the Ridge comprising the first stretch of technical climbing. Other notable pitches include the Golden Stair (immediately following the traverse from Wall Street Ledge), the Friction Pitch (considered the most difficult pitch on the route), and the V-Pitch. The direct start of the Exum Ridge using the Lower Exum Ridge Route (III, 5.7,) is considered a mountaineering classic and is featured in the historic climbing text &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;.
*In addition to the Direct Exum Ridge Route, the &quot;Classic Climbs&quot; listing also features the North Ridge (IV, 5.8) and North Face with Direct Finish (IV, 5.8), both of which ascend the dramatic northern aspect of the peak. The Grand Teton has the most routes listed in the &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot; of any peak. The only other to have more than one route listed is El Capitan, with The Nose and Salathé Wall. These inclusions have helped maintain the fame of the peak in the climbing community. Since the Grand Teton&#x27;s first ascent, 38 routes with 58 variations have been established.

==Skiing==
=== First ski and snowboard descents ===

* First male alpine descent: Bill Briggs, 1971
* First female alpine descent: Kristen Ulmer, 1997
* First male Telemark descent: Rick Wyatt, 1982
* First female Telemark descent: A.J. Cargill, 2004 
* First male snowboard descent: Stephen Koch, 1989
* First female snowboard descent: Dani deRuyter, 2010
*First male disabled ski descent: Santiago Vega, 2021.

===Routes===
The Grand Teton has been skied by five routes, each requiring at least one rappel. The first descent on skis was made by Bill Briggs in the spring of 1971 down the East Face and Stettner Couloir, it has since been renamed the Briggs Route. This descent required a free rappel, which was completed with skis on. More casually, skiing is possible from the crest of the saddle between the Grand and the Middle Teton, continuously into the valley floor.

<text>Galyat () region, or hill tract, (also written Galliat and Galiyat) is a narrow strip or area roughly – north-east of Islamabad, Pakistan, extending on both sides of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-Punjab border, between Abbottabad and Murree. The word itself is derived from the plural of the Urdu word &quot;gali&quot;, which means an alley between two mountains on both sides of which there are valleys and it is not the highest point in the range. Many of the towns in the area have the word &quot;gali&quot; as part of their names, and are popular tourist resorts.
Being on linguistic and geographical continuum this area has challenged social scientists in terms of anomalous classification.

==Brief history and ethnology==

The Galyat tracts were first &#x27;discovered&#x27; by early British colonial officials, such as James Abbott, who ventured into these areas circa 1846–47. The British found them climatically conducive to them and began to develop some of the sites in the range/tract as hill resorts, to escape the summer heat of the low-lands. Later on, after Partition/Independence of Pakistan in 1947, these were neglected for some time but eventually developed further from the 1960s onwards as popular resorts.

The area, being home to the Karlal tribe, was called the &#x27;Karral country&#x27; during the colonial times by the British (named after the tribe). The Karlal&#x27;s are still the dominant tribe of the Galyat. The language spoke by the tribesmen is Hindko whereas the dialect of Hindko spoken is called the &#x27;Dhundi-Kairali&#x27;.
It is today located in what is the Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At an elevation of 2,410 m (8,000 ft), it is a popular tourist resort in the summer months. It is forested with pine, cedar, oak walnut and also oak and maple trees.

In 2023, this region has been included by UNESCO in prestigious biospehere reserve sites.

<text>Todd Lynn Helton (born August 20, 1973) is an American former professional baseball first baseman who played his entire 17-year career for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). A five-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger, and three-time Gold Glove Award winner, Helton holds the Rockies&#x27; club records for hits (2,519), home runs (369), doubles (592), walks (1,335), runs scored (1,401), runs batted in (RBIs, with 1,406), games played (2,247), and total bases (4,292), among others.

Each season from 1999 to 2004, Helton met or exceeded all of the following totals: .320 batting average, 39 doubles, 30 home runs, 107 runs scored, 96 RBI, .577 slugging percentage and .981 on-base plus slugging. In 2000, he won the batting title with a .372 average, and also led MLB with a .698 slugging percentage, 59 doubles, and 147 RBI and the National League with 216 hits. Helton collected his 2,000th career hit against the Atlanta Braves on May 19, 2009, and his 2,500th against the Cincinnati Reds on September 1, 2013. In , Helton was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==High school==
Helton attended Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was a letterman in football and baseball. In football, he posted 2,772 total yards as quarterback. In baseball, as a senior, Helton posted a .655 batting average and 12 home runs and was named the Regional Player of the Year. &quot;Baseball America&quot; also bestowed on him All-American honors for his senior season. Helton was drafted in the 2nd round (55th overall) by the San Diego Padres during the 1992 MLB draft. He did not sign and chose to attend college.

==University of Tennessee==
Helton received an athletic scholarship from the University of Tennessee to play both football and baseball. He was named a Gatorade Player of the Year for football and baseball in Tennessee. As a freshman and sophomore, he backed up Heath Shuler at quarterback. Entering his junior season in 1994, he was the back-up to senior Jerry Colquitt and ahead of Peyton Manning (then a true freshman). After Colquitt tore knee ligaments in the season opener at UCLA, Helton took over as the starter. Three weeks later against Mississippi State, he suffered a knee injury and was replaced by Manning, who went on to break several records. Helton appeared in 12 games during his career with the Vols football team, completing 41 of 75 passes for 484 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions.

In baseball, Helton was awarded the Dick Howser Trophy as National Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year, following his junior baseball season in 1995. During his career at Tennessee (1993–1995), he recorded a .370 batting average, with 38 home runs and 238 RBI (both school records), while also pitching 193 innings, registering an ERA of 2.24, with 172 strikeouts and 23 saves. In 1995, he set the Tennessee saves record with 11, while posting a 0.89 ERA. Helton also has the NCAA Division I record for most consecutive scoreless innings, at 47.

Helton spent the summer of 1994 playing for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), where he was named a league all-star. He was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2024.

==MLB career==
===Draft and debut===
Helton was the eighth overall pick of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, selected in the first round by the Colorado Rockies, and signed on August 1, 1995. He spent the next two years in the minor leagues, playing for the class-A Asheville Tourists, AA New Haven Ravens, and AAA Colorado Springs Sky Sox before moving up to the majors. Helton made his major-league debut in 1997 on August 2, a 6–5 road loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He started in left field, flied out in his first at-bat, singled in his next time up off Francisco Córdova, and hit a solo home run off Marc Wilkins.

===1997–1999: Early career===
During the 1997 season, Helton hit .280/.337/.484 (batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage), with five home runs, in 35 games played. When Rockies first baseman Andrés Galarraga went to the Atlanta Braves in 1998, Helton became the full-time starter at first base for Colorado during the 1998 season. The Rockies named Helton their club representative in 1998, the first time the team ever gave a rookie that role. He hit .315/.380/.530, with 25 home runs and 97 RBI, in 152 games played. Helton led all major-league rookies in average (.315), home runs (25), RBI (97), multi-hit games (49), total bases (281), slugging percentage (.530) and extra base hits (63). He also led all National League rookies in runs (78), hits (167) and on-base percentage (.380). At the time, only Mike Piazza (35), David Justice (28) and Darryl Strawberry (26) had hit more home runs as an NL rookie since 1972, and only Piazza had more RBI (112). Helton finished second to Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs in the voting for National League Rookie of the Year. The Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame named Helton its 1998 Professional Athlete of the Year.

In 1999, Helton had a .320 batting average, .395 on-base percentage and .587 slugging percentage. He also hit 35 home runs and 113 RBI, while drawing 68 walks. On June 19, 1999, in a 10–2 Rockies home win over the Florida Marlins, Helton hit for the cycle. He fell short of hitting a second cycle on four occasions during the 1999 season, which would have made him only the second player since 1900 (Babe Herman was the first to do so in 1931) to hit two cycles in one season.

===2000–2006: Mid-career===

Helton enjoyed arguably his best season in 2000, leading the major leagues in batting average (.372), RBI (147), doubles (59), total bases (405), extra base hits (103), slugging percentage (.698) and OPS (1.162). He led the National League in hits (216) and on-base percentage (.463). Helton hit a league-leading home batting average of .391 and placed third in the National League in road batting average (.353). Helton&#x27;s MLB-leading 103 extra base hits tied for the fourth most in MLB history and the second most in NL history. His National League-leading numbers in on-base percentage, slugging percentage and batting average gave him the &quot;percentage triple crown.&quot; Helton became the second Rockies player, after Larry Walker in 1999, to accomplish that feat. Helton and Walker made the Rockies the first team in MLB history to record percentage triple crowns in consecutive seasons with different players. Helton became only the fourth player in National League history to lead the NL in both batting average and RBI. He became the first player in National League history and the fifth player in MLB history (Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg are the others) to have at least 200 hits, 40 home runs, 100 RBI, 100 runs, 100 extra base hits and 100 walks in one season.

Helton was invited to his first career Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2000. He also received National League Player of the Month honors for May and August. He finished fifth in voting for the MVP award. However, the Associated Press, &quot;Sporting News&quot;, USA Baseball Alumni and &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; all named Helton the MLB Player of the Year. Buck O&#x27;Neil and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum presented Helton with the Walter Fenner &quot;Buck&quot; Leonard Legacy Award. Helton was also given the team-honored version of the Roberto Clemente Man of Year Award, for his community contributions to Eastern Tennessee. Furthermore, he was the National League winner of the second annual Hank Aaron Award. Each season from 2000 to 2003, he was named the Rockies Player of the Year. For all of his success, the Colorado Rockies rewarded Helton with a nine-year, $141.5 million contract in April 2001 that took effect in 2003.

The following season, Helton posted a career-high 49 home runs (22 of them occurred away from Coors Field). The 49 home runs tied teammate Larry Walker for the most home runs ever by a Colorado Rockies player in a single season. Additionally, Helton had a .336 batting average, .432 on-base percentage and .685 slugging percentage. He also had 105 extra base hits, making him the first player in MLB history to have at least 100 total extra base hits in back-to-back seasons. Furthermore, Helton attained 402 total bases, making him only the fourth player in MLB history to do so in consecutive seasons (Chuck Klein, Gehrig and Foxx are the others). Helton appeared in his second consecutive All-Star game in 2001 — his first as a starter. He won his first Gold Glove at first base and was once again a top candidate for MVP, but was overshadowed by Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds.

In 2002, Helton had a .329 batting average, 30 home runs, 109 RBI, 98 walks, 107 runs, .577 slg % and 319 total bases. He became the first player in Rockies history to score at least 100 runs in four consecutive seasons. He was named Player of the Month for May, as he hit .347 with six doubles, one triple, 10 home runs and 28 RBI during the month. Helton was named to his third consecutive All-Star game — his second straight as a starter. He also received his second consecutive Gold Glove.
2003 saw Helton involved in the closest NL batting race in history, as he hit .35849, while St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols finished first with a .35871 batting average. During the season, Helton also had 33 home runs, 117 RBI, 135 runs, 49 doubles and five triples. He won his fourth Player of the Month honor during the month of April, as he hit .337 with six home runs, 27 RBI, 28 runs, 11 doubles and 24 walks. He also appeared in his fourth consecutive All-Star game.

During the 2004 season, Helton again finished second in the NL batting race, as he hit .347, while San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds hit .362. Helton also had 32 home runs and 96 RBI on the season. He became the first player in MLB history to hit at least .315 with 25 home runs and 95 RBI in each of his first seven full seasons in the majors. He became only the third player in MLB history to accomplish that feat during any seven-year stretch in a career (Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth are the others). He set a franchise record by hitting at least 30 home runs in six consecutive seasons. Helton was named to his team-record fifth consecutive All-Star game and won his third Gold Glove during the season.

In 2005, Helton spent time on the disabled list (July 26 – August 9) for the first time in his career with a strained left calf muscle. He hit .320 with 20 home runs, 79 RBI, 92 runs and 45 doubles for the season. He was under 1.000 in OPS (finished with .979 OPS) for the first time since 1999. Helton also was not named to the National League All-Star team for the first time since 1999. However, he did end up joining Gehrig and Bill Terry as the only first basemen in MLB history to have at least a .315 batting average in eight consecutive seasons. Also in 2005, St. Louis Cardinals radio broadcaster Wayne Hagin claimed manager Don Baylor said that Helton had &quot;tried the juice&quot; in the 1990s, implying steroid use. Helton vehemently denied the allegation and considered legal action against Hagin. Hagin later apologized clarifying his comments saying he was &quot;referring to supplements, creatine, not steroids&quot; when he said &quot;juiced&quot;. Baylor said of his conversation with Hagin, &quot;We discussed creatine and that was the end of the conversation. Steroid use was never even a question with me in regards to Todd Helton. [Hagin] has his facts wrong.&quot;

The following season, Helton had to spend time on the disabled list again, this time from April 20 to May 4, 2006, as he was diagnosed with acute terminal ileitis. He hit .302 with 15 home runs, 81 RBI, 40 doubles, 91 walks and a .404 on-base percentage for the season. He ended the season below .900 in OPS (he had .880 OPS) for the first time since entering the league in 1997 when he only played 35 games that year. Helton finished third on the Rockies roster in 2006 in runs (94), hits (165), doubles (40), total bases (260) and multi-hit games (42).

===2007–2013===
Helton&#x27;s power and RBI production stayed relatively level to his previous year&#x27;s stats during the 2007 season, as he managed 17 home runs and 91 RBI. Despite these numbers being below his career averages, Helton kept up his string of seven consecutive seasons with an on-base percentage higher than .400, nine consecutive seasons with a batting average above .300, and had also been walked more times than he had struck out (a feat he had accomplished in seven of his first ten full seasons). Helton recorded his 1,000th career hit at Coors Field on June 20, 2007, in a 6–1 home win over the New York Yankees, becoming only the fifth active player to have 1,000 career hits in one ballpark. On September 9, in 4–2 home victory over the San Diego Padres, Helton hit his 35th double of the season. This made him the only player in MLB history to have hit 35 or more doubles in at least 10 consecutive seasons (1998–2007). Helton hit his 300th career home run on September 16, in a 13–0 home win over the Florida Marlins. He became the first player to hit 300 home runs for the Rockies.

Helton made what was arguably the most pivotal play of the Rockies&#x27; 2007 season in the second game of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 18. In the bottom of the ninth inning, with two outs and two strikes, Helton hit an emotional two-run walk-off home run off Dodgers closer Takashi Saito. The home run kept the Rockies alive in the bid to win the wild card or National League West title. The Rockies eventually clinched the National League wild card, in a 9–8 extra innings victory over the Padres in a wild card tie-breaker game, allowing Helton to appear in the playoffs for the first time in his career. Colorado went on to sweep the Philadelphia Phillies in three games of the National League Division Series. Helton hit a triple in the first pitch of his first career playoff at-bat in the opening game against the Phillies at Philadelphia. The Rockies also swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games of the National League Championship Series, sending the Rockies on their first trip to the World Series in franchise history. The Rockies went on to lose the World Series to the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep.
In August 2008, Helton was diagnosed with a degenerative back condition, putting his health and ability to continue play in question. On May 19, 2009, Helton got his 2,000th hit, a single, as part of an 8–1 road loss to the Atlanta Braves. On July 22, 2009, Helton hit his 500th career double in a 4–3 home victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He became the 50th player in MLB history to hit 500 career doubles and the fastest to do since 1954. Helton also joined Babe Ruth, Stan Musial, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams as the only players in MLB history to have at least 500 doubles, 320 home runs and a .325 batting average for a career. On March 11, 2010, Helton signed a two-year contract extension through the 2013 season. The extension for 2012 and 2013 was worth a total of $9.9 million.

Helton&#x27;s degenerative back condition sent him back to the disabled list in July 2010. Helton returned from the DL in August and hit .256 with 8 home runs and 37 RBI for the season. After the 2010 season, Helton said he would return to the Rockies in 2011, following rumors of a possible retirement. On February 15, 2011, Helton announced his intention to play baseball for three more years, preferably for the Rockies. On June 30 he played his 2,000th career game. On April 14, 2012, Helton hit a 2-run walk-off home run, his 7th of his career. On July 13, Helton was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to inflammation in his right hip. In 63 games, he was batting .235. After returning from the DL, Helton played only 6 games before announcing that he would have season-ending hip surgery in order to prepare for the 2013 season. Helton was healthier in 2013, playing in 124 games while hitting 15 home runs with 61 RBIs.

On September 14, 2013, Helton announced that he would be retiring at the conclusion of the 2013 season. On September 25, 2013, before his last game at Coors Field, Helton was honored by the Rockies Organization in a pre-game ceremony. In the game, Helton hit a home run and drove in three runs versus the Boston Red Sox.

On August 17, 2014, the Rockies retired Helton&#x27;s number 17 before a 6:30 pm day game at Coors Field. Helton was the first Rockies player to have his number retired in the franchise&#x27;s history.

<text>The Watermill Theatre is a producing theatre in Bagnor, Berkshire. It opened in 1967 in Bagnor Mill, a converted watermill on the River Lambourn. As a producing house, the theatre has staged works that have subsequently moved on to the West End, including the 2004 revival of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, which also transferred to Broadway in 2006. The theatre has become recognised in particular for its focus on actor-musician led productions, and for focusing on accessibility within theatre. In particular, the theatre has pioneered the concept of Integrated British Sign Language performances, which is a style of interpreted performance wherein the interpreters perform on stage as part of the cast, as opposed to remaining by the side of the stage.

In 2024 the Watermill Theatre jointly won Theatre of the Year at The Stage Awards.

== History ==
The theatre is situated in Bagnor Mill, a former corn mill on the River Lambourn in Bagnor, Berkshire. The site is named in the Domesday Book, which references a watermill in Bagnor, though the current building is much more recent. It opened as a 113-seat amateur theatre in 1965, having been converted by David Gollins. In 1967 the theatre was expanded with the addition of a fly system and lighting control, and housed its first professional productions. In 1971, the auditorium was rebuilt to allow a capacity of 170.

In 1981 the theatre was purchased by Jill Fraser, who sought to change it from a local repertory theatre into a producing house. In the 1990s, the Propeller company was formed at the theatre. In the early 21st century, the theatre staged a number of productions that subsequently transferred to the West End – including &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, and &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;.

In the mid-2000s, Fraser sought to sell the theatre to ensure its long-term future. The &quot;Save The Watermill&quot; appeal was founded to raise funds to allow the board of trustees to purchase the theatre. Fraser died from cancer in February 2006. In 2008 it was announced that funds had been met for the theatre&#x27;s purchase.

Fraser was succeeded as artistic director by Hedda Beeby, who was voted Theatre Manager of the year in the 2014 UK Theatre Awards. Paul Hart, the incumbent artistic director, was appointed as Beeby&#x27;s successor in 2015.

==Funding==

The Watermill is a registered charity and receives funding from a variety of sources. It was previously funded by Arts Council England, as part of their National Portfolio Organisation funding scheme, which highlights cultural institutions that it believed to be of national importance. In 2022, the Arts Council announced the conclusion of a major review into its funding strategy, which resulted in many cultural organisations having their funding cut, including the Watermill which lost 100% of its funding.

The theatre also receives funding in the form of individual donations by members of the public, donations from Trusts and Foundations as well as through corporate funding schemes. Income is also generated through the sale of tickets for the shows, and sale of merchandise.

In 2020, the theatre accepted a £500,000 donation from the Sackler family, the billionaire American family accused of contributing to the opioid crisis through the drug OxyContin. In January 2024, the New York Times contacted 30 institutions which were previously recipients of Sackler money, 29 of which confirmed that they no longer accepted money from the family. The Watermill Theatre was the only institution which declined to comment.

<text>In statistics, a proper linear model is a linear regression model in which the weights given to the predictor variables are chosen in such a way as to optimize the relationship between the prediction and the criterion. Simple regression analysis is the most common example of a proper linear model. Unit-weighted regression is the most common example of an improper linear model.

<text>A hill station is a town located at a higher elevation than the nearby plain or valley. The English term was originally used mostly in colonial Asia, but also in Africa (albeit rarely), for towns founded by European colonialists as refuges from the summer heat and, as Dale Kennedy observes about the Indian context, &quot;the hill station (...) was seen as an exclusive British preserve: here it was possible to render the Indian into an outsider&quot;. The term is still used in present day, particularly in India, which has the largest number of hill stations, most are situated at an altitude of approximately .

== History ==

=== In South Asia ===
Nandi Hills is an 11th-century hill station that was developed by the Ganga dynasty in present-day Karnataka, India. Tipu Sultan (1751–1799) notably used it as a summer retreat.

Hill stations in British India were established for a variety of reasons. One of the first reasons in the early 1800s, was for the place to act as a sanitorium for the ailing family members of British officials. After the rebellion of 1857, the British &quot;sought further distance from what they saw as a disease-ridden land by [escaping] to the Himalayas in the north&quot;. Other factors included anxieties about the dangers of life in India, among them &quot;fear of degeneration brought on by too long residence in a debilitating land&quot;. The hill stations were meant to reproduce the home country, illustrated in Lord Lytton&#x27;s statement about Ootacamund in the 1870s as having &quot;such beautiful English rain, such delicious English mud.&quot; Shimla was officially made the &quot;summer capital of India&quot; in the 1860s and hill stations &quot;served as vital centres of political and military power, especially after the 1857 revolt.&quot; 

As noted by Indian historian Vinay Lal, hill stations in India also served &quot;as spaces for the colonial structuring of a segregational and ontological divide between Indians and Europeans, and as institutional sites of imperial power.&quot;
 William Dalrymple wrote that &quot;The viceroy was the spider at the heart of Simla&#x27;s web: From his chambers in Viceregal Lodge, he pulled the strings of an empire that stretched from Rangoon in the east to Aden in the west.&quot; Meanwhile Judith T Kenny observed that &quot;the hill station as a landscape type tied to nineteenth-century discourses of imperialism and climate. Both discourses serve as evidence of a belief in racial difference and, thereby, the imperial hill station reflected and reinforced a framework of meaning that influenced European views of the non-western world in general.&quot; The historian of Himalayan cultures Shekhar Pathak speaking about the development of Hill Stations like Mussoorie noted that &quot;the needs of this (European) elite created colonies in Dehradun of Indians to cater to them.&quot; This &quot;exclusive, clean, and secure social space – known as an enclave – for white Europeans ... evolved to become the seats of government and foci of elite social activity&quot;, and created racial distinctions which perpetuated British colonial power and oppression as Nandini Bhattacharya notes. Dale Kennedy observed that &quot;the hill station, then, was seen as an exclusive British preserve: here it was possible to render the Indian into an outsider&quot;. 

Kennedy, following Monika Bührlein, identifies three stages in the evolution of hill stations in India: high refuge, high refuge to hill station, and hill station to town. The first settlements started in the 1820s, primarily as sanitoria. In the 1840s and 1850s, there was a wave of new hill stations, with the main impetus being &quot;places to rest and recuperate from the arduous life on the plains&quot;. In the second half of the 19th century, there was a period of consolidation with few new hill stations. In the final phase, &quot;hill stations reached their zenith in the late nineteenth century. The political importance of the official stations was underscored by the inauguration of large and costly public-building projects.&quot;

The concept of Hill Station has been used loosely in India (and more broadly South Asia) since the mid-20th century to qualify any town or settlement in mountainous areas, which attempt to expand its local economy toward tourism, or have been invested by recent mass tourism practices. Kullu and Manali in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, are two example of that misuse of &quot;Hill Station&quot; or more accurately deviation of its meaning. These two historical settlements existed prior to the British, and haven&#x27;t been specially frequented by them or even extensively modified or shaped by them. However, the rise of internal domestic tourism in India from the eighties and the subsequent reproduction of Hill Station practice by urban middle-class Indians contributed to the labelling of these two localities as &quot;Hill Stations&quot;. Munnar, a settlement in the state of Kerala whose economy is primarily based on tea cultivation and processing, as well as plantation agriculture, is another example of a hill town transformed by contemporaneous tourism practices as a hill station.

<text>Lam Yiu-gwai　林耀桂 (1877–1966) was the master responsible for the dissemination of Dragon Kung Fu. Lam was born in 1877 in Huìyáng () County in the prefecture of Huizhou in Guangdong Province, China.

From a young age Lam learned martial arts from his father Lam Qing-yun and grandfather Lam Hao-hing and Uncle Lam Hap. Like them, he would eventually undertake training from masters on Loh Fu Mountain in neighboring Bo Loh () County, where he was taught by Chan (Zen) master Tai Yuk of the Wa Sau Toi temple, who knew the Dragon style. He also learned the routines Saam Tung Goh Kiu (“Three Ways to Cross the Bridge”) from the Taoist Wong Lei-giu and Mui Fa Chat Lo (“Plum Flower Fist in Seven Sections”) from Ke Hing-ma.

Good friends since their youth in Huizhou, Lam Yiu-gwai and the Bak Mei master Jeung Lai-chuen張禮泉 later became cousins by marriage and opened several schools together. Both Lam and Jeung served as combat instructors at the Whampoa Military Academy under the leadership of General Chan Chai-tong陳濟棠.

Lam Yiu-gwai married and had several children. His wife taught Dragon Style Kung Fu to women in Hong Kong.

In the 1920s, he moved to Guangzhou, where he opened a number of Dragon style schools and met Mok Gar master Lin Yin-tang, who became a friend with whom he had much in common.
Lin Yin-tang was from the prefecture of Dongguan, which bordered both Huìyáng and Bóluó counties.
Like Yiu-gwai, Yin-tang studied at a temple on Loh Fu Mountain; in Yin-tang&#x27;s case, the Temple of Emptiness (), where he studied meditation and traditional Chinese medicine.

After a stroke in the early 1950s, Lam Yiu-gwai moved to Hong Kong for medical treatment and to reunite with his family where, after another stroke in 1965, he died in 1966.

He passed on the art to his students, among others, Chiu Chung, Wu Hua-tai, Ma Chai, Chan Cheung (Robert Chan), Tsui Yiu-cheung, Yip Ho-sing, Tsang Gan, Ho Lai何禮, Cho Sam曹森, Lau Hong劉康, Mao Yim繆炎, Lee Fat李发 and Chan Dak, in addition to his sons Lam Chan-gwong () and Lam Wun-gwong (). The Dragon Sign Athletic Association in Hong Kong celebrated its 50th anniversary in November 2019. In addition to Hong Kong and mainland China, Dragon Style Kung Fu is practiced in the United States, London, Canada, Ireland, and Australia.

Cho Sam&#x27;s student, Yip Wing-hong, Lam Yiu-gwai&#x27;s disciples, Mao Yim, Ho Lai and Lau Hong, would emigrate to New York City. They have taught numerous students in Manhattan Chinatown since 1974.

Chiu Chung‘s student Nicholas Costello established the Chiu Chung Lung Ying Academy in Slane, Co. Meath, Ireland and has been teaching there since 1998.

<doc id="1037720" wikidata="Q6225613" url="?curid=1037720" title="John Cerutti">
<text>John Joseph Cerutti (April 28, 1960 – October 3, 2004) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Toronto Blue Jays and Detroit Tigers between 1985 and 1991, and was later a broadcaster for the Blue Jays.
==Early Life==
John was the second of six children. His father, Dan Cerutti, was a bricklayer. Mom Marlene was originally from St. Catherines, Ontario, in Canada.

As a kid, Cerutti was a left-handed centerfielder, so talented that his nickname was &quot;Freddie Lynn&quot;.

Cerutti grew up a fan of the New York Yankees, and idolized Ron Guidry.

==Playing career==
Born in Albany, New York, Cerutti attended Amherst College, and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. In 1980, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.

He was selected in the first round of the amateur draft by the Blue Jays in with the 21st overall pick. Cerutti played seven seasons in the major leagues with the Blue Jays (–) and Detroit Tigers ().

On June 7, 1989, Cerutti recorded the first Blue Jays win in SkyDome, their new stadium.

On December 20, 1990, the Toronto Blue Jays granted him free agency. He signed as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers on 
January 14, 1991.

==Broadcasting career==
After his playing career, he went into broadcasting and started calling Blue Jays games alongside Brian Williams on CBC before becoming a TV analyst for the team&#x27;s new flagship station, Rogers Sportsnet.

==Death==
Cerutti was supposed to broadcast the last game of the 2004 season for the Blue Jays, an afternoon home game on October 3 versus the New York Yankees, but he uncharacteristically missed an 11:00 AM pregame meeting. The production staff began to worry and started calling him. After numerous attempts, the police had to be brought in to break open the door of his Toronto hotel room. He was found without any vital signs, dead at age 44. Two weeks later, his death was officially declared to be of natural causes due to a ventricular arrhythmia, a condition he knew he had but had been told wasn&#x27;t a major concern.

&quot;It was an unbelievable shock,&quot; Blue Jays president Paul Godfrey said, in various wire reports. &quot;We all realize, those of us involved in winning and losing games, how unimportant that is at a time like this.&quot;

The Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America paid tribute to Cerutti in November 2004, giving him its annual Good Guy Award and renaming the honor for him, as Cerutti was known for his exemplary character, goodwill, and sportsmanship. The award has been handed out every year since Toronto&#x27;s inaugural season in 1977, and is given annually to an individual who best exemplifies a positive image for baseball.

<text>Murree (Punjabi, ) is a mountain resort city, located in the Galyat region of the Pir Panjal Range, within the Murree District of Punjab, Pakistan. It forms the outskirts of the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, and is about northeast of Islamabad. It has average altitude of . The British built this town during their rule to escape the scorching heat in the plains of Punjab during the summer.

Construction of the town was started in 1851 on the hill of Murree as a sanatorium for British troops. The permanent town of Murree was constructed in 1853 and the church was consecrated shortly thereafter. One main road was established, commonly referred to even in modern times, as the &quot;Mall Road&quot;. Murree was the summer headquarters of the colonial Punjab Government until 1876 when it was moved to Shimla.

Murree became a popular tourist station for British citizens of the British Raj. Several prominent Britons were born here including Bruce Bairnsfather, Francis Younghusband, Reginald Dyer and Joanna Kelley. During the colonial era, access to commercial establishments was restricted for non-Europeans. Such establishments included Lawrence College, Murree.

Since the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Murree has retained its position as a popular hill station, noted for its pleasant summer weather. Many tourists visit the town from the Islamabad-Rawalpindi area. The town also serves as a transit point for tourists visiting Azad Kashmir and Abbottabad. The town is noted for its Tudorbethan and neo-gothic architecture. The Government of Pakistan owns a summer retreat in Murree, where foreign dignitaries including heads of state often visit.

==History==

Murree, or &quot;Marhee&quot; as it was then called, was first identified as a potential hill station by Major James Abbott in 1847.

The town&#x27;s early development was in 1851 by the President of the Punjab Administrative Board, Sir Henry Lawrence. It was originally established as a sanatorium for British troops garrisoned on the Afghan frontier. Officially, the municipality was created in 1850.

The permanent town of Murree was constructed at Sunnybank in 1853. The church was sanctified in May 1857, and the main road, Jinnah Road, originally known as Mall Road and still commonly referred to as &quot;The Mall&quot;), was built. The most significant commercial establishments, the Post Office, general merchants with European goods, tailors and a millinery, were established opposite the church. Until 1947, access to Mall Road was restricted for &quot;natives&quot; (non-Europeans).

In the summer of 1857, a rebellion against the British broke out. The local tribes of Murree and Hazara, including the Dhund Abbasis and others, attacked the depleted British Army garrison in Murree; however, the tribes were ultimately overcome by the British and capitulated. From 1873 to 1875, Murree was the summer headquarters of the Punjab local government; after 1876 the headquarters were moved to Shimla.

The railway connection with Lahore, the capital of the Punjab Province, via Rawalpindi, made Murree a popular resort for Punjab officials, and the villas and other houses erected for the accommodation of English families gave it a European aspect. The houses crowned the summit and sides of an irregular ridge, the neighboring hills were covered during the summer with encampments of British troops, while the station itself was filled with European visitors from the plains and travelers to Kashmir. It was connected with Rawalpindi by a service tangas.

It was described in the &quot;Gazetteer of Rawalpindi District&quot;, 1893–94 as follows:

The sanatorium of Murree lies in north latitude 33° 54′ 30″ and east longitude 73° 26′ 30″, at an elevation of above sea level, and contained a standing population of 1,768 inhabitants, which was, however, enormously increased during the [May–November] season by the influx of visitors and their attendant servants and shopkeepers. It is the most accessible hill station in the Punjab, being distant from Rawalpindi only a five hours&#x27; journey by tonga dak. Magnificent views are to be obtained in the spring and autumn of the snow crowned mountains of Kashmir; and gorgeous sunset and cloud effects seen daily during the rains [July–August]. Part of the station, especially the Kashmir end, are also well wooded and pretty.

In 1901, the permanent population of the town was 1,844; if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.

In early January 2022, over 20 people died trying to reach the town during a snowstorm.

==Climate==

Murree features a monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. It is situated in the outer Himalayas, retaining high altitude. This type of area has cold, snowy winters, relatively cool summers with drastically escalated rain, in relation to lower altitudes, and frequent fog. Precipitation is received year round, with two maxima, the first one during winter and the second one at summer, July–August. Total mean precipitation annually is . Murree receives around of snow per year according to a 13-year data. Heavy snowfall starts in January and February.

==Administration==
Murree, (Urdu: ضِلع مری) is a district of the Rawalpindi Division in the northernmost part of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It has two tehsils, Kotli Sattian and Murree. In March 2022, the Punjab Government upgraded the administrative status of Murree by posting Hassan Waqar Cheema as the first Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC). Its status was updated from tehsil to that of a district in October 2022 after the formal appointment of a Deputy Commissioner in November 2022. 

However, the caretaker Punjab Government reversed the status of District in February 2023. The Lahore High Court struck down the move after which the additional charge of the Deputy Commissioner was given to the Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner. 

In September 2023, the Punjab Government posted a Deputy Commissioner in Murree. Agha Zaheer Abbas Sherazi was posted as the second ever Deputy Commissioner on 26 September 2023. The elected government post February 2024 elections decided to stick with the upgraded status of Murree considering its pivotal importance for the tourism industry.

The Pakistan Air Force also maintains a base at Lower Topa, near Patriata, with its own military boarding school for boys, PAF Public School Lower Topa.

During the British Raj, in the hot season Murree was the headquarters of the Lieutenant General of the Northern Command. The Commissioner of the Rawalpindi Division and the Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi also resided here during part of the season, for which period an Assistant Commissioner was placed in charge of the subdivision consisting of Murree Tehsil. The site was selected in 1850 almost immediately after the annexation of the province, and building operations commenced at once. In 1851 temporary accommodation was provided for a detachment of troops; and in 1853 permanent barracks were erected. The regular garrison generally consisted of two mountain batteries and one battalion of infantry.

<doc id="1037735" wikidata="Q459390" url="?curid=1037735" title="Ambrosia (band)">
<text>Ambrosia is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1970. Ambrosia had five Top 40 hit singles released between 1975 and 1980, including the Top 5 hits &quot;How Much I Feel&quot; and &quot;Biggest Part of Me&quot;, and Top 20 hits &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Woman (You &amp; I)&quot; and &quot;Holdin&#x27; on to Yesterday&quot;. Most of the original band members have been active with the group continuously since their 1989 reformation to the present day, with the notable exception of original guitarist and lead vocalist David Pack who left in 2000.

Ambrosia currently tours internationally and has worked in the past and present with Alan Parsons, Bruce Hornsby, Bill Champlin, Michael McDonald, and Peter Beckett among other notable artists.

==Formation==
The group was founded as a quartet with guitarist/vocalist David Pack, bassist/vocalist Joe Puerta, keyboardist Christopher North and drummer Burleigh Drummond. According to Joe Puerta, their original name was &quot;Ambergris Mite,&quot; but after doing some touring they discovered there was already a band using the name &quot;Ambergris,&quot; so they turned to the dictionary and picked the name &quot;Ambrosia&quot; because a name meaning &quot;nectar of the gods&quot; seemed fitting. While Ambrosia had several radio hits in the 1970s, much of the material on their five albums is progressive in nature.

The founding constituents of Ambrosia were reared in Southern California&#x27;s South Bay, later adopting San Pedro as their hometown. Their initial musical influences, like many of their generation, came from the Beach Boys, Jimmy Reed, King Crimson, and the Beatles. Ambrosia fused symphonic art rock with a slickly produced pop sound, resulting in a &quot;melodic prog&quot; style.

Early on, the band was infatuated with Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young and began to experiment with vocal harmonies.

The musicians, inspired by the music and artists of the progressive rock era, acquired a significant regional admiration. In 1971, a friend who was doing sound for the Hollywood Bowl, invited them to play there on stage to test a new sound system that had been installed. Gordon Parry, the head engineer in charge at the Bowl, was so impressed with the group that he invited them back to attend performances by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He introduced them to conductor Zubin Mehta, who featured Ambrosia as part of a so-called All-American Dream Concert.

==Rise to fame==
Ambrosia auditioned for Herb Alpert and A&amp;M Records early in their history, but were signed by 20th Century Fox Records in 1975, who released two albums by the group.

Their first album, &quot;Ambrosia&quot;, produced by Freddie Piro, was released in February 1975. It spawned the top 20 chart single &quot;Holdin&#x27; On to Yesterday&quot;, as well as &quot;Nice, Nice, Very Nice&quot;. The latter sets to music the lyrics to a poem in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording (other than Classical). Alan Parsons was the engineer for Ambrosia&#x27;s first album and the producer for their second. All four members of Ambrosia played on the first Alan Parsons Project album, &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot;, which was recorded soon after Ambrosia&#x27;s first album. David Pack later appeared on the Alan Parsons album &quot;Try Anything Once&quot; (1993), co-writing, playing, and providing vocals on three songs.

After lengthy touring, the band recorded &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ve Never Travelled&quot;, produced by Alan Parsons and released in September 1976. The album yielded the title song and the single &quot;Can&#x27;t Let a Woman&quot;, which both became FM favorites, both featuring lush orchestration and vocal arrangements. The record sleeve folded into a large pyramid. &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ve Never Travelled&quot; received a Grammy nomination and set the stage for the band&#x27;s signing to Warner Bros. Records.

In 1976 the group recorded the Beatles song &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, for the transitory musical documentary, &quot;All This and World War II&quot; (November 1976). The film&#x27;s soundtrack consisted of different artists providing arrangements of Beatles songs. Their version of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; scored a top 40 hit, and has since been a staple of their live shows.

In August 1978, &quot;Life Beyond L.A.&quot; was released. It marked a move away from their lush arrangements and introduced a more raw, aggressive jazz/R&amp;B influence. Christopher North, who had family obligations and was not totally happy with the group&#x27;s shift away from the sound of the first two albums, had left the group in 1977 during the album&#x27;s recording.

The year 1978 marked their biggest pop breakthrough with their first Gold single &quot;How Much I Feel&quot; from the album, which was a No. 3 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Warner Bros advertised the title cut for radio and &quot;Life Beyond L.A.&quot; started to get significant airplay on radio stations, a few months after the album&#x27;s release. Extensive touring with Fleetwood Mac, Heart, and the Doobie Brothers, in addition to major headlining shows, cemented Ambrosia&#x27;s reputation as a live act. For the 1978 touring band, North returned and the group added a second keyboardist, David C. Lewis, as well as an additional singer, Royce Jones, who joined in late 1978.

In April 1980 Warner Bros. released &quot;One Eighty&quot;, which produced two of the year&#x27;s biggest hits. The first, &quot;Biggest Part of Me&quot;, reached number three for three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and crossed over to the soul chart, where it peaked at number thirty-five. The second, another blue-eyed soul hit, &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Woman (You &amp; I)&quot;, reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;One Eighty&quot; earned the band three Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Group. A headlining world tour followed. For the Japanese leg of the tour, the group was joined by their longtime friend Cliff Woolley (formerly of The Association, who had also guested on &quot;Life Beyond L.A.&quot;) on guitar, harmonica, and backup vocals.

The title of the album &quot;One Eighty&quot; was believed by fans to signal the group&#x27;s &quot;180-degree&quot; change in direction. 

Also in 1980, the band contributed the song &quot;Outside&quot; to the film &quot;Inside Moves&quot;, and &quot;Feels So Good to Win&quot; appeared in the film &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; later that same year. The following year they placed another track, &quot;Poor Rich Boy&quot; (written by Burt Bacharach), on the soundtrack of the film, &quot;Arthur&quot;.

In 1982, David C. Lewis briefly left the touring group to be replaced by Bruce Hornsby, four years before his own rise to stardom. The same year, Ambrosia released their fifth and final studio album, &quot;Road Island&quot; (May 1982), their first effort without the assistance of Freddie Piro&#x27;s production company. Produced by James Guthrie, the album consisted of intense, driving hard rock (outside of the soft ballad &quot;Feeling Alive Again&quot; and the progressive rock closer &quot;Endings&quot;). Though it received some airplay with &quot;How Can You Love Me&quot;, the album was a commercial disappointment. The band broke up afterwards, ending their run of chart success.

==Later years==
After Ambrosia, David Pack pursued a solo career and produced or worked with many top artists. Pack&#x27;s 1985 solo album, &quot;Anywhere You Go&quot;, included the song &quot;Prove Me Wrong&quot;, which also appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;. Joe Puerta became a founding member of Bruce Hornsby and the Range.

In 1989, Ambrosia reunited with all four original members and began playing live shows again, mostly on the West Coast. They expanded their touring ranks once again with Tollak Ollestad (vocals, keyboards, harmonica) and Shem von Schroeck (vocals, percussion, bass, guitar).

In 1995, the band expanded their annual touring schedule. Pack had a conflict and guitarist John DeFaria filled in for him. Bernie Chiaravalle likewise stepped-in in the summer of 1997 and Mike Keneally did the honors in 1998 and 2000 for the concerts Pack was unable to play. Brian Stiemke subbed for an ill Burleigh Drummond for a few shows in 1997.

In May 1997, Warner Bros. released Ambrosia&#x27;s greatest hits CD &quot;Anthology&quot;, which contained tracks from all five albums plus three new tracks. In addition to &quot;Anthology&quot;, the entire Ambrosia catalog was remastered and released on CD.

The band launched a 30th anniversary tour in 2000. Early the following year, it was announced that Pack had permanently left the band and he was replaced by Doug Jackson, who had filled in for him for some shows the previous year. Pack&#x27;s final show with the band was on November 4, 2000, in Chandler, Arizona. Jackson was in place on guitar for their 2001 shows, except for one gig at Stone Mountain Park in Georgia on August 25 where Steve Farris (from Mr. Mister) subbed for him.

Ricky Cosentino filled in for Shem for some concerts in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2003. Shem then left in 2003 to join Kenny Loggins&#x27; band. Robert Berry (vocals, guitars), formerly of 3 and GTR, joined temporarily in 2004–2005, and singer/guitarist Ken Stacey became a member in 2005. Shem then returned and he and Stacey alternated with the group for a while.

Tollak Ollestad left in late 2004 to concentrate on a solo career and relocate to the Netherlands where he has had success. David C. Lewis then returned, after having substituted for Ollestad on some 1999 and 2003 gigs. Ollestad remained on call to sub for various band members and came back to play with Ambrosia&#x27;s spring 2009 tour in place of Lewis and Shem.

Later in 2009, Rick Cowling (formerly with Kenny Loggins) came in on vocals, guitar, and keyboards, though Ollestad still appeared with the band from time to time, most recently in 2010 when Doug Jackson was out playing guitar for Gary Wright, and again while Cowling moved over to lead guitar until Jackson&#x27;s return later in the year.

==Current era==

Ambrosia appeared on the May 2, 2011 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; as part of the host&#x27;s &quot;Yacht Rock 2k11&quot; theme show, performing &quot;Biggest Part of Me&quot; (during the show) and &quot;How Much I Feel&quot; (after the formal taping, but put up on the Fallon website).

In 2012, Burleigh Drummond&#x27;s wife Mary Harris, after filling in on a show or two since 2000, became a permanent band member on keyboards and vocals. Harris is also a vocal arranger and songwriter, who has co-written new material for Ambrosia performed onstage. She has previously worked in varied capacities with Pink Floyd, XTC, Stanley Clarke and for many years with Jimmy Buffett.

Ken Stacey rejoined in 2014 after Rick Cowling departed. Ambrosia&#x27;s six-person lineup was then stable for a while and the group continued to tour, sometimes combining their talents with other artists including Bill Champlin, Peter Beckett, Michael McDonald, Edgar Winter, Dave Mason, Gary Wright, Al Stewart and others.

Ambrosia&#x27;s live performances showcase both their legacy hit material and more recent songs. Ambrosia continues to feature a majority of the band&#x27;s founding members, with Puerta, Drummond and North onstage, as they have been for the past thirty plus years. Kipp Lennon (from the Venice, California band Venice) joined on lead vocals to start the 2021 tour as the band began their post lockdown era, Ken Stacey having exited during their downtime in 2020.

Former keyboardist for the band, David Cutler Lewis, died of brain cancer on June 7, 2021.

Former member Shem von Schroeck returned in the fall of 2022, this time on drums, to sub for Drummond, who was recovering from back surgery. Shem likewise returned during the whole of 2024 (and will continue on into 2025) to stand in for Christopher North, who was undergoing a successful battle with throat cancer. After Shem&#x27;s return, Kipp Lennon returned full-time to his other band Venice.

===Live and alumni albums===
On September 1, 2001, the band recorded a live album at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, California without David Pack. This album, &quot;Live&quot;, was released in May 2002. Also, in 2003 Collectables Records released another compilation album, &quot;How Much I Feel and Other Hits&quot;. 

David Pack released two 2005 solo projects: &quot;Unborn&quot;, a compilation of older unreleased material, and the more up-to-date &quot;The Secret of Movin&#x27; On&quot; featuring collaborations with Timothy B. Schmit of Eagles fame, former Journey vocalist Steve Perry, Heart vocalist Ann Wilson and America co-founder Dewey Bunnell, amongst others. Both albums follow in Pack&#x27;s later era style of smooth pop-rock.

===Member solo projects===
Several members have established careers outside of Ambrosia. 
* Joe Puerta has started a studio near his suburban Milwaukee home, The Exchange, where he&#x27;s produced several artists including Les Lokey, Big Nick &amp; the Cydecos, Alaria Taylor and The Good Luck Joes.
* Burleigh Drummond drummed for roots CCM supergroup Lost Dogs for several albums. He and Mary Harris co-founded their own group, Tin Drum, which has released three albums to date. Tin Drum also become a production company with such varied artists on their roster as bluesman Mighty Mo Rodgers and kids-oriented gospel act Kingdom Bound.
* Doug Jackson released his second solo album in 2016.
* David Pack joined childhood friend and former bandmate Fred Beato to form Beato Band.

<text>Chosen People Ministries (CPM) is an evangelical Christian nonprofit organization which engages in evangelization of Jews. It is headquartered in New York City and led by Mitch Glaser, who was raised Jewish and converted to Christianity.

Its stated mission is to &quot;pray for, evangelize, disciple, and serve Jewish people everywhere and to help fellow believers do the same&quot;. It supports the establishment of Messianic Jewish congregations, which it describes as &quot;faith communities that stress the Jewish context of the Gospel of Jesus&quot;.

== History ==
Leopold Cohn, a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant to the United States who became a Christian, founded the Brownsville Mission to the Jews in 1894. The Brownsville Mission later expanded to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York and became the Williamsburg Mission to the Jews from 1897 until 1924. In 1897, the Williamsburg Mission headquarters housed a medical clinic, boys&#x27; club, Girl Scouts, and sewing and English classes, in addition to evening Gospel services.

From 1924 until 1984 it was known as the American Board of Missions to the Jews. Since then it has been known as Chosen People Ministries.

== Methods and locations ==
Chosen People Ministries has staff in 16 countries. It also sends out missionaries and conducts evangelism in areas of high Jewish concentration, teaches in churches, and produces evangelical literature and media.

=== Centers ===

==== Brooklyn, New York - The Charles L. Feinberg Center ====

In 2010, Chosen People Ministries attracted attention when it acquired a former funeral home in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish community located in Midwood, Brooklyn. This acquisition sparked anger from the Jewish community in New York. The Center opened in 2014 and houses an English-speaking congregation, a Russian-speaking congregation, and an accredited seminary program.

The seminary program, The Charles L. Feinberg Center for Messianic Jewish Studies, is co-sponsored with Talbot School of Theology and offers an accredited Master of Divinity program in Messianic Jewish Studies. The program is designed to train Messianic congregational leaders, outreach workers and educators. In addition to the full Master of Divinity program, it offers a 6-course Certificate in Messianic Jewish studies. Classes are held in Brooklyn at the Feinberg Center, though the summer program includes classes at Talbot&#x27;s Los Angeles campus.

==== Berlin, Germany ====
In 2012, the organization a building dedicated to Jewish evangelism in Berlin, Germany. The Berlin center hosts a hospitality network, Shabbat fellowships, tandem language partnerships, and friendship ministries.

==== Ramat Gan, Israel ====
In 2017, Chosen People Ministries opened a Messianic Center in the Ramat Gan area of Greater Tel Aviv. The center hosts seminars on parenting, financial management, biblical counseling, as well as a bi-weekly women&#x27;s Bible study.

==== Toronto, Canada ====
In 2019, Chosen People Ministries opened the Toronto Messianic Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The centre houses the headquarters of Chosen People Ministries in Canada, as well as serves as the meeting place for Kehillat Eytz Chaim (Tree of Life Congregation).

== Church affiliations and memberships ==
Chosen People Ministries states that it is a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, CrossGlobal Link, the Canadian Council of Christian Charities, the Christian Stewardship Association and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

<text>The 1996 Major League Soccer College Draft was held on March 4, 1996, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

==History==
As Major League Soccer prepared for its first season, the league began stocking teams with players. As the teams were being created at the same time, the league adopted a measured approach to building rosters. First, the league allocated four &quot;big name&quot; players to each team. Then on February 6 and 7, 1996, the league held its 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Over sixteen rounds, teams selected players from any source. Then on March 4, 1996, the league held a three-round draft of collegiate players. The 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft was held later the same day.

<text>Mount Luofu () is a sacred Taoist mountain situated on the north bank of the Dongjiang in the northwest of Boluo County, Huizhou in Guangdong Province, China. It covers 250 kilometers.

Among the many temples on Mt. Luofu is Wa Sau Toi, which is linked to both the Dragon and Bak Mei styles of Kung Fu.

Mok Gar masters studied meditation and traditional Chinese medicine at the Temple of Emptiness on Mt. Luofu.

Choy Fook, one of the teachers of Choy Lee Fut founder Chan Heung, is said to have been a monk on Mt. Luofu.

== History ==
In the Eastern Jin dynasty, the renowned Taoist practitioner Ge Hong once refined elixirs here. During Ge Hong&#x27;s stay on Mt. Luofu, four huts were built, and subsequently enlarged into temples, namely the southern Temple of Great Emptiness (which was changed into the Temple of Emptiness afterwards), the western Temple of the Yellow Dragon, the eastern Temple of the Nine Heavens, and the northern Temple of Junkets.

In the Qing dynasty, a branch of the Dragon Gate Sect propagated its teachings at the Temple of Junkets. During the reign of the Guangxu Emperor, the abbot of the temple, Chen Jiaoyou, wrote &quot;Evolution of the Taoism of Master Changchun&#x27;s Lineage&quot;, an important work on the history of transmission and inheritance of the Dragon Gate Sect.

It was said that there were nine guan (Taoist temples), 18 si (Buddhist monasteries) and 22 an (nunneries) on Mt. Luofu, but after the Ming and Qing dynasties, many of them collapsed and only five guan and five si remain nowadays. The five remaining Taoist temples are the Temple of Emptiness, the Temple of Junkets, the Temple of the Nine Heavens, the Temple of the White Crane, and the Temple of the Yellow Dragon. The Temple of Emptiness is one of the national key temples acknowledged by the State Council.

There are many relics of Ge Hong on Mt. Luofu, such as the &quot;Well of Longevity&quot; from which he obtained water, the alchemical kitchen for refining elixirs, and the pond for washing elixirs. The Grotto of Vermillion Brightness on the mountain is said to be the place where Ge Hong cultivated Tao and attained immortality. It is situated in the forest in the deep valley below Mt. Luofu, where everything is in deep stillness, except for gurgling streams.

Besides, there is a &quot;Boots-Losing House&quot;, which is said to be the place where Ge Hong and his teacher Bo Jing used to discuss scriptures. One day, after talking until daybreak, two swallows flew toward them. However, they turned out to be a pair of boots instead of swallows, after being entangled. There is a stone tablet above the house. It is about five-chi long, half-chi wide and one-chi high. It lies against a huge stone like a bed and is completely in the shade.

<doc id="1037745" wikidata="Q2693491" url="?curid=1037745" title="Evan S. Connell">
<text>Evan Shelby Connell Jr. (August 17, 1924 – January 10, 2013) was a U.S. novelist, short-story writer, essayist and author of epic historical works. He also published under the name Evan S. Connell Jr. 

In 2009, Connell was nominated for the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement. On April 23, 2010, he won the Robert Kirsch Award from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for &quot;a living author with a substantial connection to the American West, whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition.&quot;

==Background==
Connell was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the only son of Evan S. Connell, Sr. (1890–1974), a physician, and Ruth Elton Connell. He had a sister Barbara (Mrs. Matthew Zimmermann), to whom he dedicated his novel &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot; (1959). Connell grew up in the upper middle-class Country Club District of Kansas City, Missouri, and graduated from Southwest High School in 1941. 

He entered Dartmouth College in the fall of 1941, but left in 1943 to become a pilot in the United States Navy. After the end of World War II, he entered the University of Kansas and graduated in 1947, with a B.A. in English. Connell studied creative writing at Columbia University in New York and Stanford University in California. 

Connell never married. He lived and worked in San Francisco and Sausalito, California, from 1954 to 1989, and then moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he remained until his death. Connell died on January 10, 2013, at an assisted-living facility in Santa Fe.

==Career==
Connell&#x27;s novels &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot; (1959) and &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot; (1969) are bittersweet, gently satirical portraits of a conventional, unimaginative upper middle-class couple living in Kansas City from the 1920s to the 1940s. The couple tries to live up to societal expectations and to be good parents, but they are sadly incapable of bridging the emotional distance between themselves and their children and between each other.

The pair of novels was adapted as a 1990 Merchant-Ivory motion picture, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot;, starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Critics gave the film mostly positive reviews.

Connell&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;The Patriot&quot; is the story of Melvin Isaacs, aged 17, and his experiences in naval aviation school during the Second World War. Melvin faces the terrifying reality of training and the likelihood of his &quot;washing out&quot; (failing). Melvin&#x27;s attempts to communicate the realities of his experience to his father are rebuffed. The characters of Melvin and his father Jacob are similar in many respects to those of Douglas and Mr. Bridge. Though not well reviewed, &quot;The Patriot&quot; contains some rewarding social satire and impressive scenes of aviation.

Connell&#x27;s 1984 sweeping account of George Armstrong Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn, &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, earned critical acclaim and was a bestseller. The book was adapted as a television miniseries in 1991 and won four Emmy Awards.

Dorothy Parker described Connell as &quot;a writer of fine style and amazing variety&quot;.

<doc id="1037754" wikidata="Q1525702" url="?curid=1037754" title="Hot Water Music">
<text>Hot Water Music is an American punk rock band formed in October 1994 and based in Gainesville, Florida. Since their formation, the group has consisted of Chuck Ragan and Chris Wollard on shared lead vocals and guitars, bass guitarist Jason Black, and drummer George Rebelo. Since 2017, the band has also included guitarist-vocalist Chris Cresswell. The band initially broke up in August 1998, but reformed by October 1998. The group split up again in 2006, but has remained active since 2008.

== Background ==

=== Early history (1994–1998) ===

Ragan, Black, and Rebelo initially met while living in Sarasota. Black and Rebelo had played together in jazz bands in school. Ragan and Rebelo met while working at eateries on the same street, with the corner becoming a frequent gathering place for Sarasota musicians. As Wollard was based in Bradenton at the time, he met the other three at a storage facility which was frequently used as a rehearsal space for both Sarasota and Bradenton bands. Frustrated by the lack of musical opportunities in their respective hometowns, Black, who had been attending the University of Florida for a year, recommended that the other three join him in Gainesville, a city known for its historic and contemporary music scene.

Upon moving to Gainesville and variously filling in as performers in each others&#x27; bands Fossil and Thread, the four joined together as Hot Water Music in October 1994. The band&#x27;s name was taken from a collection of short stories by Charles Bukowski of the same name.

The band played its first show at the Ringling School of Art in Sarasota, Florida in the fall of 1994. After rapidly releasing a series of singles splits, and EPs, the band released their first two LPs in 1997, &quot;Fuel for the Hate Game&quot; and &quot;Forever and Counting&quot;, the latter of which was released under the temporary moniker The Hot Water Music Band due legal concerns on the part of the band&#x27;s label Doghouse Records regarding an unrelated record titled &quot;Hot Water Music&quot; by Elektra Records band Hot Water that same year.

After two years of rigorous touring had exhausted the band&#x27;s members and strained their relationships, they announced that they would be breaking up following a farewell show at the Hardback Cafe in Gainesville on August 28, 1998. Their intention to disband was evidently short-lived, as, during the show, Ragan announced to the audience, &quot;I&#x27;m sure a lot of people here came a long way tonight because they heard this was our last show. I don&#x27;t know what to tell you guys...we&#x27;re trying to keep it going.&quot; The performance from this show was recorded and released as the live album &quot;Live at the Hardback&quot;.

=== First reunion (1998–2006) ===
On October 26, 1998, Hot Water Music announced their reformation, playing their comeback show on December 5, 1998, at the Hardback Cafe. In promotion of the band&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;No Division&quot; on Some Records, scheduled for release in September 1999, Hot Water Music toured the United States with Discount, Elliott and Leatherface, from May to June 1999. A tour of Europe and the United Kingdom was then booked, originally intended to be shared with fellow Gainesville hardcore band As Friends Rust, but due to disagreements over top-billing, the two bands ended up booking separate tours. The incident also caused the cancellation of a split 7-inch vinyl the two bands had planned to release through Good Life Recordings in promotion of the tour. As Friends Rust ultimately headlined its own tour with Ensign and Ignite, while Hot Water Music invited Discount back to open for them on their European dates. Hot Water Music ended the year by embarking on a month and a half American and Canadian tour opening for Sick of It All, AFI, and Indecision.

The band next signed to Epitaph Records, releasing three more albums, 2001&#x27;s &quot;A Flight and a Crash&quot;, their commercial breakthrough &quot;Caution&quot; in 2002, and their final record &quot;The New What Next&quot;, before disbanding in 2005. In promotion of &quot;The New What Next&quot;, Hot Water Music embarked on a six-week North American tour supported by Florida post-hardcore band Moments in Grace, which spanned from October 13 to November 21, 2004 The package tour also included Alexisonfire from October 13 to November 13; Don&#x27;t Look Down from October 13–23; Planes Mistaken for Stars from October 23 to November 21; and Silverstein from November 15–21. Engine Down was initially to be on the tour but was replaced by Silverstein. The trip took the bands through the United States&#x27; West Coast, South and East Coast, followed by two dates in Canada, and finished in the American Midwest. It also included a stop to play The Fest 3 festival in Gainesville, Florida on October 31, 2004.

In late 2005, Hot Water Music announced through the No Idea Records website that they would be going on a hiatus following Chuck Ragan&#x27;s departure, citing &quot;family&quot; reasons. While this was initially intended as a temporary hiatus, the band announced in 2006 that the break would be permanent. The three remaining members then started a new project, The Draft, whose first album, &quot;In a Million Pieces&quot;, was released on September 12, 2006. Chuck Ragan continued with a primarily-acoustic solo project, releasing his debut record &quot;Feast or Famine&quot; in 2007.

=== Second reunion (2008–present) ===

Less than two years after announcing their hiatus, the band announced that they would be reuniting for a handful of shows in 2008 to commemorate the release of their B-sides compilation record &quot;Till The Wheels Fall Off&quot;. The band continued to be semi-active, sporadically performing and touring over the next few years.

In 2011, the band announced that, after releasing a 7-inch single to support their European tour with Make Do and Mend, they would be releasing a new LP of original material through Rise Records. Hot Water Music released the album, &quot;Exister&quot;, in 2012.

After the release of their 2017 record &quot;Light It Up&quot;, Wollard announced that he was taking a break from the band to focus on his health. The band continued to play previously booked shows with The Flatliners&#x27; Chris Cresswell and Chris DeMakes of Less Than Jake filling in for Wollard at several dates. Cresswell also filled in for Wollard for the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour in 2019. While Wollard is not currently performing live with the band, he is still involved in their studio endeavors, playing and singing on their 2019 &quot;Shake Up The Shadows&quot; EP, with Cresswell joining the recording on backing vocals. In 2021, the band signed with Equal Vision Records for their ninth LP &quot;Feel The Void&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album featuring Cresswell as a permanent member, with Cresswell performing lead vocals on the track &quot;Turn the Dial.&quot; In May 2024, their tenth album VOWS is released once again through Equal Vision Records.

==Other projects==
Prior to founding Hot Water Music, the band&#x27;s members played in several other groups, including Yellow Section (Ragan), Burial (Rebelo), Kelly Green (Black and Rebelo), Thread (Black and Wollard), and Fossil (Ragan and Rebelo). Between 1996 and 1998 Wollard and Rebelo, along with Jack Bailey and Heather Ann Parker, formed The Blacktop Cadence and released their album &quot;Chemistry for Changing Times&quot; in 1997. From 1998 through 1999, Ragan and Wollard joined Samantha Jones for the acoustic side-project Rumbleseat, which released four 7-inch singles and contributed several songs to compilations, later releasing an eponymous compilation in 2005 after their breakup.

Following Hot Water Music&#x27;s 2005 hiatus announcement, Chuck Ragan began a solo career, releasing several records, as well as various collaborative efforts with other artists, including a collaborative live acoustic project called The Revival Tour, featuring several punk rock, bluegrass, and alt-country performers with Ragan&#x27;s goal of &quot;sharing music together&quot; and &quot;bringing it to people in an extremely honest and grassroots fashion.&quot; During this hiatus, Black, Rebelo, and Wollard formed The Draft, which released an LP and two EPs before disbanding, returning for a reunion tour in 2013. Wollard&#x27;s first solo effort, &quot;Chris Wollard and the Ship Thieves&quot; was released in 2009. Jason Black joined Senses Fail in 2008, playing on their records &quot;Life is Not A Waiting Room&quot; and &quot;The Fire&quot; before departing in 2012. Rebelo joined Against Me! in 2009, playing on their 2010 LP White Crosses, leaving the band that same year. Rebelo has been a member of The Bouncing Souls since 2013, playing on their 2016 record &quot;Simplicity&quot;. Chris Cresswell has been the lead vocalist/guitarist for Canadian punk rock group The Flatliners since its inception in 2002.

<text>Lake Artemesia is an artificial lake in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, located within the Lake Artemesia Natural Area in College Park and Berwyn Heights. The lake covers an area of , and the surrounding natural area is administered by Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and includes aquatic gardens, fishing piers, and hiker-biker trails.

The lake, located between Indian Creek and Paint Branch, was constructed during the late-1980s completion of the Washington Metro&#x27;s Green Line, which runs alongside the lake. Sand and gravel were excavated from the site of a smaller lake and the surrounding area to construct the rail beds and parking lots for the and stations. Metro saved $10 million by sourcing the material locally and in return spent $8 million constructing the lake and natural area to repair the excavation damage. During the construction phase, signs identified the site as &quot;Lake Metro.&quot;

The park is named for Artemesia N. Drefs, who donated ten lots to the county for preservation as open space in 1972. The smaller lake that existed on the site, which was created in the mid-1800s when stone was quarried from the area for use on the B&amp;O Railroad&#x27;s Washington Branch line, was already named Lake Artemesia after Artemesia&#x27;s mother and grandmother, who shared the same name. Drefs&#x27;s father, Arthur, surveyed the land for his Lakeland development in the 1890s; according to Drefs, the pre-existing lake was originally used to raise goldfish, but was later stocked with bass.

The 1.35 mile hiker-biker trail around the lake is part of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System and East Coast Greenway.

The site of Lake Artemesia Park was once home to about one third of the Lakeland community, an African-American community which became part of College Park, Maryland in 1945.

<doc id="1037763" wikidata="Q1391080" url="?curid=1037763" title="Business software">
<text>Business software (or a business application) is any software or set of computer programs used by business users to perform various business functions. These business applications are used to increase productivity, measure productivity, and perform other business functions accurately.

==Overview==
Much business software is developed to meet the needs of a specific business, and therefore is not easily transferable to a different business environment, unless its nature and operation are identical. Due to the unique requirements of each business, off-the-shelf software is unlikely to completely address a company&#x27;s needs. However, where an on-the-shelf solution is necessary, due to time or monetary considerations, some level of customization is likely to be required. Exceptions do exist, depending on the business in question, and thorough research is always required before committing to bespoke or off-the-shelf solutions.

Some business applications are interactive, i.e., they have a graphical user interface or user interface and users can query/modify/input data and view results instantaneously. They can also run reports instantaneously. Some business applications run in batch mode: they are set up to run based on a predetermined event/time and a business user does not need to initiate or monitor them.

Some business applications are built in-house and some are bought from vendors (off-the-shelf software products). These business applications are installed on either desktops or big servers. Prior to the introduction of COBOL (a universal compiler) in 1965, businesses developed their own unique machine language. RCA&#x27;s language consisted of 12-position instructions. For example, to read a record into memory, the first two digits would be the instruction (action) code. The next four positions of the instruction (an &#x27;A&#x27; address) would be the exact leftmost memory location where you want the readable character to be placed. Four positions (a &#x27;B&#x27; address) of the instruction would note the very rightmost memory location where you want the last character of the record to be located. A two-digit &#x27;B&#x27; address also allows the modification of any instruction. Instruction codes and memory designations excluded the use of 8&#x27;s or 9&#x27;s. The first RCA business application was implemented in 1962 on a 4k RCA 301. The RCA 301, mid-frame 501, and large frame 601 began their marketing in early 1960.

Many kinds of users are found within the business environment, and can be categorized by using a small, medium, and large matrix:

* The small business market generally consists of home accounting software, and office suites such as LibreOffice, Microsoft Office or Google Workspace (formerly G Suite and Google Apps for Work).
* The medium size, or small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), has a broader range of software applications, ranging from accounting, groupware, customer relationship management, human resource management systems, outsourcing relationship management, loan origination software, shopping cart software, field service software, and other productivity-enhancing applications.
* The last segment covers enterprise level software applications, such as those in the fields of enterprise resource planning, enterprise content management (ECM), business process management (BPM) and product lifecycle management. These applications are extensive in scope and often come with modules that either add native functions or incorporate the functionality of third-party computer programs.

Technologies that previously only existed in peer-to-peer software applications, like Kazaa and Napster, are starting to appear within business applications.

== Types of business tools ==
* Enterprise software application (Esa)
* Resource Management
*Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
* Digital dashboards, also known as business intelligence dashboards, enterprise dashboards, or executive dashboards. These are visually based summaries of business data that show an at-a-glance understanding of conditions through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Dashboards are very popular tools that have arisen in the last few years.
* Online analytical processing (OLAP), (which includes HOLAP, ROLAP and MOLAP) - are a capability of some management, decision support, and executive information systems that support interactive examination of large amounts of data from many perspectives.
* Reporting software generates aggregated views of data to keep the management informed about the state of their business.
* Procurement software is business software that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations.
* Data mining is the extraction of consumer information from a database by utilizing software that can isolate and identify previously unknown patterns or trends in large amounts of data. There is a variety of data mining techniques that reveal different types of patterns. Some of the techniques that belong here are statistical methods (particularly business statistics) and neural networks, as very advanced means of analyzing data.
* Business performance management (BPM)
*Business Process Management (BPM)
*Customer Relationship Management (CRM) such as Yesware.
* Document management software is made for organizing and managing multiple documents of various types. Some of them have storage functions for security and backup of valuable business information.
* Employee scheduling software- used for creating and distributing employee schedules, as well as for tracking employee hours. 

== History ==
Business software is designed to increase profits by cutting costs or speeding the productive cycle. In the early days of white-collar business automation, large mainframe computers were used to tackle the most tedious jobs, like bank cheque clearing and factory accounting.

Factory accounting software was among the most widely-used early business software tools and included the automation of general ledgers, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).

The early use of software to replace manual white-collar labor was extremely profitable and caused a radical shift in white-collar labor. One computer could in many cases replace many white-collar administrative employees, without requiring any health or retirement benefits.

Building on this success, corporate consumers demanded from IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and other early suppliers, of business software to replace the old-fashioned drafting board. Computer-aided drafting for computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) arrived in the early 1980s. Project management software was also so valued in the early 1980s that it could cost up to $500,000 per copy.

One of the most noticeable, widespread changes in business software was the word processor, whose rapid rise caused the decline of the ubiquitous IBM typewriter in the 1980s, as millions of companies switched to using Word Perfect, and later Microsoft Word. Other popular computer programs for business were mathematical spreadsheet programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, and later Microsoft Excel.

In the 1990s business shifted towards globalism, with the appearance of SAP software, which coordinates a supply-chain of vendors in order to streamline the operation of factory manufacturing. This process was triggered and vastly accelerated by the advent of the internet.

The next phase in the evolution of business software is being driven by the emergence of robotic process automation (RPA), which involves identifying and automating highly repetitive tasks and processes, with an aim to drive operational efficiency, reduce costs and limit human error. Industries at the forefront of RPA adoption include the insurance industry, banking and other related financial services, the legal industry, and the healthcare industry.

== Application support ==
Business applications are built based on the requirements of business users. Also, these business applications are built to use certain kinds of Business transactions or data items. These business applications run flawlessly until there are no new business requirements or there is no change in underlying Business transactions. Also, the business applications run flawlessly if there are no issues with computer hardware, computer networks (Internet/intranet), computer disks, power supplies, and various software components (middleware, database, computer programs, etc.).

Business applications can fail when an unexpected error occurs. This error could occur due to a data error (an unexpected data input or a wrong data input), an environment error (an in infrastructure-related error), a programming error, a human error, or a workflow error. When a business application fails one needs to fix the business application error as soon as possible so that the business users can resume their work. This work of resolving business application errors is known as business application support.

=== Reporting errors ===
The Business User calls the business application support team phone number or sends an e-mail to the business application support team. The business application support team gets all the details of the error from the business user on the phone or from the e-mail. These details are then entered in a tracking software. The tracking software creates a request number and this request number is given to the business user. This request number is used to track the progress on the support issue. The request is assigned to a support team member.

=== Notification of errors ===
For critical business application errors (such as an application not available or an application not working correctly), an e-mail is sent to the entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with an estimated time for application availability.

=== Investigation or analysis of application errors ===
The business application support team member collects all the necessary information about the business software error. This information is then recorded in the support request. All of the data used by the business user is also used in the investigation. The application program is reviewed for any possible programming errors.

=== Error resolution ===
If any similar business application errors occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and the error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new support error, then new issue resolution steps are created and the error is resolved. The new support error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for future use. For major business application errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error.

=== Code correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to programming errors, then a request is created for the application development team to correct programming errors. If the business user needs new features or functions in the business application, then the required analysis/design/programming/testing/release is planned and a new version of the business software is deployed.

=== Business process correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to a workflow issue or human errors during data input, then the business users are notified. Business users then review their workflow and revise it if necessary. They also modify the user guide or user instructions to avoid such an error in the future.

=== Infrastructure issue correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to infrastructure issues, then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fixes for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid the re-occurrence of the same error.

== Support follow-up and internal reporting ==
The business application error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly, and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor the resolved issues, repeating issues, and pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for the improvement and management of business applications.

<doc id="1037765" wikidata="Q2645849" url="?curid=1037765" title="No Division">
<text>No Division is the third full-length album by American post-hardcore band Hot Water Music. It was released by Some Records on August 10, 1999.

==Recording==
Hot Water Music&#x27;s Jason Black stated of the recording: &quot;[on the last album] we just didn&#x27;t know what the hell we were doing. So this time around it was nice, we went to a studio and spent maybe two, two and a half weeks and really recorded an album, front to back. The album was produced by Walter Schreifels of Gorilla Biscuits fame. The band recorded the album after a hiatus, vocalist Chuck Ragan stated &quot;I know we were all a hell of a lot more focused going into [it], You can really tell just by listening to it.”

The album was originally scheduled for release on June 1, 1999, but was pushed back to August 10, 1999.

== Composition == 
Regarding its musical style, &quot;No Division&quot; has been labeled as a punk rock album, and under punk subgenres such as emocore, post-hardcore, and hardcore punk. The album includes elements of hard rock, pop-punk, and Southern gospel in the overall sound.

==Reception==
&quot;Allmusic&quot; stated the album &quot;isn&#x27;t as strong as the records that preceded it, but, at the end of the day, anything this band has to offer is still a lot more honest and explosive than what most of their peers have.&quot; &quot;Punknews.org&quot; called the album &quot;awesome&quot; stating the band has &quot; their formula of &#x27;emotionally-charged hardcore&#x27; down to a tee&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; praised two songs as &quot;jaw-dropping technical&quot; and praised the sincerity of the album&#x27;s lyrics. &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album &quot;a magnificent testament to what a punk rock band could do if they kept both ears on expanding their sound, but both feet planted in their roots... For one album, Hot Water Music managed to pull off the rare feat of maintaining the energy and politics of punk while embracing a thoroughly rock and roll sound.&quot; &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; described the album as a &quot;grandiose, varied and absolutely standalone work&quot;.

==Legacy==
The song &quot;Rooftops&quot; was covered by Alkaline Trio on the Alkaline Trio / Hot Water Music split EP in 2002. In 2019, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; included the album on the list of 12 essential punk and emo albums of 1999, describing it as &quot;a gut-wrenching roller coaster of love, hate and grief, all captured in an aggressive 30 minutes.&quot; DecoyMusic.com described &quot;No Division&quot; as &quot;one of blueprints for modern punk rock&quot; and the band&#x27;s best work.

In 2019, the band played the album in full on tour, based on a Twitter poll conducted amongst fans. Also in 2019, brewing company Arizona Wilderness created an IPA named after the album in collaboration with the band.

<text>Matilde Urrutia Cerda (30 April 1912 – 5 January 1985) was the third wife of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, from 1966 until he died in 1973. They met in Santiago, Chile in 1946, when she was working as a physical therapist in Chile. She was the first woman in Latin America to work as a pediatric therapist. Urrutia was the inspiration behind Neruda&#x27;s later love poems beginning with &quot;Los Versos del Capitan&quot; in 1951, which the poet withheld publication until 1961 to spare the feelings of his previous wife; as well as &quot;100 Love Sonnets&quot; which includes a beautiful dedication to her.

Neruda built a house in Santiago called &quot;La Chascona&quot;, for Urrutia, which served as a secret love den for the two, as news that Neruda was having an affair would not have been received well by the Chilean public. In his house, there is a portrait of Urrutia painted by Diego Rivera, given to her by Neruda depicting a two-faced Urrutia with her famously long, bright red hair. What is remarkable about this painting is that one face depicts Urrutia as the singer the public knew, and the other depicts the lover Neruda knew. The painting also has a hidden image; the profile view of Neruda&#x27;s face is hidden in her hair, showing their continuous secret relationship.

After Neruda&#x27;s death, Urrutia edited for publication his memoir, &quot;Confieso que he vivido&quot; (&quot;I confess that I have lived&quot;). This and other activities brought her into conflict with the government of Augusto Pinochet, which tried to suppress the memory of Neruda, an outspoken communist, from the collective consciousness.

Her own memoir, &quot;My Life with Pablo Neruda&quot;, , was published posthumously in 1986.</text><links>

<doc id="1037773" wikidata="Q523963" url="?curid=1037773" title="Fuel for the Hate Game">
<text>Fuel for the Hate Game is the first full-length album by Hot Water Music. &quot;Fuel...&quot; was released by Toybox Records and No Idea Records in 1997, later repressings only listed No Idea. The album features artwork by Scott Sinclair (not to be confused with Scott Sinclair) and was designed by Sean Bonner.

The track &quot;Freightliner&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the skateboarding video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; included the song on a list of &quot;20 Best Drinking Songs&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Allmusic&quot; reviewed the album as &quot;raw and unrelenting, but it is also a refreshing release of energy, and an infectious one at that. This is the record that saw the band rise to the top of the hardcore/punk scene, and, years after its release, it is still as deserving of credit as it ever was.&quot;
&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated the album (and their next album released later that year) &quot;stand as two of ’90s’ punk’s proudest monuments—records that cut through all the squabbling, all the second-guessing, and all the politics of the punk scene and straight into its aching heart.

<text>Toulouse Street is the second studio album by American rock band the Doobie Brothers. It was released in July 1972, by Warner Bros. Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album with bassist Tiran Porter and also the first with drummer Michael Hossack to augment existing drummer John Hartman, putting in place their trademark twin-drummer sound. Toulouse Street is the name of a street in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The cover and inside centerfold photos were taken at a former brothel on Toulouse Street.

The album peaked at number 21 on the Billboard 200.

<doc id="1037778" wikidata="Q634171" url="?curid=1037778" title="Typhoon Tip">
<text>Typhoon Tip, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Warling, was an exceptionally large, extremely powerful, and long-lived tropical cyclone that traversed the Western Pacific for 20 days, shattering multiple records worldwide. The forty-third tropical depression, nineteenth tropical storm, twelfth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, Tip developed out of a disturbance within the monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei in Micronesia. Initially, Tropical Storm Roger to the northwest hindered the development and motion of Tip, though after the storm tracked farther north, Tip was able to intensify. After passing Guam, Tip rapidly intensified and reached peak sustained winds of and a worldwide record-low sea-level pressure of on October 12. At its peak intensity, Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a wind diameter of . Tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast, in response to an approaching trough. The typhoon made landfall in southern Japan on October 19, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. Tip&#x27;s extratropical remnants continued moving east-northeastward, until they dissipated near the Aleutian Islands on October 24.
U.S. Air Force aircraft flew 60 weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon, making Tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones. Rainfall from Tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13 United States Marines and injured 68 at Combined Arms Training Center, Camp Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42 deaths; offshore shipwrecks left 44 people killed or missing.

== Meteorological history ==

At the end of September 1979, three circulations developed within the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands. The westernmost disturbance developed into a tropical depression on October 1, to the west of Luzon, which would later become Typhoon Sarah on October 7. On October 3, the disturbance southwest of Guam developed into Tropical Storm Roger, and later on the same day, a third tropical disturbance that would later become Typhoon Tip formed south of Pohnpei. Strong flow from across the equator was drawn into Roger&#x27;s wind circulation, initially preventing significant development of the precursor disturbance to Tip. Despite the unfavorable air pattern, the tropical disturbance gradually organized as it moved westward. Due to the large-scale circulation pattern of Tropical Storm Roger, Tip&#x27;s precursor moved erratically and slowly executed a cyclonic loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a closed low-level circulation, and early on October 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression Twenty-Three-W.
While executing another loop near Chuuk, the tropical depression intensified into Tropical Storm Tip, though the storm failed to organize significantly due to the influence of Tropical Storm Roger. Reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation, since satellite imagery estimated the center was about from its true position. After drifting erratically for several days, Tip began a steady northwest motion on October 8. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone, resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into Tip. An area of a tropical upper tropospheric trough moved north of Guam at the time, providing an excellent outflow channel north of Tip. Initially, Tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make landfall on Guam, though instead, it turned to the west early on October 9, passing about south of Guam. Later that day, Tip intensified to attain typhoon status.

Owing to very favorable conditions for development, Typhoon Tip rapidly intensified over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. Late on October 10, Tip attained wind speeds equal to Category 4 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS), and it became a super typhoon on the next day. The central pressure dropped by from October 9 to 11, during which the circulation pattern of Typhoon Tip expanded to a record diameter of . Tip continued to intensify further, becoming a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, and early on October 12, reconnaissance aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of with 1-minute sustained winds of , when Tip was located about west-northwest of Guam. In its best track, the Japan Meteorological Agency listed Tip as peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of . At the time of its peak strength, its eye was wide. Tip crossed the 135th meridian east on the afternoon of October 13, prompting the PAGASA to issue warnings on Typhoon Tip, assigning it the local name &quot;Warling&quot;.

After peaking in intensity, Tip weakened to and remained at that intensity for several days, as it continued west-northwestward. For five days after its peak strength, the average radius of winds stronger than extended over . On October 17, Tip began to weaken steadily and decrease in size, recurving northeastward under the influence of a mid-level trough the next day. After passing about east of Okinawa, the typhoon accelerated to . Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honshū with winds of about on October 19. It continued rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honshū a few hours after moving ashore. The extratropical remnant of Tip proceeded east-northeastward and gradually weakened, crossing the International Date Line on October 22. The storm was last observed near the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 24.

== Impact ==

The typhoon produced heavy rainfall early in its lifetime while passing near Guam, including a total of at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts of were measured during October 9 at the Naval Base Guam, as the center of the storm was positioned south of Agana. Tip caused a total loss of nearly US$1.6 million (1979 USD, US$6.93 million in 2024) across Guam. The outer rainbands of the large circulation of Tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the Philippine islands of Luzon and Visayas.

Heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated at the base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility&#x27;s barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.

During recurvature, Typhoon Tip passed about east of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached , with gusts to . Sustained wind velocities in Japan are not known, though they were estimated at minimal typhoon strength. The passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in millions of dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44 fishermen dead or unaccounted for. A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon, though its crew of 46 were rescued. The rainfall led to over 600 mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of Japan and flooded more than 22,000 homes; 42 people died throughout the country, with another 71 missing and 283 injured. River embankments broke in 70 places, destroying 27 bridges, while about 105 dikes were destroyed. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left homeless. Tip destroyed apple, rice, peach and other crops. Five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital, Tokyo. Transportation in the country was disrupted; 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled. In total, damages associated with Tip in Japan were estimated as billion (US$482.34 million in 1979 USD, US$2.09 billion in 2024). Tip was described as the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.

== Records and meteorological statistics ==

Typhoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of —almost double the previous record of in diameter set by Typhoon Marge in August 1951. At its largest, Tip was nearly half the size of the contiguous United States. The temperature inside the eye of Typhoon Tip at peak intensity was and described as exceptionally high. With 10-minute sustained winds of , Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the complete tropical cyclone listing by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone on record, with a pressure of , lower than the previous record set by Super Typhoon June in 1975. The records set by Tip still technically stand, though with the end of routine reconnaissance aircraft flights in the western Pacific Ocean in August 1987, modern researchers have questioned whether Tip indeed remains the strongest. After a detailed study, three researchers determined that two typhoons, Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992, registered higher Dvorak numbers than Tip, and concluded that one or both of the two may have therefore been more intense. Other recent storms may have also been more intense than Tip at its peak; for instance, satellite-derived intensity estimates for Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 indicated that its core pressure may have been as low as . Due to the dearth of direct observations and Hurricane hunters into these cyclones, conclusive data is lacking. In October 2015, Hurricane Patricia reached an estimated peak intensity of , with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of , making Patricia the second-most intense tropical cyclone recorded worldwide. However, the NHC noted in their report on the cyclone that Patricia may have surpassed Tip at the time of its peak intensity, as it was undergoing rapid intensification; however, due to the lack of direct aircraft observations at the time of the storm&#x27;s peak, this possibility cannot be determined.

Despite the typhoon&#x27;s intensity and damage, the name &quot;Tip&quot; was not retired and was reused in 1983, 1986, and 1989. The name was discontinued from further use in 1989, when the JTWC changed their naming list.

<text>Forever and Counting is the second full-length album by Hot Water Music. It was released by Doghouse Records in 1997, reissued in 2008 by No Idea Records, and later purchased and re-released in 2012 by Rise Records.

For &#x27;Forever And Counting&#x27;, the band had to have a short lived name change to &#x27;The Hot Water Music Band&#x27;. This was due to a rival label, Elektra Records claiming they owned the rights to the name Hot Water Music, due to another band with the same name on the label. The Elektra band broke up after the release of the album and Hot Water Music continued to produce records under their original name.

In a 2015 interview, bassist Jason Black criticized the sound of the album, stating &quot;I think there’s some cool songs on it, that’s definitely one record we’ve thought about re-recording a lot but we haven’t because people like it so much. It just sounds terrible.&quot; La Dispute frontman Jordan Dryer cited the album as highly influential on his career. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated the album (and their previous album released earlier that year) &quot;stand as two of ’90s’ punk’s proudest monuments—records that cut through all the squabbling, all the second-guessing, and all the politics of the punk scene and straight into its aching heart.

<doc id="1037781" wikidata="Q1750507" url="?curid=1037781" title="Beta function (physics)">
<text>In theoretical physics, specifically quantum field theory, a beta function, &quot;β(g)&quot;, encodes the dependence of a coupling parameter, &quot;g&quot;, on the energy scale, &quot;μ&quot;, of a given physical process described by quantum field theory.
It is defined as
:: formula_1
and, because of the underlying renormalization group, it has no explicit dependence on &quot;μ&quot;, so it only depends on &quot;μ&quot; implicitly through &quot;g&quot;.
This dependence on the energy scale thus specified is known as the running of the coupling parameter, a fundamental 
feature of scale-dependence in quantum field theory, and its explicit computation is achievable through a variety of mathematical techniques. The concept of Beta function was Introduced by Ernst Stueckelberg and André Petermann in 1953.

==Scale invariance==
If the beta functions of a quantum field theory vanish, usually at particular values of the coupling parameters, then the theory is said to be scale-invariant. Almost all scale-invariant QFTs are also conformally invariant. The study of such theories is conformal field theory.

The coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can run even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant. In this case, the non-zero beta function tells us that the classical scale invariance is anomalous.

==Examples==
Beta functions are usually computed in some kind of approximation scheme. An example is perturbation theory, where one assumes that the coupling parameters are small. One can then make an expansion in powers of the coupling parameters and truncate the higher-order terms (also known as higher loop contributions, due to the number of loops in the corresponding Feynman graphs).

Here are some examples of beta functions computed in perturbation theory:

===Quantum electrodynamics===

The one-loop beta function in quantum electrodynamics (QED) is

*formula_2
or, equivalently,
*formula_3

written in terms of the fine structure constant in natural units, .

This beta function tells us that the coupling increases with increasing energy scale, and QED becomes strongly coupled at high energy. In fact, the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy, resulting in a Landau pole. However, one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong coupling, and so it is likely that the Landau pole is an artifact of applying perturbation theory in a situation where it is no longer valid.

===Quantum chromodynamics===

The one-loop beta function in quantum chromodynamics with formula_4 flavours and formula_5 scalar colored bosons is
:formula_6

or
:formula_7

written in terms of &quot;αs&quot; = formula_8 .

Assuming &quot;n&quot;&quot;s&quot;=0, if &quot;n&quot;&quot;f&quot; ≤ 16, the ensuing beta function dictates that the coupling decreases with increasing energy scale, a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. Conversely, the coupling increases with decreasing energy scale. This means that the coupling becomes large at low energies, and one can no longer rely on perturbation theory.

===SU(N) Non-Abelian gauge theory===
While the (Yang–Mills) gauge group of QCD is formula_9, and determines 3 colors, we can generalize to any number of colors, formula_10, with a gauge group formula_11. Then for this gauge group, with Dirac fermions in a representation formula_12 of formula_13 and with complex scalars in a representation formula_14, the one-loop beta function is
:formula_15

where formula_16 is the quadratic Casimir of formula_13 and formula_18 is another Casimir invariant defined by formula_19 for generators formula_20 of the Lie algebra in the representation R. (For Weyl or Majorana fermions, replace formula_21 by formula_22, and for real scalars, replace formula_23 by formula_24.) For gauge fields (&quot;i.e.&quot; gluons), necessarily in the adjoint of formula_13, formula_26; for fermions in the fundamental (or anti-fundamental) representation of formula_13, formula_28. Then for QCD, with formula_29, the above equation reduces to that listed for the quantum chromodynamics beta function.

This famous result was derived nearly simultaneously in 1973 by Politzer, Gross and Wilczek, for which the three were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004.
Unbeknownst to these authors, G. &#x27;t Hooft had announced the result in a comment following a talk by K. Symanzik at a small meeting in Marseilles in June 1972, but he never published it.

===Standard Model Higgs–Yukawa Couplings===
In the Standard Model, quarks and leptons have &quot;Yukawa couplings&quot; to the Higgs boson. These determine the mass of the particle. Most all of the quarks&#x27; and leptons&#x27; Yukawa couplings are small compared to the top quark&#x27;s Yukawa coupling. These Yukawa couplings change their values depending on the energy scale at which they are measured, through &quot;running&quot;. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings of quarks are determined by the renormalization group equation:

formula_30,

where formula_31 is the color gauge coupling (which is a function of formula_32 and associated with asymptotic freedom) and formula_33 is the Yukawa coupling. This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale formula_32.

The Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks, are small at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, formula_35 GeV. Therefore, the formula_36 term can be neglected in the above equation. Solving, we then find that formula_33 is increased slightly at the low energy scales at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs, formula_38 GeV.

On the other hand, solutions to this equation for large initial values formula_33 cause the &quot;rhs&quot; to quickly approach smaller values as we descend in energy scale. The above equation then locks formula_33 to the QCD coupling formula_31. This is known as the (infrared) quasi-fixed point of the renormalization group equation for the Yukawa coupling. No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large it will reach this quasi-fixed point value, and the corresponding quark mass is predicted.

===Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model===

Renomalization group studies in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) of grand unification and the Higgs–Yukawa fixed points were very encouraging that the theory was on the right track. So far, however, no evidence of the predicted MSSM particles has emerged in experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

<doc id="1037791" wikidata="Q503506" url="?curid=1037791" title="Cunard Building">
<text>The Cunard Building is a Grade II* listed building in Liverpool, England. It is located at the Pier Head and along with the neighbouring Royal Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building is one of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces&quot;, which line the city&#x27;s waterfront. It is also part of Liverpool&#x27;s former UNESCO designated World Heritage, the Maritime Mercantile City.

It was designed by William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was constructed between 1914 and 1917. The building&#x27;s style is a mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, and its development has been particularly influenced by Italian palace design. The building is noted for the ornate sculptures that adorn its sides.

The building was, from its construction until the 1960s, the headquarters of the Cunard Line, and the building still retains the name of its original owner. It was also home to Cunard&#x27;s passenger facilities for trans-Atlantic journeys departing from Liverpool. Today, the building is owned by Liverpool City Council and is home to numerous public and private sector organisations, including The British Music Experience. It is located diagonally across the Strand from Albion House, the former headquarters of White Star Line.

==History==
In 1914 the Cunard Steamship Company commissioned the construction of new headquarters for their company. Cunard&#x27;s expansion meant that they had outgrown their previous offices, which were also in Liverpool, and the site chosen for construction was at the former George&#x27;s Dock, in between the Royal Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building. The building was designed by the architects William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was inspired by the grand palaces of Renaissance Italy – particularly the Farnese Palace at Rome. It was constructed by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts between 1914 and 1917, with Arthur J. Davis, of Mewes and Davis, acting as consultant on the project.

In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company merged with the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, becoming the largest passenger steamship company in the world and helping to make Liverpool one of the most important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many famous ships were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and the Queen Elizabeth 2.

Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port, and due to the building&#x27;s proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for liner passengers, both before and after sailing. Within the building were passenger facilities, including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea-based Cunard employees.

During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.

The building remained the headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s, when they decided to relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England&#x27;s south coast and their global headquarters to New York. Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969. In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II* listed building status by the English Heritage. Initially, it was listed together with the Royal Liver Building and the Port of Liverpool Building under Pier Head, but in 1985 each building gained its own listing. In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund, an organisation providing pension services to public sector workers on Merseyside. Today, the building provides a range of office accommodation for a variety of public and private sector organisations. In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams to draw up a conservation plan to preserve the building. The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building.

In October 2013, Liverpool City Council approved the acquisition of the Cunard Building for use as offices and as a cruise liner terminal. The Council projected that the building would accommodate 1,000 staff relocated from Millennium House and leases in the Capital Building, saving an estimated £1.3 million. The anticipated use as cruise terminal however had to be abandoned due to the high costs associated with security and border control.

==Architectural design==

The Cunard Building&#x27;s architectural style can be generally described as a mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, with a degree of Beaux-Arts influence on the building&#x27;s structural form. Willink and Caldwell&#x27;s designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the building itself and, as the building itself is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.

The Cunard Building is approximately rectangular in shape, with nine bays on the east and west sides, and seventeen bays on the north and south sides. However, as it was constructed after the Royal Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building on either side of it, space limitations meant that the east (landward) side was actually built wider than the west. The central bays on each side provide the main entrance points into the building. Each entrance consists or a large panelled oak door, adorned by a pair of fluted columns and with a coffered ceiling. The Cunard Building stands six storeys tall and has two basement levels. Due to its construction on the site of the former George&#x27;s Dock, part of the original dock wall is still visible in the eastern boundary of the first basement level.
The frame of the building was constructed from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland stone. Several highly detailed sculptures adorn the outside of the building, including ones of Britannia and Neptune, as well as others representing peace, war, and storms. There are also sculptures of the Zodiac and the coat of arms of the United Kingdom&#x27;s allies during World War I. Another series of sculptures on the building depict different races from around the world, which reflect the global operations of the Cunard company. Marble was used to furnish several parts of the inside of the building, particularly on the ground floor corridors that link the north and south entrances. It was imported from several locations in Italy and Greece, including Attica, Carrara, and Arni Alto.

As the initial usage of the Cunard Building was mixed, there are a variety of features within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard&#x27;s administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality and ornate fittings present in what was once the first class passenger lounge, located on the first floor. These fittings are also present in the former board room, located in a &#x27;commanding&#x27; position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.

Among the most notable features of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the company&#x27;s property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing a link to the boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, originally used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard&#x27;s ships, such as the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.

==Cunard War Memorial==

The Cunard War Memorial is located on the west side of the Cunard Building and was erected in memory of the Cunard employees who were killed during the First World War, and later the Second World War. A Grade II listed monument, it was designed by Arthur Davis, who acted as consultant during the construction of the Cunard Building itself. It was erected around 1920, although it wasn&#x27;t officially unveiled until 1921, by the Earl of Derby, Edward Stanley. Prior to being located at the Pier Head, the monument had been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

The monument consists of a large bronze statue that sits upon a Doric style column, which is itself raised above the ground by a pedestal base. The statue was sculpted by Henry Alfred Pegram, whilst John Stubbs &amp; Sons provided the stonework. Due to the architects wishes that the monument be in keeping with the design of the Cunard Building, Davis designed the memorial to match the Greek features of building. The figure on top is of man, who is said to represent Victory, standing above the prow of a Roman ship. Around him there are other naval references including ropes, anchors, and shells. After the Second World War, the monument become dedicated to all Cunard employees who died in both wars. An inscription on the side of the memorial reads &quot;Pro Patria&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;For One&#x27;s Country&quot;.

<doc id="1037795" wikidata="Q7734111" url="?curid=1037795" title="The First Day on the Somme">
<text>The First Day on the Somme () is a First World War military history book by Martin Middlebrook, first published in 1971 and still in print, which is regarded as a seminal work in the field of World War I scholarship reflecting the United Kingdom&#x27;s perspective in the conflict. Its text covers in detail the events leading up to and during 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, concentrating almost exclusively on the British Army&#x27;s experiences and focussing only in relief on French Army&#x27;s contribution, especially south of the Somme River.

Early chapters deal with the formation of Kitchener&#x27;s Army (New Army), which comprised a substantial part of the British Army&#x27;s order of battle for the day, and the origins and planning of the Somme offensive. The coverage of the fighting is divided by time of day, starting with the hours leading up to &quot;zero&quot;, followed by &quot;zero hour&quot;, the morning, afternoon and night, with review chapters between each to sum up the fighting. The book concludes with the aftermath of the first day and a calculation of the cost of the fighting. The British casualty figures compiled by Middlebrook are often quoted as the definitive tally for 1 July.

Throughout the book Middlebrook uses quotations from soldiers involved in the fighting on the day, following ten men&#x27;s stories. These men presenting a cross-section of the British Army of 1916 — Regular Army, New Army and Territorial Force — with ranks from privates up to battalion commander (lieutenant colonel).

== Reviews ==
When the book came back into print in 2003, literary editor Benjamin Schwarz wrote in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; that &quot;The First Day on the Somme&quot; &quot;remains one of the most innovative and harrowing works of military history ever written...It&#x27;s still the definitive account of that day of slaughter, and the most unsentimental yet heartbreaking appreciation of the British infantrymen – stolid, sardonic, comradely – who fought and died in the Great War.&quot;

<doc id="1037796" wikidata="Q3284314" url="?curid=1037796" title="The Captain and Me">
<text>The Captain and Me is the third studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released on March 2, 1973, by Warner Bros. Records. It features some of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;China Grove&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;. The album has been certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was voted number 835 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Recording and content==
There was pressure on the band to move quickly and to save time they began reworking old tunes. One of Tom Johnston&#x27;s songs, &quot;Osborn&quot;, had been an improvisational piece that the band played live. After laying down the track, according to producer Ted Templeman, &quot;We still really didn&#x27;t have it, and I said, &#x27;Make it about a train, since you have this thing about &#x27;Miss Lucy down along the track.&#x27; So he came up with &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;.&quot;

Synthesizers and strings were brought in to record &quot;The Captain and Me&quot;. Synth programmers Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff were brought in to engineer the opening track, &quot;Natural Thing&quot;. Striving for a synthesized sound like that of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, they would overdub individual notes to create chords for the song&#x27;s bridge.

&quot;Dark Eyed Cajun Woman&quot; was a bluesy track (one of the band&#x27;s earliest) and seen by Johnston as a tribute to the blues and B.B. King. &quot;South City Midnight Lady&quot;, while being about South San Francisco, is not about any woman in particular. Jeff Baxter of Steely Dan played pedal steel guitar on the track. He would become an official Doobie Brother in 1974. Cecil and Margouleff also added the synthesized effect of a woman whispering at the end.

&quot;Clear as the Driven Snow&quot;, according to Johnston, is a warning about recreational chemical abuse, which reflected the band members&#x27; lifestyles at that time.

The second side of the album opens with the rocker &quot;Without You&quot;. This song, like many others, had begun as a jam. &quot;That song had both drummers playing at the same time,&quot; Johnston stated. &quot;It was kind of a tribute to The Who. We did it in concert for quite a while.&quot;

Patrick Simmons&#x27; short solo guitar piece &quot;Busted Down Around O&#x27;Connelly Corners&quot; is followed by &quot;Ukiah&quot;, which Johnston wrote in tribute to the area. Johnston said, &quot;We played a few shows in Ukiah, and I used to camp out a lot in the area when I was going to college.&quot; The song&#x27;s back-to-the-land sentiments also reflected some of his feelings at the time, although he admitted he probably couldn&#x27;t make it as a farmer. This track segues into the album closer and title track, &quot;The Captain and Me&quot;. According to Johnston, the captain is no one in particular and the lyrics were written at the last minute and have no real meaning. The song was released as a single in the Netherlands and received some airplay there. Ron Blomberg recalled he and Yankee captain Thurman Munson liking the song for its positive message &quot;about people coming together to change things for the better,&quot; describing the song as having &quot;pretty cosmic&quot; words, and named his book about Munson after this song.

==Surround releases==
The album was originally released in Quadraphonic sound on the CD-4 Quadradisc system and also on Quadraphonic 8-track tape. The album was also released in 2002 remixed into 5.1 multichannel DVD-Audio, and on 14 September 2011, on hybrid stereo-multichannel Super Audio CD by Warner Japan in their Warner Premium Sound series.

==Artwork==
The artwork found on the front and back of the album features the band, including manager Bruce Cohn, dressed in 19th century western garments and riding a horse-drawn stagecoach beneath an incomplete freeway overpass. &quot;All that stuff came from the Warner Bros. film studios lot,&quot; Tom Johnston said. &quot;It must&#x27;ve been a lot of work for the guys who brought up the horse team and the carriage and the clothes. It was fun to do—they had coffins out there, all kinds of crazy stuff.&quot; The photography was done by Michael and Jill Maggid. The setting for the cover was located at the Newhall Pass interchange of the Interstate 5 and California State Route 14 freeways near Sylmar, California, the incomplete bridge featured being one that partially collapsed during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. This same section of freeway would collapse again during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

<doc id="1037808" wikidata="Q2004082" url="?curid=1037808" title="Guaíra, Paraná">
<text>Guaíra () is a municipality in the state of Paraná in the Southern Region of Brazil. The population is 33,310 (2020 est.) in an area of 560 km2. The elevation is 517 m. This place name comes from the Tupi language and means &quot;place difficult to access&quot;. It borders the Paraguayan city of Salto del Guairá, across the Paraná River, which marks the border between Brazil and Paraguay. Just like its Paraguayan twin city, it is named after the Guaíra Falls, which was located on the border with Paraguay. The falls was submerged after the construction of the Itaipu Dam in 1982.

== History ==

The foundation of Guaíra is closely linked to Companhia Matte Larangeira, also responsible for the founding of the city of Porto Murtinho. In historical times, it belonged to the indigenous people; in 1556 it was occupied by the Spanish. At that time, the Jesuit Missions took place, which aimed to catechize the Indians, based on the precepts of the Catholic Church. The Missions took place in the territories now geographically demarcated in the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná and Paraguay. In 1620, the territory of Guaíra was virtually in the hands of the Portuguese, as the São Paulo bandeirantes periodically ravaged the region, destroying the Spanish people and enslaving the catechized Indians of the Jesuit reductions.

It was only in 1872, with the Limits Treaty, that the territorial limits between Brazil and Paraguay were demarcated, leaving Guaíra in Brazilian territory. The search for wealth, or for slave labor, led the Bandeirantes Paulistas to enter this territory, decimating the Spanish groups and enslaving the Indians. These lands remained without economic and population development for a period.

After complaints from the Superintendent, Antonio Corrêa da Costa and losses caused by the transport of Matte Larangeira&#x27;s production, Banco Rio Branco declared bankruptcy in 1902 and Thomaz Larangeira acquired his estate, while Cia Matte Larangeira was sold to the Argentine company Francisco Mendes &amp; Cia , changing its name to Larangeira Mendes e Companhia. A new lease contract was signed with the state government, along the same lines as the previous one, which would remain in force until 1916.
In 1910, the main focus of exploration of erva mate was transferred to the Paraná River, reducing its strategic importance for the company, with its monopoly being broken in 1916.

The Company&#x27;s headquarters were transferred in 1918 from Porto Murtinho to Campanário Farm, near the municipality of Caarapó. The herb began to be exported via the Paraná River, with only the production from nearby ranches being exported via Porto Murtinho. Since 1902, the Company had been established in Guaíra, initially called Porto Monjoli, beginning the construction of a railroad from the Guaíra to Porto Mendes Railway in 1911, which would cross the Sete Quedas rapids.

In territorial divisions dated July 31, 1936 and July 31, 1937, the district of Guaíra appears in the municipality of Foz de Iguassú. By state decree-law No. 7573, of October 20, 1938, the district of Guaíra was extinct, with its territory being annexed to the district headquarters of the municipality of Foz do Iguassú.

The dominance of Companhia Matte Larangeira continued until 1943, when Getúlio Vargas assumed power, creating the Federal Territory of Ponta Porã and the Federal Territory of Iguaçu, and annulling the concession. On April 17, 1944, Decree No. 6,428 was signed, by Getúlio Vargas incorporating the Plata Basin Navigation Service (SNBP), the District of Guaíra, the Guaíra to Porto Mendes Railway, as well as material and fixed installations, port facilities and all floating installations and material.

Guaíra was elevated to the category of municipality with this name by state law no. 790, of November 14, 1951, separated from Foz do Iguassú, being installed on December 14, 1952.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Walter Martins de Oliveira Airport.

==Consular representation==
Paraguay has a Consulate in Guaíra.

<text>Gard Agdi (&quot;Old Norse&quot; Garðr agði) appears in the legendary genealogies of &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; as one of the three sons of Nór, the legendary first king of Norway, and as ruler and ancestor of rulers over southwestern Norway. The nickname Agdi may refer to a member of the &quot;Egðir&quot;, a tribe inhabiting the southernmost region of Norway known as Agder, represented today by the counties of Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder.

==Descendants of Gard==

===Sons of Gard===
Gard was father of seven sons: Hörd (&quot;Hǫrðr&quot;), Rúgálf (&quot;Rúgálfr&quot;), Thrym (&quot;Þrymr&quot;), Végard (&quot;Végarðr&quot;), Freygard (&quot;Freygarðr&quot;), Thorgard (&quot;Þorgarðr&quot;), and Grjótgard (&quot;Grójtgarðr&quot;),

====Descendants of Hörd and Rúgálf====
According to the &quot;Hversu&quot;, Hörd son of Gard, the eponym of Hördaland (the former county of Hordaland) was father of Jöfur (&quot;Jǫfurr&quot;) or Jösur (&quot;Jǫsurr&quot;).

The &quot;Hversu&quot; goes on to say that Rúgálf son of Gard, the eponym of Rogaland, was father of Rögnvald (&quot;Rögnvaldr&quot;), the father of Ögvald (&quot;Ǫgvaldr&quot;) but gives no further descendants.

But &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot; (&#x27;The saga of Half and his heroes&#x27;), brings in King Ögvald of Rogaland at its beginning (though making no mention of Ögvald&#x27;s ancestry) and in this work it is Ögvald who is the father of Jösur.

The &quot;Hversu&quot; and the &quot;Hálf&#x27;s saga&quot; do agree in their accounts of the descendants of Jösur. Jösur was father of King Hjör (&quot;Hjǫrr&quot;) who in the saga was king of both Hördaland and Rogaland. Hjör was father of Hjörleif the Ladies&#x27; Man (&quot;Hjǫrleifr inn kvensamr&quot;) who had three wives.

By Æsa the Fair, daughter of Jarl Eystein of Valdres, Hjörleif was father of Ótrygg (&quot;Ótryggr&quot;), the father of Óblaud (&quot;Óblauðr&quot;), the father of Högni the White (&quot;Hǫgni inn hvítr&quot;), the father of Úlf the Squinter (&quot;Úlfr inn skjálgr&quot;).

Hjörleif then also married Hild the Slender (&quot;Hildr in mjóva&quot;) daughter of Högni of Njardey (&quot;Njarðey&quot; &#x27;Njörd&#x27;s-Isle&#x27;, modern Nærøya). By Hild the Slender Hjörleif was father of Hjörólf (&quot;Hjǫrólfr&quot;) and Hálf (&quot;Hálf&quot;), this last being the hero of the saga. According to the saga and the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (2.19 and following), Hálf was father of Hjör who married Hagný daughter of Haki, son of Hámund (&quot;Hámundr&quot;). Their children were the twins Hámund Hellskin (&quot;Hámundr heljarskinn&quot;) and Geirmund Hellskin (&quot;Geirmundr heljarskinn&quot;). Geirmund Hellskin settled in Iceland with his kinsman Úlf the Squinter. The &quot;Landnámabók&quot; describes Geirmund as a war-king who had dominions in Rogaland but names a certain Sulki as the true king of Rogaland, as do other accounts. However &quot;Grettis saga&quot; (&#x27;Saga of Grettir&#x27;) states that Hördaland belonged to Geirmund and that Sulki ruled only South Rogaland.

The son of Geirmund&#x27;s brother Hámund was Thorir-at-Espihól (&quot;Þórir á Espihóli&quot;) who also appears as a settler in Iceland in Icelandic accounts.

====Descendants of Gard&#x27;s other sons====
Thrym ruled Agdir. He fathered Agdi (&quot;Agði&quot;) and Agnar (&quot;Agnarr&quot;). Agnar was father of Ketil Thrym (&quot;Ketill Þrymr&quot;) who had land at Thrumu in Agdir.

Végard ruled Signafylki, that is the eastern part of the modern county Sogn og Fjordane. Végard was the father of Vedrorm (&quot;Vedrormr&quot;), the father of Vémund the Old (&quot;Vémundr inn gamli&quot;) who was called Sygnatrausti. The &quot;Gríms saga lodinkinna&quot; (&quot;Gríms saga loðinkinna&quot; &#x27;Saga of Grim Hairy-cheek&#x27;) tells at the end that Vedrorm, son of Vémund the Old, was a powerful lord who asked for the hand of Brynhild, daughter of Grim Hairy-Cheek. She went with him. Their son was Vémund, father of a son Vedrorm and a daughter Brynhild. Vedrorm fled King Harald Fairhair to Jamtaland (the modern Jämtland County in Sweden) and cleared the forest to live there and was father of a son Holmfast. Holmfast and his cousin Grím son of Brynhild are also mentioned in the &quot;Landnámabók&quot; (4.2).

Freygard ruled Fjörd (&quot;Fjǫrðr&quot;) and Fjalir, that is the western part of the modern county Sogn og Fjordane. Freygard was father of Freystein the Old (&quot;Freysteinn gamli&quot;) who had land at Gaular and was also father of Freybjörn (&quot;Freybjǫrn&quot;), father of Audbjörn (&quot;Auðbjǫrn&quot;) father of Arinbjörn (&quot;Arinbjǫrn&quot;) Jarl of Fird.

Thórgard ruled South Mœr (&quot;Sunnmœrr&quot;), the modern Sunnmøre district in the county Møre og Romsdal. Thórgard was father of Thorvid (&quot;Thorviðr&quot;) father of Arnvid (&quot;Arnviðr&quot;) Tréserkjabana, father of Slævid (&quot;Slæviðr&quot;) and Brávid (&quot;Bráviðr&quot;).

Grjótgard ruled North Mœr (&quot;Norðmœrr&quot;), the modern Nordmøre district in the county Møre og Romsdal. Grjótgard was father of Salgard (&quot;Salgarðr&quot;), father of Grjótgard, father of Sölvi (&quot;Sǫlvi&quot;), father of Högni of Njardey, father of a son, Sölvi Víking, and a daughter, Hild the Slender, the same Hild the Slender who married Hjörleif the Ladies&#x27; Man and was mother of Hálf as described in the previous section. (Högni, Sölvi, and Hild all play important parts in &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;.)

Högni of Njardey is mentioned also in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; as the father of Sölvi who for a time ruled Sweden. Since Sölvi in &quot;Hálfs saga&quot; appears eventually as king of Sweden, the two are obviously intended to be the same. But chronologically that is impossible unless either the genealogies in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; or those of Hálf&#x27;s lineage are incorrect or defective (or both are incorrect).

The &quot;Hversu&quot; notes further that another son of Grjótgard was Sigar (&quot;Sigarr&quot;), father of a daughter Signýjar who married Jarl Harald of Naumu Dale who fathered on her Herlaug, father of Grjótgard, father of Jarl Hákon, father of Jarl Sigurd, father of Jarl Hákon of Hlada. (These last three were contemporaries to and supporters of King Harald Fairhair. Indeed, one of Harald&#x27;s wives was Ása the daughter of Jarl Hákon son of Grjótgard. However the Herlaug who was king of Naumu Dale according to the account in &quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s saga&quot; in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; could certainly not be Jarl Hákon&#x27;s grandfather.)

==Commentary==
The word &quot;garðr&quot; means &#x27;an enclosed piece of land&#x27; and is cognate with English &quot;yard&quot; and &quot;garth&quot;. The element &quot;garðr&quot; is commonly an element in place names such as Asgard, Midgard, Micklegard (a common Norse name for Constantinople), Holmgard (a common Norse name for Novgorod), and so forth. So, though Garðr does appear as a man&#x27;s name, it is possible that &quot;Garðr Agði&quot; is in origin a personification of the Land of Agdir, and that his sons whose names end in &quot;-gard&quot; (&quot;-garðr&quot;) are similar personifications of other regions of Norway, euhemerized into first kings of those regions.

Thrym is otherwise known only as the name of a giant. See Thrym.

<doc id="1037825" wikidata="Q1638389" url="?curid=1037825" title="Holambra">
<text>Holambra (from the words Holland-America-Brazil) is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. Holambra is the largest producer of flowers and ornamental plants in Latin America, also hosting the largest spring event in the continent, the Expoflora. The population is 15,272 (2020 est.) in an area of 65.58 km2. The elevation is 600m on average.

== History ==
The colony Holambra and The &quot;Cooperativa Agropecuária de Holambra&quot; (Cattle Farming Cooperation of Holambra) were founded in 1948 by Catholic Dutch immigrants at the farm &quot;Fazenda Ribeirão&quot;, situated between the cities Jaguariúna, Santo Antonio de Posse, Artur Nogueira and Cosmópolis.

After the devastation caused by World War II, the Dutch government stimulated emigration to Australia, Brazil, Canada and France. Brazil was the only nation to allow the arrival of large groups of Catholics. With the consent of the Brazilian government, the Catholic Dutch Farmers and Market-gardeners Union (Dutch: &quot;Katholieke Nederlandse Boeren- en Tuindersbond&quot;) coordinated the emigration process.

A group of approximately 500 migrants from the province of North Brabant arrived in Brazil, establishing their first colony at the farm of Fazenda Ribeirão in the state of São Paulo. Holambra I was founded on July 14, 1948.

After a referendum in 1991 where 98% of the population voted in favor of political autonomy for the area, Holambra gained city status in January 1993.

Famous for its large production of flowers and plants and for the yearly event Expoflora, Holambra receives thousands of tourists each year. In April 1998 this fact was recognized as Holambra gained the status of &quot;Estância Turística&quot;, touristic location.

<text>Swampoodle Grounds aka Capitol Park (II) was the home of the Washington Nationals baseball team of the National League from 1886 to 1889. The name refers to the one-time Swampoodle neighborhood of Washington.

The ballfield was located on a block bounded by North Capitol Street NE and tracks (west); F Street NE (south); Delaware Avenue NE (east); and G Street NE (north); a few blocks north of the Capitol building. Spectators faced toward the south and could see the Capitol dome. They could also see the McDowell and Sons Feed Mill, visible behind right field in the picture, and which was across F Street to the south.

The club moved a few blocks north, from Capitol Park (I) to the Swampoodle location, upon joining the National League. Local papers reported that the new grounds had more space and a more favorable lease. The papers often referred to the new grounds as Capitol Park, even as the previous Capitol Park was still in use, under the same name, for various types of entertainment. When referencing the previous park, the reports would general specify its location, to minimize possible confusion.

Portions of the site were eventually annexed as the site of the Union Station and of the Main Post Office, which is now the National Postal Museum.

Swampoodle Grounds held 6,000. The Washington Statesmen folded after the end of the 1889 season.

<doc id="1037832" wikidata="Q952617" url="?curid=1037832" title="Hortolândia">
<text>Hortolândia is a Brazilian municipality in the interior of the state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas and the Mesoregion and Microregion of Campinas. It is located northwest of the state capital, about 110 km away. It is part of the São Paulo macrometropolis, which exceeds 29 million inhabitants and makes up approximately 75 percent of the state&#x27;s population. The metropolitan regions of Campinas and São Paulo form the first megalopolis in the southern hemisphere. It is bordered by Sumaré, to the north; Monte Mor, to the south and west; and Campinas, to the east.

Hortolândia was founded in 1991, splitting from Sumaré, and the privileged location and proximity to major industrial centers in the country caused the municipality to undergo a rapid demographic and industrial development. Hortolândia is considered a technopole and has several high tech companies, including IBM. These activities make the city have the 76th largest nominal municipal GDP in Brazil, with BR$12.9 billion in 2017. Hortolândia has several campuses of renowned universities, such as the Federal Institute of São Paulo and the Adventist University Center of São Paulo.

Some of the city&#x27;s main attractions are important green areas that provide space for sports and resting. There are also the cultural projects and events held by the Municipal Secretariat of Culture, the body responsible for projecting the cultural life of Hortolândia.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

In 1798, lands were donated by the Portuguese Crown to José Teixeira Nogueira, an important mill owner in the region. He brought coffee for the first time to where the city of Hortolândia is today, whose work on the farms was based on slavery. After the slaves were freed, lands were donated to them, but stolen by an American doctor. Some areas were even renegotiated, but those that were made available did not favor coffee, so cotton, sugarcane and cattle breeding began to be grown. The place, which served as a stopping point for tropeiro, settlers and slaves, came to be called Jacuba (a Tupi-Guarani word meaning &quot;hot water&quot;), or the Sítio de Jacuba, since these travelers took advantage of the waters of the streams and the shade of the trees to rest and feed themselves.

The settlement began to take utterance when the telegraph office was inaugurated in 1896. Later, in 1917, the Jacuba telegraph post became a railroad station. Only in 1947 did its growth begin, with the approval of the Ortolândia Park subdivision, owned by João Ortolan. In December 1953, the District of Santa Cruz, which Jacuba was part of, was split from Campinas to become the municipality of Sumaré; as such, Jacuba went from a village to a district.

On April 17, 1958, Jacuba became known as Hortolândia, on the occasion of a legislative proposal by state deputy Leôncio Ferraz Júnior. The proposal to change the name came about because a district with the name &quot;Jacuba&quot; already existed in the state of São Paulo in the town of Iacanga (which later became part of the town of Arealva).

In the mid-1920s, an industrialization process began in Sumaré, with tax incentives. An IBM factory was installed in the Hortolândia district, on the edge of the Rodovia Jornalista Francisco Aguirre Proença. Other companies were attracted by the abundant land and tax incentives.

=== As a district ===
The beginning of the process of turning Hortolândia into a municipality originated in 1975, although this first attempt was unsuccessful because Hortolândia did not reach 5 thousandths of the state&#x27;s tax revenue and also because the President of the Republic did not give the endorsement for separation.

In the 1980s, Hortolândia was responsible for most of Sumaré&#x27;s tax collection, which exceeded 60%. Popular organization followed for the pro-separation movement. The residents wanted autonomy to define the future of Hortolândia, so they began to support creation of the municipality. In 1988, with the approval of the new constitution of Brazil, the interest in becoming an autonomous district surfaced in the community leaders of Hortolândia&#x27;s neighborhoods and in the population. On December 21, 1990, the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo set a plebiscite to be held in May 1991. On May 17, 1991, 97.4% voted in favor of separation in the plebiscite.

=== As a city ===
The municipality of Hortolândia is located in a strategic position, between major poles of development. Due to its privileged position, the region attracts large industrial organizations, besides being surrounded by large universities. The geographical location of the city is to the west of Campinas, bordering also the cities of Sumaré and Monte Mor. Hortolândia is the smallest municipality in the Campinas metropolitan area. The main river that cuts through the town is the Ribeirão Jacuba pt]. The city has benefited economically from being along the Rodovia Anhanguera, bordering Campinas, and being close to the Viracopos International Airport. More recently, a continuation of Rodovia dos Bandeirantes was implemented through the city, in the region of Jardim Amanda. This highway allowed important access to the municipality through the cloverleaf at the junction with Rodovia Jornalista Francisco Aguirre Proença in an area near the IBM do Brasil company.

There is a visible conurbation between Campinas, Sumaré and Hortolândia, without a clear identification of the territorial limits of these municipalities. The socio-economic interdependence for these municipalities is an element of extreme importance in the elaboration of their plans and projects.

== Geography ==

=== Relief and hydrography ===

The soil is formed by the decomposition of eruptive rocks, with low density drainage and soils varying from red to yellow latosols, suitable for mechanised agriculture. There are also sandy soils suitable for pastures and occasional crops. In some stretches the layers are sedimentary and the sandstone substrate makes the soil more impoverished, noticeably susceptible to erosion. These characteristics are more noticeable where the terrain is more wavy.

The hydrographic basin of the Piracicaba River, the basin in which Hortolândia and the region are located, covers the southeastern part of the state of São Paulo and the extreme south of Minas Gerais and is the main source of water extraction for consumption in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The main river that cuts through the municipality is Ribeirão Jacuba pt].

=== Climate ===
The Köppen climate classification of the region is humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;), with decreased rainfall in winter and an average annual temperature of 21.6 °C, having dry and mild winters (rarely too cold) and rainy summers with moderately high temperatures. The warmest month, February, has an average temperature of 24.5 °C, with a maximum average of 30.1 °C and a minimum of 18.9 °C. The coldest month, July, averages 17.8 °C, with a maximum average of 25.0 °C and a minimum average of 10.7 °C. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons.

The average annual rainfall is 1384.3 mm, with August being the driest month, when only 21.0 mm occurs. In January, the rainiest month, the average is 279.6 mm. In recent years, however, hot and dry days during winter have been increasingly frequent, often exceeding the 30 °C mark, especially between July and September. In August 2010, for example, there was no rain at all in the city. Dry seasons and Indian summers in the middle of the rainy season are also common records of bush fires, especially in the rural area of the city, which contributes to deforestation and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, further damaging the air quality.

=== Ecology and environment ===

Most of the original vegetation that existed in the city in the Atlantic Forest was ravaged. Like 13 other municipalities of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, the city suffers a serious environmental stress, and Hortolândia, along with Santa Bárbara d&#x27;Oeste and Sumaré, is considered one of the most critical areas subject to flooding and silting, with less than 2% of vegetation. This is the result of a historical process of land use by monocultures such as coffee and cattle breeding.

To try to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being carried out and planned, such as the construction of wildlife corridors, despite the fact that the remaining forest fragments suffer continuously from the pressure of irregular urban settlements. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of the riparian forests and an environmental protection area is being created to contain the conurbation with neighboring cities. Four environmental parks have also been created, which are natural reserves that still provide visitors and schools with environmental awareness programs.

In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1037836" wikidata="Q729546" url="?curid=1037836" title="Eclogite">
<text>Eclogite () is a metamorphic rock containing garnet (almandine-pyrope) hosted in a matrix of sodium-rich pyroxene (omphacite). Accessory minerals include kyanite, rutile, quartz, lawsonite, coesite, amphibole, phengite, paragonite, zoisite, dolomite, corundum and, rarely, diamond. The chemistry of primary and accessory minerals is used to classify three types of eclogite (A, B, and C). The broad range of eclogitic compositions has led to a longstanding debate on the origin of eclogite xenoliths as subducted, altered oceanic crust.

The name &quot;eclogite&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word for &#x27;choice&#x27; (, ), meaning &#x27;chosen rock&#x27; on account of its perceived beauty. It was first named by René Just Haüy in 1822 in the second edition of his work &quot;Traité de minéralogie&quot;.

==Origins==
Eclogites typically result from high to ultrahigh pressure metamorphism of mafic rock at low thermal gradients of &lt; as it is subducted to the lower crust to upper mantle depths in a subduction zone.

=== Classification ===
Eclogites are defined as bi-mineralic, broadly basaltic rocks which have been classified into Groups A, B and C based on the chemistry of their primary mineral phases, garnet and clinopyroxene. The classification distinguishes each group based on the jadeite content of clinopyroxene and pyrope in garnet. The rocks are gradationally less mafic (as defined by SiO2 and MgO) from group A to C, where the least mafic Group C contains higher alkali contents.

The transitional nature between groups A, B and C correlates with their mode of emplacement at the surface. Group A derive from cratonic regions of Earth&#x27;s crust, brought to the surface as xenoliths from depths greater than 150 km during kimberlite eruptions. Group B show strong compositional overlap with Group A, but are found as lenses or pods surrounded by peridotitic mantle material. Group C are commonly found between layers of mica or glaucophane schist, primarily exemplified by the New Caledonia tectonic block and off the coast of California.

=== Surface versus mantle origin ===
The broad range in composition has led a longstanding debate on the origin of eclogite xenoliths as either mantle or surface derived, where the latter is associated with the gabbro to eclogite transition as a major driving force for subduction.

Group A eclogite xenoliths remain the most enigmatic in terms of their origin due to metasomatic overprinting of their original composition. Models proposing a primary surface origin as seafloor protoliths strongly rely on the wide range in oxygen isotope composition, which overlaps with obducted oceanic crust, such as the Ibra section of the Samail ophiolite. The variation found in some eclogite xenoliths at the Roberts Victor kimberlite pipe are a result of hydrothermal alteration of basalt on the seafloor. This process is attributed to both low- and high-temperature seawater exchange, resulting in large fractionations in oxygen isotope space relative to the upper mantle value typical of mid ocean ridge basalt glasses. Other mechanisms proposed for the origin of Group A eclogite xenoliths rely on a cumulate model, where garnet and clinopyroxene bulk compositions derive from residues of partial melting within the mantle. Support of this process is result of metasomatic overprinting of the original oxygen isotope composition, driving them back towards the mantle range.

==Eclogite facies==
This facies reflects metamorphism at high pressure (at or over 12kbar) and moderately high to very high temperatures. The pressures exceed those of greenschist, blueschist, amphibolite or granulite facies.

Eclogites containing lawsonite (a hydrous calcium-aluminium silicate) are rarely exposed at Earth&#x27;s surface, although they are predicted from experiments and thermal models to form during normal subduction of oceanic crust at depths between about .

==Importance==

===Formation of igneous rocks from eclogite===

Partial melting of eclogite has been modeled to produce tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite melts. Eclogite-derived melts may be common in the mantle, and contribute to volcanic regions where unusually large volumes of magma are erupted. The eclogite melt may then react with enclosing peridotite to produce pyroxenite, which in turn melts to produce basalt.

==Distribution==

Occurrences exist in western North America, including the southwest and the Franciscan Formation of the California Coast Ranges. Transitional granulite-eclogite facies granitoid, felsic volcanics, mafic rocks and granulites occur in the Musgrave Block of the Petermann Orogeny, central Australia. Coesite- and glaucophane-bearing eclogites have been found in the northwestern Himalaya. The oldest coesite-bearing eclogites are about 650 and 620 million years old and they are located in Brazil and Mali, respectively.

<text>What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Doobie Brothers. The album was released on February 1, 1974, by Warner Bros. Records.

==Recording and content==
Tom Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single. &quot;It&#x27;s about losing a girl,&quot; stated Johnston. &quot;I wrote the chords and played it on acoustic, and then Ted [Templeman] had some ideas for it, like running the acoustic guitar through a Leslie.&quot; The song did moderately well on the charts, peaking at No. 32. &quot;Record World&quot; said that it was &quot;more melodic and easy-tempoed [than previous Doobie Brothers&#x27; hits], in tune with the pastoral weekend setting.&quot;

The second single released was &quot;Eyes of Silver&quot;, another Johnston-penned tune. According to him, &quot;Wordwise, that one really isn&#x27;t that spectacular. I wrote them at the last minute.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it was &quot;very similar to their smash &#x27;Listen To The Music and &quot;features every lick the Doobies have featured in their great patented sound&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that the group was &quot;back into their chuggin&#x27; folk-rock groove, fitting more easily into their &#x27;Listen to the Music&#x27; bag&quot;. That song did not have much success on the charts either, peaking at only No. 52. 

Grasping for chart action, Warner Brothers re-released the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nobody&quot;, backed with Tiran Porter&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;. This release was soon overshadowed when radio stations discovered &quot;Black Water&quot;. Other stations joined in and the song was officially released as a single that went on to sell over a million copies and became the Doobie Brothers&#x27; first No. 1 hit. &quot;Black Water&quot; had been featured as the B-side of &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday&quot; eight months earlier.

==Artwork==
The unusual lettering on the album cover was suggested by drummer John Hartman after visiting his high school alma mater, J.E.B. Stuart in Falls Church, Virginia. The school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Raiders Digest&quot;, had just changed its masthead to include those stylized fonts. The cover photo is by Dan Fong, their touring Media Coordinator. The cover photo was taken at a concert on December 4, 1973, at E.A. Diddle Arena, Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, Kentucky. He also did the cover photo for their album &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;.

<text>In solid-state physics, the free electron model is a quantum mechanical model for the behaviour of charge carriers in a metallic solid. It was developed in 1927, principally by Arnold Sommerfeld, who combined the classical Drude model with quantum mechanical Fermi–Dirac statistics and hence it is also known as the Drude–Sommerfeld model.

Given its simplicity, it is surprisingly successful in explaining many experimental phenomena, especially
* the Wiedemann–Franz law which relates electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity;
* the temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity;
* the shape of the electronic density of states;
* the range of binding energy values;
* electrical conductivities;
* the Seebeck coefficient of the thermoelectric effect;
* thermal electron emission and field electron emission from bulk metals.

The free electron model solved many of the inconsistencies related to the Drude model and gave insight into several other properties of metals. The free electron model considers that metals are composed of a quantum electron gas where ions play almost no role. The model can be very predictive when applied to alkali and noble metals.

==Ideas and assumptions==

In the free electron model four main assumptions are taken into account:
*Free electron approximation: The interaction between the ions and the valence electrons is mostly neglected, except in boundary conditions. The ions only keep the charge neutrality in the metal. Unlike in the Drude model, the ions are not necessarily the source of collisions.
*Independent electron approximation: The interactions between electrons are ignored. The electrostatic fields in metals are weak because of the screening effect.
*Relaxation-time approximation: There is some unknown scattering mechanism such that the electron probability of collision is inversely proportional to the relaxation time formula_1, which represents the average time between collisions. The collisions do not depend on the electronic configuration.
*Pauli exclusion principle: Each quantum state of the system can only be occupied by a single electron. This restriction of available electron states is taken into account by Fermi–Dirac statistics (see also Fermi gas). Main predictions of the free-electron model are derived by the Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi–Dirac occupancy for energies around the Fermi level.

The name of the model comes from the first two assumptions, as each electron can be treated as free particle with a respective quadratic relation between energy and momentum.

The crystal lattice is not explicitly taken into account in the free electron model, but a quantum-mechanical justification was given a year later (1928) by Bloch&#x27;s theorem: an unbound electron moves in a periodic potential as a free electron in vacuum, except for the electron mass &quot;me&quot; becoming an effective mass &quot;m*&quot; which may deviate considerably from &quot;me&quot; (one can even use negative effective mass to describe conduction by electron holes). Effective masses can be derived from band structure computations that were not originally taken into account in the free electron model.

== From the Drude model ==

Many physical properties follow directly from the Drude model, as some equations do not depend on the statistical distribution of the particles. Taking the classical velocity distribution of an ideal gas or the velocity distribution of a Fermi gas only changes the results related to the speed of the electrons.

Mainly, the free electron model and the Drude model predict the same DC electrical conductivity &quot;σ&quot; for Ohm&#x27;s law, that is
:formula_2 with formula_3

where formula_4 is the current density, formula_5 is the external electric field, formula_6 is the electronic density (number of electrons/volume), formula_1 is the mean free time and formula_8 is the electron electric charge.

Other quantities that remain the same under the free electron model as under Drude&#x27;s are the AC susceptibility, the plasma frequency, the magnetoresistance, and the Hall coefficient related to the Hall effect.

== Properties of an electron gas ==

Many properties of the free electron model follow directly from equations related to the Fermi gas, as the independent electron approximation leads to an ensemble of non-interacting electrons. For a three-dimensional electron gas we can define the Fermi energy as
:formula_9

where formula_10 is the reduced Planck constant. The Fermi energy defines the energy of the highest energy electron at zero temperature. For metals the Fermi energy is in the order of units of electronvolts above the free electron band minimum energy.

=== Density of states ===
The 3D density of states (number of energy states, per energy per volume) of a non-interacting electron gas is given by:
:formula_11

where formula_12 is the energy of a given electron. This formula takes into account the spin degeneracy but does not consider a possible energy shift due to the bottom of the conduction band. For 2D the density of states is constant and for 1D is inversely proportional to the square root of the electron energy.

=== Fermi level ===
The chemical potential formula_13 of electrons in a solid is also known as the Fermi level and, like the related Fermi energy, often denoted formula_14. The Sommerfeld expansion can be used to calculate the Fermi level (formula_15) at higher temperatures as:
:formula_16

where formula_17 is the temperature and we define formula_18 as the Fermi temperature (formula_19 is Boltzmann constant). The perturbative approach is justified as the Fermi temperature is usually of about 105 K for a metal, hence at room temperature or lower the Fermi energy formula_20 and the chemical potential formula_21 are practically equivalent.

=== Compressibility of metals and degeneracy pressure ===
The total energy per unit volume (at formula_22) can also be calculated by integrating over the phase space of the system, we obtain
:formula_23

which does not depend on temperature. Compare with the energy per electron of an ideal gas: formula_24, which is null at zero temperature. For an ideal gas to have the same energy as the electron gas, the temperatures would need to be of the order of the Fermi temperature. Thermodynamically, this energy of the electron gas corresponds to a zero-temperature pressure given by
: formula_25

where formula_26 is the volume and formula_27 is the total energy, the derivative performed at temperature and chemical potential constant. This pressure is called the electron degeneracy pressure and does not come from repulsion or motion of the electrons but from the restriction that no more than two electrons (due to the two values of spin) can occupy the same energy level. This pressure defines the compressibility or bulk modulus of the metal
:formula_28

This expression gives the right order of magnitude for the bulk modulus for alkali metals and noble metals, which show that this pressure is as important as other effects inside the metal. For other metals the crystalline structure has to be taken into account.

=== Magnetic response ===
According to the Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem, a classical system at thermodynamic equilibrium cannot have a magnetic response. The magnetic properties of matter in terms of a microscopic theory are purely quantum mechanical. For an electron gas, the total magnetic response is paramagnetic and its magnetic susceptibility given by 
:formula_29
where formula_30 is the vacuum permittivity and the formula_31 is the Bohr magneton. This value results from the competition of two contributions: a diamagnetic contribution (known as Landau&#x27;s diamagnetism) coming from the orbital motion of the electrons in the presence of a magnetic field, and a paramagnetic contribution (Pauli&#x27;s paramagnetism). The latter contribution is three times larger in absolute value than the diamagnetic contribution and comes from the electron spin, an intrinsic quantum degree of freedom that can take two discrete values and it is associated to the electron magnetic moment.

== Corrections to Drude&#x27;s model ==

=== Heat capacity ===

One open problem in solid-state physics before the arrival of quantum mechanics was to understand the heat capacity of metals. While most solids had a constant volumetric heat capacity given by Dulong–Petit law of about formula_32 at large temperatures, it did correctly predict its behavior at low temperatures. In the case of metals that are good conductors, it was expected that the electrons contributed also the heat capacity.

The classical calculation using Drude&#x27;s model, based on an ideal gas, provides a volumetric heat capacity given by
:formula_33.

If this was the case, the heat capacity of a metals should be 1.5 of that obtained by the Dulong–Petit law.

Nevertheless, such a large additional contribution to the heat capacity of metals was never measured, raising suspicions about the argument above. By using Sommerfeld&#x27;s expansion one can obtain corrections of the energy density at finite temperature and obtain the volumetric heat capacity of an electron gas, given by:
:formula_34,

where the prefactor to formula_35 is considerably smaller than the 3/2 found in formula_36, about 100 times smaller at room temperature and much smaller at lower formula_37.

Evidently, the electronic contribution alone does not predict the Dulong–Petit law, i.e. the observation that the heat capacity of a metal is still constant at high temperatures. The free electron model can be improved in this sense by adding the contribution of the vibrations of the crystal lattice. Two famous quantum corrections include the Einstein solid model and the more refined Debye model. With the addition of the latter, the volumetric heat capacity of a metal at low temperatures can be more precisely written in the form, 
:formula_38, 
where formula_39 and formula_40 are constants related to the material. The linear term comes from the electronic contribution while the cubic term comes from Debye model. At high temperature this expression is no longer correct, the electronic heat capacity can be neglected, and the total heat capacity of the metal tends to a constant given by the Dulong–petit law.

=== Mean free path ===
Notice that without the relaxation time approximation, there is no reason for the electrons to deflect their motion, as there are no interactions, thus the mean free path should be infinite. The Drude model considered the mean free path of electrons to be close to the distance between ions in the material, implying the earlier conclusion that the diffusive motion of the electrons was due to collisions with the ions. The mean free paths in the free electron model are instead given by formula_41 (where formula_42 is the Fermi speed) and are in the order of hundreds of ångströms, at least one order of magnitude larger than any possible classical calculation. The mean free path is then not a result of electron–ion collisions but instead is related to imperfections in the material, either due to defects and impurities in the metal, or due to thermal fluctuations.

=== Thermal conductivity and thermopower ===
While Drude&#x27;s model predicts a similar value for the electric conductivity as the free electron model, the models predict slightly different thermal conductivities.

The thermal conductivity is given by formula_43 for free particles, which is proportional to the heat capacity and the mean free path which depend on the model (formula_44 is the mean (square) speed of the electrons or the Fermi speed in the case of the free electron model). This implies that the ratio between thermal and electric conductivity is given by the Wiedemann–Franz law,

:formula_45

where formula_46 is the Lorenz number, given by

:formula_47

The free electron model is closer to the measured value of formula_48 V2/K2 while the Drude prediction is off by about half the value, which is not a large difference. The close prediction to the Lorenz number in the Drude model was a result of the classical kinetic energy of electron being about 100 smaller than the quantum version, compensating the large value of the classical heat capacity.

However, Drude&#x27;s mode predicts the wrong order of magnitude for the Seebeck coefficient (thermopower), which relates the generation of a potential difference by applying a temperature gradient across a sample formula_49. This coefficient can be showed to be formula_50, which is just proportional to the heat capacity, so the Drude model predicts a constant that is hundred times larger than the value of the free electron model. While the latter get as coefficient that is linear in temperature and provides much more accurate absolute values in the order of a few tens of μV/K at room temperature. However this models fails to predict the sign change of the thermopower in lithium and noble metals like gold and silver.

==Inaccuracies and extensions==
The free electron model presents several inadequacies that are contradicted by experimental observation. We list some inaccuracies below:
; Temperature dependence: The free electron model presents several physical quantities that have the wrong temperature dependence, or no dependence at all like the electrical conductivity. The thermal conductivity and specific heat are well predicted for alkali metals at low temperatures, but fails to predict high temperature behaviour coming from ion motion and phonon scattering.
; Hall effect and magnetoresistance: The Hall coefficient has a constant value formula_51 in Drude&#x27;s model and in the free electron model. This value is independent of temperature and the strength of the magnetic field. The Hall coefficient is actually dependent on the band structure and the difference with the model can be quite dramatic when studying elements like magnesium and aluminium that have a strong magnetic field dependence. The free electron model also predicts that the traverse magnetoresistance, the resistance in the direction of the current, does not depend on the strength of the field. In almost all the cases it does.
; Directional: The conductivity of some metals can depend of the orientation of the sample with respect to the electric field. Sometimes even the electrical current is not parallel to the field. This possibility is not described because the model does not integrate the crystallinity of metals, i.e. the existence of a periodic lattice of ions. 
; Diversity in the conductivity: Not all materials are electrical conductors, some do not conduct electricity very well (insulators), some can conduct when impurities are added like semiconductors. Semimetals, with narrow conduction bands also exist. This diversity is not predicted by the model and can only by explained by analysing the valence and conduction bands. Additionally, electrons are not the only charge carriers in a metal, electron vacancies or holes can be seen as quasiparticles carrying positive electric charge. Conduction of holes leads to an opposite sign for the Hall and Seebeck coefficients predicted by the model.

Other inadequacies are present in the Wiedemann–Franz law at intermediate temperatures and the frequency-dependence of metals in the optical spectrum.

More exact values for the electrical conductivity and Wiedemann–Franz law can be obtained by softening the relaxation-time approximation by appealing to the Boltzmann transport equations.

The exchange interaction is totally excluded from this model and its inclusion can lead to other magnetic responses like ferromagnetism.

An immediate continuation to the free electron model can be obtained by assuming the empty lattice approximation, which forms the basis of the band structure model known as the nearly free electron model.

Adding repulsive interactions between electrons does not change very much the picture presented here. Lev Landau showed that a Fermi gas under repulsive interactions, can be seen as a gas of equivalent quasiparticles that slightly modify the properties of the metal. Landau&#x27;s model is now known as the Fermi liquid theory. More exotic phenomena like superconductivity, where interactions can be attractive, require a more refined theory.

<text>Lowell Tom Perry (August 5, 1922 – May 30, 2015) was an American businessman and religious leader who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1974 until his death.

==Early life==
Perry was born in Logan, Utah, to Leslie Thomas Perry and his wife, Elsie Nora Sonne. Perry, Utah is named for Perry&#x27;s ancestor, Gustavus Adolphus Perry and his family, who were among the first settlers in that area.

From the time of Perry&#x27;s birth until he was eighteen, his father was bishop of their LDS ward in Logan. From 1942 to 1944, Perry served as an LDS missionary in the Northern States Mission, headquartered in Chicago. He spent about 10 months in Marion, Ohio, where he was instrumental in forming a branch in that city. He also served for part of his mission based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. After returning from his mission he joined the United States Marine Corps and was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. While in training Perry attended church and activities at the Adams Ward in Los Angeles.

Perry was then part of the American forces that landed on Saipan, and remained there for about a year. While there he participated in the construction of an LDS chapel on the island. He was among the United States troops sent to occupy Japan after the war. While in Nagasaki, Perry coordinated a group of Marines to help rebuild a local Protestant church.

==Education==
Perry graduated from the Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University (USU)) in 1949 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in finance.

While he was a student at USU, Perry served as president of the university&#x27;s Associated Students.

==Employment==
Perry&#x27;s first job out of college was working as administrative assistant working for the USU Extension Service. He also took graduate courses in finance during this time.

In 1950, before his second child was born, Perry took a Christmas retail season job with C.C. Anderson&#x27;s (CCA) Department Store in Logan, Utah. CCA was a division of Allied Stores.

In early 1951, Perry took a job with CCA at its corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho. Later in 1951, CCA decided to appoint controllers in each of their stores. Perry was appointed as controller for the Lewiston, Idaho store. When he first took this position he lived in Lewiston, but later moved to Clarkston, Washington.

He was later involved in business jobs that took him to Washington, California, New York, and Massachusetts.

Perry was in the retail business during his time in Boston, Massachusetts. He became a fan of the Boston Red Sox and threw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game on May 8, 2004.

==Early church service==
In addition to his mission to the Northern States, Perry served as an LDS group leader while on Saipan. He oversaw more convert baptisms in this position than while on his mission.

He also served in the LDS Church as an early-morning seminary teacher, as a counselor in a bishopric, high councilor, counselor in a stake presidency, and as president of the church&#x27;s Boston Massachusetts Stake.

In early 1963, after moving to Scarsdale, New York, Perry was called simultaneously as a member of the New York Stake&#x27;s high council, stake mission president, and special assistant to the president of the church&#x27;s Eastern States Mission. In these assignments, he worked with Bernard P. Brockbank and Wilburn C. West in overseeing the creation and implementation of the LDS Church&#x27;s pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==General authority==

Perry was called as a general authority and Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1972. The death of church president Harold B. Lee created a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve when Spencer W. Kimball, who had been serving as quorum president, became church president. Perry was sustained as a member of the Twelve on April 6, 1974, and was ordained an apostle on April 11, 1974.

In 2004, Perry was asked by church president Gordon B. Hinckley to serve as president of the church&#x27;s Europe Central Area, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. This was a position normally held by a member of the seventy. This made Perry one of the most senior officials of the church ever to be stationed away from Salt Lake City. While serving in this capacity, Perry initiated a more proactive institute program that emphasized meeting the social and intellectual needs of young single adult church members. In 2015, he met with Barack Obama and other LDS Church leaders at a meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Family==
Perry married Virginia C. Lee in the Logan Temple on July 18, 1947. They had three children together. Perry&#x27;s son, Lee Tom Perry, is an academic and was dean of the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University from 1998 to 2005. Virginia Perry died of cancer in December 1974. Their daughter, Barbara, died of cancer in 1983.

In 1976, Perry married Barbara Dayton.

==Death==
In April 2015, Perry was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. In May 2015, the church reported the aggressive cancer had spread and Perry died the following day, on May 30, 2015. At the time of his death, he was the third most senior and oldest living apostle in the church. His funeral was held on June 5, 2015. Perry was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery, next to his first wife, Virginia and his daughter, Barbara.

<text>The province of Brescia (; Brescian: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. It has a population of some 1,265,964 (as of January 2019) and its capital is the city of Brescia.With an area of 4,785 km2, it is the biggest province of Lombardy. It is also the second province of the region for the number of inhabitants and fifth in Italy (first, excluding metropolitan cities).

It borders the province of Sondrio to the north and north west, the province of Bergamo to the west, the province of Cremona to the south west and south, the province of Mantua to the south. On its northeastern border, Lake GardaItaly&#x27;s largestis divided between Brescia and the neighboring provinces of Verona (Veneto region) and Trentino (Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region).

The province stretches between Lake Iseo in the west, Lake Garda in the east, the Southern Rhaetian Alps in the north and the Lombardian plains in the south. The main rivers of the province are the Oglio, the Mella and the Chiese.

Besides Brescia, other important towns in the province are Travagliato, Darfo Boario Terme, Desenzano del Garda, Palazzolo sull&#x27;Oglio, Montichiari, Ghedi, Chiari, Rovato, Gussago, Rezzato, Concesio, Orzinuovi, Salò, Gardone Val Trompia and Lumezzane.

==Geography==
The province of Brescia is the largest in the region, boasts three main lakes, Lake Garda, Lake Iseo and Lake Idro, plus several other smaller lakes, three valleys, Val Camonica, Val Trompia and Valle Sabbia, as well as a wide flat area south of the city, known as the &quot;Bassa Bresciana&quot;, and several hilly areas surrounding the city landscape and extending eastwards towards Veneto and west to Franciacorta.

Due to the altitude and morphological variety and the presence of large lakes, the province includes all kinds of biomes in Europe: from something similar to the maquis shrubland up to the perennial snow of Adamello (with the largest glacier in the Italian Alps).

===Valleys===
The three main valleys on the territory of Brescia are the Val Camonica, crossed by the river Oglio and inserted in the northwestern part of the province from Adamello to Lake Iseo; Val Trompia, the river Mella basin, between the municipalities of Concesio and Collio; and the Valle Sabbia which includes the municipalities from Serle to Bagolino along the course of the river Chiese.

All the three valleys have the point of union the Croce Domini Pass, which takes the name from the &quot;cross&quot; formed by the union of the three basins.

===Lakes===
Within the province there are eight lakes. The main lake basin, in both dimensional, climatic and cultural terms, is Lake Garda, shared with the Veneto and Trentino regions, which with its 370 km2 of surface is the biggest lake in Italy. Because of its size, the lake has a considerable influence on the climate and the surrounding environment, generating a micro-geographic area in a more mitigated climate both in summer and winter.

Lake Iseo is the second lake of the area, and is situated at about 180 m above sea level, in an area called &quot;Sebino&quot;, between Val Camonica (north) and Franciacorta (south), which divides the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia.

Lake Idro, the third lake within the provincial territory, is located in Valle Sabbia, on the border between Brescia and the province of Trento, and differs from the other two main lakes for its modest size. The waters of the lake are mainly exploited for the irrigation of crops in contiguous territories, as well as for the production of energy through a small power plant located in the municipality of Vobarno.

Other small lakes in the province are: Lago della Vacca (at an elevation of 2,358 m, in one of the coldest points of the province), Lago d&#x27;Arno, Lago Aviolo, Lago Baitone, Lago Moro and Lago di Valvestino.
===Rivers===
There are about 45 watercourses crossing the territory of the province, but almost all of them are torrents. The only watercourses that can be defined as real rivers are just three: Oglio, Chiese and Mella; divided between the three main valleys.

==Government==

The Province of Brescia is an administrative body of intermediate level between a municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) and Lombardy region.

The three main functions devolved to the province of Brescia are:
* local planning and zoning;
* provision of local police and fire services;
* transportation regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.).

As an administrative institution, the province of Brescia has its own elected bodies. From 1945 to 1995 the President of the province of Brescia was chosen by the members of the Provincial Council, elected every five years by citizens. From 1995 to 2014, under provisions of the 1993 local administration reform, the President of the Province was chosen by popular election, originally every four, then every five years.

On 3 April 2014, the Italian Chamber of Deputies gave its final approval to the Law n.56/2014 which involves the transformation of the Italian provinces into &quot;institutional bodies of second level&quot;. According to the 2014 reform, each province is headed by a President (or Commissioner) assisted by a legislative body, the Provincial Council, and an executive body, the Provincial Executive. President (Commissioner) and members of Council are elected together by mayors and city councilors of each municipality of the province respectively every four and two years. The Executive is chaired by the President (Commissioner) who appoint others members, called &quot;assessori&quot;. Since 2015, the President (Commissioner) and other members of the Council do not receive a salary.

In each province, there is also a Prefect (&quot;prefetto&quot;), a representative of the central government who heads an agency called &quot;prefettura-ufficio territoriale del governo&quot;. The Questor (&quot;questore&quot;) is the head of State&#x27;s Police (&quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;) in the province and his office is called &quot;questura&quot;. There is also a province&#x27;s police force depending from local government, called provincial police (&quot;polizia provinciale&quot;).

This is a list of the Presidents of the Province since 1945:

<text>MS &quot;Scandinavian Star, originally namedMS &quot;Massalia, was a car and passenger ferry built in France in 1971. The ship was set on fire on 7 April 1990, killing 159 people. The official investigation determined the fire had been caused by a convicted arsonist who died in the blaze. This finding has since been disputed.

After a lengthy period of lay-up after the fire, she was eventually repaired and refitted and put back into ferry service as the Regal Voyager, initially in the Mediterranean, and later in the Caribbean. She was eventually scrapped in 2004.

==History==
M/S &quot;Massalia&quot; was built by Dubigeon-Normandie SA in 1971 and delivered to Compagnie de Paquebots, which put her on the company&#x27;s Marseille–Málaga–Casablanca route. The ship also conducted cruises in the Mediterranean Sea. By 1984 she had been owned by a number of companies and renamed &quot;Stena Baltica&quot;, &quot;Island Fiesta&quot; and finally &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot;, a name given to her by Scandinavian World Cruises. &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was chartered for cruises between St. Petersburg/Tampa, Florida, United States, to Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico.

&quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; had been stricken by other fires throughout its history. During the investigation of the 1990 fire, investigators learned that unreported fires had also occurred in 1985, caused by a deep-fryer, and twice more in 1988, the first caused by a broken lubricating pipe. On 15 March 1988, just a few days after the first fire, &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was about northeast of Cancún when a second fire started in the engine room. The ship, which was then carrying 439 passengers and 268 crew members, lost its power supply and emergency oxygen system, hampering the fire crew&#x27;s efforts. The inability of the crewmembers to communicate effectively with each other and with passengers was a serious concern and created confusion during the firefighting and evacuation procedures.

==Fire==

In 1990, &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was put into service on the Oslo-Frederikshavn route for the Norwegian shipping line DA-NO Linjen. As she had been converted from a casino ship to a passenger ferry, &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot;″s new crew had to be trained in just ten days to learn new responsibilities, whereas six to eight weeks would have been a reasonable period to train a crew for a ship of its size. Many of the crew could not speak English, Norwegian or Danish, thus further reducing the effectiveness of the crew&#x27;s response to an emergency. Erik Stein, technical leader for the Norwegian marine insurance company Assuranceforeningen Skuld, had inspected the ship and had declared the fire preparedness deficient, citing defective fire doors among other reasons.

During the night of 7 April 1990, at about 2 a.m. local time, a fire broke out and was discovered by a passenger and was brought to the attention of the receptionist. The fire spread from deck 3 to 4 stopping at deck 5. The stairwell and ceilings acted as chimneys for the fire to spread. Although the bulkheads were made of steel structure with asbestos wall boards, a melamine resin laminate was used as a decorative covering and proved extremely flammable in subsequent testing, spreading fire throughout deck 3. The burning laminates produced toxic hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. The fire then spread to deck 4 and deck 5.

When the captain learned of the fire, he attempted to close the bulkhead fire doors on deck 3. The fire doors were not configured for fully automatic closing and did not respond since emergency alarms near the doors had not been manually triggered by passengers or crew. A vehicle storage area ventilated by large fans to remove exhaust fumes was also located nearby, and the fans pulled air through an improperly secured fire door and caused rapid fire progress from deck 3 through deck 4 and deck 5 via stairways located on either end.

The captain later ordered his crew to turn off the ventilation system when he realized it was feeding the fire, and an unintended result was that smoke was able to enter passenger cabins via the door vents. Some tried to seek refuge from the smoke in areas such as closets and bathrooms or remain asleep in bed, but were eventually overcome by smoke. Those who tried to escape may have variously encountered thick smoke, confusing corridor layouts, and poorly trained crew members.

Investigators proposed several reasons for why many passengers did not safely evacuate:

# Many people probably did not hear the alarms due to the distance between their cabins and the alarms, and due to the ordinary mechanical noise of the ship systems.
# Some people probably could not find their way out because of thick smoke obscuring the exit routes and signage.
# Burning melamine panels in the hallways produced poisonous hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide gases, causing rapid unconsciousness and death.
# Numerous Portuguese crew members did not speak or understand Norwegian, Danish or English, were unfamiliar with the ship, and had never practised a fire drill. Only a few crew members even thought to put on breathing masks before entering smoke-filled corridors.
# On deck 5, where most passenger deaths occurred, the hallways were arranged in a layout that contained dead ends and did not otherwise logically lead to emergency exits.

The captain ordered the general alarms to be activated, told everyone to abandon ship, and sent out a Mayday request. The captain and crew ultimately abandoned the ship before all passengers were evacuated, leaving many still on board the burning ship even after it was towed to the harbour. The ship was towed to Lysekil, Sweden, where the fire department suppressed the fire in ten hours.

===Victims===
The captain of the vessel said that the ferry was carrying 395 passengers and 97 crew on the day of the fire. It was later determined that 158 people, or approximately one-third of all passengers on board, died on the ship. Another victim died two weeks later from his injuries. 136 of those killed were Norwegian.

As many of the victims&#x27; remains were damaged by the fire, more than 100 specialists, including police technicians, forensic pathologists, and forensic dentists, worked to identify all the recovered remains. It was initially reported that many of the bodies found were children, but Swedish Police were quoted as stating that children under the age of 7 were not included on passenger lists, causing confusion on actual counts.

===Investigation===
An Oslo police investigation initially cast suspicion on Erik Mørk Andersen, a Danish truck driver who died in the disaster and who had three previous convictions for arson. A later investigation in 2009 determined that there were several separate fires and that multiple people would have been needed to start them, especially if they were not familiar with the layout of the ship. A 2013 report prepared by a self-appointed Norwegian group called &quot;Stiftelsen Etterforskning Av Mordbrannen Scandinavian Star&quot; (&quot;Foundation for Arson Investigation Scandinavian Star&quot;) denied that Andersen was responsible, claiming instead that multiple fires were deliberately set and the truck driver was killed by one of the first two fires (up to nine hours prior to the last fire being started).

The same 2013 report claimed that as many as nine experienced members of the crew, having joined the ship earlier in Tampa, were likely to be responsible for six separate fires on the &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; as well as multiple acts of sabotage to both the ship and the fire crew&#x27;s efforts to put out the fire. The report proposed the motive for the crime was insurance fraud, as the ship was insured for twice its value shortly before the fire broke out. The report claims that multiple people with insider knowledge of the ship were required for events to unfold as they did. This controversial and unproven report led to renewed police interest, and in 2014 the investigation was officially reopened and charges dropped against the deceased suspect Andersen.

In March 2015, the Parliament of Norway decided to remove the statute of limitations for arson, such that criminal investigation and prosecution remains possible. In February 2016, the retired Danish investigator Flemming Thue Jensen, who had led the post-fire investigation in 1990, claimed that the fire was sabotage and was set by members of the ship&#x27;s crew; that fire doors had been propped open to allow the fire to spread; and that a third flare-up that occurred after the ship had been evacuated of passengers was caused by crew members soaking mattresses with diesel fuel.

====Changes to the International Code for Fire Safety Systems====
The incident raised a number of issues relating to fire protection and evacuation on passenger ships. The International Code for Fire Safety Systems of the International Maritime Organization&#x27;s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea was comprehensively amended after the disaster, in 1992.

==Salvage and later service==

The burnt ship was towed to Copenhagen, Denmark on 18 April 1990, arriving two days later and remaining there for several months. On 11 August 1990, she was towed to the United Kingdom, first arriving at Hull before moving on to Southampton on 10 September, where the vessel was renamed &quot;Candi&quot; by simply painting over part of the original name.

In February 1994, she was sold at auction to International Shipping Partners. She was renamed &quot;Regal Voyager&quot; and sent to Italy for rebuilding, then later chartered to Comarit Ferries and put on the route between Tangier, Morocco and Port-Vendres, France.

In 1997, she was registered to St. Thomas Cruises and put on a route between Port Isabel, Texas and Puerto Cortés, Honduras, for Isabel Cortes Ferry Service. Chartered to Ferries del Caribe in 1999, she was put on the route Santo Domingo – San Juan, Puerto Rico. The ship was laid up in Charleston, South Carolina in 2003, then sold to Indian shipbreakers in 2004 and renamed as &quot;Regal V&quot;. She arrived at the Alang Ship Breaking Yard, India, on 14 May 2004, and the work to get her broken up started five days later.

==Memorials==

A few months after the fire, a two-day memorial voyage was arranged by a survivors&#x27; support group, clergymen and psychologists in order to remember the victims and help survivors and family members heal. The voyage was taken by about 300 people, who dropped flowers into the North Sea during a sunset memorial service.

On 7 April 2006, a memorial was inaugurated in Oslo, near the Akershus Fortress. It features a mother carrying her baby and leading another child, a small boy who reaches back for his dropped teddy bear; also a large commemorative plaque with the names of all the victims of the fire.

In 2015 on the 25th anniversary of the fire, Queen Sonja of Norway, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang, and Denmark&#x27;s Ambassador to Norway Torben Brylle, paid tribute to the victims and survivors in a waterfront ceremony.

A permanent memorial of the &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; fire was unveiled in Lysekil on 13 May 2021.

==2020 documentary and possible reopening of the case==
In 2020, Danish national television channel DR, Norwegian channel NRK, and Swedish channel TV4 broadcast a six-hour Nordic documentary named &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot;, largely based on &quot;Politiken&quot; journalist Lars Halskov&#x27;s book &quot;Branden - Gåden om Scandinavian Star&quot; (&quot;The fire - The Scandinavian Star riddle&quot;). The documentary went into great detail and made a number of allegations about what happened that night, about why the truth of &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; has never been revealed, how the authorities have let down the bereaved and how the police investigations into the matter are lacking.

Some of the allegations were:
* Contrary to the authorities, several fire experts believe there were at least four fires that night and there was not just one fire propagating through the ship but rather individual fires started at different times. The fire experts point out that among the evidence to suggest this was the fact that the same section of the ship burned twice and that the Swedish firefighters maintain that all fires were put out while the ship was being towed to Lysekil, but still an enormous fire broke out in a completely different area of the ship five hours after the ship docked.
* There is no evidence to suggest that Erik Mørk Andersen started any of the fires, and Andersen himself perished during the second fire.
* Several fire experts and the Danish maritime authorities&#x27; main investigator, Flemming Thue Jensen, do not believe that the fires were the work of some random pyromaniac. They believe they were all started by professionals who knew what they were doing and knew the ship&#x27;s layout well. When the second fire was started, two fire doors had been blocked to prevent them from closing, one with two mattresses and one with a big concrete block only accessible to the ship&#x27;s crew. Keeping these fire doors open ensured quick fire propagation, because it ensured airflow from the car deck beneath the fire thereby ensuring a &quot;wood stove effect&quot;, and the same fire was started in a position on the ship that allowed ventilation to carry it to other floors and to the opposite side of the ship.
* &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was (officially) purchased by shipowner Henrik Johansen at a highly inflated price (US$21.7 million), and was immediately insured for US$24 million by Danish insurance company Fjerde Sø. Only one week earlier, the ship had been sold to SeaEscape Ltd. for just US$10 million. This may be an indicator of insurance fraud, but this has never been investigated properly by the authorities. A Swedish representative of Polferries, who had also been interested in purchasing the ship in 1990, said that &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was &quot;a three-legged horse&quot; and its value was not even close to US$20 million since it was old, poorly maintained and not a RO-RO ferry. The latter is a serious drawback for a ferry transporting vehicles, because they all have to reverse out the ferry when it arrives instead of just continuing forward out the other end of the ship.
* On the morning of 7 April while the firefighters were trying to extinguish the flames, four members of the ship&#x27;s crew were flown back to the ship by helicopter: the chief machinist, a machinist, the chief electrician and captain Hugo Larsen. They said they wanted to help the firefighters but the behaviour of the chief machinist and the chief electrician was highly suspicious. At one time, the chief electrician kicked wedges away from underneath the fire doors in an attempt to shut the doors. The firefighters had deliberately placed the wedges there for their own safety. Also, all four crew members disappeared at one time or another and the firefighters did not see them again.
* According to several Swedish firefighters and salvage workers, three unknown men emerged from the ship during the night at Lysekil harbour and quickly disappeared before the firefighters could alert the police. Shortly thereafter, an enormous fire broke out in the ship&#x27;s front restaurant area. This fire quickly rose to temperatures so high that firefighters were unable to put out the fire for another 12 hours. According to the fire brigade, there had been no previous fires anywhere near the restaurant.
* Several large and suspicious fires had hit &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; and her sister ships while they were sailing in the Caribbean. In 1984, a fire completely destroyed MS &quot;Scandinavian Sea&quot; and its value was written down to zero (thereby triggering payout of the full insurance sum).
* &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was far from seaworthy when it started sailing with passengers on 1 April, and the safety of the passengers was given very low priority. While the ship was docked at Cuxhaven in Germany in March, an inspector for Norwegian insurance company, Skuld, inspected the ship and gave specific instructions that several things needed to be fixed before the ship could get a liability insurance, let alone travel with passengers. Among the defects were fire doors that did not close properly, rusty sprinkler systems that could not be tested, a critical fire door having been replaced by an ineffective glass door and that not a single fire drill had been conducted at any time. Strangely, Skuld ended up issuing a liability insurance for the ship anyway despite the inspector&#x27;s report.
* According to both Danish and Norwegian maritime authorities, none of them were informed in any way about &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot;, and therefore no inspection was conducted by any of them prior to 7 April. According to the Danish maritime authority, the ship was registered in Nassau, Bahamas and therefore only obliged to adhere to the much more lenient Bahamian safety regulations. However, in the documentary, former secretary and chairman of the Danish Association of Sailors, Henrik Berlau, alleged that the Danish maritime authorities knew that &quot;Scandinavian Star&quot; was not ready to transport passengers, before the ship was assigned to its route during the first week of April 1990. However, the maritime authorities opted to keep quiet about this after the disaster, because it might have rendered the state of Denmark liable for damages. Berlau states that his source is the former management of the maritime authorities and that the maritime authorities postponed their statutory inspection by two weeks. The ship burned before the inspection was scheduled. The maritime authorities have since commented on Berlau&#x27;s information, stating that they have found no archival evidence to suggest that any employee had seen the ship or been in its presence.

On 9 May 2020, the documentary led to a majority of the Danish parliament voting to initiate a government hearing. Among the questions are: what is the status of the case, and what is being done to achieve closure?

<doc id="1037877" wikidata="Q742178" url="?curid=1037877" title="Jets to Brazil">
<text>Jets to Brazil was an American indie rock band from Brooklyn, New York, US. They formed in 1997 and were active until 2003.

==History==
Jets to Brazil was founded by Blake Schwarzenbach, the former frontman of Jawbreaker, and Jeremy Chatelain, previously the guitarist and vocalist of Handsome, when Schwarzenbach relocated to New York City after Jawbreaker&#x27;s disbanding. The two began working on four-track recordings aided by drum machines until former Texas Is the Reason drummer Chris Daly joined the band, and they signed to Jade Tree Records. The origin of the band&#x27;s name came from a suggestion by Daly, after seeing it on a poster in the 1961 film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Orange Rhyming Dictionary&quot;, was released on Jade Tree Records in 1998 to critical and commercial success, followed by extensive touring with bands like The Promise Ring. Their second album, &quot;Four Cornered Night&quot;, was released in 2000 to mainly positive reviews. &quot;Four Cornered Night&quot; was the first album to feature new guitarist Brian Maryansky, formerly of the band The Van Pelt. With Maryansky included in the band, this allowed Schwarzenbach to also become the keyboard player for the band. In 2002, Jets to Brazil released their third and final album, &quot;Perfecting Loneliness&quot;, to positive reviews.

By the fall of 2003, less than a year after the release of &quot;Perfecting Loneliness&quot;, the band broke up for unspecified reasons.

Schwarzenbach teaches English at Hunter College in New York City and is pursuing a PhD in English Literature. In October 2008, he started a new band, The Thorns of Life, but was short-lived and broke up in August 2009. Shortly afterwards, Schwarzenbach enlisted Against Me! drummer Kevin Mahon and bassist Caroline Paquita to form Forgetters who released an album and started their own record label, Too Small To Fail Records. In 2017, Schwarzenbach reunited with Jawbreaker.

Daly reunited with Texas Is The Reason for two shows at the Irving Plaza in New York City in November 2006 and a reunion tour from 2012 to 2013.

&quot;Sweet Avenue&quot;, the final track of &quot;Orange Rhyming Dictionary&quot;, has often been attributed to Damien Rice due to misattribution on peer-to-peer networks.

On March 25, 2019, during the Q&amp;A portion a screening of Jawbreaker&#x27;s documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Down&quot;, Schwarzenbach answered a fan question regarding a Jets To Brazil reunion to which he answered it may happen one day but his present main focus is on Jawbreaker.

<doc id="1037880" wikidata="Q1568920" url="?curid=1037880" title="Planum temporale">
<text>The planum temporale is the cortical area just posterior to the auditory cortex (Heschl&#x27;s gyrus) within the Sylvian fissure. It is a triangular region which forms the heart of Wernicke&#x27;s area, one of the most important functional areas for language. Original studies on this area found that the planum temporale was one of the most asymmetric regions in the brain, larger in the left cerebral hemisphere than the right.

==Location==
The planum temporale makes up the superior surface of the superior temporal gyrus to the parietal lobe. The posterior extent of the planum temporale has been variably defined, which has led to disputes to estimates of size and degree of asymmetry.

==Asymmetry==
The planum temporale shows a significant asymmetry. In 65% of all individuals the left planum temporale appears to be more developed, while the right planum temporale is more developed in only 11%. In some people’s brains, the planum temporale is more than five times larger on the left than on the right, making it the most asymmetrical structure in the brain. Evidence for this asymmetry has also been seen in great apes.

This greater size of the left planum temporale compared with the right is already present in the fetus, where it can be observed starting from the 31st week of gestation. This observation strengthens the hypothesis of a genetic predisposition for brain asymmetry, however the effect of fetal experience has not been ruled out. Leftward asymmetry, however, does not directly relate to asymmetry of language processing in all individuals.

In addition, more and more research is suggesting that the apparent asymmetries in this region are the result of old techniques and criteria used to identify the planum temporale. When new imaging is used that takes into account asymmetries in the curvatures of lateral fissures, the hemispheric asymmetries of the planum temporale become negligible. This newer imaging would indicate that the size of the region would not explain the higher faculties of language in the left hemisphere, but would instead require an analysis of the neural circuitry.

=== Gender based asymmetry ===
Imaging has repeatedly suggested gender marked differences in planum temporale surface area asymmetry. There have been multiple findings suggesting a greater leftward surface area asymmetry in male subjects, with no significant difference as mediated by gender of the right part of the planum temporale.

Recent evidence can be used to support the idea that differences between males and females in planum temporale asymmetry begin to develop and show early in development, potentially during prenatal stages. Gender based asymmetry may be the result of environmental factors occurring in-utero, such as levels of testosterone.

Certain studies have found differences within the planum temporale on a microscopic level, finding greater cell packing density in females, as well as a reduction of micro-structural asymmetry. Females have also been found to display asymmetry in grey matter volume.

Due to the novel nature of these findings, researchers have yet to discern how to interpret these sex-based differences on brain function.

== Functions ==
The planum temporale is a highly lateralized brain structure involved with language and with music. Although the planum temporale is found to have an asymmetry in the normal population, having a leftward bias in right-handed individuals, people who possess absolute pitch have an increased leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale. This is due to a smaller than average volume of the right planum temporale and not a larger than average volume of the left. The planum temporale may also play an important role in auditory processing with recent research suggesting that the region is responsible for representing the location of sounds in space.

There have also been many studies that show the asymmetry of the planum temporale to be related to handedness of subjects. There have been reports of decreased asymmetry displayed on the left side of the planum temporale in those that are dominantly left handed.

==Atypical development==
The planum temporale seems to be symmetrical in individuals with dyslexia, which may indicate that their low specialization in the left hemisphere is a cause of their disability. This symmetry also holds for people who stutter, although it is also possible to see a larger right planum temporale in stutters. It is thought that this bias for right hemisphere could be interrupting or impeding information flow between Wernickes and Broca&#x27;s, which are on the left hemisphere.

MRI studies have shown that the planum temporale in schizophrenics is more symmetrical. This reduced lateralization correlates with more severe positive symptoms, such as hallucinations, as measured by the PANSS.

Sexual dimorphism has shown to play an important role on planum temporale studies within schizophrenia. These findings have highlighted the relevance and importance of sex/gender as a plays a key role on PT in schizophrenia, underlying the importance of gender as a key component of brain morphology and the specialized brain structure and function for schizophrenia.

==Non-human brains ==
Although the brain area was thought to be unique to humans, almost like the anatomic version of the linguistic &quot;language organ&quot; of Noam Chomsky, it was shown to be similarly leftward asymmetric in chimpanzees and other great apes but not other primates, as was a related, rightward asymmetric, brain region the planum parietale that is implicated with dyslexia in humans. Monkeys show cellular asymmetry but not gross anatomic asymmetry of the planum temporale. (Brain Research, 2008).
The question still remains open; what are great apes or monkeys using this &quot;non-human primate language area&quot; for?

<doc id="1037882" wikidata="Q4843946" url="?curid=1037882" title="Stampede (The Doobie Brothers album)">
<text>Stampede is the fifth studio album by American rock band the Doobie Brothers. The album was released on April 25, 1975, by Warner Bros. Records. It was the final album by the band before Michael McDonald replaced Tom Johnston as lead vocalist and primary songwriter. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.

==Recording and content==
&quot;Stampede&quot; showed the bands diversifying elements of their sound more than ever before, combining elements of their old sound as well as country-rock, funk and folk music. Many guest musicians contributed on the album including Maria Muldaur, Ry Cooder and Curtis Mayfield.

This was the first album featuring Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter as a full-fledged member of the band, although he is absent from the cover photo. He had previously played on a couple of songs as a guest on the two previous albums and toured with the band prior to this one.

The first and most successful single released from this album was &quot;Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me)&quot; on April 23, 1975, a classic Motown tune written by the legendary songwriting trio of Holland-Dozier-Holland. Tom Johnston had wanted to record the song for several years. &quot;I thought that would be a killer track to cover,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s probably one of my favorite songs of all time. I thought our version came out great.&quot;

The next single, released on July 8, 1975, was &quot;Sweet Maxine&quot; which was more akin to the Doobie Brothers&#x27; earlier hits style-wise. &quot;Pat wrote the music to this and I wrote the words,&quot; Johnston recalled. &quot;And Billy Payne had a lot to do with the sound of the song, because of his incredible keyboard playing.&quot; The track stalled at #40 on the Billboard charts. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;after a barrelhouse piano intro, the boys zoom back into that familiar rockin&#x27; groove.&quot;

The third and final single was Patrick Simmons&#x27; &quot;I Cheat the Hangman&quot;, released November 12, 1975. It is a somber outlaw ballad that was inspired by the story &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; by Ambrose Bierce. &quot;It&#x27;s about a ghost returning to his home after the Civil War and not realizing he&#x27;s dead,&quot; said Simmons about the song. The album version of the song is a progressive rock-style composition ending in a twisted collage of strings, horns and synthesizers made to sound like ghostly wails. &quot;We&#x27;d cut the track, and we kicked around how to develop the ending—I thought about synthesizers and guitar solos. Ted [Templeman] got to thinking about it, and he ran it past [arranger] Nick DeCaro for some orchestration ideas. &#x27;Night on Bald Mountain&#x27; by Mussorgsky really inspired the wildness of the strings, and Nick came up with the chorale thing at the end.&quot; The ambitious &quot;I Cheat the Hangman&quot; only managed to reach #60 on the music charts. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said it was a &quot;rather lengthy piece quite unlike any previous single release from this super-group&quot; and &quot;a low-key ballad carried by a single, melodic voice against flowing guitar picking that grows into beautiful vocal harmony from the group, soon to segue into sustained orchestration holding a sweeping power chord under which some jazz improvisation goes on.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;the Doobies stretch out with a searing ballad that relies on a strong vocal harmony sound.&quot;

&quot;Neal&#x27;s Fandango&quot; was inspired by the Santa Cruz mountains and was an homage to Neal Cassady, Merry Prankster bus driver and former Jack Kerouac sidekick in &quot;On the Road&quot;. It was occasionally played on San Francisco Bay Area classic rock station KFOX &quot;K-FOX&quot; (that means KUFX) because of the Doobie Brothers&#x27; South Bay roots.

<doc id="1037884" wikidata="Q6508967" url="?curid=1037884" title="League for Social Reconstruction">
<text>The League for Social Reconstruction (LSR) was a circle of Canadian socialists officially formed in 1932. The group advocated for social and economic reformation as well as political education. The formation of the LSR was provoked by events such as the Great Depression and the completion of World War One as well as increased industrialization and urbanization.. The league esteemed &#x27;rational moralism&#x27; as the ideology that could be utilized and applied to prevent suffering in Canada. The league aimed to act as an independent supplementary force influencing public policy reform in Canada during this tumultuous period. Working with both intellectuals and politicians, the league assisted in the creation of centralized social welfare and national assistance schemes. The LSR disbanded formally in 1942 during the Second World War.

==Origins and ideology==

The Canadian economy had boomed during the late 1920s and showed no sign of weakness, but during the 1930s the Great Depression swept across Canada and provoked mass unemployment, and this incited the LSR into action. The LSR believed that the roots of the Depression were &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and governance and that the &quot;free&quot; market was anything but. Politicians worked closely with businesses, securing interest-free loans, developing tariffs, and managing labor disputes; in short: manipulating markets. A small group of political businessmen controlled public policy and economic development and guided the centralization of finance and power into private hands. Widespread unemployment marked the Depression and served to underscore financial inequity. In the eyes of the LSR, the problem facing Canada was not an economic depression, it was a corrupt political economy.

Faced with what they believed to be profiteering politicians, a group of men and women were united in their resolve that this could not stand. Three key influences stood out among the members of this group: religious affiliation, maturation in an environment of war and urbanization, and intellectual cultivation in the university environment. These characteristics defined the group&#x27;s ideals.

Believing the existing system was not practicable, the league set about promoting a new system. The solution to ending this and all depressions would be a planned economy, and the transformation of Canada from a royal commonwealth into a socialist commonwealth. To achieve this transformation, the league planned to perform research, and apply the results toward public education and public policy. However, because the LSR believed that the system was not only corrupt but corruptive, the league planned to lay its foundations beyond politics. Public education would take the form of books and lectures, and influence over policy would be achieved through the institutionalization of expert intellectuals. Politicians would call upon the league&#x27;s extra-political organization to perform research, and recommend policy. In this way, the league hoped to minimize partisanship, and influence government policy writ large. Even so, the ideals of the LSR found them working closest with one political party, in particular, the avowedly socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

==Political economy and the Great Depression==

The Great Depression resulted in a protracted period of mass unemployment, and it was the impact unemployment had on Canadians that motivated the LSR into action. National unemployment peaked in the first half of 1933 at 32 percent; but 32 percent was only the average, in some towns unemployment reached nearly 50 percent. The LSR were roused, as they faced the ravages of unemployment in their classrooms, churches, and offices; &quot;Everywhere hopelessness. A country without a purpose ... An industrious and intelligent people going to waste in idleness and despair.&quot;

For the LSR, the Depression was the inexorable result of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; philosophy. This philosophy had spread since the Act of Union in 1840, which began a transition from power structures that favored aristocracy to structures that favored business. The responsible government arrived shortly after the union and shifted influence from the governor to ministers. Powers that had previously been focused on the governor, became divided among ministers. No meaningful administrative structures were implemented to ensure that ministers remained responsive to the public, and ministers aligned themselves with capitalists. Free market governance became the consort of free-market capitalization. Legislation regulating conflicts of interest did not exist, and politicians worked openly with business. One former prime minister made the marriage of business with politics strikingly clear when he stated &quot;my politics are railroads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian/Campbell p.79&quot;&gt;Christian &amp; Campbell (1983), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The developmental history of Canada&#x27;s political economy was central in the analysis of the LSR, and they later observed that &quot;[m]onopolies are not an unlucky accident in our economic system, they are our economic system.&quot;

Previous economic fluctuations had not created the need for federal unemployment programs, and policy and tradition dictated that assistance was a local issue, because traditionally it had been locally tractable. Under the British North America Act of 1867 (BNA), the government received most revenue collection powers, and provinces became responsible for social relief, education, and health care. However, 60 years had passed since the BNA, and this was a different economy. The National Policy dramatically increased prairie populations, and when Depression hit, the prairies, in particular, could not manage social relief, and, along with other provinces, asked for federal aid. Federal politicians believed free markets would rebalance themselves, and refused assistance. Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King refused to attempt relief, claiming it would endanger the national budget. Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett declared that provinces should reduce wasteful spending. &quot;Laissez-faire&quot; ideology underpinned the policies of Liberals and Conservatives alike. Provinces became disgruntled, relationships with Ottawa became strained, and so it was that the crisis of capitalism triggered a crisis of federalism. &quot;Here was the proof that the [political economy] built by the businessman and the old party politician was defective. The men who had presided over the construction of a complex modern civilization apparently did not know how to keep it running smoothly.&quot;

==Moralism, intellectualism, and elitism: foundations of the LSR==

In November 1930, the problems of political economy were the focus of discussion for a group of &quot;radically minded [professors]&quot;, organized by the University of Toronto historian Frank Underhill. At the same time in Montreal, the legal scholar F. R. Scott was preparing a book examining the same problems. In August 1931, the two men met and discovered they had developed a similar analysis; instability and depression were born of a capitalistic political economy, and any permanent solution would be born of democratic socialism. Underhill proposed the formation of a research organization, styled after the British Fabians, modified to suit Canada. The organization&#x27;s ideas would be spread in two ways; directly into the public mind through local associations and literature, and directly into government through an institution of intellectual elites that politicians could requisition to perform research and recommend policy. Scott agreed. Underhill also believed a socialist political party would shortly appear, and that there &quot;should be a group of intellectuals that could provide the new party with a coherent platform.&quot; The men returned home, and Underhill established a group in Toronto while Scott did the same in Montreal.

These groups shared one important belief; that the objective study of social science yielded an inescapable conclusion: scientific socialism. Theirs was a scholarly disposition, and shared intellectualism aroused an elitist camaraderie. Educational distinction provided the group with a sense they were distinguished from the public and public servants; that amongst all reformists, they alone possessed the expertise necessary to develop corrective policies. The result was a highly principled and elitist political reformism, however, this reformism was not solely rationalistic in origin.

The twin inclinations of intellectual solidarity and moral solidarity motivated these academics. They were endowed not only with higher education, but also a belief in a higher purpose. Moralism was important to the group and had been engendered through lifelong religious association. Though not all members remained religious in adulthood, most had been influenced by religion since their youth. A partial survey of the league&#x27;s leading members reveals the following; Frank Underhill: Flavelle scholar, raised a Presbyterian; F. R. Scott: Rhodes scholar, son of an archdeacon; Eugene Forsey: Rhodes scholar, son of a Methodist clergyman; Eric A. Havelock: respected economist, Christian Socialist; David Lewis: Rhodes scholar, a secular Jew, but deeply influenced by the Social Gospel and the Jewish Labour Movement. Artists who were among its early members included Jean Palardy and Jori Smith, both of Montreal.

Three important commonalities stood out among the LSR&#x27;s founding members. Religion imbued an indelible morality; war and urbanization prompted sober reflection on suffering and reform, and modern education in the social sciences produced a propensity for rational analysis and a deterministic bent.

Scott and Underhill&#x27;s groups exchanged drafts for a manifesto, attempting to strike a balance between pragmatism and radicalism. Their goal was to motivate all Canadians to critically examine Canada&#x27;s political economy, and because the group did not want radicalism scaring potential members away, they opted to avoid the inclusion of the one word that best explained their politics: &quot;socialism&quot;. Drafts were exchanged for many months, and eventually, a meeting was scheduled in Toronto, for February 23, 1932. Seventy-five men and women attended the meeting, ratified the manifesto, and discussed the selection of a name. The Montreal group suggested the &quot;League for Economic Democracy&quot;, however, the winning moniker came from the Torontonians, and when proceedings concluded the League for Social Reconstruction was born.

==Social planning: the CCF and the Royal Commission==

Later in 1932, the socialist party Underhill predicted materialized as the CCF. The CCF were social democrats and held the same ideas as the LSR regarding state theory, and hence the CCF was the LSR&#x27;s best option for access to parliament. The CCF was also the best option for another reason: J. S. Woodsworth, honorary president of the LSR, was also the leader of the CCF. Because the LSR had been established outside the political system, the question was how to structure the relationship between the league and the CCF on the stated goal of education, and it was not clear they would stay if the LSR became the organ of a political party. Woodsworth proposed a solution for members of the LSR who desired affiliation; CCF Clubs. Club membership brought affiliation, and LSR members could thus affiliate with the CCF independently of affiliation with the LSR. The LSR was thus able to move forward as an independent research organization.

To promote and improve their ideas, the league discussed political economy with intellectuals and politicians across the nation. The LSR believed that because the Depression was national, its solution would be national as well, and they found sympathetic analyses amongst the intellectual community. Intellectuals concerned with social reform began to contemplate national reform. Common ground between the LSR and intellectual elites provided a program for action. Intellectuals felt that they needed to convince Canadians that government should assume an interventionist role; financial and social policies should be implemented at the national level, and stability would flow top downwards. Such an arrangement was not however possible under the BNA, and accordingly, the constitution would require modification.

By the mid-1930s, many modern intellectuals found work in government, and political bodies began to seek advice from extra-parliamentary intellectuals. In 1935, extra-political intellectual elites were included in a national conference on Dominion-provincial relations, however, the conference&#x27;s primary purpose was to stop the flow of federal money to provinces, which was not what intellectuals had in mind. The initiatives put into place after the conference proved unproductive, and the movement was transmuted into the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations. The Commission was placed under the control of modern social scientists, including LSR member Frank Scott, and was instructed to provide recommendations for securing the economy and the federation. In 1940, the Commission reported that the Depression resulted from problems in the definition of the Canadian Dominion; the BNA had developed in the context of a wheat-timber-fish economy, and could not support Canada&#x27;s mixed industrializing economy. Industrial growth had increased the complication of economic activity, but the political system had not made corresponding advancements. To solve the Depression, the taxation powers and fiscal responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments required readjustment. The government should control all unemployment insurance programs, assume all provincial debts, collect all income taxes, and make equalization payments to needy provinces.

Premiers met the Prime Minister in 1941 to discuss the recommendations, and with war raging in Europe, the Premiers agreed to the Commission&#x27;s proposals. After the war, Prime Minister King was eager to preserve the government&#x27;s new powers, and a separate agreement was reached with the provinces, making the Commission&#x27;s recommendations into a permanent policy. Politicians of all stripes were eager to mitigate against the economic and social problems experienced after World War One, and acceded to the implementation of central planning measures. Reflecting on the Commission, historian Doug Owram noted that the report &quot;was not so much the product of the public hearings as ... of the intellectual network of the 1930s... Indeed, the results of the study had been conceived even before its appointment.&quot; The report itself became a vehicle for sharing data in such a fashion that it supported the conclusions of the intellectuals who wrote it, with an eye towards converting its readers into advocates of centralization.

The ideas of the LSR proved instrumental in introducing successful social planning measures into government, however disenchantment with socialism had grown as World War Two approached, and the LSR itself was reduced to the point of dissolution. With CCF related activities expanding, the league finally disbanded in 1942. In the mid-1940s two members of the LSR held prominent positions within the CCF: Frank Scott became the National Chairman, and Professor George M. A. Grube became the president of the Ontario CCF.

==Publications==

The LSR made its views known through the magazine &quot;New Commonwealth&quot; (formerly the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot;, publication of the United Farmers of Ontario until purchased by Graham Spry). The group further contributed to Canada&#x27;s political and intellectual fields with two books, &quot;Social Planning for Canada&quot; (1935) and &quot;Democracy Needs Socialism&quot; (1938). &quot;Canadian Forum&quot; was saved from bankruptcy by the LSR, which was acquired in the journal in 1936 and continued its publication. With these texts, social and economic change policies were popularized.

<doc id="1037893" wikidata="Q1474525" url="?curid=1037893" title="Tuxedomoon">
<text>Tuxedomoon is an experimental, post-punk, new wave band from San Francisco, California, United States. The band formed in the late 1970s at the beginning of the punk rock movement. Pulling influence from punk and electronic music, the group, originally consisting of Steven Brown (born Steven Allan Brown on August 23, 1952, in Chicago, Illinois) and Blaine L. Reininger, used electronic violins, guitars, screaming vocals and synthesizers to develop a unique &quot;cabaret no-wave&quot; sound. Bassist Peter Principle (Peter Dachert, 1954–2017) joined the band and in 1979 they released the single &quot;No Tears&quot;, which remains a post-punk cult classic. That year they also signed to Ralph Records and released their debut album, &quot;Half-Mute&quot;, in 1980. Eventually, Reininger left the group, and Tuxedomoon relocated to Europe, signing to Crammed Discs and releasing &quot;Holy Wars&quot; in 1985. The band separated in the early 1990s, only to reunite later that decade. They all have remained together since releasing the album &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; in 2004.

==History==

In 1977, Tuxedomoon formed out of The Angels of Light, an artist collective and commune, a group in which Steven Brown was involved. He met Blaine L. Reininger in an electronic music class at San Francisco City College. Brown worked with Tommy Tadlock, of the Angels of Light, to create the final project of the class. Tadlock would go on to be Tuxedomoon&#x27;s manager. Reininger and Brown started playing music together at Tadlock&#x27;s house. Reininger played electronic violin and guitar. Tadlock assisted with the sound and audio. He also created tools for the band, including a &quot;Treatment Mountain&quot; a pyramid made of plywood, which held all of Reininger&#x27;s effects pedals.

They started playing music together in the mid-1970s, when punk rock was popular in the underground music scene. &quot;The only rule was the tacit understanding that anything that sounded like anyone else was taboo&quot;, stated Brown on the band aiming to create music that sounded unlike anything else before. The vocals were screaming and inspired by punk rock, and the band used any instruments they had around, including saxophone, violin and a polymoog synthesizer. The band had no drummer. Bassist Peter Principle, performance artist Winston Tong and Bruce Geduldig, a filmmaker, joined the band during concerts. The band created new performances for each concert, creating theatrical performances and being described as &quot;theatrical electronic cabaret&quot;. The band performed frequently with Pere Ubu, The Residents, Devo, and Cabaret Voltaire.

In 1979 they released the EP &quot;No Tears&quot; with the single &quot;No Tears&quot;. The title track is described as &quot;one of the best electro-punk hymns of all times&quot;. That year they also signed to Ralph Records and released their debut album, &quot;Half-Mute&quot;, in 1980.

==Career==

===1980s===

In 1980 the band released their first album, &quot;Half-Mute&quot;, on Ralph Records. The band toured Europe in 1980 and moved to New York City. While in New York, they performed in, and were featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Downtown 81&quot;. They gained popularity in the Netherlands and Belgium. They eventually relocated to Brussels. after spending some months in Rotterdam, playing in Arena, Hal 4 and returned in 1988 to Lantaren/Venster, where they contributed to the Bob Visser movie &quot;Plan Delta&quot;. Trumpet player Luc van Lieshout joined the band, followed shortly after by Ivan Georgiev. In 1987, the band performed on the soundtrack for the Wim Wenders film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. Tuxedomoon played in Athens, Greece, for the first time in December 1987, selling out the Pallas Theatre twice in one night.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, the band separated and did not reunite for approximately eight years. Tuxedomoon reunited to perform at the Next Festival in Tel Aviv. The band had not played together in eight years, when Brown called the members to come together for the concert. They rehearsed in a studio for 10 days, in Tel Aviv, before the concert. Brown credits the Next Festival concert as being the key event in reuniting the band.

===2000s===

Tuxedomoon performed in 2000, playing acoustic and electronic concerts of previously recorded material.

Their 2004 album &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; would serve as their comeback record. The majority of the record is instrumental. Reininger&#x27;s voice, which was compared to David Bowie&#x27;s during Tuxedomoon&#x27;s early career, has been described as evolving into &quot;Tom Waits&quot; and a wolf from Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Baron Brown&quot;, by music critic Rod Smith. Filmmaker Bruce Geduldig performs backup vocals on the album.

In 2006 the band released &quot;Bardo Hotel&quot; on Crammed Discs. Recorded in San Francisco, the album is a soundtrack to a film by George Kakanakis, which at the time of the album&#x27;s release, remained unfinished. The album and film are named after the book &quot;Beat Museum – Bardo Hotel&quot; by Brion Gysin, which is named after the Bardo Hotel in Paris. The soundtrack and film pulled influence from Gysin&#x27;s &quot;cut-up&quot; method, which was co-developed with William S. Burroughs. The recording features samples of airplane sounds, BART announcements and other found sounds. New Orleans jazz and opera are two influences for the album&#x27;s sound.

Tuxedomoon released the album &quot;Vapour Trails&quot; on Crammed Discs in 2007. The album was recorded at Reininger&#x27;s home. The band uses instruments like clarinets and flugelhorns along with their standard instrument setup. In 2007, they also released a CD and DVD boxset of unreleased and rare music and videos.

===2010s===

Various Tuxedomoon members have extensively collaborated with the UK band Cult With No Name, and as a group Tuxedomoon collaborated to produce the joint soundtrack album &quot;Blue Velvet Revisited,&quot; (the documentary of which will appear as a feature on the Criterion Collection&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray Special Edition of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;). Members have also joined the FuturePlaces medialab for citizenship in 2010, 2011 and 2013, their participation documented in Bandcamp audio releases.

&quot;The Box&quot;, a 10-vinyl boxed set containing 9 of Tuxedomoon&#x27;s major albums, as well as an album of previously unreleased material, came out in November 2015.

Geduldig (born Bruce Frederick Geduldig on March 7, 1953, in California) died on March 7, 2016, in Sacramento, California, he was 63 years old. David Haneke took over Geduldig&#x27;s duties in Tuxedomoon for their 2016 tour.

Peter Principle died on July 17, 2017, at the age of 62, in Brussels. (Obituaries incorrectly stated his age as 63.)

==Legacy==

The band Factrix called Tuxedomoon mentors.

Scooter&#x27;s &quot;My Eyes Are Dry&quot; from their album &quot;Mind The Gap&quot; is a cover version of &quot;No Tears&quot; with additional sections.

==Musical style==

Steven Brown cites the band&#x27;s early influences as &quot;Eno, Bowie, John Cage, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota, Igor Stravinsky and Ennio Morricone&quot;. Later and current influences include Radiohead, Claude Debussy, Miles Davis, Michael Nyman and the Velvet Underground. Their music finds influence in genres such as punk rock, jazz, funk, chamber music, tango, and post-punk.

Music critic Simon Reynolds wrote that their sound has an &quot;aura of jaded elegance&quot;, with a more European style musically versus what their American counterparts were creating at the time of the band&#x27;s formation. &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; described their music as radiating &quot;a discomfort that hints of existential hives.&quot;

Lyrically, Tuxedomoon examined society, culture and psychology. &quot;Holiday for Plywood&quot;, on &quot;Desire&quot;, examined consumerism and paranoia.

<text>The MLS supplemental draft had a number of incarnations in US soccer:

From 1996 to 1999, all players playing in the United States playing professionally in the United Soccer Leagues were eligible for the MLS Supplemental Draft, where they could be selected by all Major League Soccer teams. Players graduating college were entered into a separate MLS College Draft. The division between the two was eliminated in 2000, when they were combined into a single MLS SuperDraft.

*1996 MLS supplemental draft

*1998 MLS supplemental draft
*1999 MLS supplemental draft

In 2003, MLS held a Supplemental draft to distribute players who were signed by the league after the SuperDraft.

*2003 MLS supplemental draft

From 2005 to 2008, with the expansion of developmental rosters, the creation of reserve teams, and contractual limits on the length of the MLS Superdraft included in the MLS Players Union Contract, MLS re-instituted the Supplemental draft, which was held after the SuperDraft those years.

*2005 MLS supplemental draft
*2006 MLS supplemental draft
*2007 MLS supplemental draft
*2008 MLS supplemental draft

In 2009 and 2010, due to roster changes resulting in fewer developmental spaces, MLS again discontinued the Supplemental Draft.

In January 2011, it was announced that the Supplemental Draft would be re-instated. The first two rounds of the Supplemental Draft replaced the last two rounds of the SuperDraft.

<doc id="1037904" wikidata="Q624488" url="?curid=1037904" title="Lycopodium">
<text>Lycopodium (from Ancient Greek &quot;lykos&quot;, wolf and &quot;podion&quot;, diminutive of &quot;pous&quot;, foot) is a genus of clubmosses, also known as ground pines or creeping cedars, in the family Lycopodiaceae. Two very different circumscriptions of the genus are in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), &quot;Lycopodium&quot; is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and has from nine to 15 species. In other classifications, the genus is equivalent to the whole of the subfamily, since it includes all of the other genera. More than 40 species are accepted.

==Description==

They are flowerless, vascular, terrestrial or epiphytic plants, with widely branched, erect, prostrate, or creeping stems, with small, simple, needle-like or scale-like leaves that cover the stem and branches thickly. The stems usually creep along the ground, forking at intervals. The leaves contain a single, unbranched vascular strand, and are microphylls by definition. They are usually arranged in spirals. The kidney-shaped (reniform) spore-cases (sporangia) contain spores of one kind only, (isosporous, homosporous), and are borne on the upper surface of the leaf blade of specialized leaves (sporophylls) arranged in a cone-like strobilus at the end of upright stems. Each sporangium contains numerous small spores. The club-shaped appearance of these fertile stems gives the clubmosses their common name.

Lycopods reproduce asexually by spores. The plants have an underground sexual phase that produces gametes, and this alternates in the lifecycle with the spore-producing plant. The prothallium developed from the spore is a subterranean mass of tissue of considerable size, and bears both the male and female organs (antheridia and archegonia). They are more commonly distributed vegetatively, though, through above- or below-ground rhizomes.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lycopodium&quot; was first published by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. He placed it in the Musci (mosses) along with genera such as &quot;Sphagnum&quot;, and included species such as &quot;Lycopodium selaginoides&quot;, now placed in the genus &quot;Selaginella&quot; in a different order from &quot;Lycopodium&quot;. Different sources use substantially different circumscriptions of the genus. Traditionally, &quot;Lycopodium&quot; was considered to be the only extant genus in the family Lycopodiaceae, so includes all the species in the family, although sometimes excluding one placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Phylloglossum&quot;. Other sources divide Lycopodiaceae species into three broadly defined genera, &quot;Lycopodium&quot;, &quot;Huperzia&quot; (including &quot;Phylloglossum&quot;) and &quot;Lycopodiella&quot;. In this approach, &quot;Lycopodium&quot; sensu lato has about 40 species. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the broadly defined genus is equivalent to the subfamily Lycopodioideae, and &quot;Lycopodium&quot; is one of 16 genera in the family Lycopodiaceae, with between 9 and 15 species.

===Species===

Using the narrow circumscription of &quot;Lycopodium&quot;, in which it is one of nine genera in the subfamily Lycopodioideae, the &quot;Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World&quot; recognized the following species :
*&quot;Lycopodium clavatum&quot; – stag&#x27;s-horn clubmoss; subcosmopolitan
*&quot;Lycopodium diaphanum&quot; – Tristan da Cunha
*&quot;Lycopodium japonicum&quot; – eastern Asia (Japan west and south to India and Sri Lanka)
*&quot;Lycopodium lagopus&quot; – circumpolar arctic and subarctic
*&quot;Lycopodium papuanum&quot; – New Guinea
*&quot;Lycopodium venustulum&quot; – Hawaii, Western Samoa, the Society Islands
*&quot;Lycopodium vestitum&quot; – northwest South America (Andes)

==Uses==
The spores of &quot;Lycopodium&quot; species are harvested and are sold as lycopodium powder.

&quot;Lycopodium &quot; sp. herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea or externally as compresses for treatment of disorders of the locomotor system, skin, liver and bile, kidneys and urinary tract, infections, rheumatism, and gout, though claims of efficacy are unproven. It has also been used in some United States government chemical warfare test programs such as Operation Dew. &quot;Lycopodium&quot; powder was also used to determine the molecular size of oleic acid.

<text>The Brooks Institute was a private for-profit art school in Ventura, California. It was formerly the Brooks Institute of Photography and was originally based in Montecito and Santa Barbara. Brooks Institute offered four majors and two graduate programs. The college was last owned by Gphomestay. The college consolidated and moved operations from Santa Barbara to the Ventura Campus before autumn 2015.

The college abruptly announced it was closing on August 12, 2016. The last term was the summer 2016 semester. Enrollment had declined by 90% to 250 students, completion rates ranged from 3% to 40% by program, and there was controversy surrounding advertising using inflated job placement rates, unusual loan policies, and surprise fees.

==History==

===Brooks family===
Brooks Institute of Photography was founded in 1945 by Ernest H. Brooks Sr. over a bakery on State Street in Santa Barbara, California. The school&#x27;s first photography students were primarily World War II veterans supported by the G.I. Bill.

In 1952, the Brooks family purchased the former David Gray estate &#x27;Graholm&#x27; after the owner at that time, Herschel McGraw, died. Ernest purchased the property for $61,000. The property was located on Alston Road in Montecito, a community adjacent to Santa Barbara. This served as the home of Brooks Institute of Photography, as well as for Ernest H. Brooks, Sr.&#x27;s growing family.

Ernest H. Brooks Sr. stayed on as president of the school until 1971, when he became board chairperson. He died in 1990. His personal passion for underwater photography inspired the underwater still photography and video courses that started in the late 1960s, and continued until the school closed.

At the time of his retirement as president, his son, Ernest H. Brooks, Jr. &#x27;stepped into his father&#x27;s shoes&#x27; and served as the school&#x27;s president from 1971 until 1999. He continued to expand the Brooks Institute of Photography facilities.

In 1976 Brooks purchased the former Jefferson School in the Riviera neighborhood of Santa Barbara, that had been slated for demolition, and opened the Brooks Jefferson Campus.

Brooks Institute has been involved in many extraordinary projects in recent years, but this forward vision and involvement was happening even in the 1980s when the institute was permitted to photograph the Shroud of Turin. Professor Vernon Miller, then head of the Industrial/Scientific program, led a team of photographers as they photographed the cloth for documentation and study.

===Career Education Corporation ownership===
In 1999 the Brooks Institute of Photography was sold by Ernest H. Brooks Jr. to Career Education Corporation (CEC), a for-profit higher education corporation. CEC expanded the school. That included the acquisition of an former movie production studio in Ventura in 2002, from which to base the school&#x27;s motion picture program, later becoming the Ventura Campus for consolidating the entire school.

In 2007, the school changed its name to the Brooks Institute, from the Brooks Institute of Photography.

In 2011, Brooks Institute moved its programs and offices located on the Brooks Jefferson Campus in Santa Barbara to the new Ventura Campus. In 2014 it moved the programs, library, and offices at the Mason Street Campus (Santa Barbara) to the Cota Street Campus in Downtown Santa Barbara, before the final move to the Ventura Campus.

====Campus consolidation====
In 2013 Brooks announced its consolidation of all its educational programs to the Ventura Campus, and departure from Santa Barbara planned for 2015. From the Cota Street Campus in Santa Barbara, it moved its Professional Photography baccalaureate program in Autumn 2013 and MFA in Photography in Autumn 2014 to its now solo Ventura Campus, where the other baccalaureate programs in Film, Graphic Design, and Visual Journalism were already located.

===Gphomestay ownership===
In June 2015 the Brooks Institute was sold by CEC to Gphomestay—Massachusetts Homestay Company, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based company that specializes in finding homes for international students studying abroad in the United States. In July Gphomestay announced Edward Clift as president, and Victoria Liptak as provost of Brooks. In August 2016, Edward Clift was dismissed as president and a majority of the board of directors resigned. On August 12, 2016, Brooks Institute announced it was closing and canceled the Fall 2016 semester.

==Campus and student life==
Brooks Institute completed consolidating all its visual arts education programs and facilities for new students onto one campus in the Autumn of 2014, the Ventura Campus, located on North Ventura Avenue in the city of Ventura. The Professional Photography Program and MFA, Visual Journalism, Film and Video Production, Business Administration and Graphic Design programs&#x27; classes shared the single campus, &quot;providing cross-platform opportunities in one location.&quot; The Brooks Library was on the campus, containing thousands of books, journals, and other publications and media.

Brooks Institute had a research vessel, &#x27;Just Love,&#x27; on which Ernest H. Brooks II led a photographic research and travel expedition to the Sea of Cortez in 1986.

Brooks Institute had two public art galleries that display student, faculty, alumni, and guest photographer work: the Gallery 27 at the former Cota Street Campus in Santa Barbara; and the Visions Gallery in Ventura, operated in conjunction with the Marriott Ventura Beach.

===Ventura Campus===
The Ventura campus housed faculty and administrative offices and offers serviced such as counseling, financial aid, academic affairs, admissions, accounting, career services and the library.
;Film
Before Brooks Institute acquired the Ventura Campus and renovated its buildings for the school, the property was used by &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; movie production companies to shoot motion pictures. The Ventura Campus contained professional sound stages, a screening room, digital video editing studios, a post-production facility, and a movie backlot with an outdoor movie set.

Scenes from both &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Cast Away&quot; were shot on there. In 2010 &quot;The Mexican Village&quot; movie set was used for filming the feature film &quot;Without Men&quot;, directed by Gabriela Tagliavini.

====Visual Journalism Program====
The Visual Journalism Program had a documentary-focused class. This was a class-based program that all Brooks undergraduates can participate in. The documentary class took students all over the world to document various cultures. Students spent a scholastic session (approximately 2 months) in another country and return to California to edit a multimedia presentation. The documentary class took students to many countries, including: Ireland, India, Mexico, Cuba, West Africa, Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Australia, Argentina, China and Chile.

==Accreditation==
Brooks was nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools which offered accreditation to mostly vocational schools.

Up until the mid-1980s, Brooks Institute was the only national level university program regionally accredited to offer a full Bachelor of Arts degree in photographic sciences, underwritten by WASC. But because of financial reporting irregularities discovered during its reaccreditation cycle, Brooks lost its standing with WASC and sought accreditation through other oversight bodies. Ernest Brooks II, president of the institute and son of founder Ernest Brooks, eventually lost control of the institute and surrendered his role as president shortly thereafter.

In August 2008, Brooks Institute successfully completed &quot;Eligibility,&quot; the first step to receiving regional accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). This application process takes several years and is not a guarantee that the school will ever receive regional accreditation. As of Autumn 2015 Brooks was still without regional accreditation.

==Controversy==
In July 2005, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) accused the Brooks Institute of Photography and its then parent corporation Career Education Corporation of persuading prospective students to enroll by &quot;willfully misleading&quot; them, and &quot;falsifying and omitting critical information.&quot; Brooks was given only a conditional approval to operate for the next two years with a hearing scheduled for February 2006, and ordered to provide &quot;equitable restitution&quot; to students going back to 1999. However, Brooks appealed the decision and at the hearing the judge determining that BPPVE had not complied with the mandatory provisions of the Education Code, and that it had wrongly denied Brooks Institute an opportunity to contest the Bureau&#x27;s action prior to the time it was imposed. The California Department of Consumer Affairs (which oversees BPPVE) later reached the same conclusion. Although Brooks ultimately received unconditional renewal of its license, it settled with a class action lawsuit for $12,250,000.

===Restructuring===
In November 2008, Brooks laid off five faculty members and 12 staff members as part of a restructuring. The school reports that its enrollment dropped from 2,300 in 2004 to 1,200 in 2008. The restructuring was in addition to the faculty who had been &#x27;seemingly dismissed&#x27; in recent years. Together these created tensions at Brooks Institute going back to January 2007.

In 2015 Gphomestay purchased the Brooks Institute from Career Education Corporation, and appointed new leadership.

<doc id="1037913" wikidata="Q856862" url="?curid=1037913" title="Dodger blue">
<text>Dodger blue is a rich bright tone of the color azure named for its use in the uniform of the Los Angeles Dodgers. It is also a web color used in the design of web pages. The web color is not used in the Dodgers&#x27; uniform but it rather resembles the lighter blue used throughout Dodger Stadium.

==History==
The Dodgers were never referred to as wearing Dodger Blue during their time in Brooklyn, although some now refer to them as representing &quot;True Dodger Blue.&quot; The concept originated by Tommy Lasorda who popularized it with his saying &quot;Cut me and I&#x27;ll bleed Dodger blue.&quot; Lasorda managed the franchise in Los Angeles for 20 years from 1977 to 1996, and was on the player roster of the Brooklyn Dodgers, though he played for them only very briefly.

In 1989, the team&#x27;s famous Dodger blue was added to a color database. Paul Raveling, a software engineer who in 1989 was working at the Information Sciences Institute at USC, had been “tuning” colors to be properly displayed on computer monitors. He proposed a major update to the list of color names that were supported by the X11 user interface system, including one called “dodgerblue.” Eventually, that list of colors would be incorporated into web browsers, which allow programmers writing HTML or CSS to type a color name instead of a code.

===Uniform color===

The actual blue that the Dodgers currently wear is RGB-hex #005A9C. Regarding the web color&#x27;s RGB values, Paul Raveling notes that &quot;The color tuning was done on HP monitors and the colors turned out very good then. The catch is that since then, monitors seemed to have standardized on different gamma corrections.&quot; The current standard RGB color space was defined in 1996, seven years after “dodgerblue.”

==Plot==

&quot;Samurai 7&quot; tells the story of a village named Kanna. Set in a futuristic world that has just witnessed the end of a massive war, scores of villages are terrorized by Nobuseri bandits. But the Nobuseri are no normal bandits. They were once samurai, who during the war integrated their living cells with machines to become dangerous weapons now appearing more machine than man. Absolute power corrupts, and their reign of terror is increasing its hold on the countryside.

The elder of Kanna Village has decided that to protect the village they must hire samurai to fight against the bandits. However, the village has no money and thus must find samurai willing to protect the village for a payment of rice. Three members of the village leave to attempt to recruit samurai. They travel to the city and search for samurai willing to work, and after finding several samurai and having a few encounters with the local government, they return to Kanna village to prepare defenses against the bandits.

The samurai train the villagers in the use of bows, building walls, and construct a giant ballista to defend the village against the bandits. After successfully defeating the bandits, the samurai then launch an attack upon the capital to defeat a power-hungry ruler who has recently risen to power as Emperor. After heavy casualties for the samurai, and the near-destruction of Kanna village, the capital is finally defeated.

==Characters==
===Samurai===
: 
:: Kanbei is a wise samurai who has survived many battles, though he feels no joy from them. Many of his friends have died in those battles, and he was on the losing side of many of them. He constantly lives in the shadow of his painful and violent past, rejecting Kirara after stating that his heart is dried up. He leads the group during their battles and usually plans strategy. In the end, after understanding Katsushiro has become a successful samurai, he passes his sword onto him as he leaves Kanna village ahead of him and Shichirouji. He is the first samurai.
: 
:: Katsushiro is a young and inexperienced samurai who wishes to be Kanbei&#x27;s student, calling him sensei almost from their first meeting. He idolizes the principles of bushido. He promises to protect Kirara no matter what, and seems to be attracted to her. He grows stronger and more skillful throughout the series, eventually becoming a worthy student of Kanbei; and he also comes to terms with killing enemies, after reacting in shock the first time. He becomes strong enough to deflect the capital&#x27;s main cannon, and defeated numerous bandits in his own right. He gains emotional strength as well, and understands what his true reason for becoming a samurai is. After turning down Kirara in the end, he explains to her that he intends to continue his life on the battlefield. After hearing this, he receives Kanbei&#x27;s sword from him in recognition as his student. Unlike in the original movie, he shows more focus on becoming a samurai and improving his skills greatly in the anime (where in the original he was preoccupied with a love affair). He is the fifth samurai.
: 
:: Gorobei is a skilled samurai who has made his living since the wars&#x27; end by entertaining people on the city streets. He is also a veteran of the Great War, so he knows Kanbei by reputation. He is very skilled at dodging blows and can pluck arrows and darts from the air. This ability was presumably based on the fact that in the original movie, Gorobei was able to sense (from a few feet outside the door) Katsushiro&#x27;s waiting to hit him inside the hut. He often makes light of rather serious or dangerous situations. He is also quite smart, in his own unique way. He also appears to have a paraphilia with inflicted injury as it reminds him of battle. He is the second samurai, he was also the first samurai to die in the anime, and guided Katsushiro to go back to Kanna Village in spirit form.
: 
:: Shichiroji initially fought side by side in the Great War with Kanbei, and is often referred to as &quot;Kanbei&#x27;s old wife&quot; (&quot;mate&quot; in the English dub). He temporarily leaves behind his successful post-war business at the Firefly Inn, and with it, his beautiful girlfriend/fiance, to join Kanbei in battle once again. He has a prosthetic left hand which has a grappling hook capability with his index finger. In combat he uses a type of spear; the only samurai not using a sword. This is probably a reference to his using a spear mainly during the final battle in the original movie (though normally he carried a sword). His girlfriend, Yukino, has nicknamed him Momotarō, from the traditional Japanese tale, because she found him, badly injured after a battle, floating down a river inside a capsule reminiscent of a peach. He is the fourth samurai.
: 
:: Kikuchiyo is a cyborg with a mechanized exoskeleton. He was originally a peasant until becoming a samurai in order to help others. He is often looked upon as a clown or a bother, as he gets angry easily and often causes trouble with his loud noise and clumsy ways. He is accepted as the seventh samurai after revealing he was also a farmer, like the peasants of Kanna. He carries the largest of the swords, which also acts as a chainsaw. He is fiercely loyal to Kanbei, and, when given recognition, he returns favors fourfold. He is well-liked by the villagers, especially by little Komachi, who asks him to become her husband when she grows up, a request that he accepts in return for her keeping his fake family tree. He died from an explosion when stopping the crashing capital from destroying Kanna village using one of the Bandit&#x27;s giant swords. He is the seventh and final samurai.
: 
:: Heihachi is a genial samurai who wishes to avoid fighting as much as possible and prefers to eat rice instead. During the Great War, he took a position as a combat engineer, which kept him off the front lines but also used his mechanical skills. He is discovered chopping wood in exchange for food or devices that interest him. He is most helpful within the group as their mechanic, and orchestrates the construction of medieval-type weapons. However, he harbors a deep hatred for traitors as he was one himself, which resulted in his whole unit being killed. Within the series, he talks about the old tradition of the &quot;seven rice kami&quot; inside every grain of rice: he is pinned by a Bandit&#x27;s Giant sword while detonating the explosive that would detach the engines from the Capital Airship, and before falling to his death, he shouts out to Katsushiro: &quot;I&#x27;ll be in the rice&quot; or &quot;Find me in the rice&quot;. He is the third samurai.
: 
:: Kyuzo is originally a nearly silent, mysterious bodyguard for Ayamaro. In that role, he fights with Kanbei, and he later joins the group with the stated intent of saving Kanbei&#x27;s life so that he can later fight Kanbei to the death. Kyuzo is an incredibly skilled fighter, wielding double blades that fit into one sheath on his back. He is accidentally killed by Katsushiro when he used a gun to protect Kanbei; because Katsushiro&#x27;s sword was broken. Instead of showing anger to Katsushiro or regret of his own life, he instead expresses his anticipation of fighting Kanbei in the afterlife. He is the sixth samurai.

===Kanna Village===
: 
:: Kirara is a &quot;Mikumari&quot; (water maiden, a village priestess) of Kanna village. She decides to go find the samurai to be brought back to her village, while admitting that she also wanted to see the outside world. She possesses a dowsing crystal on a necklace which allows her to detect the flow of groundwater and to read other&#x27;s hearts. She rejects Katsushiro&#x27;s love, and later is shown to have fallen for Kanbei instead, who rejected her for his own reasons.
: 
:: Komachi is Kirara&#x27;s little sister, who follows along with her and Rikichi to see the city as well as help locate the samurai. She likes the boisterous Kikuchiyo and asks him to marry her when she grows up. After the death of Kikuchiyo, Komachi is seen with her sister&#x27;s dowsing necklace hinting that she inherited her position as the &quot;Mikumari&quot; of her village.
: 
:: Rikichi is a peasant of Kanna, who travels with Kirara to locate the samurai. He can be often rash because of his hatred for the bandits. He blames himself for the loss of his wife, Sanae, who has given herself up to the bandits to save the village. Kanbei promises to rescue Sanae, and Rikichi is eventually reunited with her.
: 
:: The village patriarch who hired samurai to battle bandits.
: 
:: The matriarch of Kanna village and former water priestess. She is also Kirara and Komachi&#x27;s Grandmother.
: 
:: Komachi&#x27;s best friend in Kanna village, Okara is always receiving letters from her about everything that goes on with the samurai. A strong lover of gossip and secrets, she always a mischievous laugh whenever she sees a secret or overhears some juicy gossip. Even though Okara is around Komachi&#x27;s age, she speaks and acts like a full grown woman with wisdom and perception of truth far beyond her years. Okara always has a baby on her back, though it&#x27;s never explained whose baby it is, what its name is, if it&#x27;s a boy or a girl, or even why it&#x27;s with her.

; Manzō (万造)
:: A farmer in Kanna Village. A somewhat ugly man with a pointed head and buck-teeth, he is always complaining about anything and everything. He becomes the unofficial spokesman for the villagers who don&#x27;t want the samurai&#x27;s help and wish to maintain the status quo. Just before the battle with the bandits, Manzo attempts to sell out the samurai to a bandit scout, after which Katsushiro is forced to kill the scout. When Manzō (万造) is brought before the villagers to answer for his betrayal, he is defended by an unlikely advocate, Kikuchiyo. Kikuchiyo lectures everyone that it was the tragic cycle of what the Bandits and Samurai do to villagers that make them turncoats and cowards, and that Manzo shouldn&#x27;t be faulted for acting in desperation. Kanbei convinces Manzo that his home and village are not truly his, but possessions of the bandits, and that he should fight for them and for his daughter. Though Manzō (万造) eventually becomes loyal to the samurai&#x27;s cause, he never fully stops complaining about every little thing.
: 
:: Manzo&#x27;s daughter. It was told that Shino was very beautiful until her father cut off all her hair and covered her with dirt to disguise her from being taken by the bandits. She&#x27;s always arguing with her father about his wanting to betray the samurai. She appears to be a close friend of Kirara.
: 
:: A farmer of Kanna village. A short pudgy man who&#x27;s always complaining about things along with Manzo.
: 
: 

===Antagonists===
: 
:: Ukyo is the adopted heir to Ayamaro. His shielded and pampered lifestyle leaves him with a self-centered yet playful attitude on life, which is really a cover for a rather calculating, manipulative and cruel personality. He is later revealed to be the 49th clone of the Emperor and after surviving a three-day ordeal of constant questioning, Ukyo is proclaimed heir to the throne. He then murders the Emperor to succeed him and launches a plan to pit the villagers, samurai and bandits against one another to consolidate his control.
: 
:: Tessai is a samurai employed by Ukyo as a body guard. Throughout most of the series, he plays the role of the frustrated sycophant to Ukyo, enduring near constant verbal abuse. However, he is eventually revealed to be a competent warrior, whose martial skills may even be greater than the heroes. His subservience to Ukyo comes from a sense of personal honor in loyalty to his retainer, however undeserving that retainer might be.
Tessai&#x27;s dress is a derivative of the traditional dress of the Dutch fishermen town of Volendam, including his pipe.
: 
:: Ayamaro is the Magistrate to Kogakyo and adopted father of Ukyo. He raised Ukyo and taught him in the ways of commerce. But, when his samurai hunt for the murderer of the Imperial Envoy turn up unsuccessful, he is stripped of his title which is given to Ukyo. Ayamaro was seen in the last episode, living among the Shikimoribito.
: 
:: Hyogo is one of Ayamaro&#x27;s bodyguards. He is identifiable by an androgynous appearance, and deports a cutthroat personality; he is always seen trying to outshine Kyuzo, as suggested in Episode 5 when he challenges Kanbei after Kyuzo is defeated by the ronin. He is later killed by Kyuzo, who cuts him down after he fires a shot from his newly-acquired rifle at Katsushiro.

; /Lord/Emperor
:: He&#x27;s the emperor, whose body was damaged during the great war. Therefore he bought out the samurai in an act of revenge. He also created several clones in an attempt to make a successor, including Ukyo. The reason behind the harem of women he keeps is to impregnate them with his seed in order to create more clones; this is seen with Sanae being pregnant with another clone and Mizuki revealing that they were being used as &quot;farms&quot; to hold the clones of Amanushi.
: 
:: Leader of the intelligence operation during the initial Kanna Village campaign, receiving information from Manzo. Following his meeting with Manzo being discovered by Katsushiro, he was killed by Katsushiro while inside a Yakan.

====Mechanical Samurai====
During the great war, there are samurai that had converted their bodies into large fighting machines. When the war was ended by merchants, many became , or bandits. Under the emperor&#x27;s employment, the bandit units rob farming villages of their rice, and occasionally women and children for the capital. During Capital&#x27;s journey to Kanna Village, Ukyo orders the court physician to remove the bandits&#x27; souls, so they will be nothing more than mindless machines, accepting orders only from the emperor.

; /Teakettle
:: A troop-transporting unit. During the battle against Capital, one such unit was reused by Heihachi to infiltrate Capital. It is the only mechanical samurai in the series that is operated by pilot.
; 
:: It is usually in flying saucer form, but it can split into two rabbit-eared units.
:: A humanoid unit dressed in black suit, resembling a ninja.
: 
:: Head of the bandit army leading the campaign against Kanna Village.
: 
:: Syusai&#x27;s sub-commander.
: 
:: A leader of bandits. It receives orders from incumbent emperor to raid villages. After Ukyo revealed his plan to have samurai hired by Ukyo to destroying the bandits, it was destroyed by Capital&#x27;s main cannon blast.

===Other characters===
; Masamune
: Masamune is Kikuchiyo&#x27;s mechanic and veteran of the Great War. As the series progresses, he befriends Kanbei and the other samurai while they stayed in Kogakyo. He was the one who helped them escape Kogakyo in episode 6 of the show (Although he was tied up by Kambei and &quot;roughened up&quot; by Kikuchiyo as a ploy to trick the attendants into believing that Masamune was taken hostage rather than willingly aiding the samurai).
: 
:: Yukino is Shichiroji&#x27;s lover and the woman who saved his life when Shichiroji&#x27;s escape pod washed ashore on the river underneath the Firefly House. Indebted to Yukino, Shichiroji helps her run the Firefly House and claims that he had abandoned the samurai life. However, it is one of Yukino&#x27;s fears that the old samurai hasn&#x27;t quite forgotten fighting. When Shichiroji joins Kanbei and the others on their journey to Kanna Village, Yukino waits for him, expecting him to return with &quot;a mountain of treasure&quot; as in the old tale of &quot;Peach Boy&quot; with which they tease Shichiroji with. As the series progresses, Yukino seems to be very sisterly towards Kirara and is aware of Kirara&#x27;s hidden love for Kanbei.
: 
:: Honoka is a village girl who was traded to the Shikimoribito by the Nobuseri after they destroyed her village. In truth, she is a spy for the Nobuseri, who desire to control the Shikimoribito&#x27;s power cells. If she is not compliant with the Nobuseri&#x27;s wishes, they claim they will kill her little sister, Mizuki. However, when discovered, rather than be killed as Heihachi wanted, Kanbei spares her and promises to restore Mizuki to her.
: 
:: Rikichi&#x27;s wife. She gave herself willingly to the bandits to save Kanna village. Kirara discovers from the bandits that Sanae and other &quot;choice&quot; girls that they abduct are sent to the capital. Later on she becomes pregnant with Amanushi&#x27;s child (clone) and refuses to leave with Kanbei proclaiming that she is in love with the Emperor. Sanae believes the Emperor is misunderstood while Honoka and the other women believe she&#x27;s been brainwashed. She is later informed about the loss of the baby, which devastates her, as she believes she killed the baby which was caused by the stress and grief over the Emperor&#x27;s death. She begins to sob and apologize to the Emperor and later says that &quot;she will pray for the souls of the Emperor and their [our] baby for the rest of her [my] life.&quot; Kanbei stated that the look in Sanae&#x27;s eyes were &quot;sincere love for the Emperor.&quot; After she&#x27;s rescued, Sanae refuses to see Rikichi either out of shame or the fact that she still loves the Emperor. In the very last episode she is seen taking over her husband&#x27;s spot in the rice fields. It is possible she might have suffered from Stockholm syndrome.
: 
:: Honoka&#x27;s little sister who is revealed to be Sanae&#x27;s attendant in the Capital, rather than the Nobuseri&#x27;s hostage.

<text>Adro (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, with a traditional wine-growing vocation favored by its position in the Franciacorta area (northern Italy).

== Physical geography ==
The municipality of Adro is located at the foot of Monte Alto, in Franciacorta about six kilometers from Lago d&#x27;Iseo, in the southwestern part of province of Brescia.

== Origin of the name ==
From what is reported by Mazza (1986), the origins of the toponym are uncertain: Dante Olivieri claims that it would come from Latin &quot;ater&quot; or &quot;atro&quot; (&quot;black&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;obscure&quot;), while Paolo Guerrini suggested the derivation from &quot;acer&quot;, demonstrating the ancient presence of maple woods. In a document of 822 it is called &quot;Atro&quot;.

== History ==
The oldest evidence of anthropization in the municipality of Adro are Neolithic finds found in the hamlet of . The finds of tombs with grave goods from the late imperial period (III century) and Longobardi date back to a later period.

The oldest news of the village of Adro is present in the document in which it is mentioned as &quot;Atro&quot;, dated April 10, 822. In it, the Abbess Eremperga gave a vico con corte to a certain Rampergo.

The castle was built between 13th and 14th century: in acts of 1006 and 1050 Adro is named as &quot;&#x27;vicus&quot; and not as &quot;castrum&quot;. Both under the domination of the Visconti and under that of Venice, Adro administratively belonged to the quadra (Town Square) of Palazzolo.

During the Venetian domination – popularly known as Domini di Terraferma – of the territory (from 1426 to 1797) the Bargnani family gained importance in the village, important in the life of the town between the 17th and 18th centuries, to whom the Dandolo counts succeeded.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s coat of arms is formed by a capital &quot;A&quot; with a rounded top, of silver color on a green field, which is surrounded by three bunches of grapes with its branches and tendrils. Of these clusters, two are at the top, while the other is at the larger tip; the vine is golden, loading the bunch. The oldest form of this coat of arms appears in the frescoes sixteenth century of the ancient parish church.

<text>The Guide for the Perplexed (; ; ) is a work of Jewish theology by Maimonides. It seeks to reconcile Aristotelianism with Rabbinical Jewish theology by finding rational explanations for many events in the text.

It was written in Judeo-Arabic, a dialect of Classical Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet. It was sent originally, part after part, to his student, Rabbi Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta, the son of Rabbi Judah, and is the main source of Maimonides&#x27; philosophical views, as opposed to his opinions on Jewish law.

Since many of the philosophical concepts, such as his view of theodicy and the relationship between philosophy and religion, are relevant beyond Judaism, it has been the work most commonly associated with Maimonides in the non-Jewish world and it is known to have influenced several major non-Jewish philosophers. Following its publication, &quot;almost every philosophic work for the remainder of the Middle Ages cited, commented on, or criticized Maimonides&#x27; views.&quot; Within Judaism, the &quot;Guide&quot; became widely popular, with many Jewish communities requesting copies of the manuscript, but also quite controversial, with some communities limiting its study or banning it altogether.

== Contents ==

&quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; was originally written sometime between 1185 and 1190 by Maimonides in Judeo-Arabic (Classical Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet). It was first translated in 1204 into Hebrew by a contemporary of Maimonides, Samuel ibn Tibbon. The work is divided into three parts. According to Maimonides, he wrote the &quot;Guide&quot; &quot;to enlighten a religious man who has been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who conscientiously fulfills his moral and religious duties, and at the same time has been successful in his philosophical studies.&quot;

Also, he made a systematic exposition on &quot;Maaseh Bereishit&quot; and &quot;Merkabah mysticism&quot;, works of Jewish mysticism regarding the theology of creation from the Book of Genesis and the chariot passage from the Book of Ezekiel—these being the two main mystical texts in the Tanakh. This analysis occurs in the third part, and from this perspective, the issues raised in the first two parts are there to provide background and a progression in the mystical and philosophical knowledge required to ponder the climax.

===The opening letter ===
The book begins with a letter from Maimonides to his dear student, Rabbi Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta. Maimonides praises his student&#x27;s sharp comprehension and eagerness to acquire knowledge. 

=== The first part ===
The part begins with Maimonides&#x27; thesis of the unity, omnipresence, and incorporeality of God, explaining biblical anthropomorphism of divine attributes as homonymous or figurative. The first chapter explains the Genesis 1 description of Adam the first as in the &quot;image of God&quot;, as referring to the intellectual perception of humankind rather than physical form. In the Bible, one can find many expressions that refer to God in human terms, for instance the &quot;hand of God&quot;. Maimonides strongly opposed what he believed to be a heresy present in unlearned Jews who then assume God to be corporeal (or even possessing positive characteristics).

To explain his belief that this is not the case, Maimonides devoted more than 20 chapters in the beginning (and middle) of the first part to analyzing Hebrew terms. Each chapter was about a term used to refer to God (such as &quot;mighty&quot;) and, in each case, Maimonides presented a case that the word is a homonym, whereby its usage when referring to a physical entity is completely different from when referring to God. This was done by close textual analysis of the word in the Tanakh in order to present what Maimonides saw as the proof that according to the Tanakh, God is completely incorporeal:
This leads to Maimonides&#x27; notion that God cannot be described in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; notes his view that &quot;As to His essence, the only way to describe it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while if positive essential attributes are admitted it may be assumed that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.&quot;

Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of positive attributes is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God&#x27;s role in the universe, and that is the most important aspect of the world.

The first part also contains an analysis of the reasons why philosophy and mysticism are taught late in the Jewish tradition, and only to a few. Maimonides cites many examples of what he sees as the incapability of the masses of understanding these concepts. Thus, approaching them with a mind that is not yet learned in Torah and other Jewish texts can lead to heresy and the transgressions considered the most serious by Maimonides.

The part ends (Chapters 73–76) with Maimonides&#x27; protracted exposition and criticism of a number of principles and methods identified with the schools of Jewish Kalam and Islamic Kalam, including the argument for creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; and the unity and incorporeality of God. While he accepts the conclusions of the Kalam school (because of their consistency with Judaism), he disagrees with their methods and points out many perceived flaws in their arguments: &quot;Maimonides exposes the weakness of these propositions, which he regards as founded not on a basis of positive facts, but on mere fiction ... Maimonides criticizes especially the tenth proposition of the &quot;Mutakallimīn&quot;, according to which everything that is conceivable by imagination is admissible: e.g., that the terrestrial globe should become the all-encompassing sphere, or that this sphere should become the terrestrial globe.&quot;

=== The second part ===

The second part begins with 26 propositions from Aristotle&#x27;s metaphysics, of which Maimonides accepts 25 as having been conclusively demonstrated, rejecting only the proposition that holds the universe to be eternal. The exposition of the physical structure of the universe, as seen by Maimonides. The world-view asserted in the work is essentially Aristotelian, with a spherical Earth in the centre, surrounded by concentric Heavenly Spheres. While Aristotle&#x27;s view with respect to the eternity of the universe is rejected, Maimonides extensively borrows his proofs of the existence of God and his concepts such as the Prime Mover: &quot;But as Maimonides recognizes the authority of Aristotle in all matters concerning the sublunary world, he proceeds to show that the Biblical account of the creation of the nether world is in perfect accord with Aristotelian views. Explaining its language as allegorical and the terms employed as homonyms, he summarizes the first chapter of Genesis thus: God created the universe by producing on the first day the &quot;reshit&quot; (Intelligence) from which the spheres derived their existence and motion and thus became the source of the existence of the entire universe.&quot;

A novel point is that Maimonides connects natural forces and heavenly spheres with the concept of an angel: these are seen as the same thing. The Spheres are essentially pure Intelligences who receive power from the Prime Mover. This energy overflows from each one to the next and finally reaches earth and the physical domain. This concept of intelligent spheres of existence also appears in Gnostic Christianity as Aeons, having been conceived at least eight hundred years before Maimonides. Maimonides&#x27; immediate source was probably Avicenna, who may in turn have been influenced by the very similar scheme in Isma&#x27;ili Islam. This leads into a brief exposition of Creation as outlined in Genesis and theories about the possible end of the world.

The second major part of the part is the discussion of the concept of prophecy. Maimonides departs from the orthodox view in that he emphasizes the intellectual aspect of prophecy: According to this view, prophesy occurs when a vision is ascertained in the imagination, and then interpreted through the intellect of the prophet. In Maimonides view, many aspects of descriptions of prophesy are metaphor. All stories of God speaking with a prophet, with the exception of Moses, are metaphors for the interpretation of a vision. While a perfected &quot;imaginative faculty&quot; is required, and indicated through the behavior of the prophet, the intellect is also required. Maimonides insists that all prophesy, excepting that of Moses, occurs through natural law. Maimonides also states that the descriptions of nation-wide prophesy at Mount Sinai in Exodus are metaphors for the apprehension of logical proofs. For example, he gives the following interpretation:

Maimonides outlines 11 levels of prophecy, with that of Moses being beyond the highest, and thus most unimpeded. Subsequent lower levels reduce the immediacy between God and prophet, allowing prophecies through increasingly external and indirect factors such as angels and dreams. Finally, the language and nature of the prophetic books of the Bible are described.

=== The third part ===

The beginning of the third part is described as the climax of the whole work. This is the exposition of the mystical passage of the Chariot found in Ezekiel. Traditionally, Jewish law viewed this passage as extremely sensitive, and in theory, did not allow it to be taught explicitly at all. The only way to learn it properly was if a student had enough knowledge and wisdom to be able to interpret their teacher&#x27;s hints by themselves, in which case the teacher was allowed to teach them indirectly. In practice, however, the mass of detailed rabbinic writings on this subject often crosses the line from hint to detailed teachings.

After justifying this &quot;crossing of the line&quot; from hints to direct instruction, Maimonides explains the basic mystical concepts via the Biblical terms referring to Spheres, elements and Intelligences. In these chapters, however, there is still very little in terms of direct explanation.

This is followed by an analysis of the moral aspects of the universe. Maimonides deals with the problem of evil (for which people are considered to be responsible because of free will), trials and tests (especially those of Job and the story of the Binding of Isaac) as well as other aspects traditionally attached to God in theology, such as providence and omniscience: &quot;Maimonides endeavors to show that evil has no positive existence, but is a privation of a certain capacity and does not proceed from God; when, therefore, evils are mentioned in Scripture as sent by God, the Scriptural expressions must be explained allegorically. Indeed, says Maimonides, all existing evils, with the exception of some which have their origin in the laws of production and destruction and which are rather an expression of God&#x27;s mercy, since by them the species are perpetuated, are created by men themselves.&quot;

Maimonides then explains his views on the reasons for the 613 mitzvot, the 613 laws contained within the five books of Moses. Maimonides divides these laws into 14 sections—the same as in his Mishneh Torah. However, he departs from traditional Rabbinic explanations in favour of a more physical/pragmatic approach by explaining the purpose of the commandments (especially of sacrifices) as intending to help wean the Israelites away from idolatry.

Having culminated with the commandments, Maimonides concludes the work with the notion of the perfect and harmonious life, founded on the correct worship of God. The possession of a correct philosophy underlying Judaism (as outlined in the Guide) is seen as being an essential aspect in true wisdom.

==Reception==
While many Jewish communities revered Maimonides&#x27; work and viewed it as a triumph, others deemed many of its ideas heretical. The Guide was often banned and, in some occasions, even burned in Paris in 1233.

In particular, the adversaries of Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah declared war against the &quot;Guide&quot;. His views concerning angels, prophecy, and miracles—and especially his assertion that he would have had no difficulty in reconciling the biblical account of the creation with the doctrine of the eternity of the universe, had the Aristotelian proofs for it been conclusive—provoked the indignation of his coreligionists.

Likewise, some (most famously Rabbi Abraham ben David, known as the RaBad) objected to Maimonides&#x27; raising the notion of the incorporeality of God as a dogma, claiming that great and wise men of previous generations held a different view.

In modern-day Jewish circles, controversies regarding Aristotelian thought are significantly less heated, and, over time, many of Maimonides&#x27; ideas have become authoritative. As such, the book is seen as a legitimate and canonical, if somewhat abstruse, religious masterpiece.

The Guide had great influence in Christian thought, both Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus making extensive use of it: the negative theology contained in it also influenced mystics such as Meister Eckhart. Due to The Guide&#x27;s influence on Western Christian thought, it has been regarded as a &quot;Jewish-scholastic &quot;Summa.&quot;&quot; It was massively used in—and disseminated through—Ramon Martí&#x27;s &quot;Pugio Fidei&quot;. It was also read and commented on in Islamic circles, and remains in print in Arab countries.

Several decades after Maimonides&#x27; death, a Muslim philosopher by the name of Muhammad ibn Abi-Bakr Al-Tabrizi wrote a commentary in Arabic on the first 25 propositions (out of 26) of Book Two, leaving out the last one, which states that the universe is eternal. The extant manuscript of the commentary was written in 677AH (1278 CE), and states that it was copied from a copy in Maimonides&#x27; own hand writing. The commentary was printed in Cairo in 1949.

== Analysis ==

By Maimonides&#x27; own design, most readers of the &quot;Guide&quot; have come to the conclusion that his beliefs were orthodox, i.e. in line with the thinking of most rabbis of his day. He wrote that his Guide was addressed to only a select and educated readership, and that he is proposing ideas that are deliberately concealed from the masses. He writes in the introduction:

No intelligent man will require and expect that on introducing any subject I shall completely exhaust it; or that on commencing the exposition of a figure I shall fully explain all its parts.

and:

My object in adopting this arrangement is that the truths should be at one time apparent and at another time concealed. Thus we shall not be in opposition to the Divine Will (from which it is wrong to deviate) which has withheld from the multitude the truths required for the knowledge of God, according to the words, &#x27;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him (Psalm 25:14)&#x27;

Marvin Fox comments on this:
It is one of the mysteries of our intellectual history that these explicit statements of Maimonides, together with his other extensive instructions on how to read his book, have been so widely ignored. No author could have been more open in informing his readers that they were confronting no ordinary book.

Marvin Fox writes further:
In his introduction to the Guide Maimonides speaks repeatedly of the &quot;secret&quot; doctrine that must be set forth in a way appropriate to its secret character. Rabbinic law, to which Maimonides as a loyal Jew is committed, prohibits any direct, public teaching of the secrets of the Torah. One is permitted to teach these only in private to selected students of proven competence ... It would seem that there is no way to write such a book without violating rabbinic law ... Yet at times it is urgent to teach a body of sound doctrine to those who require it ... The problem is to find a method for writing such book in a way that does not violate Jewish law while conveying its message successfully to those who are properly qualified.

According to Fox, Maimonides carefully assembled the Guide &quot;so as to protect people without a sound scientific and philosophical education from doctrines that they cannot understand and that would only harm them, while making the truths available to students with the proper personal and intellectual preparation.&quot;

Aviezer Ravitzky writes:
Those who upheld a radical interpretation of the secrets of the Guide, from Joseph Caspi and Moses Narboni in the 14th century to Leo Strauss and Shlomo Pines in the 20th, proposed and developed tools and methods for the decoding of the concealed intentions of the Guide. Can we already find the roots of this approach in the writings of Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon, a few years after the writing of the Guide? ... Ibn Tibbon&#x27;s comments reveal his general approach toward the nature of the contradictions in the Guide: The interpreter need not be troubled by contradiction when one assertion is consistent with the &quot;philosophic view&quot; whereas the other is completely satisfactory to &quot;men of religion&quot;. Such contradictions are to be expected, and the worthy reader will know the reason for them and the direction they tend to ... The correct reading of the Guide&#x27;s chapters should be carried out in two complementary directions: on the one hand, one should distinguish each chapter from the rest, and on the other one should combine different chapters and construct out of them a single topic. Again, on the one hand, one should get to the bottom of the specific subject matter of each chapter, its specific &quot;innovation&quot;, an innovation not necessarily limited to the explicit subject matter of the chapter. On the other hand, one should combine scattered chapters which allude to one single topic so as to reconstruct the full scope of the topic.

== Translations ==
The original version of the Guide was written in Judaeo-Arabic. The first Hebrew translation (titled &quot;Moreh HaNevukhim&quot;) was written in 1204 by a contemporary of Maimonides, Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon in southern France. This Hebrew edition has been used for many centuries. A new, modern edition of this translation was published in 2019 by Feldheim Publishers. Another translation, which most scholars see as inferior, though more user-friendly, was that of Judah al-Harizi.

A first complete translation in Latin (&quot;Rabbi Mossei Aegyptii Dux seu Director dubitantium aut perplexorum&quot;) was printed in Paris by Agostino Giustiniani/Augustinus Justinianus in 1520.

A French translation accompanied the first critical edition, published by Salomon Munk in three volumes from 1856 ().

The first complete English translation was &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, by Michael Friedländer, with Mr. Joseph Abrahams and Reverend H. Gollancz, dates from 1881. It was originally published in a three volume edition with footnotes. In 1904 it was republished in a less expensive one volume edition, without footnotes, with revisions. The second edition is still in use today, sold through Dover Publications. Despite the age of this publication it still has a good reputation, as Friedländer had solid command of Judeao-Arabic and remained particularly faithful to the literal text of Maimonides&#x27; work.

Another translation to English was made by Chaim Rabin in 1952, also published in an abridged edition.

The most popular English translation is the two-volume set &quot;The Guide of the Perplexed&quot;, translated by Shlomo Pines, with an extensive introductory essay by Leo Strauss, published in 1963.

A new English translation published by Lenn E. Goodman and Phillip I. Lieberman of Vanderbilt University was published in 2024. This edition attempts to highlight the conversational, emotionally resonant tone of the original text.

A modern translation to Hebrew was written by Yosef Qafih and published by Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem, 1977. A new modern Hebrew translation has been written by Prof. Michael Schwartz, professor emeritus of Tel Aviv University&#x27;s departments of Jewish philosophy and Arabic language and literature. &quot;Mishneh Torah Project&quot; published another Hebrew edition between 2018 and 2021, translated by Hillel Gershuni.

 (1842–1915), the rabbi of Nagybecskerek translated it to Hungarian and published it in multiple volumes between 1878 and 1890.

The Arabic original was published from Arabic manuscripts in a critical edition by the Turkish Dr. Hussein Atai and published in Turkey, then in Cairo Egypt.

Translations exist also in Yiddish, French, Polish, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, and Chinese.

== Manuscripts ==
The earliest complete Judeo-Arabic copy of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, copied in Yemen in 1380, was found in the India Office Library and added to the collection of the British Library in 1992. Another manuscript, copied in 1396 on vellum and written in Spanish cursive script, but discovered in Yemen by bibliophile, David Solomon Sassoon, was formerly housed at the Sassoon Library in Letchworth, England, but has since been acquired by the University of Toronto. The manuscript has an introduction written by Samuel ibn Tibbon, and is nearly complete, with the exception of a lacuna between two of its pages. Containing a total of 496 pages, written in two columns of 23 lines to a column, with 229 illuminations, the manuscript has been described by David Solomon Sassoon in his &quot;Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library&quot;. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, England, there are at least fifteen incomplete copies and fragments of the original Arabic text, all described by Adolf Neubauer in his &quot;Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts&quot;. Two Leyden manuscripts (cod. 18 and 211) have also the original Arabic texts, as do various manuscripts of the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot; in Paris (No. 760, very old; 761 and 758, copied by Rabbi Saadia ibn Danan). A copy of the original Arabic text was also stored at the Berlin Royal Library (now Berlin State Library), under the category Ms. Or. Qu., 579 (105 in Catalogue of Moritz Steinschneider); it is defective in the beginning and at the end. Hebrew translations of the Arabic texts, made by Samuel ibn Tibbon and Yehuda Alharizi, albeit independently of each other, abound in university and state libraries.

<text>The 1996 Major League Soccer supplemental draft was held on March 4, 1996, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

==History==
As Major League Soccer prepared for its first season, the league began stocking teams with players. As the teams were being created at the same time, the league adopted a measured approach to building rosters. First, the league allocated four &quot;big name&quot; players to each team. Then on February 6 and 7, 1996, the league held its 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Over sixteen rounds, teams selected players from any source. Then on March 4, the league held a three-round 1996 MLS College Draft. The 1996 MLS Supplemental Draft was held later the same day.

<doc id="1037923" wikidata="Q6942130" url="?curid=1037923" title="Music of Java">
<text>The Music of Java embraces a wide variety of styles, both traditional and contemporary, reflecting the diversity of the island and its lengthy history. Apart from traditional forms that maintain connections to musical styles many centuries old, there are also many unique styles and conventions which combine elements from many other regional influences, including those of neighbouring Asian cultures and European colonial forms.

==Gamelan==

The gamelan orchestra, based on metallic idiophones and drums, is perhaps the form which is most readily identified as being distinctly &quot;Javanese&quot; by outsiders. In various forms, it is ubiquitous to Southeast Asia. In Java, the full gamelan also adds a bowed string instrument (the rebab, a name illustrative of Islamic influence), plucked siter, vertical flute suling and voices. The rebab is one of the main melodic instruments of the ensemble, together with the metallophone gendér; these and the kendang drums are often played by the most experienced musicians. Voices usually consist of a male chorus gerong, together with a female soloist pesindhen; however, the voices are not usually featured in court gamelan (as opposed to wayang kulit, shadow puppet theatre) and are supposed to be heard discreetly in the middle of the orchestral sound. In these abstract pieces, the words are largely secondary to the music itself.

There are two tuning systems in Javanese gamelan music, slendro (pentatonic) and pelog (heptatonic in full, but focusing on a pentatonic group). Tuning is not standard, rather each gamelan set will have a distinctive tuning. There are also distinct melodic modes (pathet) associated with each tuning system. A complete gamelan consists of two of sets of instrument, one in each tuning system. Different gamelan sets have different sonorities, and are used for different pieces of music; many are very old, and used for only one specific piece. Musical forms are defined by the rhythmic cycles. These consist of major cycles punctuated by the large gong, subdivided by smaller divisions marked by the striking of smaller gongs such as kenong, kempul and kethuk. The melodic interplay takes place within this framework (technically called &quot;colotomic structure&quot;).

<text>Pointe-Noire (; , with the letter d following French spelling standards) is the second largest city in the Republic of the Congo, following the capital of Brazzaville, and an autonomous department and a commune since the 2002 Constitution. Before this date it was the capital of the Kouilou region (now a separate department). It is situated on a headland between Pointe-Noire Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Pointe-Noire is the main commercial centre of the country and had a population of 1,420,612 inhabitants in 2023.

== The coat of arms ==
The coat of arms of the city of Pointe-Noire is:

&quot;Gold at the point of sand accompanied by two silver oars, the handle gules, laid in chevron poured, the tip and oars moving from a sea of azure wavy three streams of silver&quot;

==Administration==
Pointe-Noire is a commune divided into six urban boroughs (&quot;arrondissements&quot;):

*Lumumba, the oldest area. It is the administrative and commercial centre.
*Mvoumvou
*Tié-Tié
*Loandjili
*Mongo-Mpoukou
*Ngoyo

Pointe-Noire is also a department which include the area of the commune and, since 2011, the district of Tchiamba-Nzassi, formerly part of the Kouilou department.

==History==
The name Pointe-Noire (&quot;Black Point&quot;) originated with Portuguese navigators who saw a block of black rocks on the headland in 1484. From then on, Pointe-Noire, called in Portuguese &quot;Ponta Negra&quot;, became a maritime point of reference, and then a small fishing village starting in 1883, after the French signed a treaty with local people, the Loangos.

In 1910, French Equatorial Africa (&quot;Afrique équatoriale française&quot;, AEF) was created, and French companies were allowed to exploit the Middle Congo (modern-day Congo Brazzaville). It soon became necessary to build a railroad that would connect Brazzaville, the terminus of the river navigation on the Congo River and the Ubangui River, with the Atlantic coast. As rapids make it impossible to navigate on the Congo River past Brazzaville, and the coastal railroad terminus site had to allow for the construction of a deep-sea port, authorities chose the site of Ponta Negra instead of Libreville as originally envisaged. In 1923, it was chosen to be the terminus of the Congo-Ocean Railway (CFCO).
In 1927, drinking water became available in the city, which had about 3,000 inhabitants. The airport was built in 1932. In 1934, Governor Raphael Antonetti inaugurated the Congo-Ocean Railway. The first hospital was built in 1936. That same year, Paris-based Banque de l&#x27;Afrique Occidentale opened its first branch in the city. In 1942, the Pointe-Noire Harbour welcomed its first ship, and made the city the AEF&#x27;s seaport.

In 1950, Pointe-Noire had 20,000 inhabitants, and became the capital of the Middle Congo, while Brazzaville was the capital city of the AEF. In 1957, the Middle-Congo became the Republic of Congo, although it was still not independent. Incidents which occurred during 1958 legislative elections led the leaders of the Democratic Union for the Defence of African Interests (&quot;Union démocratique pour la défense des interets africains&quot;, UDDIA) to transfer the capital to Brazzaville, since Pointe-Noire was under the influence of the political opposition.

Pointe-Noire continued growing, and was the most modern city in 1960, when Congo gained independence. Then, the oil discovery around 1980 re-attracted people and Elf-Aquitaine facilities. The population doubled by 1982, and reached 360,000 in 1994.

Civil wars in 1997 and 1999 caused an influx of refugees from the surrounding provinces (Lékoumou, Niari, Bouenza, Pool) towards Pointe-Noire, causing the population to climb to over 1 million inhabitants.

Recently the Government has proposed the development of a new bulk resource port to be constructed at Point Indienne, to the north of the Port of Pointe-Noire. A meeting was held on 18 December 2012 with a collective of 10 Congo government ministries and invited mining companies to discuss future development opportunities.

==Economy==

Pointe-Noire is the essential centre of the oil industry of the Republic of Congo, one of the main oil producers in Central Africa. Congolese oil has been largely exploited by the French company Elf Aquitaine since its discovery around 1980.

Pointe-Noire is also known for its fishing industry, which is often at odds with the oil development. Local waters are reportedly getting overfished.

Formerly, Pointe-Noire was home to a potash exploitation which led to the construction of a wharf, currently closed to the public.

==Education==
Lycée Français Charlemagne, a French international school for primary and secondary school children, is in Pointe-Noire. It also hosts a British international school for children aged 0 to 18 years, called Connie&#x27;s Academy.

The city is home to the École Supérieure de Technologie du Littoral (technology) the École supérieure de commerce et de gestion (Business), Institut UCAC-ICAM (Engineering) and the Centre d’éducation, de formation et d’apprentissage en mécanique auto (Automotive Engineering). The Higher Institute of Technology of Central Africa has a campus in the city. There are also several other institutions of higher education in the city.

== University establishments ==
As a result of the decentralisation policy put in place by the Congolese government, Pointe-Noire has seen the emergence of some young universities. The city has several private institutes and universities:

* The University of Loango, which offers programmes in law, management and commerce
* The Ecole Africaine de Développement in Pointe-Noire offers programmes in science and technology
* Ecole Superieure of Commerce and Industry of Congo of Congo offers Bachelor&#x27;s degree courses in partnership with Ecole SupdeV Paris

==Transport==

Pointe-Noire is home to Agostinho-Neto International Airport which as of August 2023 had direct flights to Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Brazzaville, Cotonou, Douala, Istanbul, Libreville, Luanda and Paris and was the second busiest airport in the country.

Pointe-Noire is also the terminus of the Congo-Ocean Railway, the railway station being a notable building. the railway was operating the &quot;La Gazelle&quot; train service every other day to Brazzaville and intermediate destinations.

Thanks to its rapid growth, the city now includes Tié-Tié Railway Station and Ngondji Railway Station, the next railway stations after the Pointe Noire terminus.

On 22 June 2010 a train departing from Pointe-Noire derailed resulting in the deaths of many passengers. The railway was built by the French between 1921 and 1934 during the French colonial rule in Congo.

Pointe-Noire has a taxi-bus network that runs throughout the entire city.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Pointe-Noire (Catholic Church), Evangelical Church of Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches) and Assemblies of God.

==Climate==
Pointe-Noire has a tropical savanna climate under the Köppen climate classification. The city has a wet season that spans from October through April, while the remaining 5 months form the dry season. Pointe-Noire receives roughly of precipitation annually. Temperatures are somewhat cooler during the dry season with average temperatures roughly at 24 degrees Celsius. During the wet season, average temperatures hover around 28 degrees Celsius.
==Sport==

Football teams include Association Sportive des Cheminots and Jeunesse Sportive les Bougainvillées.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

<text>Interstate 894 (I-894) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in Milwaukee County in the US state of Wisconsin. The route serves as a bypass of downtown Milwaukee, connecting with I-94 at the Zoo Interchange west of downtown and the Mitchell Interchange south of downtown. The route runs concurrently with three other highways for its duration, following US Highway 45 (US 45) from the Zoo Interchange to Hale Interchange as the Zoo Freeway, where it separates from US 45 to follow I-43 heading east to the Mitchell Interchange as the Airport Freeway. In local traffic reporting and casual conversation, it is known simply as &quot;the bypass&quot; or &quot;894&quot;, with &quot;41&quot; also being more recently used, as I-894 is entirely concurrent with I-41/US 41. The east–west portion is also concurrent with I-43.

I-894 is part of what was proposed to be an extensive freeway network around the Milwaukee area. The Zoo Freeway portion was completed from Beloit Road northward in 1963, and the Airport Freeway and remaining segment of the Zoo Freeway were completed in 1966. I-43 was routed concurrently with I-894 in 1987.

==Route description==

I-894 begins at the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee with I-41, I-94, US 41, and US 45. The highway heads south as part of the Zoo Freeway from this interchange running concurrently with I-41/US 41/US 45. Traffic reports generally refer to this section either as 894 northbound (southbound) or the northbound (southbound) Bypass. North of the Zoo Interchange, I-41/US 41/US 45 continues separately as the north part of the Zoo Freeway. I-894 enters West Allis before its first exit after the interchange; this first exit is a junction with State Trunk Highway 59 (WIS 59), known locally as Greenfield Avenue. After the first three exits, I-894 enters Greenfield. Farther south, I-894 has interchanges with National Avenue, Oklahoma Avenue, and Beloit Road. This section of the bypass is usually congested during rush hour because of traffic on I-894 and merging traffic from the Rock Freeway (I-43). This stretch usually has travel times between 10 and 15 minutes during the rush hour (as opposed to five minutes during non-rush-hour times).

The Interstate turns eastward at the Hale Interchange. US 45 turns westbound at that point to follow I-43 (Rock Freeway) south, and I-43 north follows I-894 to the east. The highway becomes the Airport Freeway after the Hale Interchange. Generally, this section is referred to as I-894 eastbound (westbound), as I-43 was not added until the late 1980s. Westbound I-894 has exits to WIS 24 (Forest Home Avenue) after the junction, though the eastbound highway only exits to a nearby local street. I-894 has two more exits after this and meets WIS 36 (Loomis Road) before reentering Milwaukee. It meets WIS 241 (South 27th Street) at exit 9 before terminating at the Mitchell Interchange with I-94, I-43 and US 41; I-43 continues northbound concurrently with I-94.

I-894 passes generally through residential areas for its entire length with the exception of a few commercial districts right next to the freeway such as the Southridge Mall district, along with South 27th Street north to Oklahoma Avenue, which contains multiple car dealerships. With the approximate distance traveled through downtown via I-94 at , I-894 provides a shorter distance for travelers heading to Chicago or Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. The Zoo Freeway portion as of 2007 carries at most 170,000 vehicles per day—with the highest values closer to the Zoo Interchange. The Airport Freeway carries up to 134,000 vehicles per day.

==History==

The freeways that exist today are only a part of what the Milwaukee County Expressway Commission had hoped would be built by 1972. The Zoo Freeway between Beloit Road and North Avenue was completed in 1963. At that time, the portion between Beloit Road and the Zoo Interchange was signed as I-894. The remainder of the Zoo Freeway to the Hale Interchange was completed in 1966 when the Airport Freeway was constructed. US 45 was rerouted to the freeway, as was WIS 15 south of National Avenue. (The Rock Freeway had also been constructed west to 108th Street at the time.) The Airport Freeway was proposed to be routed to the also-proposed Stadium Freeway South along Howard Avenue which is about north of the current alignment and named the Howard Avenue Expressway. The Airport Freeway construction was completed in 1966 to fully open I-894. Both freeways were slated to become part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, prior to their construction. I-43 was signed along the Airport Freeway concurrently with I-894 in 1988 after being officially designated in 1987, while I-41 was added to the route on April 7, 2015. A remnant of the proposed Stadium Freeway remains connected to I-894 near WIS 36 as an unbuilt interchange. Its three completed ramps are closed to all traffic, and previously had allowed busses access to a park and ride; the fourth ramp was demolished.

<text>The Battle of Molino del Rey (8 September 1847) was one of the bloodiest engagements of the Mexican–American War as part of the Battle for Mexico City. It was fought in September 1847 between Mexican forces under General Antonio León against an American force under Major General Winfield Scott at El Molino del Rey on the fringes of Mexico City. The Americans made little progress in this battle, but the Mexican forces were unable to hold them back long enough to prevent the capture of Mexico City one week later. Ulysses S. Grant served as a captain during this battle.

==Background==

The Americans were camped south of Mexico City, Scott and Worth&#x27;s division at Tacubaya, Gideon Johnson Pillow&#x27;s division at Mixcoac, David E. Twiggs division at San Ángel, and John A. Quitman&#x27;s division at San Agustín.

On 6 September 1847, Scott ended the armistice following the Battle of Churubusco as negotiations broke down, as it became clear that Antonio López de Santa Anna was preparing to resume fighting. On 7 September, a large number of Mexican horsemen were observed around a group of low, massive stone buildings known as El Molino del Rey or King&#x27;s Mill. Spread across the distance of this point, they were about west of the Castle at Chapultepec, which itself was about 2 mi (3 km) from the gates of Mexico City. A large grove of trees separated the mill from the castle, while the castle&#x27;s batteries covered the area.

General Winfield Scott received reports that the trees masked a foundry for casting cannon, and rumors told that Antonio López de Santa Anna, leader of both the Mexican government and military, in desperate need of ordnance, was sending out church and convent bells to have them melted down and converted to cannon. Scott ordered General Worth to attack and take the mill, break up the factory, and destroy any munitions found.

Molino del Rey was manned by Brigadier Antonio León&#x27;s Oaxaca Brigade, while Brigadier General Francisco Pérez manned the Casa Mata, and Brigadier General Simeón Ramírez&#x27;s brigade with seven guns manned the ditch connecting the two. General Juan Álvarez&#x27;s 4,000 cavalry waited in reserve at the Hacienda Morales.

The National Guard Battalions of Liberty, Union, Querétaro, and Mina were commanded by General León (1,400 men and three 8-lb guns), and the brigade of troops (Grenaderos, San Blas Activos, Mixto de Santa Ana, and Morelia Battalions) were commanded by General Joaquín Rangel. The 2nd light battalion, that of the Fijo the Mejico, and the 1st and 12th regiments of the line, with six pieces of artillery, were commanded by General Simeón Ramírez. The 4th light battalion (600 men)and 11th regiment of the line (900 men), were commanded by General Francisco Pérez. In the grove of Chapultepec was the reserve 1st and 3d light battalions (700 men).

==Battle==
At 5:45 am, on 8 September, Worth sent an assault column of 500 men, assembled from the various units of his division and led by Major George Wright of the 8th Infantry, down a gently sloping plain against the western end of the buildings. Behind them, he placed Colonel Charles F. Smith&#x27;s light battalion and George Cadwalader&#x27;s brigade in the center, and to their right was Garland&#x27;s brigade and a battery under Captain Simon H. Drum. On the left, attacking the Casa Mata, was Colonel James Duncan&#x27;s battery and a brigade commanded by Colonel James S. McIntosh. Major Edwin Vose Sumner commanded three squadrons of dragoons on the left flank. Captain Benjamin Huger&#x27;s heavy guns provided support.

Major Wright&#x27;s force came under intense artillery and small-arms fire, which drove them back, killing or wounding 11 of 14 officers. Lt. Col. Miguel Maria Echeagaray&#x27;s 3d Light Infantry launched a counterattack, prompting Worth to send in Capt. Ephraim Kirby Smith&#x27;s light battalion. Similarly, McIntosh&#x27;s men withdrew in the face of a counterattack, but Duncan&#x27;s guns forced Pérez&#x27;s men to withdraw from Casa Mata.

Worth sent the Voltigeur Regiment and the 11th Infantry into the assault, while Scott sent in the 9th Infantry. General León and Col. Lucas Balderas were killed. Brigadier General Matías Peña y Barragán led two counterattacks, but the Americans were able to force two gates and then fight room-to-room to take the mill after 2 hours, but found only a few gun molds. The Casa Mata caught fire and blew up near noon, causing more casualties, but by 1:00 pm, the Americans were back where they started. 685 Mexicans were taken prisoner and historian K. Jack Bauer estimates their killed and wounded at about 2,000.

==Aftermath==
Col. Hitchcock called the battle a Pyrrhic victory for the Americans. Scott still needed an assault path into the city, despite the destruction of Molino del Rey. Preparations began immediately thereafter for the Battle of Chapultepec.

<text>Angolo Terme (&quot;Angól&quot; in Camunian dialect) is a &quot;comune&quot; in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It lies on the right bank of the river Dezzo, in the lower Valle di Scalve.

==History==
Angolo was a mining center known since the 4th century BC. After the 12th century AD its history was closely linked to that of the Federici family. In 1335 Luchino Visconti granted them a privilege to extract iron in the area. In 1403 Caterina Visconti gave the family the possessions of the Antonioli of Grevo in exchange for the support offered her.

In 1408 Angolo went to Pandolfo III Malatesta, who ceded it to Comicino Federici, who temporarily sided for the Guelphs, until 1419, when he returned to the Ghibelline allegiance and the Visconti.

In 1509 Angolo (called &quot;Anghol&quot;) appears in a map of the Valle Camonica designed by Leonardo da Vinci.

In 1846 the town of Angolo, placed administratively in the province of Bergamo, demanded to be included in the province of Brescia.

In 1923 several houses suffer damage from the failure of the Gleno Dam (Italy), with 46 deaths among the inhabitants.

==Main sights==
* Parish Church of San Lorenzo, of ancient origin, rebuilt in 1694 and enlarged in 1757. The side portals are in &quot;Simona stone&quot;. The fifteen panels of the entrance door depict episodes of Christ&#x27;s Life.
* Church of Saint Elizabeth (or of the Visitation), situated along the road that leads into the Val di Scalve. It was built between the 15th and 16th century.
*Hermitage of Saint Sylvester: built in the early 16th century.
* Former Albrici - Federici palace, with a 16th-century portal in &quot;Sarnico stone&quot;.

==Culture==
The scütüm are in camunian dialect nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Angolo Terme is &quot;Treàangoi&quot;.
