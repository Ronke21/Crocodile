<text>The Ivory Coast national football team (French: &quot;Équipe de football de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;, recognized as the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire by FIFA) represents Ivory Coast in men&#x27;s international football. Nicknamed &quot;the Elephants&quot;, the team is managed by the Ivorian Football Federation (FIF). The team has won the Africa Cup of Nations three times, in 1992, 2015 and 2024, and has qualified for the FIFA World Cup three times, in 2006, 2010, and 2014.

Ivory Coasts&#x27;s home colours are all orange. Since 2020 their home games have been played at Alassane Ouattara Stadium, in Abidjan. Prior to this their home ground was Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium, also in Abidjan. Didier Zokora holds the record for number of caps, with 123. The nation&#x27;s leading goalscorer is Didier Drogba, who scored 65 goals for &quot;the Elephants&quot; in 105 Appearances.

==History==
===1960s===
The team played its first international match against Dahomey, now known as Benin, which they won 32 on 13 April 1960 in Madagascar.

The team took a large 110 victory against the Central African Republic. In 1961 the team made their first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations. After gaining independence from France, the team finished third in the 1963 and 1965 tournaments.

===1970s===
Ivory Coast&#x27;s performances in the 1970s were mixed. In the 1970 African Cup of Nations, the team finished top of their group, but lost to Ghana – the powerhouses of African football at the time – in the semi-finals, and went on to finish 4th after losing the third-place play-off to the United Arab Republic (now Egypt). They failed to qualify for the 1972 edition, losing 4–3 to Congo-Brazzaville in the final qualifying round. They qualified in 1974 but finished bottom of their group with only a single point, then failed to qualify in 1976, again losing to Congo-Brazzaville (now simply known as the Congo) in the first round.

The team initially qualified for 1978, beating Mali 2–1 on aggregate, but were disqualified for fielding an ineligible player in the second leg. Mali were also disqualified, due to police and stadium security assaulting the match officials during the first leg, and so Upper Volta, who Ivory Coast had beaten in the first qualifying round, inherited their place.

===1980s===
In 1984, the team hosted the African Cup of Nations for the first time, but failed to get out of their group. In 1986, they narrowly qualified from their group on goals scored, and went on to finish third once more, beating Morocco 3–2 in the third-place play-off.

===1990s===
At the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast beat Algeria 30 and drew 00 with Congo to finish top of their group. An extra-time victory over Zambia and a penalty shoot-out win over Cameroon took them to the final for the first time, where they faced Ghana. The match again went to a penalty shoot-out, which became (at the time) the highest-scoring in international football; Ivory Coast eventually triumphed 11–10 to win the title for the first time. They were unable to defend their title in 1994, losing to Nigeria in the semi-finals.

The Ivory Coast team is notable for having participated in (and won) the two highest-scoring penalty shoot-outs in international football competition — the 24-shot shoot-out in the final of the 1992 African Cup of Nations when Ghana was defeated 11–10, and the 24-shot shoot-out in the quarter-final of the 2006 African Cup of Nations, when Cameroon was defeated 12–11. In 2015, Ivory Coast once again defeated Ghana in the final of a 2015 African Cup of Nations with a 22-shot shoot-out, winning 9–8.

===2000s and World Cup debut===
In October 2005, Ivory Coast secured qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was to be their first-ever appearance at the tournament. Having been drawn into a &quot;Group of Death&quot; that also featured Cameroon and Egypt, Ivory Coast went into the final match second behind Cameroon, but qualified after beating Sudan 3–1 while Cameroon could only draw with Egypt.

In the tournament itself, Ivory Coast were drawn into another Group of Death, against Argentina, Holland, and Serbia and Montenegro. They lost 2–1 to Argentina – with Didier Drogba scoring the team&#x27;s first-ever World Cup goal in the 82nd minute – and then 2–1 to the Netherlands, meaning they had already been eliminated by the time they played Serbia and Montenegro. Despite going 2–0 down after just 20 minutes, Ivory Coast came back to win 3–2, with Bonaventure Kalou scoring an 86th-minute penalty to give Ivory Coast their first-ever World Cup victory.

After Uli Stielike left before the 2008 African Cup of Nations, due to his son&#x27;s health, co-trainer Gerard Gili took his position. To compensate of the lack of another co-coach, Didier Drogba acted as a player-coach. This was only the second time that a player had also acted as a coach at the tournament, after George Weah was both player and coach for Liberia during the 2002 tournament.

===2010s===
Ivory Coast qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and were again drawn in a &quot;Group of Death&quot;, against five-time champions Brazil, Portugal, and North Korea. Having managed a 0–0 draw against Portugal, a 3–1 defeat to Brazil meant that in order to qualify from their group, they would have to beat North Korea, Brazil needed to beat Portugal, and (thanks to Portugal&#x27;s 7–0 win over North Korea) there needed to be a substantial swing in goal difference. Ivory Coast won 3–0, but Portugal held Brazil to a 0–0 draw and Ivory Coast were once again eliminated in the group stages.

The team made a third appearance in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, where they were drawn in Group C against Colombia, Greece, and Japan. After coming from behind to beat Japan 2–1, Ivory Coast then lost 2–1 to Colombia, leaving their qualification in the balance. In their final match against Greece, the score was 1–1 going into stoppage time, and with Japan losing 4–1 to Colombia, Ivory Coast looked set to qualify. However, in the 93rd minute, Giovanni Sio gave away a penalty which Georgios Samaras converted, giving Greece both the victory and the place in the last 16; Ivory Coast, meanwhile, went out in the group stage for the third tournament in a row.

In 2015, the national team won the Africa Cup of Nations for a second time in Equatorial Guinea, defeating Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a scoreless game.

The team&#x27;s streak of World Cup qualifications came to an end at the 2018 tournament. Needing a win in their final match against Morocco, they lost 2–0, meaning Morocco qualified instead.

=== 2020s ===

In early 2024, Ivory Coast hosted the Africa Cup of Nations for the second time. Following a 4–0 defeat to Equatorial Guinea and third-placed finish in the group stage, coach Jean-Louis Gasset was dismissed, and assistant coach Emerse Faé was hired as caretaker in the knockout stages, as the national team qualified as one of the best third-placed teams. Later on, Ivory Coast managed to defeat the defending champions Senegal in the penalty shoot-outs, Mali after extra-time, and DR Congo in the semi-finals. They eventually won the title, defeating Nigeria 2–1 in the final, marking their third victory. For the first time in the history of the African Cup of Nations, it was won by a team that changed coaches during the tournament.

==Home stadium==
From 1964 to 2020, Felix Houphouet Boigny Stadium, a 50,000-seater stadium in Abidjan was the main venue used to host home matches. In 2020, the 60,000-seat Alassane Ouattara Stadium, also in Abidjan, was opened ahead of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.

==Supporters==
Supporters of the Elephants are known to be among the most colorful in Africa. At Ivory Coast matches, the Elephants supporter sections typically include a percussion band that mimics the sounds of an elephant traveling through a forest.

<text>The Parliament Act 1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. c. 103) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It reduced the power of the House of Lords to delay certain types of legislation – specifically public bills other than money bills – by amending the Parliament Act 1911.

Following the Labour Party&#x27;s election in 1945, Attlee&#x27;s government was worried that the Lords would delay their nationalisation programme. In particular, they feared that peers would reject the Iron and Steel Bill. To resolve the issue, the Commons passed the Parliament Bill in 1947, but it took until December 1949 for the law to be given royal assent under the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911.

This act is interpreted as one with the Parliament Act 1911. This act, and that act, may be cited together as the &quot;Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949&quot;.

==Parliament Act 1911==
The 1911 act placed the relationship between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing, removing the power of the Lords to veto money bills.

Other public bills could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that legislation introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent its being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session.

==Effects of 1949 act==
The 1949 act amended the 1911 act, reducing this delay to a single year. Section 2 defined the act&#x27;s short title as the &quot;Parliament Act 1949&quot; and stated that the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 should be construed together as one under that name.

==Legal challenge==
In &quot;Jackson v Attorney General&quot;, the validity of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned because it used the 1911 act to ensure its passage. The challenge asserted that the 1949 act was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 act had delegated power to the Commons. If this were the case, then the Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 act without direct permission from the Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 act, it had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the 1949 act was found to be legal. It was concluded that the 1911 act was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather was about restricting the ability of the Lords to affect legislation. This ruling also meant that efforts to abolish the House of Lords using the acts could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.

<text>Steinheuterode is a village and a former municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, in the center of Germany. On 1 January 2024 it became part of the municipality Uder.

==Location==
It is located at an altitude of 316 m at the foot of the Steinberg hill, and is surrounded by forest. The houses are arranged around the St. Alban church and a community center.

==Coat of arms==
In the center of Steinheuterode&#x27;s coat of arms is a billygoat, which refers to the nickname of the inhabitants: &quot;Steintreeder Zeggenböcke&quot;. There is a golden oak leaf on the left, representing the location of the municipality in Eichsfeld. The stump in the foreground is symbolic of the establishment of the village as a clearance village. The mountain at the bottom represents the location of Steinheuterode, at the foot of the Steinberg.

==History==
The first time the village was documented was in 1228, when it was called &quot;Hauwerterode&quot;. To distinguish it from the Eichsfeldian village Wüstheuterode, the prefix &quot;Stein&quot; was added. A manor was built in 1575 and in 1732 the fountain Regine was constructed in the courtyard of the manor, which today serves as a community center.

When gang master Hung died, his two followers Cheung and Chapman To were sent to Thailand to look for his son, Georgie Hung, to succeed him. Georgie, who is gay and lives as a cook with his boyfriend Frankie, is uninterested to continue his father&#x27;s work. But his close friend Sam, adored the life of a gangster and took his position instead. Sam and Georgie thus returned to Hong Kong with their identities swapped.

Upon returning, they discovered that Hung had accidentally killed Cheng Chow&#x27;s father and now Cheng Chow, a leading gangster of a friendly gang, led by Chan Wai-Man, is looking to avenge for his father&#x27;s death.

Meanwhile, Chan Wai-Man wanted to let his daughter Julie to marry Sam in order to strengthen the bond between the two gangs. Sam initially agrees but later changed his mind when he discovered that Julie is not in love with him.

Finally, Cheng Chow kidnapped both Julie and Sam and forced Georgie to lead his gang on a rescue mission. Georgie, with help from Julie and Sam, defeated Cheng Chow in the final battle and told him to accept the fact that his father&#x27;s death was an accident.

<text>Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though it falls under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting and playwriting—are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.

Creative writing can technically be considered any writing of original composition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. In her work, &quot;Foundations of Creativity&quot;, Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant&#x27;s &quot;Teaching the People&#x27;s Language&quot; to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:

== In academia==

Unlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the language, creative writing is believed to focus on students&#x27; self-expression. While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages of, if not throughout, primary and secondary school (K–12), perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in universities.

Following a reworking of university education in the post-war era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a Master of Arts degree at the University of East Anglia in 1970 by the novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:
===Programs of study===
Creative Writing programs are typically available to writers from the high school level all the way through graduate school/university and adult education. Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent times as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Creative Writing undergraduate degrees tend to be Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degrees, but Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees also exist. Some continue to pursue a Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts, or Master of Studies in Creative Writing. Once rare, Ph.D. programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.

Creative writers often place an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and it is normal to start with short stories or simple poems. They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of film and theatre, screenwriting and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs since creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.

== In the classroom ==
Creative writing is usually taught in a workshop format rather than seminar style. In workshops, students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as editing, structural techniques, genres, random idea generating, or unblocking writer&#x27;s block. Some noted authors, such as Michael Chabon, Sir Kazuo Ishiguro, Kevin Brockmeier, Ian McEwan, Karl Kirchwey, Dame Rose Tremain and reputed screenwriters, such as David Benioff, Darren Star and Peter Farrelly, have graduated from university creative writing programs.

Many educators find that using creative writing can increase students&#x27; academic performance and resilience. The activity of completing small goals consistently rather than unfinished big goals creates pride in one&#x27;s brain, which exudes dopamine throughout the brain and increases motivation. It has been shown to build resilience in students by documenting and analyzing their experiences, which gives the students a new perspective on an old situation and allows sorting of emotions. It also has been proven to increase a student&#x27;s level of compassion and create a sense of community among students in what could otherwise be deemed an isolating classroom.

===Creative writing influence on international students===

Creative writing may have an influence not only on native speaking students but also on international students. Educators who advocate for creative writing say incorporating creative writing classes or exercises has the potential to develop students into better readers, analysts, and writers. These same people say creative writing can have similar effects on international students by acting as a platform for them to share their own heritage, experiences, and values. Scholar Youngjoo Yi conducted a case-study that tested this idea over two years. Yi focused on an international student from Korea and examined how her creative writing class influenced her in-school and out-of-school writing. He concluded that taking the creative writing class ultimately made her a more confident writer not only in English but also in other languages. In addition to that, the projects done in her creative writing class encouraged her to express and connect her Korean heritage with her English writing. 

===Creative writing influence on composition studies=== 

Argument and research writing is a major focus in the field of composition studies. The focus on academic writing tends to leave little room for creative writing in writing studies. Gregory Stephens suggests that  focusing heavily on academic writing prevents students from developing their own unique writing style and voice. When he applied creative writing pedagogy techniques to STEM students at University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, he found exercises such as &quot;self-characterization&quot; and storytelling assignments helped his STEM students develop empathy, self-awareness, and a narrative voice. He suggests these are skills that are transferable to real-world situations such as professional settings. By engaging in creative writing exercises/activities, students are able to break free from the &quot;constraints of formal thinking and writing&quot; of academic writing, potentially boosting students’ confidence, creativity, and overall writing skills.

===Controversy in academia===
Creative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the US) to be an extension of the English discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the US and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.

Those who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students&#x27; abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer&#x27;s work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary studies outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to constitute experience in creative problem-solving.

Despite a large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught. Essayist Louis Menand explores the issue in an article for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in which he quotes Kay Boyle, the director of the creative writing program at San Francisco State University for sixteen years, who said, &quot;all creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.&quot; Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs&#x27; lack of both diversity and genre awareness.

The pedagogy of creative writing is also a source of controversy. Critics of MFA and English graduate programs argue that the methods of instruction discriminate against people with disabilities, emphasizing writing practices such as daily writing requirements or location-based writing that students with chronic illness, physical or mental health barriers, and neurodivergent students are unable to access. The selection of texts used in traditional creative writing programs is also being challenged, with critics pointing out that Western literary canon and writing pedagogy is &quot;historically rooted and linked to exclusion and structural racism in creative writing programs.&quot;

== In prisons ==
In the late 1960s, American prisons began implementing creative writing programs due to the prisoner rights movement that stemmed from events such as the Attica Prison riot. The creative writing programs are among many art programs that aim to benefit prisoners during and after their time in prison. Programs such as these provide education, structure, and a creative outlet to encourage rehabilitation. These programs&#x27; continuation relies heavily on volunteers and outside financial support from sources such as authors and activist groups.

The Poets Playwrights Essayists Editors and Novelists, known as PEN, were among the most significant contributors to creative writing programs in America. In 1971, PEN established the Prison Writing Committee to implement and advocate for creative writing programs in prisons throughout the U.S. The PEN Writing Committee improved prison libraries, inspired volunteer writers to teach prisoners, persuaded authors to host workshops, and founded an annual literary competition for prisoners. Workshops and classes help prisoners build self-esteem, make healthy social connections, and learn new skills, which can ease prisoner reentry.

Creative writing programs offered in juvenile correction facilities have also proved beneficial. In Alabama, &quot;Writing Our Stories&quot; began in 1997 as an anti-violence initiative to encourage positive self-expression among incarcerated youths. The program found that the participants gained confidence, the ability to empathize and see their peers in a more positive light, and motivation to want to return to society and live a more productive life.

One California study of prison fine arts programs found art education increased emotional control and decreased disciplinary reports. Participation in creative writing and other art programs result in significant positive outcomes for the inmates&#x27; mental health, relationship with their families, and the facility&#x27;s environment. The study evidenced improved writing skills enhanced one&#x27;s ability in other academic areas of study, portraying writing as a fundamental tool for building one&#x27;s intellect. Teaching prisoners creative writing can encourage literacy, teach necessary life skills, and provide prisoners with an outlet to express regret, accountability, responsibility, and a kind of restorative justice.

<text>The Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) ran rail and bus transport in Northern Ireland that operated from 1948 until 1967.

==Formation and consolidation==

The UTA was formed by the Transport Act 1948, which merged the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (NIRTB) and the Belfast and County Down Railway (BCDR). Added to this in 1949 was the Northern Counties Committee (NCC), owned by the British Transport Commission&#x27;s Railway Executive since its previous owner, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), had been nationalised in 1948.

==Branch railway closures==
In January 1950 the UTA closed almost the entire BCDR network except the Bangor branch line. In the same year it closed the – section of the former NCC&#x27;s Derry Central Railway and the freight-only branches to Draperstown and from Limavady to Dungiven. It also withdrew passenger services from the former NCC branch lines to Cookstown, Limavady and the – Kilrea section of the Derry Central. That summer it also closed Northern Ireland&#x27;s last narrow gauge lines: the Ballycastle Railway and the Ballymena and Larne Railway.

In 1954 seven 6-coach diesel units were put on the Belfast-Bangor line, making it the first completely dieselised passenger service in Ireland.

In 1955 the UTA closed the (by then freight-only) branches to Cookstown and Limavady, and the line between Castlewellan and Newcastle, County Down (which was still worked by the GNR).

In 1957 the Northern Ireland Government made the Great Northern Railway Board close much of its network in the province. This left no railways in many rural areas, including the whole of County Fermanagh. By 1958 the GNR main line was the only remaining railway across the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In that year what was left of the GNRB was dissolved and split between Córas Iompair Éireann (the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s nationalised transport company) and the UTA.

In 1959 the UTA closed the (by then freight only) remaining Magherafelt – Kilrea section of the Derry Central and the former GNR (by then freight only) branch from to Cookstown north of . The UTA also took over the Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners&#x27; dual gauge railway that linked Derry&#x27;s four railway termini, and in 1962 the UTA closed this railway as well.

==The Benson Report==
In 1962, on the recommendation of Dr Richard Beeching, the Government of Northern Ireland commissioned a senior Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountant, Sir Henry Benson, to report on the future of the UTA&#x27;s railways. In 1963 Benson submitted his report, which recommended closing all UTA railways except the Belfast commuter lines to Bangor and Larne and the main line between Belfast and Dublin, and the reduction of the main line between and to single track.

Benson recommended the only reason for retaining the main line between Portadown and Dundalk was not for transport or economics but solely political. The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s government objected to Benson&#x27;s proposal to single the track between Portadown and Dundalk so the Northern Ireland Government withdrew it.

Derry had two rail links with Belfast: the former NCC main line &quot;via&quot; and the former GNR one &quot;via&quot; Portadown. Benson&#x27;s recommendation to close both lines provoked strong protest from Northern Ireland&#x27;s second city and towns along both routes. The Northern Ireland Government responded by retaining the former NCC main line, which was slightly the shorter of the two but also served strongly Unionist parts of County Antrim, plus the short branch between Coleraine and the seaside resort of .

In 1965 the Northern Ireland government implemented Benson&#x27;s recommendation to close the former GNR route between Portadown and Derry, informally known as the &quot;Derry Road&quot;, at the cost of 400 jobs. This ended all railway services to stations including , , , and left the entire southwest of the province, including the whole of County Tyrone, with no rail services. The government also closed the Belfast Central Railway, (that Benson had recommended retaining). The branch between and was also closed, leaving Newry with no stations for 19 years until the reopening of the inconveniently sited Bessbrook station on the main line in 1984, which was some distance up a hill outside the town.

These closures left only the Belfast York Road – Londonderry Waterside, – and Coleraine – Portrush lines in service.

==Split into rail and road companies==
Transport Acts in 1967 split the UTA into road and rail operations, the bus operations being taken over by a new company called Ulsterbus in the same year. The rail operations temporarily became Ulster Transport Railways (UTR) before being taken over by Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) in 1968.

<text>In trigonometry, tangent half-angle formulas relate the tangent of half of an angle to trigonometric functions of the entire angle. 

== Formulae ==
The tangent of half an angle is the stereographic projection of the circle through the point at angle formula_1 radians onto the line through the angles formula_2. Among these formulas are the following:

formula_3

== Identities ==
From these one can derive identities expressing the sine, cosine, and tangent as functions of tangents of half-angles:

formula_4

==Proofs==
===Algebraic proofs===
Using double-angle formulae and the Pythagorean identity formula_5 gives

formula_6

formula_7
Taking the quotient of the formulae for sine and cosine yields

formula_8

Combining the Pythagorean identity with the double-angle formula for the cosine, formula_9

rearranging, and taking the square roots yields 

formula_10 and formula_11

which, upon division gives

formula_12 

Alternatively, 

formula_13

It turns out that the absolute value signs in these last two formulas may be dropped, regardless of which quadrant is in. With or without the absolute value bars these formulas do not apply when both the numerator and denominator on the right-hand side are zero.

Also, using the angle addition and subtraction formulae for both the sine and cosine one obtains:

formula_14

Pairwise addition of the above four formulae yields:

formula_15

Setting formula_16 and formula_17 and substituting yields:

formula_18

Dividing the sum of sines by the sum of cosines one arrives at:

formula_19

=== Geometric proofs ===

Applying the formulae derived above to the rhombus figure on the right, it is readily shown that

formula_20

In the unit circle, application of the above shows that formula_21. By similarity of triangles,

formula_22

It follows that

formula_23

== The tangent half-angle substitution in integral calculus ==

In various applications of trigonometry, it is useful to rewrite the trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine) in terms of rational functions of a new variable formula_24. These identities are known collectively as the tangent half-angle formulae because of the definition of formula_24. These identities can be useful in calculus for converting rational functions in sine and cosine to functions of in order to find their antiderivatives.

Geometrically, the construction goes like this: for any point on the unit circle, draw the line passing through it and the point . This point crosses the -axis at some point . One can show using simple geometry that . The equation for the drawn line is . The equation for the intersection of the line and circle is then a quadratic equation involving . The two solutions to this equation are and . This allows us to write the latter as rational functions of (solutions are given below).

The parameter represents the stereographic projection of the point onto the -axis with the center of projection at . Thus, the tangent half-angle formulae give conversions between the stereographic coordinate on the unit circle and the standard angular coordinate .

Then we have

formula_26

and

formula_27

Both this expression of formula_28 and the expression formula_29 can be solved for formula_30. Equating these gives the arctangent in terms of the natural logarithm
formula_31

In calculus, the tangent half-angle substitution is used to find antiderivatives of rational functions of and . Differentiating formula_32 gives 
formula_33
and thus
formula_34

===Hyperbolic identities===
One can play an entirely analogous game with the hyperbolic functions. A point on (the right branch of) a hyperbola is given by . Projecting this onto -axis from the center gives the following:

formula_35

with the identities

formula_36

and

formula_37

Finding in terms of leads to following relationship between the inverse hyperbolic tangent formula_38 and the natural logarithm:

formula_39

The hyperbolic tangent half-angle substitution in calculus uses
formula_40

==The Gudermannian function==
Comparing the hyperbolic identities to the circular ones, one notices that they involve the same functions of , just permuted. If we identify the parameter in both cases we arrive at a relationship between the circular functions and the hyperbolic ones. That is, if

formula_41

then

formula_42

where is the Gudermannian function. The Gudermannian function gives a direct relationship between the circular functions and the hyperbolic ones that does not involve complex numbers. The above descriptions of the tangent half-angle formulae (projection the unit circle and standard hyperbola onto the -axis) give a geometric interpretation of this function.

==Rational values and Pythagorean triples==

Starting with a Pythagorean triangle with side lengths , , and that are positive integers and satisfy , it follows immediately that each interior angle of the triangle has rational values for sine and cosine, because these are just ratios of side lengths. Thus each of these angles has a rational value for its half-angle tangent, using .

The reverse is also true. If there are two positive angles that sum to 90°, each with a rational half-angle tangent, and the third angle is a right angle then a triangle with these interior angles can be scaled to a Pythagorean triangle. If the third angle is not required to be a right angle, but is the angle that makes the three positive angles sum to 180° then the third angle will necessarily have a rational number for its half-angle tangent when the first two do (using angle addition and subtraction formulas for tangents) and the triangle can be scaled to a Heronian triangle.

Generally, if is a subfield of the complex numbers then implies that .

<text>Listed below are the dates and results for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] qualification rounds for [[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]].

44 Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but Cambodia, Philippines, Bhutan and Brunei decided not to take part, and Myanmar were banned from the competition (for refusing to play a qualifier in Iran during 2002 qualifying), so a total of 39 teams took part, competing for 4.5 places in the World Cup.

==Format==
The qualification was composed of three rounds. Only the 14 last ranked teams according to FIFA took part in the Preliminary Round, where they were paired 2-by-2 and played home-and-away knock-out matches. The 7 winners joined the other 25 teams in the second round, where those 32 teams were divided in 8 groups of four teams each. The teams in each group would play against each other home-and-away, and the team with most points in each group would advance to the Third Round.

In the third round, the 8 remaining teams were divided in two groups of 4 teams each, that would again play against each other in a home-and-away basis. The two teams with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup. The two third placed teams would play-off against each other home-and-away. Winner of this play-off would play against the fourth placed team in the final round of CONCACAF in an intercontinental play-off for a place in the World Cup.

==First round==




Guam and Nepal were scheduled to play against each other on November 21 and 25; Nepal withdrew, so Guam progressed to the 2nd round, but Guam later withdrew.

FIFA then decided to elect a &quot;lucky loser&quot;, to select the best of the teams that lost, to advance to the second round.

The losers were compared, using the following criteria to break ties: a) number of points; b) goal difference; c) goals scored.

Laos advanced to the second round.

==Second round==
In the second round, the 25 teams who received byes, as well as the 7 play-off round winners, were split into eight groups of four teams each. Teams played home-and-away games with the other teams in their group, and the top-ranked team qualified for the third round.

===Group 1===
===Group 2===
===Group 3===
===Group 4===
===Group 5===
===Group 6===
===Group 7===
===Group 8===
==Third round==
In the third round, the 8 teams who won their groups in the earlier round were split into two groups of four teams each. Teams played home-and-away games with the other teams in their group, and the top two teams qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, the third-placed teams entered a play-off to determine who would contest the AFC–CONCACAF play-off.

===Group 1===
===Group 2===
==Fourth round==

Teams finishing 3rd in the third round groups played each other to determine a possible 5th qualifier from Asia. The first leg was originally played on 3 September 2005 but the match was ordered to be replayed by FIFA after a refereeing mistake. With Uzbekistan leading the tie 1–0, a penalty was awarded to them but the referee disallowed the resulting goal and offered an indirect freekick to Bahrain for encroachment. Uzbekistan had formally requested for the match to be recorded as an automatic 3–0 victory.

Bahrain advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off on the away goals rule.

==Inter-confederation play-offs==
The Fourth Round winner then played the fourth-placed team of the CONCACAF qualifying group, Trinidad and Tobago, in a home-and-away play-off. The winner of this play-off qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals.
==Qualified teams==
The following four teams from AFC qualified for the final tournament.

<text>Solesmes () is a commune in the Sarthe department and Pays de la Loire region of north-western France.

Lying close to the small town of Sablé-sur-Sarthe and almost entirely agricultural in character, the commune is especially noted as the site of the Benedictine Abbey of St Peter, founded in 1010, suppressed by the National Constituent Assembly in 1791, and re-established by Dom Prosper Guéranger in 1833. A second abbey for women, St Cecilia&#x27;s, is also located here.

<doc id="1039904" wikidata="Q5266012" url="?curid=1039904" title="Detroit Stars">
<text>The Detroit Stars were an American baseball team in the Negro leagues and played at historic Mack Park. The Stars had winning seasons every year but two, but were never able to secure any championships. Among their best players was Baseball Hall of Famer Turkey Stearnes.

== Founding ==
Founded in 1919 by Tenny Blount with the help of Rube Foster, owner and manager of the Chicago American Giants, the Detroit Stars immediately established themselves as one of the most powerful teams in the West. Foster transferred several of his veteran players to the team, including player-manager Pete Hill and legendary catcher Bruce Petway. Left-hander John Donaldson, Frank Wickware, Dicta Johnson, and Cuban great José Méndez took up the pitching duties, and Texan Edgar Wesley was brought in to handle first base, a job he would hold for several years.

== League play ==

The Stars became a charter member of the Negro National League (NNL) in 1920. New outfielder Jimmie Lyons enjoyed a brilliant season at bat, and Detroit came in second with a 35–23 record. The next season Lyons was transferred to the American Giants, and the team slumped to 32–32 and fourth place. This would be their low point for some time. For the rest of their tenure in the NNL, the Stars were consistently good (finishing under .500 only twice), but not brilliant (finishing as high as second place only twice).

The mainstays of the Detroit Stars during the 1920s were Hall of Fame center fielder Turkey Stearnes, who ranks among the all-time Negro league leaders in nearly every batting category; Hall of Fame pitcher Andy Cooper, a workhorse southpaw; pitcher Bill Holland; and first baseman Wesley, who led the league in home runs twice and batting average once. Pete Hill left after the 1921 season. Bruce Petway took his place as manager until 1926, when Candy Jim Taylor briefly held the position. Bingo DeMoss, yet another Rube Foster protégé, took over in 1927, and finally led the team to its first postseason berth in 1930. The Stars won the second-half season title, only to lose the playoff series to the St. Louis Stars.

== Decline and demise ==

After the collapse of the Negro National League at the end of 1931, the original Stars baseball team disbanded. They were replaced in 1932 by the Detroit Wolves of the East–West League.

== Home fields ==

During the 1920s the Stars made their home at Mack Park before moving to Hamtramck Stadium during the 1930–1931 seasons.

<doc id="1039920" wikidata="Q1859823" url="?curid=1039920" title="Shabby chic">
<text>Shabby chic is a style of interior design that chooses either furniture and furnishings for their appearance of age and signs of wear and tear or distresses new ones to achieve the same result. Unlike much genuine period décor, this style features a soft, pastel-colored, cottage look.

==Description==
Shabby chic furniture is often antiques that have been heavily painted through the years, with many layers showing through obviously time-worn areas. Furnishings that are not genuine relics are usually selected for their resemblance to older styles, and may be reproduction pieces with a distressed finish that is faux painted using glaze or rubbing and sanding away of a painted top coat to show the wood or base coats. Elaborate furniture appliqués depicting flower swags and garlands, cherubs, and other motifs may be added. Repurposed antique pieces of obsolete usage such as pie safes and jelly cupboards are popular in shabby chic décor. Also popular are pillows made of old barkcloth fabric, vintage bed linens, chenille bedspreads, antique chandeliers, jute, and patterns of flowers, especially roses.

Fabrics tend to be cottons and linens, with linen being particularly popular, inspired by old French linens. Pure whites, as well as ecrus and worn or bleached-out pastel colors, are favorites, and &quot;bleached&quot; and &quot;faded&quot; are typical descriptions, although fabric may also be stained with tea for an antique look. Vintage floral patterns with pale colors, earth tones, and cotton ticking patterns are typical of shabby chic style. &quot;Newsweek&quot; used the term &quot;shabby chic&quot; to describe the avant-garde fashion designer Martin Margiela&#x27;s 1992 fall fashion show, which took place in a Salvation Army furniture store and featured models in &quot;wrinkled jackets, baggy-kneed pants and coats with inner linings hanging down from unfinished hems.&quot;

The general color scheme, besides white, is soft and neutral, often sky blue, rose pink, and beige. Hints from French-style interior design often show in shabby chic homes, such as Rococo-style lighting fixtures, furniture or wall paneling. The shabby chic aesthetic also expands to the garden, with the same design principles of using timeworn garden furniture and soft-hued accessories. Rose gardens are popular with the shabby chic style of décor.

Decorators consider shabby chic a relaxed, romantic style that looks comfortable, inviting, and feminine. The masculine counterpart would be &quot;rustic,&quot; with deeper or richer colors and rustic furniture using unfinished wood, denim, burlap, sailcloth and homespun cloth.

Varieties of shabby chic style include:

* Cottage chic
* Beach cottage chic
* French country
* Gustavian (Swedish)

==History==
The style started in Great Britain and evokes the type of decoration found in large country houses where there are worn and faded old chintz sofas, curtains, and paintwork and unassuming &quot;good&quot; taste, in understated contrast to the sentimental, overstated Victorian fashion. Though these forms were rather grand, the style has evolved to take in not just ornate decoration, as in the classic French château, but that of 18th-century Swedish and of the American Shakers, for whom simplicity and plainness was essential.

Recycling old furniture and fabrics has long been an important aspect of the look and was especially popular with the modern Bohemians and artisans who made up a sidelined counterculture movement during the 1980s, when expensive quality décor became very fashionable with the upper-middle classes. Rachel Ashwell founded a furniture chain called Shabby Chic and in 1996 published a book around the aesthetic, which she described as &quot;the aura of old money, cushy comfort, and crafted indifference.&quot;

An offshoot of shabby chic is a trend towards &quot;relicking&quot; (from &quot;relic&quot;) of guitars and bass guitars to create a &quot;roadworn&quot; appearance.

==Origin of term==
The phrase was used descriptively through the 20th century for both fashion and décor, and was popularized as an interior decorating style by Min Hogg in &quot;The World of Interiors&quot; magazine in the 1980s. It became popular in the United States in the 1990s with a certain eclectic surge of decorating styles with paints and effects, notably in metropolitan cultural centers on the West Coast of America, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, with heavy influences from Mediterranean cultures such as Provence, Tuscany, and Greece.

<text>The Gone Jackals were an American rock band formed by frontman Keith Karloff in 1984 and based in San Francisco, California. Originally named &quot;Keith Gale&#x27;s Parallel Universe&quot;, the first lineup consisted of Charlie Hunter, Rudy Maynard and Mark Berdon and played in the local San Francisco club scene. In 1989, after Hunter and Berdon left to pursue other projects, the band was rebranded with the addition of Judd Austin and Trey Sabatelli as &quot;The Gone Jackals&quot;, releasing their first album &quot;Out and About with the Gone Jackals&quot; in 1990.

The band&#x27;s music generally consisted of hard, garage and blues rock. Their next album, &quot;Bone to Pick&quot; (1995) also incorporated heavy metal. The band collaborated with Peter McConnell of LucasArts to produce the soundtrack to the biker-themed adventure game &quot;Full Throttle&quot;; tracks from &quot;Bone to Pick&quot; were specifically adapted for this purpose. &quot;Blue Pyramid&quot; (1998), their third and final album, also included experimentation with psychedelic rock.

The band broke up in 1999, though not before signing up a new label for distributing their music in Europe. In late 2001, Karloff started working on a new musical project. Led by his passion for the old style rock music, he formed the Bonedrivers, a blues rock power trio which has since then toured the United States and published a locally acclaimed debut album named &quot;Roadhouse Manifesto&quot;, an even bigger second outing titled &quot;Mobile&quot;, and a third one titled &quot;Greasefire&quot;.

==History==
The Gone Jackals were founded during the late 1980s by multi-instrumentalist Keith Karloff, a drummer, guitarist and songwriter who used to play as a solo artist in New York City since the early 1980s, under the stage name &quot;Keith Gale&quot;.

After moving to San Francisco in 1984, Karloff begun to search for supporting musicians to form a new band. Bassist Rudy Maynard and guitarist virtuoso Charlie Hunter were the first to join him. In addition to them, drummer Mark Berdon came to complete the line-up. Together they formed a band called &quot;Keith Gale&#x27;s Parallel Universe&quot; and started to play regularly at local clubs. Soon, they signed to Blue/Black Records and released their first EP, a promo cassette named &quot;Five Piece Screwdriver Set&quot;.

In the subsequent years, Charlie Hunter decided to leave the band and was replaced by rock guitarist Judd Austin. After a while, Mark Berdon left the band too. Drummer Trey Sabatelli came in his place and with the strength of this new line-up, Keith Karloff managed to give birth to &quot;The Gone Jackals&quot;, the final incarnation of the band. It was then that &quot;Keith Gale&quot; decided to change his name to &quot;Keith Karloff&quot;.

In 1990, The Gone Jackals released their official debut album, &quot;Out and About with the Gone Jackals&quot;. The songs were a mix of classical sounds and styles of rock music, and had a moderate success on independent radio stations throughout California and Washington state. Following the release of the album, The Gone Jackals began to tour the state of California from town to town.

Their second full-length album, &quot;Bone to Pick&quot;, was published in 1995. Its songs were chosen by Peter McConnell, music director of the LucasArts team, to be featured as the soundtrack of the new video game they were working on, &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. Keith Karloff also helped McConnell to compose some original tracks for the game. 
Thanks to &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, &quot;Bone to Pick&quot; became the most famous and acclaimed album of the band, even gaining considerable attention outside of the United States. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and its great success induced Blue/Black Records to produce a new run of &quot;Out and About with the Gone Jackals&quot;, the band&#x27;s previous album.

In 1998 a third album came out. It was called &quot;Blue Pyramid&quot; and was the band&#x27;s most ambitious project. With this album, Karloff consolidated his American-style hard rock attitude while trying to experiment in a few new directions, such as psychedelia. Some of the songs from the album received radio airplay in various national stations, while the band promoted &quot;Blue Pyramid&quot; with a new tour that brought them from Texas to South Carolina, as well as all over California.

During the year 1999, The Gone Jackals signed to the international record label Raspberry Records, with the intent of publicizing and distributing their music in Europe. Raspberry Records provided to re-release all of their albums, in addition to two previously unreleased singles, the song &quot;Faith Healer&quot; (which is a cover of the famous Alex Harvey Band&#x27;s hit) and a re-edited version of &quot;No Sign of Rain&quot; (an original audio track from &quot;Blue Pyramid&quot;).

<text>San Pietro in Valle is a medieval abbey in the &quot;comune&quot; (township) of Ferentillo in Umbria.
The Romanesque church houses some particularly fine Roman sarcophagi; the walls of the nave are decorated with a large cycle of good Romanesque frescoes. The monastery buildings are private property and today house a luxury hotel.

==History==
It was built in the 8th century by Faroaldo II, Duke of Spoleto, in the places where the hermits Lazzaro and Giovanni are said to have lived. According to a legend, the Duke of Spoleto saw in a dream the same Saint Peter who invited him to build a Benedictine monastery in the place of the present abbey. A few years later the duke gave up the title and became a monk in the abbey. Since then, the monastery was closely linked to the city of Spoleto, welcoming the remains of many of the dukes of the city.

At the end of the ninth century the monastery suffered, as it happened shortly after in Farfa, the sacking of the Saracens and was resurrected only in 996 at the behest of Otto III. In 1234 Pope Gregory IX assigns the abbey to the Cistercians in line with what happened in Lazio region under Pope Innocent III.

In 1484 Pope Innocent VIII gave the fief of the abbey to the Cybo family. Since 1917 the convent has passed into private hands and today, renovated, it is used as a hotel.

Pope Innocent VIII (Giovan Battista Cybo - i.e. Giobatta remembered as the Roman pontiff who began the merciless witch hunt), as mentioned, constituted a principality for his son Franceschetto Cybo, naming him, in addition to Duke of Spoleto, also Count of Ferentillo and therefore governor of the abbey. Franceschetto, who married Maddalena de &#x27;Medici, was succeeded by his son Lorenzo Cybo, who married Ricciarda Malaspina, Marquess of Massa and Carrara. Alberico I Cybo was born from the marriage, who, after the death of his mother Ricciarda, also assumed (again at the behest of his mother) the surname of Malaspina. Alberico I Cybo-Malaspina thus became Marquis of Massa, Lord of Carrara, Count of Ferentillo governor of Monteleone di Spoleto and therefore also lord of the Abbey of San Pietro in Valle. The dominion fief of the Cybo Malaspina lasted until 1730 with Alderano Cybo. However, the abbey always had the command of the Spoleto noble Ancaiani until its final sale in 1907. The building is a national monument visited by many tourists for its works of art, such as the cycle of frescoes of the Roman school (1150) prior to Cavallini; the frescoes in the apse by the Eggi master of 1445.

==Art==
The church, which has remained as a separate body from the abbey, has a single nave that dates back to the 7th century; the apse dates back to the 12th century. It preserves valuable medieval and Renaissance frescoes from the Umbrian school depicting scenes from the Old and New Testament.

Four sarcophagi preserved in the church date back to the 2nd century, which for the style and the representations suggest oriental artists:

*Sarcophagus with three boats (voyage to Hades).
*Sarcophagus of Faroaldo with Dionysus, Silenus, Pan and dancing Maenad.
*Sarcophagus of Cupid and Psyche
*Sarcophagus of the hunters.

===The carved slab of Bear===
The two slabs of the main altar, carved in bas-relief, are from the Lombard period. On the front of the altar runs an inscription in Latin, with curious mixed capital and lowercase characters: &quot;Ilderico Dagileopa, in honor of St. Peter and for the love of St. Leo and St. Gregory, for the salvation of the soul (pro remedio animae) &quot;. Ilderico was Duke of Spoleto between 739 and 742. The slab is also adorned with two bizarre figures, with their arms bent at 90 ° and raised upwards, with bare chest and wearing a short skirt. The figures are surrounded by stylized plant stems, which culminate in discs with inscribed crosses. One of the two figures wields a sort of stiletto, which some believe to be a chisel. This would suggest that the figure represents Ursus (Bear), the sculptor indicated as the author of the engraving by the inscription Ursus magester fecit (&quot;The master Bear did it&quot;).

It is more difficult to understand who the other figure is: the kilt, a garment perhaps suited to the activity of a sculptor, does not suit the dignity of the duke. The raised arms have been interpreted as a ritual attitude and, in this case, the kilt would correspond to the cloth that is worn after baptism (which, in ancient times, was carried out by complete immersion). The pose would correspond to that of the contemporary bone altar of the Bishop Ludgero in Werden (hamlet of Essen) or to that of the sarcophagus of Bishop Agilbert in the crypt of Jouarre (France), slightly older. In a recent article published in the monthly &quot;Medioevo&quot; (Italian monthly magazine of medieval study) in February 2016, Elena Percivaldi also added other hypotheses, while confirming the interpretation of the scene as of a ritual nature.

This one of San Pietro in Valle is one of the very rare cases, in medieval art, in which the client can easily be distinguished from the artist, thanks to the fact that they are both mentioned.

<text>Catherine Roxburgh Carswell (née Macfarlane; 27 March 1879 – 18 February 1946) was a Scottish author, biographer and journalist, now known as one of the few women to take part in the Scottish Renaissance. Her biography of the Scottish poet Robert Burns aroused controversy, but two earlier novels of hers, set in Edwardian Glasgow, were little noticed until their republication by the feminist publishing house Virago in 1987. Her work is now seen as integral to Scottish women&#x27;s writing of the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Catherine Macfarlane was born in Glasgow, the second of four children of George and Mary Anne Macfarlane (née Lewis), middle-class Free Church Glaswegians. She attended the city&#x27;s new Park School for Girls and grew up in Garnethill, where Glasgow School of Art is situated. She attended evening classes there, where the director of the life class from 1906 was the painter Maurice Greiffenhagen, with whom she later had a relationship. In 1901 she enrolled for English literature classes at the University of Glasgow. Among her professors were Walter Raleigh and Adolphus A. Jack. Although seen as a star pupil she could not, as a woman, be awarded a degree. She then studied music for two years at the Frankfurt Hoch Conservatory, a period she drew on when writing &quot;The Camomile&quot;. She returned to Glasgow intent on a future in the arts.

==First marriage==
In September 1904, Macfarlane met her first husband, Herbert Jackson, a Second Boer War veteran and artist suffering from paranoid delusions. She married him after a &quot;whirlwind courtship&quot; of only a month. Thinking he was sterile, he accused Catherine of betraying him when he heard news of her pregnancy and in March 1905 threatened to kill her. He was placed in a mental institution for the rest of his life, being considered too dangerous for release. He never met his daughter, Diana, who was born the following October and died in 1913.

In 1908 Catherine made legal history when her marriage with Herbert Jackson was dissolved after she had shown that his mental illness had started before their engagement, so that he was unaware of what he was doing when he married her.

==Critic and writer==
Working as a critic for the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;, Macfarlane began a relationship with the artist Maurice Greiffenhagen, who then was at the height of his fame and went on to be an academician. He was her elder by 17 years, married and with a family. Around this time she began to establish numerous literary connections. She later became a close friend of D. H. Lawrence.

Her daughter Diana died of pneumonia in 1913, two years after they had moved to London. Around that time she started work on her first novel, &quot;Open the Door!&quot;, and became engaged to Donald Carswell, an acquaintance from Glasgow University and the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;, whom she married early in 1915. Their son John was born the following autumn.

The same year she lost her job after writing a favourable review of Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, but remained in the press as assistant drama critic for the &quot;Observer&quot;. During the autumn of 1916 she had nearly finished her novel and exchanged lengthy letters about it with Lawrence, who in return asked for advice on his newest novel, &quot;Women in Love&quot;.

Carswell&#x27;s &quot;Open the Door!&quot; finally appeared in 1920 and won her a 250-guinea (£262.10s) Andrew Melrose Prize. Without being autobiographical, her story of the Glaswegian Joanna resembles in many ways her own life in search of independence. Melrose, who selected the book personally, said it made a &quot;profound impression&quot; on him. Two years later she published her second and last novel, &quot;The Camomile&quot;, another portrait of a woman living in Glasgow at the turn of the century.

==Biographer==
Neither of her first two books brought her fame or fortune. She became well known only after finishing a controversial biography of Scotland&#x27;s national poet, Robert Burns, in 1930. Orthodox Burns fans dismissed this frank, demystifying account of the poet&#x27;s life. The Burns Club attacked her with sermons in Glasgow Cathedral and someone sent her a bullet accompanied by a letter asking her to &quot;make the world a cleaner place.&quot;

After the death of D. H. Lawrence, Carswell immediately started working on his biography, which appeared in 1932 as &quot;The Savage Pilgrimage&quot;. The book&#x27;s first printing contained passages regarded as libelous by John Middleton Murry, who tried to suppress it (he had authored a rival biography, &quot;Son of Woman&quot;, to which Carswell&#x27;s work was essentially a response). Murry&#x27;s threats to sue for libel resulted in the publisher, Chatto and Windus, withdrawing unsold copies of the first edition from the market and making changes and deletions that affected subsequent printings until, long after Murry&#x27;s death in 1957, the original text was republished in 1981 by Cambridge University Press.

==Later life==
In the 1930s there followed three anthologies, some journalistic reviews, and a third biography, &quot;The Tranquil Heart&quot; (1937), about the Italian Renaissance author and poet Giovanni Boccaccio. In 1936 came a publication dedicated to Lord Tweedsmuir (John Buchan), written in collaboration with her husband Donald and illustrator Evelyn Dunbar (later commissioned as one of the few female official British WW2 artists): &quot;The Scots Week-End and Caledonian Vade-Mecum for Host, Guest and Wayfarer&quot; (George Routledge &amp; Sons Ltd).

In 1940 her husband Donald was killed in a street accident during the blackout. She continued to live alone in London, working on a two-volume biography of John Buchan together with his widow, Lady Tweedsmuir. Volume 1, &quot;The Clearing House&quot;, appeared in 1946 and Volume 2, &quot;John Buchan by His Wife and Friends&quot;, in 1947.

Catherine Carswell died of pleurisy after pneumonia on 18 February 1946, aged 66, at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. Her son John edited her fragmentary autobiographical texts and published them in 1950 as &quot;Lying Awake: An Unfinished Autobiography&quot;.

<doc id="1039928" wikidata="Q7830180" url="?curid=1039928" title="Townsend Hoopes">
<text>Townsend Walter Hoopes II (April 28, 1922 – September 20, 2004) was an American historian and government official, who reached the height of his career as Under Secretary of the Air Force from 1967 to 1969.

==Biography==

Hoopes, known as Tim, was born in Duluth, Minnesota. He graduated from Phillips Academy before attending Yale College, where he became a member of the Skull and Bones society. He served as captain of the 1943 Yale Bulldogs football team, graduating in 1944. Later, he graduated from the National War College as well.

Hoopes married twice. His first marriage to Marion Schmidt ended in divorce. They had two sons together: Townsend Walter Hoopes III and Peter Schmidt Hoopes. His second marriage to Ann Merrifield lasted 40 years, until his death. They had a daughter together: Andrea Hoopes DeGirolamo. He also had four stepchildren: Lise Jeantet, Cecily Hoopes Lyons, Briggs Swift Cunningham IV, and F. Thomas B.C. Hoopes. Additionally, he had 11 grandchildren including a grandson bearing his name, Hunter Townsend Hoopes.

Hoopes died in 2004 from complications of melanoma.

==Career==
During World War II, he served as a Marine Lieutenant in the Pacific theater of the war, participating in the U.S. 5th Marine Division capture of Iwo Jima and the initial occupation of Japan. Afterwards, he became assistant to the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee from 1947 to 1948. He continued as staff aide to three Secretaries of Defense: James Forrestal, General George Marshall and Robert A. Lovett from 1948 to 1953.

He then went on to work in the private sector for a number of years, spending 7 years as partner of an international consulting firm: Cresap, McCormick and Paget.

In 1964, he returned to public service as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International affairs. From 1965 to 1967, he was Principal Deputy for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon.

Serving as Under Secretary of the Air Force at the Pentagon from 1967 to 1969, he witnessed firsthand the effect of the 1968 Tet Offensive and Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s subsequent decision to de-escalate the war in Vietnam.

After leaving the government, he became fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars for two years. From 1973 to 1986, Hoopes was president of the Association of American Publishers.

In a telephone conversation between Richard Nixon and Charles Colson, taped on July 1, 1971, Colson relates the news that Lyndon Johnson privately believed that Hoopes had played a role in releasing the Pentagon Papers to the press, and that he would have liked to see Hoopes taken to court by the government alongside various newspapermen. A 1996 article in The New York Times said that the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration &quot;systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress.&quot;

Hoopes also became co-chairman of Americans for SALT, director of the American Committee on U.S. Soviet Relations, and a distinguished international executive at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2002, he became senior fellow of Washington College.

From the mid-1980s to 1995, Hoopes and his wife ran Hoopes Troupe, a charitable amateur singing group that performed around Washington, D.C., including at the Supreme Court.

==Awards==
* 1974 Bancroft Prize

==Bibliography==
Hoopes was a prolific writer of books and articles. His 1969 book &quot;The Limits of Intervention&quot; () is the most widely known. The book deals with the period from 1965 to President Johnson&#x27;s March 31, 1968 speech ordering a partial bombing halt and announcing that he would not run for re-election. As well as serving as Hoopes&#x27;s memoir, the book offered an insider&#x27;s view of the post-Tet Offensive decision-making within the Pentagon, especially that of Secretary of Defense Clark M. Clifford. The book described how the Tet Offensive undermined the support within the government and the country for the strategy of aerial bombardment and ground search-and-destroy missions, fostering instead the view that further escalation of the war was futile. (In a Washington Post article a year later, he acknowledged &quot;that the Tet Offensive was not the shattering military defeat for the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces it appeared to both Washington and the American people.&quot;)

&quot;The Limits of Intervention&quot; also made clear that, from the end of 1965 on, Hoopes favored a change in the Johnson administration&#x27;s Vietnam policy: &quot;As 1965 came to an end, I had become a great deal more skeptical about the U.S. performance in Vietnam -- about the validity of our stated purposes, the official assessment of the problems we faced, and our ability to control events.&quot; (p. 43)

His other writings include:
* &quot;The Devil and John Foster Dulles&quot; (1973), received Bancroft Prize, 
* &quot;Eye Power&quot; (1979), written with his wife, 
* &quot;Townsend Hoopes on Arms Control&quot; (1987), a collection of his essays and speeches, 
* 
* &quot;A Textured Web&quot; (2002), fiction,

<text>Magnus Erlingsson (, 1156 – 15 June 1184), also known as Magnus V, was a king of Norway during the civil war era in Norway. He helped to establish primogeniture in royal succession in Norway. King Magnus was killed in the Battle of Fimreite in 1184 against the forces of Sverre Sigurdsson who became King of Norway.

==Biography==
Magnus Erlingsson was probably born in Etne in Hordaland. He was the son of Erling Skakke, a Norwegian nobleman who earned his reputation crusading with Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, the earl of Orkney. Magnus&#x27;s mother, Kristin, was the daughter of Sigurd the Crusader, who was the king of Norway from 1103 to 1130. Magnus Erlingsson was named king in 1161 at the age of five. He was the first Norwegian king to be crowned. His father Erling took the title of earl and held the real power since Magnus was a minor. Erling Skakke continued to be the country’s real ruler even after Magnus had come of age.

In 1166, Sigurd Agnhatt and his foster son Olav Ugjæva raised a force in Oppland, and had Olav proclaimed king, while Earl Erling Skakke was away in Denmark. Olav was the son of Maria Øysteinsdotter, the daughter of former King Øystein Magnusson. After Erling returned to Norway to fight this uprising, Olav and his men attacked Erling in an ambush at Rydjokul in Sørum. Erling was wounded and barely escaped. In 1168 Olav and his men ventured south to the Oslofjord area, but were there defeated in battle at Stanger in Våler. Sigurd was killed in the battle, but Olav escaped and went to Denmark.

Magnus&#x27; reign saw the arrival in Norway of Sverre Sigurdsson, who claimed the throne for himself as an allegedly illegitimate son of a previous king. In June 1177, Sverre first led his men to Trøndelag where Sverre was proclaimed as king. Erling&#x27;s position was compromised and he fell at the Battle of Kalvskinnet outside Nidaros in 1179. 

Several more years of warfare ended with Magnus&#x27; defeat and death in the Battle of Fimreite on June 15, 1184. Sverre attacked Magnus&#x27; fleet sending his ships into battle in squadrons, to charge and overwhelm on one ship at a time, forcing the Magnus&#x27; men to jump over to the next. As the battle proceeded, the remaining ships became extremely crammed, and then started to go down because of the weight. King Magnus is reported to have gone down on one of the last of them.

==Historic context==
The civil war era in Norway would not end with the victory of Sverre over Magnus. After the death of Magnus, Sigurd Magnusson, Inge Magnusson and Erling Magnusson Steinvegg came forth all stating to be sons of Magnus and claiming the Norwegian throne. The civil war era in Norway extended over a 110-year period. It started with the death of King Sigurd I of Norway in 1130 and ended with the death of Duke Skule Baardsson in 1240.

During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts was the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between Church and King. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party.

<text>L.A. Guns are an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1983. The lineup currently consists of Tracii Guns (lead guitar), Phil Lewis (lead vocals), Ace Von Johnson (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Johnny Martin (bass, backing vocals), Adam Hamilton (studio drums) and Shawn Duncan (live drums). The first incarnation of the group was formed by Tracii Guns and Rob Gardner in 1983 and merged with fellow Los Angeles group Hollywood Rose to form Guns N&#x27; Roses in March 1985. After only a brief tenure in that band, Guns reformed L.A. Guns with a new lineup, consisting of Paul Black, Mick Cripps, Robert Stoddard, and Nickey Alexander. Black would soon be replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels was added to the group. Later, Alexander would be replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with this being known as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of L.A. Guns. They achieved moderate chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the group went through numerous lineup changes (with Riley being the most consistent member) and failed to regain mainstream attention.

The &quot;classic lineup&quot; of the group would reunite in 1999 and began recording new material. However, the group continued to change lineups and Guns eventually left to form the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe in 2002. L.A. Guns continued without Guns, bringing in guitarist Stacey Blades; however, following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus in 2006, Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band. The group&#x27;s lineup consisted of former L.A. Guns members Black and Alexander as well as Jeremy Guns (though the lineup would eventually change), with the group eventually changing their name to L.A. Guns. Both groups continued to record and tour under the L.A. Guns moniker until 2012, when the Tracii Guns-led version of the group disbanded. Riley died in 2023, and the Riley-led version of the group disbanded in 2025.

==History==
===Formation and Guns N&#x27; Roses (1983–1985)===

L.A. Guns were first formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner. The first lineup included singer Mike Jagosz, bassist Ole Beich and Gardner. Guns, Gardner and Jagosz met at Fairfax High School and previously played in a band called Pyrrhus with bassist Dani Tull. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition No. 1&quot;, before Jagosz was replaced by Axl Rose. Originally released on vinyl, the record was produced and engineered by Blues/Rock guitarist Chuck Rosa and came out on Raz Records (an independent Hollywood based record label, named after the band&#x27;s manager, Raz Cue). The same material would later be released as a bonus disc with the compilation album &quot;Hollywood Raw&quot; in 2004.

Rose fronted the group Rapidfire before going on to form Hollywood Rose, a group formed following the introduction of guitarists Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber to each other by Guns. Following the breakup of Hollywood Rose, in 1984, singer Rose joined L.A. Guns. However, Hollywood Rose reunited, briefly, with Rose, Stradlin, Weber and Steve Darrow returning while L.A. Guns drummer Gardner also joined the group. Weber, who left to move to New York City, was soon replaced by Tracii Guns. The group changed their name to Guns N&#x27; Roses (combining the names of L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose) with the lineup composed of Axl Rose, Tracii Guns, Izzy Stradlin, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner.

Beich was eventually replaced by Duff McKagan while Guns left the group (after a falling out with Rose), being replaced by Slash. McKagan went on to book shows taking place between Sacramento and Seattle, which was dubbed &quot;The Hell Tour&quot;. During this time, Gardner quit the group and was replaced by Steven Adler with this line-up becoming known as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

===Reformation and mainstream success (1985–1992)===

Later, in 1986, Guns reformed L.A. Guns with Mick Cripps, Paul Black, Nickey Alexander and Robert Stoddard, former The Dogs D&#x27;Amour singer, briefly became guitarist for the group, co-writing the song &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; that appeared on L.A. Guns&#x27; debut album. Initially, the group were to be called Faster Pussycat (later the name of another band; several of that band&#x27;s members over the years were also in L.A. Guns) but soon re-adopted the L.A. Guns moniker. After writing material and playing shows, the group signed with PolyGram. Black was soon replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while Kelly Nickels (formerly of Faster Pussycat) was added to the lineup.

They recorded their debut album, titled &quot;L.A. Guns&quot;, with producer Jim Faraci. The album featured six songs co-written by former singer Paul Black (&quot;No Mercy&quot;, &quot;Sex Action&quot;, &quot;One More Reason&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, &quot;Bitch is Back&quot; and &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;) while, after album completion, drummer Alexander was replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley (with Riley credited as L.A. Guns&#x27; drummer on the album&#x27;s liner notes and Alexander only given drum credits). The album was released in 1988, through PolyGram/Vertigo Records, peaking at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After briefly touring in support of the album, the group returned to the studio to record their new album with producers Duane Baron, John Purdell and Tom Werman. Although the group (Lewis, Guns, Cripps, Nickels and Riley) wrote the album&#x27;s material, &quot;Never Enough&quot; featured additional contributions from Paul Black, Gregg Tripp and Phil Roy. Robin Zander and Rick Nielsen, both of Cheap Trick, also make an appearance on the album.

Released in 1989, L.A. Guns&#x27; new album, titled &quot;Cocked &amp; Loaded&quot;, peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200 while the single &quot;The Ballad of Jayne&quot; peaked at number 25 and 33 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 respectively. The album went on to become RIAA certified Gold and eventually Platinum. They released their third album, titled &quot;Hollywood Vampires&quot;, in 1991 which peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200. The singles &quot;Kiss My Love Goodbye&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot; would peak at number 16 and 25 on the Mainstream Rock Chart respectively while It&#x27;s Over Now&quot; also peaked at number 62 on the Billboard Hot 100. Drummer Riley was fired from L.A. Guns in 1992 following the group&#x27;s tour of Europe with Skid Row for allegedly assaulting Lewis.

===&quot;Vicious Circle&quot; and lineup changes (1993–1999)===

Due to the rise in popularity of Seattle&#x27;s grunge movement, the group waited a number of years before recording new material. During this time, Guns participated in the short lived supergroup Contraband, the group put together by Alan Kovac. The group featured singer Richard Black (of Shark Island), Michael Schenker (of Scorpions, UFO and Michael Schenker Group), Share Pedersen (of Vixen) and Bobby Blotzer (of Ratt). They released one self-titled album in 1991, which peaked at number 187 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and achieved some moderate success with the single &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot;, which peaked at number 12 on the Mainstream Rock Chart, before disbanding.

Regrouping in the mid-1990s with drummer Michael Gersema, L.A. Guns recorded and released their fourth album, titled &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, in 1994 with the album failing to chart. It was their weakest selling album to date with the group&#x27;s first major lineup change coming afterwards. Former drummer Riley was invited to rejoin the group for the subsequent tour; however, both Lewis (who went on to form Filthy Lucre, releasing the &quot;Popsmear&quot; album in 1997) and Cripps departed the group with singer Chris Van Dahl replacing Lewis and Johnny Crypt replacing Cripps on rhythm guitar. PolyGram soon dropped the group, who had already begun sessions for a follow-up album, following the low sales of &quot;Vicious Circle&quot;. Nickels subsequently left the band as well, at which point Crypt switched to bass. The now four-piece lineup completed recording of the Pantera-influenced album &quot;American Hardcore&quot;, released in 1996 through CMC International with the album failing to chart also.

The group changed singers once again, recruiting Ralph Saenz, formerly of The Atomic Punks, for the recording of the &quot;Wasted&quot; EP released in 1998 before eventually adding former Love/Hate singer Jizzy Pearl to the group in 1999. With the lineup consisting of Pearl, Guns, Crypt and Riley, the group recorded their new album with former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke producing. The group released the album, titled &quot;Shrinking Violet&quot;, in 1999 through Perris Records before going on tour supporting Poison.

===Reunion and the departure of Tracii Guns (1999–2002)===

A compilation album of re-recorded songs and new material, titled &quot;Greatest Hits and Black Beauties&quot;, was released in the summer of 1999. Despite the Pearl-led lineup having just released new material, &quot;Shrinking Violet&quot;, during this time, the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of L.A. Guns reunited with Phil Lewis, Mick Cripps and Kelly Nickels returning to the group in the fall, touring in support of the compilation album. They recorded a live album during this time, titled &quot;&quot;, which was released the following year. That same year, they re-recorded and re-released &quot;Cocked &amp; Loaded&quot;, retitled &quot;Cocked &amp; Re-Loaded&quot;, on Deadline Records. Both Cripps and Nickels would leave the group on the eve of a 2000 summer tour, replaced by Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat and bassist Muddy.

For the recording of their new album, Cripps returned to the lineup, replacing Muscat, and recorded keyboards on the album. Produced by Gilby Clarke, the group released &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; in 2001 through Spitfire Records while former Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Keff Ratcliffe was added to the group. Sometime afterwards, Muddy would depart the group, along with Ratcliffe and Cripps, with Adam Hamilton becoming the group&#x27;s new bassist. with Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx. L.A. Guns bassist Hamilton was briefly involved with this group (as keyboardist), which was rounded out by singer London LeGrand and Adema drummer Kris Kohls. John Corabi, formerly of Mötley Crüe and The Scream, was to fill in for Guns, during the latter&#x27;s involvement with Cockstar, on L.A. Guns&#x27; tour with Alice Cooper. However, Corabi himself would soon join Cockstar, replacing Hamilton. Cockstar would change their name to Brides of Destruction.

Meanwhile, L.A. Guns completed the recording of their new album in late April 2002, releasing the record, titled &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, the same year to positive reviews. That June, the group began touring with Warrant, Ratt, FireHouse and Dokken as part of the Rock Fest tour. However, they were soon dropped from their label. They also pulled out of touring with Alice Cooper followings Guns departure from the group in October in order to concentrate on his project with Sixx, though he would argue he never left.

===Two L.A. Guns===
====Phil Lewis&#x27; L.A. Guns (2002–2012)====
Despite the departure of Guns, the group continued and toured in support of &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; with the lineup, in 2003, consisting of Lewis, Riley, Hamilton, former guitarist Brent Muscat and new guitarist Keri Kelli (formerly of Big Bang Babies and Slash&#x27;s Snakepit). The group eventually recruited guitarist Stacey Blades, with both Muscat and Kelli departing the group, in 2004 while they also released the cover album, titled &quot;Rips the Covers Off&quot;, the same year. Commenting on Blades addition to the lineup, Lewis stated that &quot;Stacey really is a virtuoso type of guy and player. It was really fortunate that we found him and that he&#x27;s another Hollywood guy. I&#x27;ve read reviews where they called him a Tracii [Guns] clone, but he&#x27;s not. He is definitely his own man.&quot;

Enlisting Andy Johns and Bruce Witkin, the group began recording a new material with the group&#x27;s current lineup with the result being &quot;Tales from the Strip&quot;, released in 2005 through Shrapnel Records. In a 2006 interview, singer Lewis stated that he would have preferred releasing the album on a larger label while he also likened the album to a demo.
In September of the same year, the group released the live album &quot;Loud and Dangerous: Live from Hollywood&quot; before going on to play a selection of shows in California as well as one date supporting Ratt in Pennsylvania.

In January 2007, the group announced a string of US tour dates in support of &quot;Tales from the Strip&quot;. In March, along with more tour dates, L.A. Guns announced the departure of bassist Hamilton who was subsequently replaced by Scott Griffin. Further tour dates were announced to take place in Australia, taking place in October, as well as dates in Europe supporting Hanoi Rocks, taking place in November. They soon announced that the European dates were postponed until 2008, but Hanoi Rocks issued a statement saying that the tour with L.A. Guns supporting &quot;was never officially approved&quot; by the group.

On July 5, 2009, bassist Griffin departed the group and was replaced by Kenny Kweens (formerly of Beautiful Creatures).
In January 2011, Kweens departed the band, with Griffin returning to the lineup.

On March 7, 2012, the band announced a new studio album, titled &quot;Hollywood Forever&quot;, which was released on June 5 that year.

====Tracii Guns&#x27; L.A. Guns (2006–2012)====

Following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus, in 2006, former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band with former L.A. Guns members Paul Black and Nickey Alexander as well as Brides of Destruction live bassist Jeremy Guns. The group announced a tour of the US with plans to perform songs from L.A. Guns, Brides of Destruction and Tracii Guns&#x27; solo material as well as various cover songs. Previously, in 2005, Black released the demos, titled &quot;Black List&quot;, recorded during his time with L.A. Guns in the &#x27;80s.

With Tracii Guns owning the rights to the name (along with Steve Riley), he changed the name of The Tracii Guns Band to L.A. Guns in the summer of 2006, creating a conflict, as there were now two groups touring under the L.A. Guns moniker. In October of the same year, during the 20-year anniversary party for Cathouse Club, in Hollywood, Phil Lewis joined Tracii Guns&#x27; L.A. Guns onstage, after being invited by singer Paul Black, for a duet of &quot;Rip and Tear&quot;. Despite Black&#x27;s hopes that this would &quot;relieve the tension between the two line-ups&quot;, Lewis would later state that &quot;Tracii [Guns] as good as he is, has had to pretty much lower himself to playing with these guys that if they were going to do anything they would have done it in the past twenty years, but they have done nothing.&quot;

In 2007, Alexander would be replaced by drummer Chad Stewart with the group playing shows in South America, Europe as well as numerous tours of the US. In December, the Tracii Guns version of the band&#x27;s dressing room was robbed during a show at McGuffy&#x27;s in Dayton, Ohio. Items taken included wallets, &quot;a Blackberry and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey.&quot; The thief was later caught with the items returned to the band.

Guns announced, in January 2008, that the group were to record a new album stating that they were &quot;heading up to Canada in April/May to record the new stuff in a very secluded location so we have no distractions and can actually get it done.&quot; They announced dates in the US and South America in February; however, they announced, in March, the South American tour was postponed with them beginning recording on their new album, tentatively titled &quot;Pretty in Black&quot;, with producer Steve Thompson. The same month, they were confirmed as one of the acts of the second Rocklahoma festival. After being invited by bassist Jeremy Guns, singer Marty Casey, of Lovehammers, joined the group, who had signed a deal with Alexus Records, in the studio co-writing material. Paul Black parted ways with the group in March, while Alec Bauer was added as the group&#x27;s second guitarist.

By July, the group had completed the new album with Casey with plans to release the album by the end of the year. They also recorded a pilot for VH1 which, at that point, was being shopped to different networks. Also announced was that the &quot;name of the band will not be L.A. Guns for this TV show and album, but we will do some nostalgia shows and festivals as L.A. Guns.&quot; The group toured through 2008 and 2009; however, Casey returned to Lovehammers to record and release their new album &quot;Heavy Crown&quot; in 2009. While the group waited for a release date for their new album, as well as deciding on a new name for the group, former L.A. Guns singer Jizzy Pearl returned to group while guitarist Alec Bauer departed the band.

In February 2010, L.A. Guns announced they had signed a deal with Steve Vai&#x27;s label, Favored Nations, to release a &quot;Deluxe Reissue&quot; of &quot;Shrinking Violet&quot;, the only L.A. Guns studio album to feature singer Jizzy Pearl, that was released the same year. The album was repackaged with new artwork and five live bonus tracks by the group&#x27;s current lineup. The band announced a one-off unplugged event, taking place at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles, California, in February 2011 featuring the band, with the exception of Jeremy Guns, former L.A. Guns members Muddy, Mick Cripps, as well as Danny Nordahl and Doni Gray. By March, both Jeremy and Stewart departed the band. Although Nordahl temporarily replaced Jeremy, while Stewart remained before both rejoined Faster Pussycat. It was later confirmed that Jeremy returned to the lineup, with Doni Gray joining as their new drummer. By September, it was announced that Pearl had departed the band, on good terms, with former &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; finalist Dilana joining in his place. Session musician Eric Grossman was also announced as the replacement for Jeremy.
But after being in the band for a mere 71 days, Dilana would depart from the band and be replaced by Tony West from Blacklist Union. Former bassist for The Whisky Rebellion, Tim Sterling, reported that upon seeing Dilana do a soundcheck with L.A. Guns, it was &quot;the most arrogant, egotistical behavior I&#x27;ve ever seen from a performer towards their band and crew.&quot; West was replaced in January 2012 by Scott Foster Harris according to the L.A. Guns official Facebook site. It has also been announced that Tracii Guns L.A. Guns will be playing their farewell tour Europe and then they will be going under the name Tracii Guns&#x27; League of Gentlemen. Eric Grossman has since announced his departure from L.A. Guns. He was later replaced by Johnny Martin on bass and the band added Steve Preach on guitar, organ and piano, extending the line-up to a 5-piece.

=== Disbanding of Tracii Guns&#x27; band (2012–2015) ===

Guns announced in July that he was finished with his version of L.A. Guns, leaving only the Phil Lewis-led group performing under the moniker. On December 12, guitarist Stacey Blades has announced his departure from L.A. Guns; five days later, Frank Wilsey joined the band as its new guitarist. On January 16, L.A. Guns announced a new video DVD, &quot;Live in Concert&quot;, including video of the band&#x27;s performance at the M3 Rock Festival in May 2012, three music videos and a documentary about the making of &quot;Hollywood Forever&quot;. The DVD was scheduled for release via Cleopatra Records on February 12. On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Wilsey had left the band; he was replaced by Michael Grant from Endeverafter.

On March 9, 2014, original singer Michael Jagosz died at aged 48. In September 2014, the band revealed that Griffin had departed and Kweens had returned.

=== Reunion between Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis / Steve Riley and Kelly Nickels version of L.A. Guns (2016–present) ===
On May 31, 2016, it was announced that Phil Lewis and Tracii Guns would perform together for the first time in 14 years under the name &quot;L.A. Guns&#x27; Phil Lewis + Tracii Guns&quot; for a handful of shows, including three shows in South America in July, Hair Nation Rock Fest in Irvine on September 17 and Rock N Skull Fest in Joliet, Illinois on October 27. This line-up of L.A. Guns consists of Lewis and Guns along with bassist Johnny Martin (who had previously been a member of Tracii Guns&#x27; version of the band) and drummer Shane Fitzgibbon, with Michael Grant from Steve Riley&#x27;s line-up touring with the band as second guitarist.

In September 2016, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; reported that Lewis and Guns plan to record a new album together under the L.A. Guns name for Frontiers Records, originally intended for a June 2017 release. The album was supported by a world tour, which kicked off with two shows at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood in March 2017.

In December 2016 Lewis announced he was leaving L.A. Guns, noting &quot;With a heavy heart I have to inform you that as of January 1, 2017 I will no longer be a member of this line up. I feel I have gone as far as I can in this band, and unless I get out and focus on myself and something new that has a future, I&#x27;m going to stagnate&quot;. It was later clarified that Lewis was to continue fronting the Tracii Guns version of L.A. Guns and that he was only leaving the Steve Riley version. The Steve Riley-led version of the band were to play the M3 Rock Festival in Maryland, in May 2019.

It was announced that L.A. Guns would be entering the studio to record a new album called &quot;The Missing Peace&quot;, which was released on October 13, 2017. The Tracii Guns version announced that they would tour Australia and New Zealand in 2018. On March 7, 2018, it was announced that the former Endeverafter guitarist Michael Grant left L.A. Guns to pursue other interests including his solo project Michael Grant and the Assassins. Grant later revealed that he was fired from the band and did not voluntarily leave. Grant was replaced by Enuff Z&#x27;Nuff guitarist Johnny Monaco, but was replaced by Hamilton a few months later.
In July 2018, L.A. Guns announced their 12th studio album, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, released in March 2019.

In January 2020, Guns and Lewis sued Riley over the use of the L.A. Guns name. On April 23, 2021, they settled this dispute in court with Guns and Lewis retaining the L.A. Guns name, while Riley was made to change his versions to Riley&#x27;s L.A. Guns. Riley&#x27;s L.A. Guns released their first single, called &quot;Crawl&quot;, on April 20, 2020. This was followed by a studio album, &quot;Renegades&quot;, released on November 13, 2020 (before the name change had taken effect). This version of the band changed its name to Riley&#x27;s L.A. Guns in April 2021 following a settlement reached between Riley with Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis. Riley died on October 24, 2023 after suffering from various health issues. At the time of his death, Riley&#x27;s L.A. Guns had completed work on their second album, &quot;The Dark Horse&quot;, which was released on January 22, 2024, in honor of what would have been Riley&#x27;s 68th birthday.

L.A. Guns (feat. Tracii Guns and Phil Lewis) released a new single, &quot;Let You Down&quot;, on May 6, 2020. It was released as the first single from their then-upcoming fourteenth studio album, &quot;Checkered Past&quot;, which was released on November 12, 2021, and featured producer Adam Hamilton on drums.

In May 2022, it was announced that Shawn Duncan had replaced Shane Fitzgibbon as their drummer. The following month, guitarist Ace Von Johnson revealed that L.A. Guns had been working on new material for their next studio album. The resulting album, &quot;Black Diamonds&quot;, was released on April 14, 2023.

L.A. Guns&#x27; sixteenth studio album, &quot;Leopard Skin&quot;, is due for release on April 4, 2025.

<doc id="1039944" wikidata="Q131233" url="?curid=1039944" title="South Tarawa">
<text>South Tarawa () is the capital and hub of the Republic of Kiribati and home to more than half of Kiribati&#x27;s population. The South Tarawa population centre consists of all the small islets from Betio in the west to Bonriki and Tanaea in the north-east, connected by the South Tarawa main road, with a population of 63,439 .

South Tarawa is home to most of the government, commercial and education facilities in Kiribati including the Port and the High Court at Betio, the State House, Government Ministries and foreign embassies and High Commissions in Bairiki, the University of the South Pacific campus in Teaoraereke, the House of Assembly in Ambo, the Kiribati Teacher College and King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School, the Government High School, is in Bikenibeu, and the Tungaru central hospital in Nawerewere. The Roman Catholic Diocese is based in Teaoraereke, the Kiribati Uniting Church in Antebuka, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Kiribati in Bikenibeu, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Eita.

== Administration ==
At the local government level, South Tarawa has two administrative subdivisions, created by John Hilary Smith in 1972:
*Betio Town Council (or BTC) on Betio
* (or TUC), from Bairiki to Tanaea (the meaning of &quot;teinainano&quot; is &quot;down of the mast&quot;, alluding to the sail-shape of the atoll)

Buota, which is part of North Tarawa and administered by the Eutan Tarawa Council (or ETC), is linked by road to South Tarawa and is experiencing many similar issues of rapid population growth, urbanisation and environmental degradation.

== Geography ==

South Tarawa is a string of islets on the atoll of Tarawa, between the Tarawa Lagoon to the north, with a maximum depth of , and the Pacific Ocean to the south, with a depth of up to . The island has been built from sediments from the lagoon.

The process of soil accumulation is driven by the dominant easterly trade winds and can be reversed during extended periods of westerly winds during El Niño–Southern Oscillations.

These islets are now joined by causeways, forming one long islet on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon. Most of South Tarawa is less than above sea level with an average width of only .

=== Population ===
At the time of the 1978 Census, South Tarawa had a population of 17,921 with most residents living in the main population centres of Betio, Bairiki and Bikenibeu. Since Kiribati became independent in 1979, the population of South Tarawa has more than tripled, and now stands at 63,439 people (2020). All of South Tarawa is now urbanised and is effectively one continuous settlement from the northeastern end of the island, Tanaea, to its southwestern end at Betio.

Buota in North Tarawa is connected to the South Tarawa main road and is also growing rapidly.
==History==
Tarawa island is central to Kiribati mythology and culture, but life on South Tarawa was little different to that on other islands before it was selected in 1895 as the seat of colonial government for the Protectorate of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. From 1906 to 1942, Ocean Island was the headquarters of the colony, then Funafuti because of the Japanese occupation of the Gilbert Islands until 1946, when it returned to Tarawa.

Betio was the location of the Battle of Tarawa.

== Environment ==

The highest point on South Tarawa is only a very few meters above sea level (Eita, 3 metres), making the island extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The effects of floods and associated soil salination are starting to threaten limited freshwater supplies.

=== Climate ===
The climate in South Tarawa is a Tropical rainforest climate (Koppen: Af) which is warm and humid all year round and average rainfalls are relatively high. However, rainfall is very unpredictable, varying with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and South Tarawa can go for many months with almost no rain during &quot;La Niña&quot; cycles. The hottest and coldest temperatures ever recorded in South Tarawa are and , respectively, which is one of the narrowest temperature ranges in the world.

=== Water ===
South Tarawa has very limited water resources for its rapidly growing population. During the frequent droughts, the only source of water is the shallow freshwater lens that permeates the coral rock of the atoll. The water lenses at Bonriki and Buota have been declared as water reserves, and have a combined sustainable yield of 1,300 m3 per day.

Other previously declared water reserves have been relinquished for urbanisation or abandoned due to overpumping and pollution from human settlement.

Water from the Bonriki and Buota reserves is distributed by a reticulated network to South Tarawa households. However, the poor condition of the network and the limited water supply mean that water can only be supplied to each village for around 2 hours every two days. Most schools and community buildings have no water supply at all, and many households rely on polluted groundwater due to the shortage of treated water.

Because of the shortage of fresh water, sanitation systems must use saltwater for flushing. The sanitation network on South Tarawa is performing very poorly, and a major project is underway to rehabilitate the system and improve sanitation and public hygiene.

=== Coastal erosion ===
The Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development (MELAD) is involved in the replanting of mangroves in selected sites to help against coastal erosion; however, much more is required to protect many of the sites eroded on South Tarawa including islets that once were protected with mangrove and iron-wood (tengea) trees. It is unclear how much of the erosion being experienced on South Tarawa is due to sea-level rise and how much is due to human activities (such as building inappropriate seawalls and mining sand and gravel from the beaches and foreshores). Coastal erosion will accelerate in future, due to climate change related sea level rise.

=== Land availability and overcrowding ===
The land area of South Tarawa is officially recorded as or 15.76 square km.

Much of this land is not available for use, including the water reserve and runway, the causeways, and a large area of reclaimed land at Temwaiku, the eastern corner of the atoll, which is too swampy and low-lying. If these areas are excluded, the land area of South Tarawa is only just over 1,000 hectares (10 square km or 2,500 acres) and the population density of 49 people per hectare or 4,905 per square km is almost equal to the density of London (5,100 people per km2) and twice the density of Sydney or Auckland.

Multi-story buildings are very uncommon on South Tarawa. The high population is accommodated through large household sizes, with an average of 7.3 people per household, on small land plots. Most land is owned by the original families or &quot;kain Tarawa&quot;, although in the main centres of Betio, Bairiki and Bikenibeu there are large areas of land on long-term lease to the government. Without access to family lands or government housing, many South Tarawa residents have no choice but to become squatters; disputes over land are common.

South Tarawa and especially Betio have high rates of respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and dysentery, all of which have been linked to overcrowding. Unsustainable development in South Tarawa is a concern to the government and to Kiribati&#x27;s aid partners. Anote Tong&#x27;s administration aims to ease the problem in the country&#x27;s main urban centre by encouraging people to stay and to resettle in outer islands. It has invested in facilities such as the South Kiribati Hospital to spread institutions and services out around the islands and relieve South Tarawa from overcrowding.


== Economy ==

South Tarawa is the economic hub of Kiribati, the location of the main port and airport and of most of the state-owned enterprises and private businesses.

Copra produced on the outer islands is processed on Betio, producing copra oil for the international market and other products which are sold locally. There is a fish processing plant producing tuna for export.

Imports far outweigh exports, and most households on South Tarawa rely on government employment and remittances from relatives working overseas. Unemployment and underemployment are a serious problem; in 2010 only 34% of urban adults (over 15) were engaged in cash work; the remaining two-thirds are either out of the labour force, unemployed or engaged in subsistence activities. Young people are especially likely to be unemployed.

==Education==
Currently there is one government high school, King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School in Bikenibeu. There are also several private Christian high schools:
* Church of God High School
* Moroni High School - Also has a junior high school
* Sacred Heart High School
* St. Louis High School
* William Goward Memorial School

==Visiting ==
===Transport===
Fiji Airways flies to Bonriki International Airport on South Tarawa from Nadi, on Mondays and Thursdays.
Solomon Airlines flies to Honiara and Brisbane at least once a week.

===Accommodation===
There is a range of accommodation available for visitors and for those working short term in South Tarawa.

<doc id="1039945" wikidata="Q1032719" url="?curid=1039945" title="Royal Meteorological Society">
<text>The Royal Meteorological Society is a long-established institution that promotes academic and public engagement in weather and climate science. Fellows of the Society must possess relevant qualifications, but Members can be lay enthusiasts. Its Quarterly Journal is one of the world&#x27;s leading sources of original research in the atmospheric sciences. The chief executive officer is Liz Bentley.

==Constitution==
The Royal Meteorological Society traces its origins back to 3 April 1850 when the British Meteorological Society was formed as &quot;a society the objects of which should be the advancement and extension of meteorological science by determining the laws of climate and of meteorological phenomena in general&quot;. Along with nine others, including James Glaisher, John Drew, Edward Joseph Lowe, The Revd Joseph Bancroft Reade, and Samuel Charles Whitbread, Dr John Lee, an astronomer, of Hartwell House, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire founded in the library of his house the British Meteorological Society, which became the Royal Meteorological Society. It became The Meteorological Society in 1866, when it was incorporated by Royal Charter, and the Royal Meteorological Society in 1883, when Her Majesty Queen Victoria granted the privilege of adding &#x27;Royal&#x27; to the title. Along with 74 others, the famous meteorologist Luke Howard joined the original 15 members of the Society at its first ordinary meeting on 7 May 1850. As of 2008 it has more than 3,000 members worldwide. The chief executive of the Society is Professor Liz Bentley. Paul Hardaker previously served as chief executive from 2006 to 2012.

== Membership ==
There are four membership categories:

* Honorary Fellow
* Fellow (FRMetS)
* Member
* Corporate member

==Awards==
The society regularly awards a number of medal and prizes, of which the Symons Gold Medal (established in 1901) and the Mason Gold Medal (established in 2006) are pre-eminent. The two medals are awarded alternately.

Other awards include the Buchan Prize, the Hugh Robert Mill Award, the L F Richardson Prize, the Michael Hunt Award, the Fitzroy Prize, the Gordon Manley Weather Prize, the International Journal of Climatology Prize, the Society Outstanding Service Award and the Vaisala Award.

== Journals ==
The society has a number of regular publications:

* &quot;Atmospheric Science Letters&quot;: a monthly journal that provides a peer-reviewed publication route for new shorter contributions in the field of atmospheric and closely related sciences.
* &quot;Weather&quot;: a monthly journal with many full colour illustrations and photos for specialists and general readers with an interest in meteorology. It uses a minimum of mathematics and technical language.
* &quot;Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society&quot;: one of the world&#x27;s leading journals for meteorology, publishing original research in the atmospheric sciences. There are eight issues per year.
* &quot;Meteorological Applications&quot;: this is a journal for applied meteorologists, forecasters and users of meteorological services and has been published since 1994. It is aimed at a general readership and authors are asked to take this into account when preparing papers.
* &quot;International Journal of Climatology&quot;: has 15 issues a year and covers a broad spectrum of research in climatology.
* &quot;WIREs Climate Change&quot;: a journal about climate change
* &quot;Geoscience Data Journal&quot;: an online, open-access journal.
* &quot;Climate Resilience and Sustainability&quot;: an interdisciplinary, open-access journal.

All publications are available online but a subscription is required for some. However certain &quot;classic&quot; papers are freely available on the Society&#x27;s website.

== Local centres and special interest groups ==
The society has several local centres across the UK.

There are also a number of special interest groups which organise meetings and other activities to facilitate exchange of information and views within specific areas of meteorology. These are informal groups of professionals interested in specific technical areas of the profession of meteorology. The groups are primarily a way of communicating at a specialist level.

<text>The &quot;Oslo&quot;-class frigate is a Royal Norwegian Navy frigate design of the 1960s, based on the US Navy destroyer escorts. The forward hull was customized to suit Norwegian sea conditions better (higher freeboard) and several sub-systems were European built. Ships of the class operated until 2007, when they were replaced by the .

== Construction ==
All ships were built at the Navy Main Yard in Horten, Norway between 1964 and 1966. The construction of the vessels was part of the Navy rebuilding program, approved by the Norwegian government in 1960. Half of the project expenses were funded by the United States as a part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP) (a program that ran from when it was passed by the Congress in October 1949 until 1967–68).

== Modernization ==
In the late 1970s, the class received new armament, most notably Penguin, RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and Mark 32 torpedo launchers. Another modernization was carried out in the 1980s.

During 1995 and 1996, after HNoMS &quot;Oslo&quot; experienced an engine failure, and subsequently sank after sailing in heavy weather, the rest of the class was once again modernized. The hulls were strengthened, which in turn increased the displacement with 200 tonnes.

All of the &quot;Oslo&quot; class are now retired, with HNoMS &quot;Narvik&quot; preserved as a museum ship. The &quot;Oslo&quot; class were replaced by the frigates. This replacement started in mid-2006.

==Ships==
Five frigates of this class were built. All of them were modernized during the period 1987–1990. They bear the prefix &quot;KNM&quot; (Kongelig Norske Marine, meaning &quot;Royal Norwegian Navy&quot;) in Norwegian and &quot;HNoMS&quot; (His Norwegian Majesty&#x27;s Ship) in English.

===&quot;Oslo&quot;===

The lead ship, &quot;Oslo&quot;, ran aground near Marstein island on 24 January 1994. One officer was killed in the accident. The next day, on 25 January, she was taken under tow. She sank on the same day in Korsfjorden outside Steinneset in Austevoll county.

===&quot;Stavanger&quot;===
&quot;Stavanger&quot; was decommissioned in 1998. She was later used for target practice and sunk in 2001 by a single DM2A3 torpedo launched from the &quot;Utstein&quot; (S 302).

===&quot;Bergen&quot;===

&quot;Bergen&quot; was decommissioned in August 2005. Now in use as a targetship.

===&quot;Trondheim&quot;===
On 17 March 2006 at 20:10 CET, &quot;Trondheim&quot; ran aground off Lines island in Sør-Trøndelag. No injuries among the 121-man crew were reported. The incident was reported from the ship itself, and at 20:30 it came loose again. Water flooded two compartments (paint storage and forward pump room) of the ship. The compartments were sealed and three ships were sent to assist the frigate. The frigate was towed to port in Bergen by the coast guard vessel .

HNoMS &quot;Trondheim&quot; was used after decommissioning as a target ship. On 5 June 2013, she was severely damaged in a test of the Norwegian-designed Naval Strike Missile system off the coast of the island of Andøya.

===&quot;Narvik&quot;===
&quot;Narvik&quot;, the last active ship of the class, has been transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy Museum in Horten.

<text>Evolutionary Technologies International (ETI) was a company focused on developing database tools and data warehousing. Originally a research project at the Microelectronics and Computer Corporation (MCC) in Austin, Texas, ETI was spun off as a private company by co-founders Katherine Hammer, Robin Curle, Lisa Keeler, and Duane Voth in 1990.

ETI&#x27;s technology provided a mechanism for automatically generating ETL (Extract/Transform/Load) programs based on user-defined metadata. Their first product was called EXTRACT (later changed to ETI•EXTRACT).

ETI was purchased by Versata in May, 2008.

ETI&#x27;s technology was acquired by Ignite in June 2015.

<doc id="1039957" wikidata="Q1573577" url="?curid=1039957" title="Poleaxe">
<text>The poleaxe (also pollaxe, pole-axe, pole axe, poleax, polax) is a European polearm that was used by medieval infantry.

== Etymology ==
Most etymological authorities consider the &quot;poll&quot;- prefix historically unrelated to &quot;pole&quot;, instead meaning &quot;head&quot;. However, some etymologists, including Eric Partridge, believe that the word is derived from &quot;pole&quot;.

== The construction of the poleaxe ==
The poleaxe design arose from the need to breach the plate armour of men at arms during the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, the form consisted of a wooden some long, mounted with a steel head. It seems most schools of combat suggested a haft length comparable to the height of the wielder, but in some cases hafts appear to have been created up to in length.

The design of the head varied greatly with a variety of interchangeable parts and rivets. Generally, the head bore an axe head or hammer head mounted on ash or other hard-wood shafts from 4–6 ft in length, with a spike, hammer, or fluke on the reverse. In addition, there was a spike or spear head projecting from the end of the haft which was often square in cross section, sometimes referred to as the &quot;dague dessous&quot;. The head was attached to the squared-off wooden pole by long flat strips of metal, called &quot;langets&quot;, which were riveted in place on either two or four of its sides to reinforce the pole against being chopped through in combat. A round hilt-like disc called a &quot;rondelle&quot; was placed just below the head. They also appear to have borne one or two rings along the pole&#x27;s length as places to prevent hands from slipping. Also of note is that the butt end of the staff, opposite the weapon&#x27;s head, bore a spike or shoe.

On quick glance, the poleaxe is often confused with the similar-looking halberd. While they may have both been designed for hacking and piercing through armor plates, the axe blade on a poleaxe seems to have been consistently smaller than that of a halberd. A smaller head concentrates the kinetic energy of the blow on a smaller area, enabling the impact to defeat armour, while broader halberd heads are better against opponents with less mail or plate armour. Furthermore, many halberds had their heads forged as a single piece, while the poleaxe was typically modular in design.

== Fighting with poleaxe ==
The poleaxe was used by knights and other men-at-arms (both noble and non-noble) in chivalric duels for prestige, to settle disputes in judicial duels, and of course on the battlefield. It was a close range weapon that required ones full body strength and both hands to wield effectively. The poleaxe has a sophisticated fighting technique, which is based on quarterstaff fighting. The blade of the poleaxe can be used, not only for simply hacking down the opponent, but also for tripping him, disarming him and blocking his blows. Both the head spike and butt spike can be used for thrusting attacks. The shaft itself is also a central part of the weapon, able to block the enemy&#x27;s blows (the langets helping to reinforce the shaft), hit and push with the shaft held in both hands, or trip the opponent. The poleaxe&#x27;s devastating efficiency is the origin of the term “to be poleaxed”, which dates from the 15th century when captives were often slain using poleaxe-blows to the head, and is now used to describe one being attacked or beat down in a brutal way, as if with a poleaxe.

Many treatises on poleaxe fighting survive from the 15th and 16th centuries. Poleaxe fighting techniques have been rediscovered with the increasing interest in historical European martial arts.

Today the poleaxe is a weapon of choice of many medieval re-enactors. Rubber poleaxe heads designed for safe combat are available commercially.

== Use in language ==

As a noun:
* An ax having both a blade and a hammer face; used to slaughter cattle.
* (historical) A long-handled battle axe, being a combination of ax, hammer and pike.

<doc id="1039962" wikidata="Q2627230" url="?curid=1039962" title="Return period">
<text>A return period, also known as a recurrence interval or repeat interval, is an average time or an estimated average time between events such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, or river discharge flows to occur.

It is a statistical measurement typically based on historic data over an extended period, and is used usually for risk analysis. Examples include deciding whether a project should be allowed to go forward in a zone of a certain risk or designing structures to withstand events with a certain return period. The following analysis assumes that the probability of the event occurring does not vary over time and is independent of past events.

== Estimating a return period ==
Recurrence interval formula_1

:&quot;n&quot; number of years on record;
:&quot;m&quot; is the rank of observed occurrences when arranged in descending order
For floods, the event may be measured in terms of m3/s or height; for storm surges, in terms of the height of the surge, and similarly for other events. This is Weibull&#x27;s Formula.

== Return period as the reciprocal of expected frequency ==
The theoretical return period between occurrences is the inverse of the average frequency of occurrence. For example, a 10-year flood has a 1/10 = 0.1 or 10% chance of being exceeded in any one year and a 50-year flood has a 0.02 or 2% chance of being exceeded in any one year.

This does not mean that a 100-year flood will happen regularly every 100 years, or only once in 100 years. Despite the connotations of the name &quot;return period&quot;. In any &quot;given&quot; 100-year period, a 100-year event may occur once, twice, more, or not at all, and each outcome has a probability that can be computed as below.

Also, the estimated return period below is a statistic: it is computed from a set of data (the observations), as distinct from the theoretical value in an idealized distribution. One does not actually know that a certain or greater magnitude happens with 1% probability, only that it has been observed exactly once in 100 years.

That distinction is significant because there are few observations of rare events: for instance, if observations go back 400 years, the most extreme event (a 400-year event by the statistical definition) may later be classed, on longer observation, as a 200-year event (if a comparable event immediately occurs) or a 500-year event (if no comparable event occurs for a further 100 years).

Further, one cannot determine the size of a 1000-year event based on such records alone but instead must use a statistical model to predict the magnitude of such an (unobserved) event. Even if the historic return interval is a lot less than 1000 years, if there are a number of less-severe events of a similar nature recorded, the use of such a model is likely to provide useful information to help estimate the future return interval.

=== Probability distributions ===
One would like to be able to interpret the return period in probabilistic models. The most logical interpretation for this is to take the return period as the counting rate in a Poisson distribution since it is the expectation value of the rate of occurrences. An alternative interpretation is to take it as the probability for a yearly Bernoulli trial in the binomial distribution. That is disfavoured because each year does not represent an independent Bernoulli trial but is an arbitrary measure of time. This question is mainly academic as the results obtained will be similar under both the Poisson and binomial interpretations.

== Poisson ==
The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is

:formula_2
where formula_3 is the number of occurrences the probability is calculated for, formula_4 the time period of interest, formula_5 is the return period and formula_6 is the counting rate.

The probability of no-occurrence can be obtained simply considering the case for formula_7. The formula is

:formula_8

Consequently, the probability of exceedance (i.e. the probability of an event &quot;stronger&quot; than the event with return period formula_5 to occur at least once within the time period of interest) is

:formula_10

Note that for any event with return period formula_5, the probability of exceedance within an interval equal to the return period (i.e. formula_12) is independent from the return period and it is equal to formula_13. This means, for example, that there is a 63.2% probability of a flood larger than the 50-year return flood to occur within any period of 50 year.

=== Example ===
If the return period of occurrence formula_14 is 243 years (formula_15) then the probability of exactly one occurrence in ten years is

: formula_16

== Binomial ==
In a given period of formula_17 for a unit time formula_18 (e.g. formula_19), the probability of a given number &quot;r&quot; of events of a return period formula_20 is given by the binomial distribution as follows.

:formula_21

This is valid only if the probability of more than one occurrence per unit time formula_18 is zero. Often that is a close approximation, in which case the probabilities yielded by this formula hold approximately.

If formula_23 in such a way that formula_24 then

:formula_25

Take
:formula_26
where
:&quot;T&quot; is return interval
:&quot;n&quot; is number of years on record.
:&quot;m&quot; is the number of recorded occurrences of the event being considered

=== Example ===
Given that the return period of an event is 100 years,

:formula_27

So the probability that such an event occurs &quot;exactly once&quot; in 10 successive years is:

: formula_28

=== Risk analysis ===
Return period is useful for risk analysis (such as natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure). When dealing with structure design expectations, the return period is useful in calculating the riskiness of the structure.

The probability of &quot;at least one&quot; event that exceeds design limits during the expected life of the structure is the complement of the probability that &quot;no&quot; events occur which exceed design limits.

The equation for assessing this parameter is
:formula_29
where
:formula_30 is the expression for the probability of the occurrence of the event in question in a year;
:&quot;n&quot; is the expected life of the structure.

<doc id="1039974" wikidata="Q1062121" url="?curid=1039974" title="University of the South Pacific">
<text>The University of the South Pacific (USP) is a public research university with locations spread throughout a dozen countries in Oceania. Established in 1968, the university is organised as an intergovernmental organisation and is owned by the governments of 12 Pacific island countries: the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

USP is an international centre for teaching and research on Pacific culture and environment, with almost 30,000 students in 2017. The university&#x27;s main campus is in Suva, Fiji, with subsidiary campuses in each member state.

==History==
Discussion of a regional university for the South Pacific began in the early 1950s, when an investigation by the South Pacific Commission recommended the creation of a &quot;central institution&quot; for vocational training in the South Pacific, with a university as a distant goal. In December 1962, the Fijian Legislative Assembly discussed establishing a university in Fiji. In 1964, New Zealand proposed the establishment of a regional teachers&#x27; training college in Suva. 

In 1965, the governments of Great Britain and New Zealand appointed a &quot;Higher Education Mission to the South Pacific&quot;, chaired by Sir Charles Morris, to investigate &quot;the future education requirements of the South Pacific area&quot; and recommend the type of level of institutions needed. In 1966 the Mission reported back, recommending the establishment of &quot;fully autonomous university comprehending within itself, as well as Faculties of Arts and Science, the Fiji School of Medicine, the School of Agriculture in Fiji, a College for the education and training of secondary teachers, the Pacific Theological College, and, in so far its activities in the field of diploma courses are concerned, the Derrick Technical Institute&quot;. The Mission recommended that it be called the University of the South Pacific. The former Royal New Zealand Air Force seaplane base at Laucala Bay in Fiji was recommended as a suitable location. A subsequent report by Norman Alexander fleshed out the proposal, and in 1967 the Fijian government passed an ordinance establishing the university&#x27;s interim council. In February 1970 this was replaced with a royal charter.

The university opened on 5 February 1968, with Colin Aikman as its first vice-chancellor. Initially teaching was limited to preliminary courses, the equivalent of New Zealand&#x27;s School Certificate and University Entrance. Degree teaching began in 1969, with a school of natural resources, a school of education, and a school of social and economic development offering interdisciplinary courses. The first graduation ceremony took place on 2 December 1971, with 49 students receiving degrees, diplomas and certificates.
In the 1970s the university began establishing regional extension centres to deliver continuing education, correspondence and extramural courses. It also began to advocate for Pacific regionalism and adopt a distinct &quot;Pacific flavour&quot;, with Vice-Chancellor James Maraj arguing that the university should become &quot;truly a university of the peoples of the Pacific&quot;. In 1976 it established the Institute of Pacific Studies under Professor Ron Crocombe to deepen students&#x27; awareness of Pacific identity and the region. Over the next 20 years, the institute published works by over 2,000 Pacific authors. A foundation course in Pacific studies is still included in every USP undergraduate programme.

In 1977 the government of Western Samoa leased the South Pacific Regional College of Tropical Agriculture in Alafua to the university to establish a school of agriculture. It is now the university&#x27;s Alafua campus. In 1989 it opened the Emalus campus in Vanuatu, which since 1996 has hosted the university&#x27;s law school and the Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute. In 1991 the Republic of the Marshall Islands became the university&#x27;s 12th member country. An extension campus was opened there in 1993. In 2012 the university opened a Confucius Institute at the Laucula campus in partnership with the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. In 2017 the university supplemented its governance arrangements with the University of the South Pacific Convention, providing for the recognition of the university by its member-states. The convention came into force on 16 June 2018.

==Governance==
The university is governed by a council, chaired by the pro-chancellor. The council consists of the ministers of education of member states, additional representatives from Fiji, Samoa, Australia and New Zealand, staff and student representatives, and additional members co-opted by the council. The titular head of the council is the chancellor, a position which rotates among the heads of state and heads of government of the university&#x27;s members. The Governor General of the Solomon Islands, David Vunagi, has served as chancellor since 1 July 2023. An independent University Grants Committee meets every three years to advise member and donor countries on funding levels.

The following people have held the role of vice-chancellor:
* Colin Aikman (1968–1974)
* James Maraj (1975–1982)
* Frank Brosnahan (1982–1983)
* Geoffrey Caston (1983–1992)
* Esekia Solofa (1992–2001)
* Savenaca Siwatibau (2001–2003)
* Anthony Tarr (2005–2007)
* Rajesh Chandra (2007–2018)
* Pal Ahluwalia (2018–present)

===Dispute with Fijian government===
In 2019, Ahluwalia raised concerns about mismanagement and abuse of office at USP under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Rajesh Chandra. An investigation by New Zealand accounting firm BDO substantiated the allegations, and the report was subsequently leaked online. In June 2020, a special council meeting led by Pro-Chancellor Winston Thompson suspended Ahluwalia for unspecified &quot;misconduct&quot;. Staff protesting the suspension were questioned by Fijian police. On 19 June Ahluwalia was reinstated by a full meeting of the USP council, and the allegations against him were dismissed in September 2020.

The Fijian government refused to accept Ahluwalia&#x27;s exoneration and on 24 September 2020 halted all funding to the university. On 4 February 2021, the Fijian government summarily deported Ahluwalia for being &quot;a person who is or has been conducting himself in a manner prejudicial to the peace, defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public health, security or good government of the Fiji Islands&quot;. In response to Fiji government interference in the regional university, Samoa has proposed moving USP&#x27;s headquarters to Samoa. Following Ahluwalia&#x27;s deportation, Masasso Pāunga was appointed acting vice-chancellor by the USP Council. The Council also established a subcommittee to investigate the deportation.

Following Ahluwalia&#x27;s deportation, Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaʻepa Saʻilele Malielegaoi announced that Samoa would be willing to provide a new home for the university. On 25 May the university&#x27;s council issued a new three-year contract to Ahluwalia and relocate the vice-chancellor&#x27;s office to the Alafua Campus in Apia, Samoa. In August 2021 the Fijian government announced that it would not fund the university as long as Ahluwalia was vice-chancellor.

Following the 2022 Fijian general election, the new government led by Sitiveni Rabuka revoked the prohibition order on Ahluwalia and reinstated funding to USP. In March 2023 former Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and former police commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho were charged with abuse of office for allegedly terminating the police investigation into the 2019 claims of financial mismanagement.

===Protest and Strike Action 2024===

In second half of 2024, the relationship between the USP Staff Association and the Vice Chancellor got bitter after Dr Osborne-Naikatini was sacked for expressing an opinion about the lack of due processes being followed for the renewal of the contract of the Vice Chancellor. This issue led to USPSA calling for removal of Vice Chancellor Pal Ahluwalia from the university and call for strike action with 95 percent majority vote to go to strike.

===Rankings===

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked USP in 1001-1200th for 2024.

In 2021, the university was ranked in 1001-1200th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The university claimed that this translated to being ranked in the top 10% of universities in the world, leading to criticism that they were exaggerating their ranking.

==Campuses==

Despite its multi-campus nature, the USP is not a university system. It is a single university with several branches across the Pacific Region. USP&#x27;s Laucala campus in Fiji is the main campus of the University, also serving as its administrative centre. USP&#x27;s main campus, called Laucala, lies on Laucala Bay in Fiji&#x27;s capital of Suva. It also has two other satellite campuses in Fiji: Labasa and Lautoka. The Alafua campus in Samoa hosts the School of Agriculture and Food Technology. The Emalus campus in Vanuatu is the location for the School of Law. The Nuku-alofa campus in Tonga is where the Institute for Education, directed by Seu&#x27;ula Johansson-Fua is based.

USP operates 11 regional centres based in Pacific islands countries. The region served by USP covers 33 million km2 of the Pacific Ocean, an area more than three times the size of Europe. In contrast, the total land mass of territories served corresponds to the area of Denmark. Populations of member countries vary from Tokelau with 1,500 people to Fiji with more than 900,000 people.

<text>A narrative environment is a space, whether physical or virtual, in which stories can unfold. A virtual narrative environment might be the narrative framework in which game play can proceed. A physical narrative environment might be an exhibition area within a museum, or a foyer of a retail space, or the public spaces around a building - anywhere in short where stories can be told in space. It is also a term coined by the Central Saint Martin&#x27;s College of Art and Design programme where the first Narrative Environment course was introduced in 2003. It is a full-time, 2 year Masters level course leading to an MA degree. Originally called in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments, now M.A. for Narrative Environments.

<text>San Pietro in Bovara is a Romanesque and Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church and abbey located on Via Don Sturzo #2 in Bovara, a frazione of the town of Trevi, in the province of Perugia, region of Umbria, central Italy. 

==History and description==

A church and Benedictine abbey at the site is documented from the 12th century. An inscription below the facade tympanum mentions the name &quot;Atto&quot; who may the master involved in the construction of San Lorenzo in Spello and the Duomo of Foligno during 1120-1140. For the next three centuries, the abbey was torn by competing ownership by different orders and institutions. It is said St Francis and his follower Pacifico stayed at the abandoned abbey in the early 13th-century. In 1484, the abbey was granted to the Olivetan order, and remained so until suppressions in the 19th century. The church is now a parish church.

The facade was rebuilt in a generally Gothic arrangement with a tall nave, a large spoked rose window, and flanking mullioned windows. The rounded arch for portal has a floral decoration, although it is unclear to when it dates. Peculiar to this church are floral friezes below the rose window and two metal corbels in the shape of cow&#x27;s heads. The interior naves are divided by heavy Romanesque columns. A 16th-century cloister is attached to the church. While the base of the bell-tower shows the white stone Romanesque construction, the elaborate domed higher stories date from the 17th century.

<doc id="1039983" wikidata="Q4613" url="?curid=1039983" title="Tongan paʻanga">
<text>The paanga is the currency of Tonga. It is controlled by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (&quot;Pangikē Pule Fakafonua o Tonga&quot;) in Nukualofa. The paanga is not convertible and is pegged to a basket of currencies comprising the Australian, New Zealand, and United States dollars and the Japanese yen.

The paanga is subdivided into 100 &quot;seniti.&quot; The ISO code is TOP, and the usual abbreviation is T$ (¢ for seniti). In Tonga, the paanga is often referred to in English as the dollar, the seniti as the cent and the hau as the union. The unit of hau (1 hau = 100 paanga), is not used in everyday life and can be found only on commemorative coins of higher denominations.

==Etymology==

&quot;Paanga&quot; is the Tongan name for &quot;Entada phaseoloides&quot;, also called the box bean or St. Thomas&#x27;s bean, a bean-like vine producing large pods with large reddish-brown seeds. The seeds are roundish, up to 5 cm diameter and 1 or 2 cm thick. When strung together they are used as anklets, part of the kailao dance costume. They were also used as playing pieces in an ancient disc-throwing game, lafo.

On 1 December 1806 Tongans attacked the passing ship &quot;Port-au-Prince&quot; near Lifuka in order to take it over. They failed, as the crew sank the vessel. The chief of Haapai, Fīnau Ulukālala, resorted to the next plan, to plunder whatever was worthwhile. On his inspection tour, he found the ship&#x27;s cash. Not knowing what money was, he considered the coins as paanga. Finally, not seeing anything of value, he ordered the remains of the ship to be burned; most of the crew were also reported to be massacred. It was much later that William Mariner, the only survivor of this attack, told him that those pieces of metal were of great value and not merely playing stones. Mariner also passed down the following statement of Fīnau Ulukālala as he began to understand the value of these pieces to the European sailors:
:&quot;If money were made of iron and could be converted into knives, axes and chisels there would be some sense in placing a value on it; but as it is, I see none. If a man has more yams than he wants, let him exchange some of them away for pork. [...] Certainly money is much handier and more convenient but then, as it will not spoil by being kept, people will store it up instead of sharing it out as a chief ought to do, and thus become selfish. [...] I understand now very well what it is that makes the papālangi [white men] so selfish – it is this money!&quot;

When Tonga introduced decimal currency, it decided not to call the main unit the dollar because the native word, &quot;tola,&quot; translated into a pig&#x27;s snout, the soft end of a coconut, or, in vulgar language, a mouth. &quot;Paanga,&quot; on the other hand, translated into money.

== History ==

The paanga was introduced on 3 April 1967. It replaced the pound at a rate of 1 pound = 2 paanga. Until 11 February 1991, the pa&#x27;anga was pegged to the Australian dollar at par. Since that time, a basket of currencies is taken, and the paanga has continuously depreciated relative to the Australian dollar. Official exchange rates are released daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga.

== Coins ==

In 1967, circulating coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 seniti and 1 and 2 paanga. The 1 and 2 seniti were struck in bronze with the other denominations in cupro-nickel. The 50 seniti, 1, and 2 paanga were only struck in small numbers as these denominations were also issued in note form. In 1974, dodecagonal (twelve-sided) 50 seniti were introduced but 50 seniti banknotes continued to be issued until 1983. In 1974, 1 seniti coins were struck in brass rather than bronze but reverted to bronze in 1975.

In 1975, a new series of coins was issued, themed around FAO and food production and featuring a new portrait style effigy of the king. This was followed by another series of similar theme in 1981. 1 and 2 Pa&#x27;anga coins continued to be issued. Starting in 1978 the 1 Pa&#x27;anga coins were redesigned with an innovative, or at least unique rectangular shape while the 2 Pa&#x27;anga (depicted on the right) remained round and continued to be one of the world&#x27;s largest circulating coins at the time ( diameter 44.5 millimetres/1.75 inches ), larger even than standard &quot;English crown sized&quot; coins. The reverses of both were changed annually to commemorate a different FAO goal or event. Later seven sided Christmas themed pa&#x27;anga coins also exist. However, due to the 2 Pa&#x27;anga coin&#x27;s large size and weight and the awkward shape of the 1 pa&#x27;anga, they failed to compete against the 1 and 2 Pa&#x27;anga notes that were simultaneously issued so production of these denominations ended in the 1980s due to low commercial demand. All 1 and 2 pa&#x27;anga coins still remain legal tender but are rarely used.

in 2002, nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 10, 20, and 50 seniti and the 5 seniti in 2005. The change did not occur in the 5 seniti initially as there was still a reasonable quantity of coins in stock at the time of the change. The move was made to reduce costs in production of the coins. The weight of the coins was also slightly reduced, although they remained the same approximate size as earlier dated coins. In 2011, commercial demand for 20 and 50 seniti prompted these denominations to be issued featuring the effigy of Tupou IV posthumous, who had died in 2006. A new obverse design for George Tupou V had not yet been made or selected at this time, possibly due to increased health concerns regarding the latter monarch, who died in March 2012.

For a brief period, some of the higher denomination coinage from the 1967–1968 series was &quot;countermarked&quot; with commemoration stamps that were added to the coin after being struck. The most distinct of these is Oil Search series which was plated in gold or &quot;gilt&quot;. Some countermarked pieces were released into circulation but many were also sold to collectors.

Current circulating coins are in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 seniti. The one and two seniti coins are still valid but are becoming less common in circulation due to high production cost and low value and may only be readily available for months after a release by the banks. Total prices in shops are usually rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 seniti.

In 2011, Tonga had announced plans to introduce a new and more modern series of coins shortly after neighboring Samoa and Fiji had done so, and on 3 March 2015 the Royal Australian Mint announced the production of new coins that would begin release later that year. Dignitaries, including Tongan Princess Angelika Tuku&#x27;aho whose father will feature on her county&#x27;s coins, took turns striking the coins at a ceremony. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud and honoured to be able to strike the coins today,&quot; she said. &quot;This is also in celebration of His Majesty&#x27;s coronation that is coming up in July.&quot;

The first series of coins showed Queen Salote Tupou III, two years after her death. The reverse designs were Tu&#x27;i Malila (a radiated tortoise presented to the Tongan royal family by Captain Cook in 1777) on the 1 and 2 seniti, wheat sheaves and a stylized depiction of the constellation Crux on the 5 and 10 seniti, and the Royal Tongan coat of arms on the higher denominations. From 1968, the portrait of King Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV appeared, facing right, with the first year issue commemorating the coronation event. Since 1975, all coins have borne the word &quot;Tonga&quot; on the obverse and the inscription &quot;Fakalahi meakai&quot; (Tongan: &quot;Grow more food&quot;) and the denomination on the reverse. All 1975–2011 coins are FAO themed. The King is shown in military uniform in portrait format rather than profile.

As part of a coinage reform, new coins were minted in 2015 by the Royal Australian Mint.

Specifications and designs are:


The King is shown facing on the 10, 20, and 50 seniti, under the initials FAO.

==Banknotes==

In 1967, notes (bearing the portrait of Queen Salote Tupou III) were introduced by the government in denominations of , 1, 2, 5 and 10 paanga. From 1974, the portrait of King Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV appeared on the notes. paanga notes were issued until 1983, with 20 paanga notes introduced in 1985, followed by 50 paanga in 1988. In 1992, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga took over production of paper money. On 30 July 2008, a new banknote series with greater security features was introduced featuring George Tupou V and a redesigned look. During this issue, a 100 paanga banknote was introduced for the first time.

The obverse of Tongan notes features text in the Tongan language and shows the portrait of the monarch. The reverse is in English language and shows typical motives and landmarks of Tonga: the Haamonga a Maui Trilithon, a humpback whale, burial mounds, school students and rugby players, the royal palace, the Tongan Development Bank, the Port of Vavau (twice, once depicted as it was around 1900, and the other in contemporary depiction), and ngatu making.

On 29 June 2015, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga introduced a new family of paanga banknotes in six denominations, from 2 to 100 paanga. Banknotes of 50 and 100 paanga are made of a paper/polymer hybrid substrate. They feature a portrait of the current king of Tonga, Tupou VI.

On 4 December 2023, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga introduced a new family of six banknotes to commemorate the birthday of the Kingdom’s moderniser King Tupou I.

<doc id="1039989" wikidata="Q2041266" url="?curid=1039989" title="Vibeke Stene">
<text>Vibeke Stene (born 17 August 1978) is a Norwegian soprano and actress. She is best known as a former member of the gothic metal band Tristania, which she joined in 1996 and appears with on five albums. as the band became &quot;one of the world&#x27;s premiere goth metal bands&quot;.

In 2007, Stene left Tristania and temporarily retired from the music industry to start a family and teach singing. In 2013, Stene came out of retirement with a guest appearance for the band God of Atheists. She later worked in musical theater and then formed the doom metal band Veil of Secrets.

==Early life==
Stene was born in Sokndal, Rogaland, Norway to Steinar Stene and Sissel Bø Stene, and has two sisters named Ingvild and Maiken. She first performed for people outside her family at the age of three. She began taking singing lessons at age 13, and became interested in classical singing. In an interview, she stated that her influences were the people with whom she had performed personally. Stene has also cited Tori Amos, Björk, David Bowie, Tom Waits, and Diamanda Galás as &quot;only a few of many singers that I think are very good&quot;.

During her school years, Stene performed in jazz, folk, and classical concerts both as a solo artist and with various bands. Around age 17, she became interested in heavy metal singing when she started &quot;to know my inner melancholy&quot;. She was inspired to join a band after seeing Theater of Tragedy live in Stavanger. She took vocal lessons until age 23, long after she had become a professional singer, because she wanted to learn how to teach others to sing.

Tristania keyboardist Einar Moen stated in an interview that Stene &quot;has a classical education actually – sort of an opera school or university degree. And she has also taken singing lessons since she was a little girl, so she&#x27;s always sung.&quot;

==Career==
===1996–2007: Tristania===

Stene met the members of Tristania through a friend and saw them again at a music contest. She joined the band at age 18 while still in school. At that time, Tristania was planning to record their first demo. At first the band intended her to be a temporary guest vocalist. According to Stene, she did not know she was an official member of the band until she read an article about them after &quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot; was released.

After five albums with Tristania, Stene left the band in February 2007 to finish her university degree which she started but did not finish in 2000, and also because she did not like the direction of the band&#x27;s recent music. Coincidentally, singer Tarja Turunen had left the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish around the same time, leading to widespread speculation that Stene would be her replacement, and Stene had to announce that this was merely a rumor.

=== 2007–2012: Retirement ===
In the years after she left Tristania, Stene retired from the music industry. She gave birth to two children and taught singing during her retirement. In a 2010 interview, Stene was asked if she would sing professionally again. She declared that when given a good offer, she would take it. In 2011, the electronic band Plutho released a song called &quot;Queen of Broken Hearts&quot; featuring Stene, though it was recorded back in 1999.

===2013–present: Return to music===
In June 2013, Stene announced on Facebook that she was returning to the music scene. Her first new music activity was an appearance with the extreme metal project God of Atheists, formed by Asgeir Mickelson. In 2015 she wrote and sang one song for the gothic metal band Viper Solfa on their debut album &quot;Carving an Icon&quot;.

Stene also ventured into theater work. She appeared in a play titled &quot;Skammens Gissel&quot; (&quot;Hostage of Shame&quot;) in which she played the role of Silja. Her theater debut was in October 2015. She described the play and her character:

In July 2020, Stene announced the formation of a new doom metal band called Veil of Secrets with Asgeir Mickelson. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Dead Poetry&quot; was released in November 2020. According to Stene, &quot;After some years with no music production or dissemination, I strongly felt an inner longing to create and feel alive through music. So I started to seek a resolution. [...] The composing process of&#x27; &quot;Dead Poetry&quot; was deeply founded on honesty and trust, and therefore I&#x27;m very proud to finally share Veil of Secrets.&quot;

The fifth ranked team would have to play-off against the best team from Oceania, with the winner of this play-off also qualifying. For the first time, defending champions Brazil was required to go through the qualifying process and did not automatically qualify for the tournament.

<text>Alexander Granach (April 18, 1890 – March 14, 1945) was a German-Austrian actor in the 1920s and 1930s who emigrated to the United States in 1938.

== Life and career ==
Granach was born Schaje Granoch in Werbowitz (Wierzbowce/Werbiwci) (Austrian Galicia then, now &quot;Verbivtsi&quot;, Kolomyia Raion, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine), to Jewish parents and rose to theatrical prominence at the Volksbühne in Berlin. Granach entered films in 1922; among the most widely exhibited of his silent efforts was &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), F.W. Murnau&#x27;s loose adaptation of &quot;Dracula&quot;, in which the actor was cast as Knock, the film&#x27;s counterpart to Renfield. He co-starred in such major early German talkies as &quot;Kameradschaft&quot; (1931).

The Jewish Granach fled to the Soviet Union when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. When the Soviet Union also proved inhospitable, he settled in Hollywood, where he made his first American film appearance as Kopalski in &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939) starring Greta Garbo and directed by Ernst Lubitsch, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Granach proved indispensable to film makers during the war years, effectively portraying both dedicated Nazis (he was Julius Streicher in &quot;The Hitler Gang&quot;, 1944) and loyal anti-fascists. He portrayed Gestapo Inspector Alois Gruber in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943). His last film appearance was in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944), in which almost the entire supporting cast was prominent European refugees.

Granach died on March 14, 1945, in New York from a pulmonary embolism following an appendectomy. He was buried in Montefiore Cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Granach&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;There Goes an Actor&quot; (1945) was republished in 2010 under the new title, &quot;From the Shtetl to the Stage: The Odyssey of a Wandering Actor&quot; (Transaction Publishers). He was survived by his long time partner, Lotte Lieven, and by his son, Gad Granach. His son, who lived in Jerusalem, wrote his own memoirs with many references to his father.

<text>The Peasant International (), known most commonly by its Russian abbreviation Krestintern (Крестинтерн), was an international peasants&#x27; organization formed by the Communist International (Comintern) in October 1923. The organization attempted to achieve united front relations with radical peasant parties in Eastern Europe and Asia, without lasting success. After failing to make headway with important initiatives in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and China in the 1920s, the organization was placed on hiatus at the end of the decade. The so-called Red Peasant International was formally dissolved in 1939.

==Organizational history==
===Background===

The idea for a Red Peasant International is commonly credited to Polish Communist Tomasz Dąbal, a former member of the Polish Peasant Party and representative elected to the Polish parliament. On 19 June 1923, Dąbal published an article in the Soviet Communist Party&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;Pravda,&quot; noting a surge in popularity of peasants&#x27; political parties, particularly in Eastern Europe, and arguing that these organizations might provide fertile soil for the sowing of Communist ideas among the peasantry. Dąbal suggested that the Communist International should form such an organization to facilitate the establishment of united front political activities between communist and peasants&#x27; parties in Europe.

The Comintern had already established similar organizations for the radical youth movement and the trade union movement — the Young Communist International (KIM) and the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern), respectively — and the idea that a radical international for peasants should be established under Comintern auspices. With the pro-peasant New Economic Policy in full swing in Soviet Russia, the idea for international organization of peasants quickly gained institutional traction.

===Establishment===

The Red Peasant International was established at a founding congress held in Moscow from 10–16 October 1923. The gathering was attended by 158 delegates, hailing from 40 countries, with a majority of participants representing countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. This gathering established a governing body comparable to the Executive Committee of the Communist International known as the International Peasant Council. Two major plenary sessions of the International Peasant Council were held — the first in October 1923 and the second in November 1927.

The formal head of the new organization at the time of its formation was A. P. Smirnov, although Dąbal emerged as the organization&#x27;s leading public spokesman. Smirnov remained in place as the organization&#x27;s chief until 1928.

In 1928 Smirnov was replaced as the top official of the Peasant International by Bulgarian Communist Vasil Kolarov, long a top figure of the Comintern. Kolarov served as chairman of a new governing body for the organization known as the Executive Committee of the Krestintern.

===Activities===
The Krestintern initially sought to build common cause with the Bulgarian Peasants Union, an organization established in exile in Yugoslavia by two former ministers of the government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski following his government&#x27;s overthrow by a military coup in June 1923. One of these ministers, K. Todorov, travelled to Moscow early in January 1924 where he conducted negotiations with Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Kolarov regarding joint action between their organization and the Communist Party of Bulgaria for the overthrow of the newly imposed Aleksandar Tsankov regime. The Bulgarian communists sought without success for Todorov to align his organization with the newly established Krestintern; for his part Todorov sought money and arms for use against the Tsankov government. Some Comintern money changed hands, but no alignment of the Peasants Union with the Peasant International or change of regime in Bulgaria was forthcoming.

The Krestintern was largely unsuccessful in its task of gathering and mobilizing non-Communist peasants&#x27; political parties to advance Communist ends and was only able to attract a small number of factional grouplets, these frequently being artificial creations of the various national communist parties themselves. The sole exception to this rule was the nominal affiliation was the brief and nominal adherence of the Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party &quot;(Hrvatska Pučka Seljačka Stranka)&quot; headed by Stjepan Radić in 1924 during a visit to Moscow. This affiliation is judged by historian E. H. Carr to have had less to do with Communism than with the national aspirations of non-Serbian ethnicities inside Yugoslavia.

The close relations between Radić&#x27;s organization and the Soviets led to a banning of the Croatian Republican Peasant Party and its official publication, the magazine &quot;Radnik&quot; (The Worker), were officially banned on 12 July 1924. The journal continued to be issued illegally for a short time before being terminated at the end of September.

Radić was imprisoned within months of his return to Yugoslavia and the Central Committee of the now-banned Peasant Party was quick to renounce his seemingly rash decision to affiliate with Moscow. Rather than bolstering the political position of his organization, Radić&#x27;s dalliance with the Red Peasant International seemed to have gone far to bringing about its demise. Four months after his release from prison in July 1925, Radić and his party endorsed the monarchy and the Yugoslav constitution and joined the government. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia was left to curse Radić for having made a &quot;shameful capitulation.&quot; The Krestintern&#x27;s &quot;united front&quot; strategy fell to failure.

The Krestintern published an official organ called &quot;The Peasant International&quot; to propagate its political views. The magazine was launched in April 1924 and included articles by Japanese communist Sen Katayama and Nguyễn Ái Quốc (Ho Chi Minh) of Vietnam, emphasizing the new International&#x27;s goal of building the radical agrarian movement of Asia in addition to its plan to build bridges to Eastern European peasant parties.

In 1926 the Krestintern attempted to help broker cooperative relations between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) headed by Chiang Kai-shek. The presidium of the International Peasant Council, the top leadership of the Peasant International, issued an open letter to the Kuomintang and its peasant section at the end of April of that year, expressing supreme confidence in that organization as &quot;the center which rallies, unites, and organizes all the revolutionary forces against the pressure of the reactionaries and imperialists.&quot; Chiang parlayed this relationship into Soviet aid and a list of CCP members — assets which were later used in a formidable and partially successful effort to annihilate the CCP in the Shanghai massacre of 1927. The Krestintern&#x27;s activities in China once again proved ineffective for advancing Comintern policy interests. Also in 1926 the Krestintern established a research facility in Moscow for the study of agrarian problems and the publication of books on these topics, known as the International Agrarian Institute. This subdivision of the Peasant International actually continued to exist for several years past the demise of its parent organization, publishing books through 1942, when the German invasion in World War II forced its termination.

===Later years and dissolution===

The period of pro-peasant moderation exemplified by the New Economic Policy came to an abrupt end in 1928, marked by a return to forced requisitioning in an attempt to alleviate the Grain Crisis of 1928. Serious efforts to advance a united front with the peasantry through the Red Peasant International seem to have been abandoned at this time, although the organization remained nominally functional for nearly a decade further.

In 1930, a new communist-backed agrarian organization called the European Peasant Committee was unveiled in Berlin. As was the case with the Peasant International, this group proved a failure in its design to attract peasants and peasant organizations to the communist banner. The grim brutality of forced collectivization, followed by agrarian collapse and a massive famine in 1932–1933 essentially terminated any chance for a reestablishment of the so-called smychka between urban-oriented communist movement and the peasantry in ensuing years.

<text>A platinum jubilee is a celebration held to mark an anniversary. Among monarchies, it usually refers to a 70th anniversary.

The most recent monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms in June 2022. The celebrations were delayed from the actual February anniversary and the ceremony occurred on a four-day Bank Holiday on 2 June 2022, as was announced earlier. Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, three months after the official celebrations in the Commonwealth took place.

A 75th anniversary can be referred to as a diamond jubilee occasionally, but that term is commonly used to refer to a 60th anniversary. An anniversary of 100 years is simply called a centenary.

<doc id="1040008" wikidata="Q273216" url="?curid=1040008" title="Maureen McGovern">
<text>Maureen Therese McGovern (born July 27, 1949) is an American singer and Broadway actress, well known for her renditions of the songs &quot;The Morning After&quot; from the 1972 film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;; &quot;We May Never Love Like This Again&quot; from &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; in 1974; and her No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary hit &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, the theme song from the television series &quot;Angie&quot;. She performed on Broadway in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;Nine&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, and &quot;Little Women&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
McGovern was born in Youngstown, Ohio, United States, the daughter of James Terrence McGovern and Mary Rita (née Welsh). She has Irish ancestry. As a child, McGovern would listen to her father&#x27;s singing quartet rehearse in their home. She was told by her elders that she began singing at the age of three, and would sometimes sing herself to sleep with things she heard on the radio. She decided at age eight that she wanted to be a professional singer. Her influences include Barbra Streisand, Judy Collins, and Joni Mitchell.

===Early work and breakthrough recording ===
After graduating from Boardman High School in 1967, she worked as a secretary and performed part-time as a singer for a local folk band called Sweet Rain. Her singing caught the attention of Russ Regan, then head of 20th Century Records, subsidiary of 20th Century-Fox, in 1972 when he heard a demo record she had recorded. At the time, Regan was searching for a singer to record &quot;The Morning After&quot; (the theme from &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;) for release as a record. He hired McGovern sight unseen to record the song, which resulted in her contracting with 20th Century Records. After it won an Oscar for Best Original Song, &quot;The Morning After&quot; scored well on the popular chart, reaching No. 1 during 1973. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in August 1973. Following the success of &quot;The Morning After&quot;, she received a Grammy Award nomination in 1974 for &#x27;Best New Artist&#x27;.

During 1974, she recorded two movie themes: &quot;We May Never Love Like This Again&quot; from the disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, in which she made a short appearance when she is seen singing the song as the evening&#x27;s entertainment, and &quot;Wherever Love Takes Me&quot; from the British disaster film &quot;Gold&quot;. The former won an Oscar (though it was only a minor pop hit), and the latter received an Oscar nomination.

In 1976, she recorded her cover version of &quot;The Continental&quot;, the very first Oscar-winning track for Best Original Song. It proved to be her only hit on the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 16.

===Subsequent challenges===
McGovern&#x27;s contract with 20th Century ended during 1976. Her career declined and so did her finances. In an interview on &quot;BBC Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on May 18, 2009, McGovern stated that exorbitant fees charged by her manager (40%) together with her band being on a full-time salary, whether she was performing or not, were the cause of her perilous financial state. Ready to begin her life over again, she moved to Marina del Rey and took a secretarial job under an assumed name, Glenda Schwartz. Nevertheless, she was still in demand occasionally for international live concerts. Her career improved when McGovern was asked to record a version of &quot;Can You Read My Mind&quot;, the love theme from 1978&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;, which was not recorded for the film. The single achieved minor success on the pop chart. Toward the end of the decade, McGovern recorded &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, the theme from the ABC-TV sitcom &quot;Angie&quot;. The song, her only other Top 40 pop single aside from &quot;The Morning After&quot;, soared to No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during 1979 and hit at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 1980, McGovern made a brief appearance as Sister Angelina, the singing nun, in the comedy-disaster movie &quot;Airplane!&quot;

===Broadway career and return to music===
At the beginning of the 1980s, McGovern gave up singing movie themes to begin a career on Broadway (her first foray into acting). During 1981, she made her Broadway debut as Mabel in a revival of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s musical &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, taking over from fellow 1970s popular singer Linda Ronstadt. She then performed in two productions with the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera: &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1981; as Maria) and &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1982; as Nellie Forbush). She returned to Broadway in 1982 to replace Karen Akers in &quot;Nine&quot; starring alongside Raul Julia. She continued her theatrical career throughout the 1980s and originated the role of Mary in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Brownstone&quot; in 1985. In 2005 she originated the role of Marmee in &quot;Little Women The Musical&quot;.

She slowly returned to music during the mid-1980s, contributing songs to musical soundtracks and recording for various-artist compilations. She also returned to touring and performing in concerts and began establishing herself as a nightclub and cabaret performer. Starting in 1987, she released three albums for CBS in three years: &quot;Another Woman in Love&quot; (a voice/piano album), &quot;State of the Heart&quot; (a fully orchestrated album), and &quot;Naughty Baby&quot; (recorded live on November 20, 1988, Studio A at Clinton Recording Studios, New York City, it features an early first recording of a lost Gershwin song, &quot;A Corner of Heaven With You&quot; (written ca. 1917). &quot;Naughty Baby&quot; was released in 1989 coinciding with McGovern&#x27;s Gershwin concert at Carnegie Hall.

===Later career===
From the 1990s into the 21st century, McGovern continued her careers in musical theatre, performing in concerts, and recording albums, and she occasionally made guest appearances on television. Other recordings include &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Yours&quot; (1992), a collection of her favorite songs from 1955 to 1970, and &quot;Out of This World&quot; (1996), a collection of songs by Harold Arlen. She was nominated twice for a Grammy, for her albums &quot;The Music Never Ends&quot; (1997), a collection of songs by Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman, and &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; (1998), another voice/piano album. McGovern voiced the character of Rachel in the animated film &quot;&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Out of This World&quot; and &quot;The Music Never Ends&quot; were re-released by Fynsworth Alley Records; both albums included bonus tracks, the former two, and the latter three.

In 2005, McGovern returned to the Broadway stage as Marmee opposite Sutton Foster&#x27;s Jo in the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot;. With negative reviews, it ended quickly, but McGovern reprised her role for the successful subsequent national tour.

She continued to appear in concert as a headliner and as a guest with symphony orchestras around the country. &quot;A Long and Winding Road&quot;, released on the PS Classics label, covers singer–songwriters of the 1960s including Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Lennon–McCartney, and Randy Newman. She performed a concert act based on this material at the Metropolitan Room in New York City and the Rrazz Room in San Francisco.

McGovern continues her work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and appeared regularly on The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon through 2014.

She created, along with Philip Himberg, a one-woman biographical musical &quot;Carry It On&quot; which premiered at Geva Theatre Center October 12 – November 14, 2010.

In 2012, she was listed as a guest star with The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies at the Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs, California.

McGovern was scheduled to headline the North Coast Men&#x27;s Chorus 30th Anniversary Concert on March 24, 2018, at the KeyBank State Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio.

===Retirement from performing===
In 2021, McGovern was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, which is thought to be a form of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She publicly announced her diagnosis the following year, saying she would no longer perform in concert, but planned to continue working on musical projects for children, and advocating for musical therapy. , she lives at a retirement community in Columbus, Ohio.

<text>Moelv is a town in Ringsaker Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. The town is located along the shores of the lake Mjøsa, about south of the town of Lillehammer and about the same distance northwest of the town of Hamar. Moelv is the second largest urban area in Ringsaker municipality (after Brumunddal).

The town has a population (2021) of 4,465 and a population density of .

Situated at the shores of lake Mjøsa at the mouth of the Moelva river, the town is bordered by green, forested hills farmland. The town consists of a few shopping centers, the Moelv Station along the Dovrebanen railway line, and some pubs and restaurants. The main employer is Moelven Industrier, a manufacturer of specialty building materials.

Archaeological excavations have found traces of human habitation in the area back to the Norwegian Stone Age. In 2010, the urban area of Moelv was granted town status.

The European route E6 used to run through Moelv, but in 1985, the Mjøsa Bridge opened for traffic and since then, the main highway has gone around the town rather than going through it.

The local sports team is Moelven IL.

<doc id="1040025" wikidata="Q914213" url="?curid=1040025" title="Ula-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Ula&quot; class is a Norwegian submarine type which was assembled in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The class, consisting of six vessels, is currently the only submarine type in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy.

==History==
The ordering of a new Norwegian submersible design stemmed from a 1972 decision to modernise the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) submarine flotilla, which then consisted of the aging submarines. The contract was signed on 30 September 1982 for six boats with Thyssen Nordseewerke, Emden. An option for two more submarines was included in the original deal, however, it was never picked up.

The construction of the vessels was an international project. The combat systems were made in Norway by Kongsberg, the attack sonar is German and the flank sonars French. The hull sections were produced in Norway and assembled in Germany by Thyssen Nordseewerke. In Germany, the design is known as the &quot;U-Boot-Klasse 210&quot;.

When commissioned, the &quot;Ula&quot;s were the first Norwegian submarines to have enough bunks for the entire crew and a shower.

The &quot;Ula&quot;-class submarines are among the most silent and maneuverable submarines in the world. This, in combination with their relatively small size, makes them difficult to detect from surface vessels and ideal for operations in coastal areas. The &quot;Ula&quot; class is regarded as both the most effective and cost-effective weapons in the RNoN.

==Ship history==
In 1989, while undergoing trials, &quot;Ula&quot; was damaged by a practice torpedo. In March 1991, &quot;Uredd&quot; was involved in an accident while docking. In February 1992, &quot;Uredd&quot; suffered a control room fire.

In recent years, several submarines of the &quot;Ula&quot; class have been deployed in the Mediterranean Sea in support of the NATO Operation Active Endeavour, where their intelligence-gathering ability surpassed expectations. Their operational availability proved to be highest of all ships taking part in the operation. This mission highlighted a need for better temperature regulation for crew comfort in warm waters. As a result, HNoMS &quot;Ula&quot; was &quot;tropicalized&quot; by the installation of new cooling systems, and two more of the class designated for &quot;tropicalization&quot;.

==Modernisation==
During 2006-2008 the &quot;Ula&quot; class was slated for modernisation. Most notably, new communication equipment (Link 11), new electronic warfare support measures and a periscope upgrade. In May 2008, a contract for new sonars was signed, with the first submarine to have new sonar 21 months after that, and the last 52 months later. Furthermore, Kongsberg was contracted in 2012 to upgrade the submarines&#x27; combat systems. The 2020 long-term defence plan envisages the &quot;Ula&quot; class being kept in service until replaced by the new Type 212CD submarines in around 2030.

In September 2024 it was reported that the combat systems of the six Ula class submarines will be updated again by Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace. The following month, in October 2024, it was also reported that Hensoldt had completed a critical design review for the modernisation of the six boats, which includes the installation of a new periscope and optronic mast systems.

==Replacement==

In 2012 the Norwegian MoD set 2014 as a deadline for deciding whether to further extend the operative life of the Ula class after their slated end-of-life in 2020, or to replace them with a new fleet. In December 2014, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence made the decision to begin the process of replacing the &quot;Ula&quot;s. As part of that decision, the &quot;Ula&quot;-class submarines would be kept in service for a further five years, but would not exceed 35 years total service as that would be too costly. Given the delay in replacing the Ula-class, it was subsequently decided to further life-extend the Ula-class through the 2020s until a new class of submarines entered service.

In 2016, two suppliers (DCNS and Thyssen Krupp) were shortlisted to provide competing options to replace the Ula-class boats. In February 2017, Thyssen Krupp was selected to provide four replacement submarines based on the Type 212-class for service entry in around 2030. A firm build contract had been anticipated in the first half of 2020. However, as of the end of 2020, the contract had not yet been signed. In March 2021 it was indicated that an agreement had been reached between Norway and Germany to initiate the acquisition program, pending approval by the Bundestag. The contract was signed in July 2021 and construction of the first vessel began in September 2023. Delivery of the first boat to the Royal Norwegian Navy is anticipated in 2029.

==Vessels==
Six submarines were delivered (1989–1992) to the RNoN. All are based at Haakonsvern in Bergen. The boats are all named after places in Norway, with the exception of &quot;Uredd&quot; (&quot;Fearless&quot; in English), in honour of the World War II submarine . The ship prefix for RNoN vessels is KNM (&quot;Kongelig Norsk Marine&quot;, Royal Norwegian Navy), in English HNoMS (His Norwegian Majesty&#x27;s Ship).

<text>A chamber tumulus is a large megalithic construct found in certain early neolithic societies. They have been uncovered along the Atlantic coastline in northern Europe, in countries such as France, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. These megaliths have also been found in southern Scandinavia, primarily in Scania and Falbygden. In Denmark there are numerous older megaliths, less advanced that the versions elsewhere, thought to be monuments marking communal burial places.

The chamber tumuli predate the ancient Egyptian pyramids, dating back to circa 6000-3000 B.C., depending on place of construction. Before the large farming reforms of the 19th century there were supposed to have been at least 10,000 of the older megaliths in Denmark. The more sophisticated later version does not appear in Denmark.

The practice of building these monuments is conjectured to have originated in Ireland or on the Atlantic coast of France where the oldest and largest versions of the monuments has been risen.

The newest of those monuments are located in Scandinavia, but pale in sophistication and complexity when compared with the megaliths along the Atlantic coast.

<text>A brandistock (also called brandestoc, buttafuore or feather staff) was a short type of polearm which was used by both infantry and civilians alike, primarily police officers in Italy between the 16th and 19th centuries. Measuring some long, the brandistock construction was unique for polearms in that it had a retractable blade. The head consisted of either a single or a trio of long thin points, which were kept in a hollow aperture inside the rest of the shaft. A sharp thrust of the weapon forward propelled the heads out, where they could be readily locked in place. This weapon is essentially a spear with a sliding blade, or alternatively, a long handled out-the-front gravity knife.

<doc id="1040059" wikidata="Q472644" url="?curid=1040059" title="Mongo Santamaría">
<text>Ramón &quot;Mongo&quot; Santamaría Rodríguez (April 7, 1917 – February 1, 2003) was a Cuban percussionist and bandleader who spent most of his career in the United States. Primarily a conga drummer, Santamaría was a leading figure in the pachanga and boogaloo dance crazes of the 1960s. His biggest hit was his rendition of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. From the 1970s, he recorded mainly salsa and Latin jazz, before retiring in the late 1990s.

Mongo learned to play the congas as an amateur rumba musician in the streets of Havana. He then learned the bongos from Clemente &quot;Chicho&quot; Piquero and toured with various successful bands such as the Lecuona Cuban Boys and Sonora Matancera. In 1950, he moved to New York City, where he became Tito Puente&#x27;s &quot;conguero&quot; and in 1957 he joined Cal Tjader&#x27;s band. He then formed his own charanga, while at the same time recording some of the first rumba and Santería music albums. By the end of the decade, he had his first pachanga hit, &quot;Para ti&quot;. He then became a pioneer of boogaloo with &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; and later signed record deals with Columbia, Atlantic and Fania. He collaborated with salsa artists and became a member of the Fania All-Stars, often showcasing his conga solos against Ray Barretto. In his later years, Santamaría recorded mostly Latin jazz for Concord Jazz and Chesky Records.

==Biography==

===Rumbero===

Santamaría learned rumba as a child in the streets of Havana&#x27;s Jesús María neighborhood. He reminisced: &quot;In the neighborhood where I came from we had all kinds of music, mostly from Africa. We did not leave it alone; we changed it our way. The music we made dealt with religion and conversation. The drum was our tool and we used it for everything&quot; (1979: 19). Gerard points out: &quot;Santamaría, like other drummers of his generation, learned music in the streets by observing different drummers. When he started playing professionally, he learned on the job. His approach was utilitarian, not theoretical&quot; (2001: 29). Santamaría was mentored on bongos and congas by Clemente &quot;Chicho&quot; Piquero, who played in Beny Moré&#x27;s band. He recalled: &quot;I would go with Chicho and play the tumbadora and also the [quinto]. I would play everything because I learned a lot from Chicho—because he could play everything&quot; (2001: 137).

Santamaría played some of the first recorded folkloric rumbas. Because he recorded for mainstream jazz labels, his folkloric records were consistently available to the public. Santamaría&#x27;s albums tended to list the personnel and their instruments, and record buyers came to know other Cuban rumberos, such as Armando Peraza, Francisco Aguabella, Julito Collazo, Carlos Vidal Bolado, Modesto Duran and Pablo Mozo. The 10 inch 33 1/3 rpm phonorecord &quot;Afro-Cuban Drums&quot; by Santamaría was recorded in SMC&#x27;s New York City studios on November 3, 1952. Santamaría&#x27;s next recordings with folkloric rumba were on &quot;Changó&quot; (re-issued as &quot;Drums and Chants&quot;) recorded in New York (1954). &quot;Yambú&quot; (1958), &quot;Mongo&quot; (1959), and &quot;Bembé&quot; (1960) followed.

Santamaría did not analyze his personal style: &quot;When I play I don&#x27;t know how I do it, or what I do ... I just play&quot; (2001: 29). The following example is an excerpt from a quinto performance by Santamaría on his composition &quot;Mi guaguancó&quot; (1959). The excerpt shows variations on two main motifs, marked as A and B. Santamaría&#x27;s use of repetition turns the secondary phrase (B), into the primary motif here.

===Drummer and band leader===
Santamaría began playing bongos with Septeto Beloña in 1937. In the 1940s he worked in the house band of the prestigious Tropicana nightclub. When Chicho could not go on the tour in Mexico in the late 1940s, he recommended Santamaría for the job. Mexico opened Santamaría up to the wider world beyond his island home. After returning from Mexico in 1950, Santamaría moved to New York City, where he became Tito Puente&#x27;s conga player. In 1957 Mongo Santamaría joined Cal Tjader&#x27;s Latin jazz combo.

In 1959 Santamaría recorded &quot;Afro Blue,&quot; the first jazz standard built upon a typical African 3:2 cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of 12/8, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato &quot;Afro Blue&quot; bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where you would normally tap your foot to &quot;keep time.&quot;

In 1960 Santamaría went to Havana, Cuba with Willie Bobo to record two albums &quot;Mongo in Havana&quot; and &quot;Bembe y Nuestro Hombre En La Habana&quot;. After recording, he returned to New York City to form the charanga orquestra La Sabrosa.

In late 1962 Chick Corea had given notice and Santamaría needed a pianist to fill in for the upcoming weekend gigs. Herbie Hancock got the temporary job. Hancock recalls what happened the night that Santamaría discovered &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, the only tune of Santamaría&#x27;s to reach the top of the pop charts:

The sudden success of the song (which Mongo Santamaria recorded on December 17, 1962) propelled Santamaría into his niche of blending Afro-Cuban and African American music. Santamaría went on to record Cuban-flavored versions of popular music R&amp;B and Motown songs.

===Death===
On February 1, 2003 Santamaria died in Miami, Florida, after suffering a stroke, at the age of 85. He is buried in Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn Park North Cemetery and Mausoleum) in Miami, Florida.

==Awards and honors==
Santamaria was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame and the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame the following year.

<text>The Lucerne hammer ( ) is a type of polearm which was popular in Swiss armies during the 15th to 17th centuries. It was a combination of the bec de corbin and a pronged war hammer.

==Origins==
The weapon originates from Switzerland, and the name comes from a discovery of many of these weapons in Lucerne, Switzerland.

==Design== 
The hammer-part of the Lucerne hammer is a three-to-four-pronged head mounted atop a long polearm shaft. It bears a long spike on its reverse, and an even longer spike extending from the top. They are occasionally found to have spikes on the side of the head as well.

==Use==
The Lucerne hammer requires both hands for effective handling. As a modified polearm, Lucerne hammers have multiple functions in battle. The forward-pointing spike could be used for spearing, while the hammer proved effective at puncturing or smashing armour. Like many other polearms, the Lucerne hammer was also used for dismounting the enemy. The long pole increased the velocity of the head when the hammer was struck, resulting in tremendous force upon impact.

<text>Barbara Herrnstein Smith (born 1932) is an American literary critic and theorist, best known for her work &quot;Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory&quot;. She is currently the Braxton Craven Professor of Comparative Literature and English and director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Science and Cultural Theory at Duke University, and also Distinguished Professor of English at Brown University.

==Biography==
Smith briefly studied at City College of New York, studying biology, experimental psychology, and philosophy. She then earned her B.A. (&quot;summa cum laude&quot;) in 1954 and her Ph.D. from Brandeis University. Brandeis University reports Smith earned her doctorate in 1965, and Duke University reports she earned her doctorate in 1963.

From 1961 to 1973, Smith taught at Bennington College. She accepted a faculty position at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973. In 1987 she joined the Duke University faculty, and also joined Brown University in 2003.

Smith has also occupied numerous short-term and honorary posts. She was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

==Scholarship and work==
Smith is a well-known writer, most particularly for her 1988 work on critical theory, &quot;Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory&quot;. In this work, she attempts to situate the various liberal, conservative, and other views of &quot;values&quot; within her &quot;metametatheory&quot; of contingencies, an economics-influenced theoretical approach. She uses her theory to address literary, aesthetic, and other types of values, attempting to discern whether any objective standards may be applied.

Other works include &quot;Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End&quot;, &quot;Belief and Resistance: Dynamics of Contemporary Intellectual Controversy&quot;, and an edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets; she has published numerous books and articles on language, literature, and critical theory.

In recent years she has been doing considerable work on science and the humanities, including &quot;Scandalous Knowledge&quot; and her 2006 Terry lectures at Yale, &quot;Natural Reflections: Human Cognition at the Nexus of Science and Religion.&quot;

<doc id="1040074" wikidata="Q936556" url="?curid=1040074" title="Skjold-class corvette">
<text>&quot;Skjold&quot;-class corvettes (skjold means &quot;shield&quot; in Norwegian) are a class of six light, superfast, stealth missile corvettes in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy. The boats were formerly classed as MTBs (motor torpedo boats) but, from 2009, the Royal Norwegian Navy has described them as corvettes (&quot;korvett&quot;) because their seaworthiness is seen as comparable to corvettes, and because they do not carry torpedoes. They were built at the Umoe Mandal yard. With a maximum speed of , the &quot;Skjold&quot;-class corvettes were the fastest combat ships afloat at the time of their introduction., beaten by the Abu Dhabi MAR WP-18 Interceptor.

==Design==

The &quot;Skjold&quot; design is a surface effect craft, constructed of glass fibre/carbon composite materials. Buoyancy is augmented underway by a fan-blown skirted compartment between the two rigid catamaran-type hulls. This provides an alternative solution to the planing hull/vee hull compromise: the air cushion reduces wave slam at high speeds while presenting a low-drag flat planing profile at the waterline.

To ensure stealth capabilities, anechoic coatings of radar absorbent materials (RAM) have been used in the load-bearing structures over large areas of the ship. This strategy leads to significant weight saving compared to the conventional construction technique of applying RAM cladding to the external surfaces. The ship&#x27;s profile has a faceted appearance with no right angle structures and few orientations of reflective panels. Doors and hatches are flush with the surfaces and the windows are flush without visible coaming (edge of window aperture) and are fitted with radar reflective screens. The vessels are additionally protected by the Rheinmetall MASS sensor / decoy system.

The final design was changed compared to the prototype &quot;Skjold&quot;, which itself was rebuilt to the new specifications. Most notably, the vessels use 4 gas turbines combined by Renk COGAG gear units built in a lightweight design. The smaller gas turbines rated 2,000 kW turbines are used for cruising speed. For sprint speed a second, larger gas turbine is combined providing a total of 6,000 kW to the waterjet on each shaft line. Two MTU 123 cruise diesel propulsion units used previously at loiter speeds were removed. The foredeck was strengthened to accommodate the addition of a 76 mm Otobreda Super Rapid gun.

The hull material was produced by a different method to improve strength and minimize vulnerability to fire. The bridge saw some changes, including an upgrade to six weapon systems control consoles.

In 2020, the Norwegian Government decided to further upgrade the &quot;Skjold&quot;-class vessels, partially to compensate for the loss of the frigate &quot;Helge Ingstad&quot;. The upgrades of the four ships would take place between 2020 and 2024, permitting the &quot;Skjold&quot;-class to remain up-to-date through to 2030 when replacement vessels were envisaged under terms of the government&#x27;s defence plan.

==US Navy==


The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard expressed interest in the design and leased the P960 for a period of one year, from 2001 until 2002. During that time it was operated by a 14-person Norwegian crew from Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.

<doc id="1040087" wikidata="Q1920776" url="?curid=1040087" title="Man catcher">
<text>A man catcher, also known as catchpole, is a type of polearm.

==History==

It was used in Europe as late as the 18th century.
The European design consisted of a pole mounted with a two pronged head. Each prong was semi-circular in shape with a spring-loaded &quot;door&quot; on the front. This created an effective valve that would allow the ring to pass around a man-sized cylinder and keep it trapped. The man catcher was used primarily to pull a person from horseback and drag him to the ground where he could be helplessly pinned. This is one of the few examples of less-lethal polearms.

The design assumes that the captured person wears armor to protect him against the metal prongs, which could easily hurt the neck of a person without armor. The man catcher was also used to trap and contain violent prisoners.

Similarly, the Japanese &quot;sodegarami&quot;, &quot;tsukubō&quot;, and &quot;sasumata&quot; were used by Edo-era law enforcement for apprehending suspects. However, the &quot;sasumata&quot; was most like a man catcher in usage as its forked head was designed to pin the suspect&#x27;s neck, legs, arms, or joints against a wall or the ground.

==Modern variants==
===Japan===

While other man catchers are no longer in use, the &quot;sasumata&quot; (described above) currently has modern variants that are semi-flexible, with padding, blunt endpoints, and other slightly modified geometry, designed to significantly reduce the chance of injury to restrained civilians. These variants are designed for use by non-soldiers—specifically, they are intended for use by a Japanese riot police mounted on horseback. In such a case, the mounted riot police would typically be arranged in formation line abreast, and would use a row of raised &quot;sasumata&quot; to hold back large crowds. These mounted riot police answer to the Japanese National Police Agency. Since the outbreak of serious riots is uncommon in Japan, the modern &quot;sasumata&quot; is rarely used. Nevertheless, the necessary training is kept up to date.

===China===
A type of locking man catcher is available for staff at train stations and airports in China to capture and restrain individuals in a non-lethal manner.

In some junior and middle schools, security guards are equipped with non-locking variants designed to seize a person&#x27;s waist or prevent them from advancing. It is essentially a two-pronged fork, a &quot;U&quot;-shape projecting from a pole.

===India and Nepal===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in India, police in Chandigarh implemented a mechanical device resembling a man catcher in order to capture suspects while maintaining a safe social distance. It was created to be used on a person&#x27;s waistline. They called it a &quot;social distancing clamp&quot; or a &quot;lockdown-breaker catcher&quot;. It was based on an idea from police in Nepal, where officers have reportedly detained over 1,400 suspects using a similar &quot;multifunctional arrest device&quot;. Mancatchers were also used for other purposes such as pulling dead bodies out of the water. The main difference between the designs is that those used in India expand the size of the clamp depending on the person&#x27;s waistline.

<doc id="1040090" wikidata="Q765394" url="?curid=1040090" title="Hauk-class patrol boat">
<text>The &quot;Hauk&quot;-class patrol boats were a series of Norwegian fast attack craft. &quot;Hauk&quot; means hawk in Norwegian. They were ordered in the 1970s and the first boat, &quot;Hauk&quot;, was commissioned on 17 August 1977. Designed as a development of the and classes, by Lieutenant commander (later Captain) Harald Henriksen, the 14 &quot;Hauk&quot;-class vessels made up the Coastal Combat Flotilla, responsible for protecting the rugged coastline of Norway. The ships were modernized frequently and in their later form were known as &quot;Super-&quot;Hauks&quot;.&quot; The Royal Norwegian Navy deployed four of these warships for anti-terror patrol in the Strait of Gibraltar.

To ensure that their capability met contemporary standards the &quot;Hauk&quot;-class boats were modernized to Super-Hauk standard with the arrival of the new and more modern MTBs. This modernization included incorporation of the Senit 8 CMS, Link 11 (receive only), modifications of the Penguin missiles and upgrades to the navigation equipment.

All the boats were decommissioned by 2008.

== International operations ==

The vessels were used as escort for allied vessels through the Strait of Gibraltar as part of Operation Active Endeavour. The Norwegian contribution consisted of 21 MTB Squadron and its four vessels. The squadron was stationed in Cadiz along with two Danish vessels of &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class. The mission lasted from April to October 2003, and the vessels were widely praised for their efforts.

In November 2006, the vessels were probably once called for international duty when 22 MTB squadron became part of UNIFIL II - a maritime UN contributions in the coastal area outside Lebanon that would prevent arms smuggling in the area. The vessels were stationed in Limassol, Cyprus.

== Hugin Class ==
Sweden had a parallel development of their own Norwegian built patrol boats in the Hugin-class, the hulls are the same as the Hauk class.
Both classes where built by the same Norwegian shipyard simultaneously.

<text>Opticom ASA is a Norwegian research and development company. The Opticom share was listed on the Oslo Børs (Oslo Stock Exchange) in 1997 and on the main list from the start of trading in January, 2000. Since its establishment in 1994, Opticom and its subsidiaries have done research and development within a number of areas, especially the emerging field of polymer electronics.

The company developed polymer-based memory chips through its majority-owned subsidiary Thin Film Electronics ASA (TFE). Opticom and Intel, which owned a minority stake in TFE, wound down their joint development work in 2005 because of technical and changes in strategic direction. Opticom has announced its intention to pursue other avenues for the technology underlying TFE&#x27;s memory designs. Opticom also owned nearly a tenth of Fast Search and Transfer.

Opticom can be seen as an example of the year 2000 internet bubble, reaching a market capitalization of nearly $8 billion at its highest, still without revenues.

<doc id="1040109" wikidata="Q372784" url="?curid=1040109" title="Demutualization">
<text>Demutualization is the process by which a customer-owned mutual organization (&quot;mutual&quot;) or co-operative changes legal form to a joint stock company. It is sometimes called stocking or privatization. As part of the demutualization process, members of a mutual usually receive a &quot;windfall&quot; payout, in the form of shares in the successor company, a cash payment, or a mixture of both. Mutualization or mutualisation is the opposite process, wherein a shareholder-owned company is converted into a mutual organization, typically through takeover by an existing mutual organization. Furthermore, re-mutualization depicts the process of aligning or refreshing the interest and objectives of the members of the mutual society.

The mutual traditionally raises capital from its customer members in order to provide services to them (for example building societies, where members&#x27; savings enable the provision of mortgages to members). It redistributes some profits to its members. By contrast, a joint stock company raises capital from its shareholders and other financial sources in order to provide services to its customers, with profits or assets distributed to equity or debt investors. In a mutual organization, therefore, the legal roles of customer and owner are united in one form (&quot;members&quot;), whereas in the joint stock company the roles are distinct. This allows a broader capital base if the customers cannot or will not provide sufficient financing to the organization. However, a joint stock company must also try to maximize the return for its owners instead of only maximizing the return and customer services to its customers. This can lead to a decline in customer service to the extent that customers&#x27;, management&#x27;s and shareholders&#x27; interests diverge.

A very early example of demutualization were the changes to the structure of the Union Insurance Society of Canton initiated by its secretary N.J. Ede between 1873 and 1882 leading to its re-registration as a limited company having originated as a mutual assurance society for traders in Canton in 1835.

== Types of demutualizations ==

There are three general methods in which an organization might demutualize, full demutualization, sponsored demutualization, and into a mutual holding company (MHC). In any type of demutualization, insurance policies, outstanding loans, etc., are not directly affected by the organization&#x27;s change of legal form.

* In a full demutualization, the mutual completely converts to a stock company, and passes on its own (newly issued) stock, cash, and/or policy credits to the members or policyholders. No attempt is made to preserve mutuality in any form. However, in a full demutualization of a mutual savings bank, stock is issued to investors in an initial public offering, while the depositors, who theoretically owned the bank before demutualization, do not automatically receive stock and must separately invest. Under United States federal and state regulations, depositors receive first priority to purchase the stock before any other investors.
* A sponsored demutualization is similar; the mutual is fully demutualized and its policyholders or members are compensated. The difference is that the mutuality is essentially &quot;bought&quot; by a stock corporation. Instead of receiving stock in the formerly mutual company, stock in the new parent company is granted instead.
* A mutual holding company is a hybrid concept, part stock company and part mutual company. Technically, the members still own over 50% of the company as a whole. Because of this, they are generally not significantly compensated for what would otherwise be viewed as loss of property. (This is also why many jurisdictions, including Canada, disallow the formation of MHCs.) The core participants are isolated into a special segment of the company, still viewed as &quot;mutual&quot;. The rest is a stock company. This part of the business might be publicly traded, or held as a wholly owned subsidiary until such time that the organization should choose to go public.

Mutual holding companies are not allowed in New York where attempts by mutual insurance to pass permissible legislation failed. Opponents of mutual insurance holding companies referred to the establishment of mutual holding companies in New York as &quot;Legalized Theft&quot;.

Some MHC demutualizations have been planned as the first of a two-stage process. The second stage would be full demutualization once the transition pains into MHC status are complete. In other cases, the MHC is the final stage.

Note that some mutual companies, such as Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and the MassMutual, have owned stock companies listed on a stock exchange. Nationwide bought back its subsidiary stock company in full, on December 31, 2008. These are not MHCs, however; they are simply mutual companies which have majority control over one or more stock companies. Other mutual companies may own some of another company&#x27;s stock, but as simply an asset, not something they actually control. Finally, many mutual companies, including Nationwide and MassMutual, have wholly owned subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may technically be stock companies, but the mutual owns all the stock. For example, the &quot;New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation&quot; (NYLIAC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC). A person may purchase an insurance policy from either company, but only those who own participating policies from NYLIC are mutual members. Other policyholders are customers.

==Examples==

===Security exchanges===
The Stockholm Stock Exchange was the first exchange to demutualize in 1993, followed by Helsinki (1995), Copenhagen (1996), Amsterdam (1997), the Australian Exchange (1998) and Toronto, Hong Kong and London Stock Exchanges in 2000. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange became a shareholder-owned public corporation in 2000 through a public offering. &quot;The road to this initial public offering began in June 2000, when Exchange members voted overwhelmingly to transform the then not-for-profit, membership-owned organization into a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. On November 13, 2000, CME became the first U.S. exchange or commodities exchange to demutualize into a joint stock corporation.&quot; The Chicago Mercantile Exchange had its IPO on December 6, 2002.

The Chicago Board of Trade similarly carried out an IPO in 2005, having previously been &quot;a self-governing, self-regulated Delaware not-for-profit, non-stock corporation that serves individuals and member firms&quot;. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong underwent a similar process of demutualization and was publicly traded.

SIX Group, a global financial service provider based in Switzerland, represents an extra ordinary form of a mutualised organisation. The owners are limited to an exclusive group of service consumers, in particular Swiss and foreign banks. This entails a closer relationship with the customer, since a customer might influence the customer-oriented behavior by the magnitude of its own equity holding of SIX Group – in this category the subsidiary SIX Swiss Exchange AG.

===Life insurers===
Over 200 US mutual life insurance companies have demutualized since 1930. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century numerous large mutuals such as Prudential, MetLife, John Hancock, Mutual of New York, Manulife, Sun Life, Principal, and Phoenix Mutual decided to demutualize and return to policyowners all the profits they had accumulated as mutual life insurers. Policyowners were awarded cash, stock and policy credits exceeding $100 billion in a wave of demutualizations, which have been regarded by some as very rewarding to the new owners although the effect on customers is not discussed. Others show that the demutualization process is detrimental to customers.

The boards of directors of other mutual companies, which include Northwestern Mutual, Massachusetts Mutual, New York Life, Pacific Life, Penn Mutual, Guardian Life, Minnesota Life, Ohio National Life, National Life Group, Union Central Life, Acacia life, and Ameritas Life decided to either remain mutual or they decided to form mutual insurance holding companies. At the end of 2006 there were fewer than 80 mutual life insurers in the United States. Some of these mutual companies award dividends to their policyowners. For example, Northwestern Mutual expects to pay more than $5 billion in dividends to participating policyowners in 2008. Northwestern Mutual has paid its policyowners more than $65 billion in dividends, since the company was founded 151 years ago. Mass Mutual Financial Group&#x27;s Web site defines life insurance policy dividends.

===Agricultural cooperatives===
Numerous agricultural supply and marketing cooperatives have demutualized.
One of the largest, CF Industries, a manufacturer and distributor of fertilizers in the United States, was for 56 years a cooperative federation. CF then demutualized and made an initial public offering of equity stock in 2005.

Another large example is Kerry Co-operative Creameries of Ireland, a milk and meat processor that partially demutualized in 1986 under the so-called Irish model, with the primary business of the co-operative transferred to a publicly traded company Kerry Group and the shareholding split between the co-operative and its farmer members. Since this partial demutualisation, the co-operative has gradually reduced its holding in the Kerry Group in order to fund an extensive redemption scheme of its own co-operative shares held by farmer members.

Murray Goulburn Co-operative and Australia&#x27;s 2016 dairy crisis is another large example.

===Building societies===

A building society is a form of mutual mortgage provision organization that emerged in the UK in the 19th century, for personal savings and home mortgages. For much of the 20th century, building societies had a large share of the retail savings market, and they had their zenith after the deregulation under the Building Societies Act 1986.
Following that Act, many of the larger societies, beginning with Abbey National, the second largest, in 1989, and including the Halifax Building Society, the largest, soon converted into joint stock banking companies, some of which were subsequently acquired by other banks. Many societies soon became targets of speculative &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;, who opened savings accounts in order to obtain a windfall, in cash or shares, in the event of demutualisation.
Most of the remaining societies, such as the Nationwide Building Society, the largest remaining mutual, adopted poison pill clauses in their rules as a defense against carpetbaggers. These took the form of a charitable assignment provision that requires new members to assign any compensation from demutualization to charity.

===Membership associations===
The UK motorists&#x27; organization, The Automobile Association, demutualized and was purchased by Centrica plc in 1999.
The sale was completed in July 2000 for £1.1 billion.

===Retail consumers&#x27; cooperatives===
As well as the many agricultural supply cooperatives that demutualized, a small number of general retail consumer&#x27;s cooperatives have demutualized or considered demutualization. In 1997, Andrew Regan launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid to demutualize the UK&#x27;s giant Co-operative Wholesale Society, which, despite its name, was a large retailer in its own right. In 2007, the tiny Scottish retailer, Musselburgh and Fisherrow Co-operative Society, completed most or all of the steps necessary to demutualize. In 2008, a Swiss competition regulator recommended demutualization to Switzerland&#x27;s leading supermarket chains, Coop and Migros.

===Retailers&#x27; co-operatives===

Irish grocer-owned retailers&#x27; cooperative, ADM Londis, changed its capital structure in 2004 to an unlisted public limited company, allowing its owners to trade its stock privately at market value.

<doc id="1040111" wikidata="Q644656" url="?curid=1040111" title="Thomas Buergenthal">
<text>Thomas Buergenthal (11 May 1934 – 29 May 2023) was a Czechoslovak-born American international lawyer, scholar, law school dean, and judge of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). He resigned his ICJ post as of 6 September 2010 and returned to his position at The George Washington University Law School where he was the Lobingier Professor Emeritus of Comparative Law and Jurisprudence.

==Early life==
Thomas Buergenthal was known as one of the youngest holocaust victims to survive places like Auschwitz and Sachsenhausen, which were concentration camps. The first 11 years of his life were spent under German authority. It is known that when the Germans were pushed out by the Soviet army in January 1945, the Germans forced the victims out by marching them; it was a long journey, people began to get tired and if they stopped they were executed. Buergenthal was one of the few children to survive the three day march to Sachsenhausen, where Buergenthal would soon be liberated. His mother was liberated from a different concentration camp around the same time, though they did not find each other until 1946. His father was killed shortly before liberation in yet another camp. Buergenthal, born to German-Jewish/Polish-Jewish parents who had moved from Germany to Czechoslovakia in 1933, grew up in the Jewish ghetto of Kielce (Poland) and later in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Sachsenhausen. After the War he lived with his mother in Göttingen.

On 4 December 1951, he emigrated from Germany to the United States. He studied at Bethany College in West Virginia (graduated 1957), and received his J.D. at New York University Law School in 1960, and his LL.M. and S.J.D. degrees in international law from Harvard Law School. Judge Buergenthal is the recipient of numerous honorary degrees from American, European and Latin American Universities, including the University of Heidelberg in Germany, the Free University of Brussels in Belgium, the State University of New York, the American University, the University of Minnesota, and the George Washington University.

==Career==
Buergenthal was a specialist in international law and human rights law.

Buergenthal served as a judge on the International Court of Justice at The Hague from 2 March 2000 to his resignation on 6 September 2010. Prior to his election to the International Court of Justice, he was the Lobingier Professor of Comparative Law and Jurisprudence at The George Washington University Law School. He was Dean of Washington College of Law of American University from 1980 to 1985, and held endowed professorships at the University of Texas, SUNY/Buffalo Law School, and Emory University. While at Emory, he was the director of the Human Rights Program of the Carter Center. Buergenthal served as a judge for many years, including lengthy periods on various specialized international bodies. Between 1979 and 1991, he served as a judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, including a term as that court&#x27;s president; from 1989 to 1994, he was a judge on the Inter-American Development Bank&#x27;s Administrative Tribunal; in 1992 and 1993, he served on the United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador; and from 1995 to 1999, he was a member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.

Buergenthal was the author of more than a dozen books and a large number of articles on international law, human rights and comparative law subjects. He was member of a number of editorial boards of law journals, including the American Journal of International Law. He also served as a member of the Ethics Commission of the International Olympic Committee.

On 9 July 2004, Judge Buergenthal was the sole dissenter in the advisory opinion on the Israeli West Bank barrier, where the ICJ found 14-1 that the Israeli-built barrier into the occupied West Bank violated international law and should be torn down. While he stated that Israeli settlements were illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention and that the Palestinians had the right of self-determination, Judge Buergenthal felt that the court hadn’t looked into the question of self-defense adequately.

Judge Buergenthal was a co-recipient of the 2008 Gruber Prize for Justice for his contributions to the promotion and protection of human rights in different parts of the world, and particularly in Latin America. He was also a recipient of the following awards: Goler T. Butcher Medal, American Society of International Law, 1997; Manley O. Hudson Medal, American Society of International Law, 2002; Elie Wiesel Award, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, 2015; and Olympic Order, International Olympic Committee, 2015.

Buergenthal strongly supported the creation of the International Nuremberg Principles Academy in Nuremberg, Germany, and became the first President of its Advisory Council in 2014. From 2016 until his death in 2023, he served as its Honorary President.

His memoir, &quot;A Lucky Child&quot;, which describes his experience in various German concentration camps, has been translated into more than a dozen languages, including German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish.

==Death==
Buergenthal died on 29 May 2023, at the age of 89. He is survived by his wife, three sons, two step children, and ten grandchildren, of which two are lawyers.

<doc id="1040123" wikidata="Q622857" url="?curid=1040123" title="National interest">
<text>The national interest is a sovereign state&#x27;s goals and ambitions – be it economic, military, cultural, or otherwise – taken to be the aim of its government.

==Etymology==
The Italian phrase &quot;ragione degli stati&quot; was first used by Giovanni della Casa around the year 1547.

The expression &quot;reason of state&quot; (Ragion di Stato) was formulated in 1580, found in the works of Giovanni Botero, who was influenced by, and wrote criticisms of the Italian diplomat and political thinker Niccolò Machiavelli, popularly known as the author of The Prince and The Discourses on Livy. Prominently, Chief Minister Cardinal Richelieu justified France&#x27;s intervention on the Protestant side, despite its own Catholicism, in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-48) as being in the national interest in order to block the increasing power of the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor. At Richelieu&#x27;s prompting, Jean de Silhon defended the concept of &quot;raison d&#x27;État&quot; as &quot;a mean between what conscience permits and affairs require.&quot;

==Usage==
Within the field of international relations, national interest has frequently been assumed to comprise the pursuit of power, security and wealth. Neorealist and liberal institutionalist scholars tend to define national interest as revolving around security and power. Liberal scholars view national interests as an aggregation of the preferences of domestic political groups. Constructivist scholars reject that the national interest of states are static and can be assumed &quot;a priori&quot;; rather, they argue that the preferences of states are shaped through social interactions and are changeable.

In a February 2020 article for CSIS, Gordon de Brouwer argued: &quot;The national interest has three components—security, prosperity, and social wellbeing—and they should all be part of framing the problem and solutions. All three matter. More than ever, they reinforce each other. Security underpins prosperity, prosperity creates power and pays for security, and a well-functioning society reduces economic and security risks.&quot;

<text>East Montlake Park is a park in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, USA. The park is bounded on the north by the Montlake Cut, on the east by Union Bay, on the south by Washington State Route 520, and on the west by East Park Drive E. It is across from the Huskies Stadium. There is a large parking area.

The 1971 Montlake Cut Waterside Trail runs through the park past the 40-foot totem pole shown at right on its way to West Montlake Park. A plaque at the bottom of the totem pole states that it was carved in 1937 by John Dewey Wallace, a Haida chief, in Waterfall, Alaska. The dedication ceremony for the donated totem pole took place in May 1983. The park used to house the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) until the museum was relocated to a different location. There are also floating paths, an observation deck, and some benches.

Before construction of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge replacement, McCurdy Park, formerly home to the Museum of History &amp; Industry, existed to the south and east. Since 2019, East Montlake Park has been closed for preparation of the WSDOT 520 bridge replacement project.

<doc id="1040128" wikidata="Q1860665" url="?curid=1040128" title="List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit">
<text>This is a list of satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GSO). These satellites are commonly used for communication purposes, such as radio and television networks, back-haul, and direct broadcast. Traditional global navigation systems do not use geosynchronous satellites, but some SBAS navigation satellites do. A number of weather satellites are also present in geosynchronous orbits. Not included in the list below are several more classified military geosynchronous satellites, such as PAN.

A special case of geosynchronous orbit is the geostationary orbit, which is a circular geosynchronous orbit at zero inclination (that is, directly above the equator). A satellite in a geostationary orbit appears stationary, always at the same point in the sky, to ground observers. Popularly or loosely, the term &quot;geosynchronous&quot; may be used to mean geostationary. Specifically, [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) may be a synonym for geosynchronous equatorial orbit, or [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary Earth orbit]]. To avoid confusion, geosynchronous satellites that are not in geostationary orbit are sometimes referred to as being in an inclined geostationary orbit (IGSO).

Some of these satellites are separated from each other by as little as 0.1° longitude. This corresponds to an inter-satellite spacing of approximately 73 km. The major consideration for spacing of geostationary satellites is the beamwidth at-orbit of uplink transmitters, which is primarily a factor of the size and stability of the uplink dish, as well as what frequencies the satellite&#x27;s transponders receive; satellites with discontiguous frequency allocations can be much closer together.

As of July 2023, the website UCS Satellite Database lists 6,718 known satellites. Of these, 580 are listed in the database as being at GEO. The website provides a spreadsheet containing details of all the satellites, which can be downloaded.

Listings are from west to east (decreasing longitude in the Western Hemisphere and increasing longitude in the Eastern Hemisphere) by orbital position, starting and ending with the International Date Line. Satellites in inclined geosynchronous orbit are so indicated by a note in the &quot;remarks&quot; columns.

<text>Garden City is a census-designated place (CDP) in and county seat of Glasscock County, Texas, United States. It lies near the center of the county, south of Big Spring, and at the 2020 census had a population of 334. The ZIP code is 79739.

==History==

Garden City&#x27;s history began in 1886, when what became the town&#x27;s post office was established in a general store, and a settlement began to develop in the area around the business. The post office was to be named after the store proprietor, a man named Gardner. However, after a clerical error by officials in Washington, the postal franchise was granted under the name &quot;Garden&quot; City.

Garden City was the first Texas community platted by renowned surveyor W. D. Twichell, a Minnesota native.

In 1893, Glasscock County was organized, and Garden City vied for the county seat along with two other area communities, New California and Dixie. New California was ultimately chosen as the county seat; it was located in a less flood-prone region with a readily accessible water supply. However, at the time of the county&#x27;s organization, New California consisted of two dwellings and an equally sparse population, whereas Garden City boasted a school, the general store/post office, and several homes. In a unique compromise, most of Garden City&#x27;s structures were placed on wheels and relocated to the New California site, and on April 5, 1893, the settlement was renamed Garden City. A two-story stone courthouse was constructed later that same year, followed by a new, larger courthouse in 1910 (with the former building remaining in use as the Glasscock County Jail).

Between 1927 and 1943, Garden City&#x27;s population fluctuated between 100 and 250, and several businesses and a newspaper (the Garden City &quot;Gazette&quot;) had come and gone. By 1945, Garden City had eight businesses and a population of 200. In the 1950s, oil was discovered nearby, creating a bit of a boom for the area. While Garden City&#x27;s population did not experience the spike that other West Texas oil boom towns had seen (the population peaked at 300 in 1968, many years after the boom had ended), it did increase the community&#x27;s commerce, with the number of operating businesses almost doubling from 1947 to 1968. By 1980, the population had fallen to 293, a figure maintained until 2010, when that year&#x27;s census counted 334 residents.

The area is conducive to wind power generation, as is much of West Texas, and several wind farms have been proposed for the area.

Limestone from the quarry of TexaStone in Garden City was donated in 2004 for establishment of the Stonehenge replica in Odessa, Texas.

==Demographics==
Garden City first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 334 people, 78 households, and 67 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Garden City is served by the Glasscock County Independent School District and home to the Garden City High School Bearkats.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Garden City has a semiarid climate, &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Alexander Morton (born 24 March 1945) is a Scottish actor. 

==Acting career==
Glasgow-born Morton trained in London at the Central School of Speech and Drama from 1965 to 1968 and is well known for his roles in several leading drama series, such as &quot;Taggart&quot;, &quot;Second Sight&quot;, &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot;, and &quot;Casualty&quot;; movies such as Croupier and London to Brighton; and single dramas &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1996), &quot;Looking After Jo Jo&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Man-Eating Wolves of Gysinge&quot; (2005).

He is best known for playing the Golly Mackenzie in the BBC TV series &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2000–2005, appearing in all 64 episodes), and before that made regular appearances over the 1980s and 1990s as the evil Andy Semple in Scottish soap &quot;Take the High Road&quot;. From 2012 to 2015, Morton played Criminal Billy Kennedy in Scottish soap opera &quot;River City&quot;. He appeared again as Billy Kennedy in the 20th anniversary episode of the show in 2022. 

Highlights of his stage career include his work with Raindog Theatre Company in the early 1990s. He was a founder member, along with Robert Carlyle, Caroline Paterson and Stuart Davis and others. Leading roles with Raindog included his Scots rendition of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; and R.P. McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, both directed by Robert Carlyle. Morton also worked regularly with theatre companies 7:84 and Borderline, and has appeared at the Traverse, the Lyceum, the Bush, the Royal Court, as well as appearing in pantomime, notably two years running at the Eden Court Theatre in Inverness with Andy Gray, and at Glasgow&#x27;s King&#x27;s Theatre.

In 2006, Morton played the Prince of Darkness in the BBC Radio adaptation of &quot;Dracula&quot; (Voyage of the Demeter, 2006). He was also the first actor to play Detective Inspector John Rebus in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Ian Rankin&#x27;s &quot;Rebus&quot; series of books. He also provided voices for video games, including &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, &quot;&quot; and he played Zoltan Chivay in series 2 and 3 of &quot;The Witcher.&quot; He was the narrator on three albums by the Swiss Celtic / Melodic Death Metal band Eluveitie.

==Personal life==
Morton has been married three times, and has two children – Kerry (b. 1970) and Jamie (b. 1980) – from each of his first two marriages. His first wife was Pam Scotcher; his second was Denise; and his third is Jane, whom he met before filming for &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; got underway. She was his landlady while he was doing television work in London.

<doc id="1040159" wikidata="Q3147832" url="?curid=1040159" title="Who is a Jew?">
<text>&quot;Who is a Jew?&quot; (, ), is a basic question about Jewish identity and considerations of Jewish self-identification. The question pertains to ideas about Jewish personhood, which have cultural, ethnic, religious, political, genealogical, and personal dimensions. Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism follow Jewish law (halakha), deeming people to be Jewish if their mothers are Jewish or if they underwent a halakhic conversion. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism accept both matrilineal and patrilineal descent as well as conversion. Karaite Judaism predominantly follows patrilineal descent as well as conversion.

Jewish identity is also commonly defined through ethnicity. Opinion polls have suggested that the majority of modern Jews see being Jewish as predominantly a matter of ancestry and culture, rather than religion.

There is controversy over Jewish identification in Israel, as it affects citizenship and personal status issues like marriage. Israel&#x27;s Law of Return grants citizenship to those with a Jewish parent or grandparent, even if not religious. But the rabbinical courts use halakhic rules for marriage, requiring Orthodox conversions for those without a Jewish mother. This creates conflicts between different branches of Judaism.

The Nazis defined Jews based on their ancestry and persecuted them on a racial basis. Antisemites have also defined Jews for discriminatory goals. Jews themselves have varying self-definitions, ranging from religious observance to secular ethnic identity. There is no consensus, but common themes emphasize ancestry, culture, and community belonging, even for secular Jews and converts to other religions.

== What is a Jew? ==
The term &quot;Jew&quot; lends itself to several definitions beyond simply denoting one who practices Judaism. The historical Israelites and/or Hebrews, who promulgated Judaism, were not simply a homogeneous assemblage united by a common ideology; they constituted an ethnoreligious group from whom a majority of modern Jews directly descend. Because of this, an ethnic form of Jewish identity exists alongside the religious form, and the concepts of Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated. Additionally, conversion allows for one who has no prior connection to the historical Jewish population to become a Jew. 

In essence, the word &quot;Jew&quot; can be defined as a conglomerate of several different, albeit closely related, ideas:

* A Jew is one who practices the Jewish religion, Judaism. This includes both converts and those who have been members of the Jewish religion since birth. 
* A Jew is one who is a direct descendant of the ancient Israelite ethnic group, and therefore is a member of the Jewish &quot;people&quot;. This includes those who may not be observantly religious, or may be irreligious altogether, and claim an overtly cultural connection, though some scholars limit the definition to descendants of Israelites who practice Judaism.
* A Jew is one who, regardless of current religious identity, is directly descended from a Jewish ancestor. Traditionally, this has only applied to matrilineal ancestry, although some Jewish groups also recognize Jewishness by way of patrilineal descent.

== Traditional interpretation and variations ==

The definition of who is a Jew varies according to whether it is being considered by Jews on the basis of religious law and tradition or self-identification, or by non-Jews for other reasons, sometimes for prejudicial purposes. Because Jewish identity can include characteristics of an ethnicity, a religion, or peoplehood, the definition depends on either traditional or newer interpretations of Jewish law and custom.

Israel&#x27;s Law of Return stipulates that a Jew is someone with a Jewish mother or someone who has converted to Judaism and is not a member of another religion. The Israeli Chief Rabbinate requires documents proving the Jewishness of one’s mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and great-great-grandmother when applying for marriage. The British Office of the Chief Rabbi (OCR) has underlined the basic principle that a child is not recognised by the OCR and other bodies as Jewish unless their mother is Jewish, or they underwent a conversion recognized by the body.

According to the simplest definition used by most Jews for self-identification, a person is a Jew by birth or becomes one through religious conversion. However, there are differences in interpretations when it comes to non-Orthodox Jewish denominations in the application of this definition, including

* Should a person with only a Jewish father be considered Jewish?
* Which conversion processes should be considered valid?
* Can one remain a Jew after converting to another religion?
* How does being unaware of having Jewish parents affect one&#x27;s Jewish status?
* How is Jewish identity determined in different countries throughout the Jewish Diaspora?
* How is the claim to Israeli citizenship adjudicated in the context of the Basic Laws of Israel?

== Tannaitic Judaism ==
According to the Mishnah, the first written source for halakha, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined matrilineally.

According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen, in the Bible, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (&quot;kilayim&quot;). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother.

== Contemporary Judaism ==
All Jewish religious movements agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion. According to &quot;halakha,&quot; a Jew by birth must be born to a Jewish mother. &quot;Halakha&quot; states that the acceptance of the principles and practices of Judaism does not make a person a Jew. However, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, as movements which reject the concept of &quot;halakha&quot;, often accept a child as Jewish when only the father is Jewish, provided that the child chooses to identify as Jewish. As conversion processes differ, those performed by more liberal denominations are not accepted by more orthodox denominations.

=== Jewish by birth ===

According to &quot;halakha&quot;, to determine a person&#x27;s Jewish status (Hebrew: ) one needs to consider the status of both parents. If both parents are Jewish, their child will also be considered Jewish, and the child takes the standing of the father (e.g., as a kohen). If either parent is subject to an halakhic breaking status (e.g., is a mamzer) then the child is also subject to that status. If one of the parents is not Jewish, the rule is that the child takes the standing of the mother (Kiddushin 68b, Shulchan Aruch, EH 4:19). The ruling is derived from various sources including , , . Accordingly, if the mother is Jewish, so is her child, and if she is not Jewish, neither is her child considered Jewish. In Orthodox Judaism the child of a non-Jewish mother can be considered Jewish only by a process of conversion to Judaism. The child is also freed from any special status to which the father may have been subject (e.g., being a mamzer or kohen) under Jewish law.

The Orthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism maintain that the halakhic rules (i.e. matrilineal descent) are valid and binding. Reform and Liberal Judaism do not accept the halakhic rules as binding, and most branches accept a child of one Jewish parent, whether father or mother, as Jewish if the parents raise the child as a Jew and foster a Jewish identity in the child, noting that &quot;in the Bible the line always followed the father, including the cases of Joseph and Moses, who married into non-Israelite priestly families.&quot; (However, according to the oral tradition of Orthodox Judaism, the spouses of both Joseph and Moses converted to Judaism prior to marrying them.) The Reform movement&#x27;s standard states that &quot;for those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi&quot;. Advocates of patrilineal descent point to and . This policy is commonly known as patrilineal descent, though &quot;bilineal&quot; would be more accurate.

==== Patrilineal descent ====

In 1983, the Reform Central Conference of American Rabbis passed the Resolution on Patrilineal Descent, declaring that &quot;the child of one Jewish parent is under the presumption of Jewish descent. This presumption of the status of the offspring of any mixed marriage is to be established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people ... Depending on circumstances, mitzvot leading toward a positive and exclusive Jewish identity will include entry into the covenant, acquisition of a Hebrew name, Torah study, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, and Kabbalat Torah (Confirmation). For those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi.&quot;

Rabbi Mark Washofsky summarizes the 1983 CCAR resolution and subsequent interpretations in Reform responsa literature as follows:
* &quot;The resolution is advisory rather than halachic in the traditional sense. It does not establish a new definition of Jewish identity, for its preamble states expressly that it means to be operative only for Reform Jews in North America, not for all Jews everywhere.&quot;
* &quot;Jewish descent may be from either parent ...The Reform Movement presumes the child of &quot;one&quot; Jewish parent, either mother or father, as Jewish. In fact, the 1983 resolution is in one significant respect more stringent than the traditional definition of Jewish status. The child of a Jewish mother and gentile father, whom halachah regards as clearly Jewish, enjoys but a &quot;presumption&quot; of Jewish status that must be &quot;established&quot; by &quot;appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification.&quot;
* &quot;Biology remains a crucial factor. In the determination of Jewish identity ... the child of &quot;two gentile&quot; parents is, as before, definitely a non-Jew and must undergo a formal conversion in order to become a Jew.&quot;
* &quot;Both descent and behavior are crucial in determining Jewish status under the resolution. The Jewish status of a child of an intermarriage cannot be determined &quot;automatically&quot; either by biology or behavior. Both elements—descent from one Jewish parent &quot;and&quot; the performance of mitzvot that lead to a &quot;positive and exclusive Jewish identity—must be present, and they must be present during childhood.&quot;
* &quot;The resolution applies only to children raised exclusively as Jews ... A child raised simultaneously in Judaism and another religious tradition does not develop a &quot;positive and exclusive&quot; Jewish identity; therefore the presumption of Jewish status is disproved, and the resolution does not apply to that child. He or she will require conversion prior to celebrating becoming bar or bat mitzvah in the synagogue.&quot;

Waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity was a departure from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.

The CCAR&#x27;s 1983 resolution has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside the United States. The Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone not born of a Jewish mother.

Karaite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent, on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line, basing this idea &quot;on the fact that, in the Bible, tribes are given male names and that biblical characters are always referenced by their fathers&#x27; names. However, a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father.

The divergence of views has become an issue because Orthodox and Conservative communities do not recognize a person as Jewish if only their father is Jewish. For the person to be accepted as Jewish by an Orthodox or Conservative community (for example, on an occasion of their bar or bat mitzvah or marriage), they require a formal conversion (in accordance with halakhic standards). Orthodox Judaism has a predominant position in Israel. Although Orthodox and Conservative Judaism do not recognize Jewishness through patrilineal descent, &quot;it should also be noted, however, that in the case of a child born to a Jewish father but to a non-Jewish mother, most Orthodox rabbis will relax the stringent demands normally made of would-be converts&quot;, and the Rabbinical Assembly of the Conservative movement &quot;agreed that &#x27;sincere Jews by choice&#x27; should be warmly welcomed into the community&quot;.

=== Converts to Judaism ===
All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with most subgroups having a specific process for accepting converts. Not all conversions are recognised by all varieties of Judaism.

In Rabbinic Judaism, the laws of conversion are based on the classical sources of Jewish law, especially discussions in the Talmud, and the law as codified in the Shulkhan Arukh. This corpus of traditional Jewish law (halakha) is regarded as authoritative by the Orthodox and Conservative movements. The traditional halakhic requirements for conversion are instruction in the commandments, circumcision (if male), and immersion in an acceptable body of water before valid witnesses, and acceptance of the commandments before a rabbinical court. If a male is already circumcised, a drop of blood is drawn from the penis.

Orthodox authorities require that conversions be performed in accord with traditional Jewish law and recognise only those conversions in which a convert accepts and undertakes to observe Jewish law as interpreted by Orthodox rabbis. Because rabbis in the other movements do not require that converts make this commitment, Orthodox authorities do not generally accept as valid conversions performed outside the Orthodox community.

Conservative authorities likewise require that conversions be conducted according to traditional Jewish law. Conducting a conversion absent the traditional requirements of immersion in a ritual bath and circumcision for males is a violation of a Standard of the Rabbinical Assembly and grounds for expulsion. Conservative authorities generally recognize any conversion done in accord with the requirements of Jewish law, even if done outside the Conservative movement. Accordingly, Conservative rabbis may accept the validity of some conversions from other non-Orthodox movements.

The Union for Reform Judaism states that &quot;people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life.&quot; Its Central Conference of American Rabbis recommends that three rabbis be present for the conversion ceremony. The Rabbinical Court of the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism requires an average of a year of study to become conversant in Jewish life and tradition. Following this, converts are required to immerse in a ritual bath, be circumcised if male, and accept the commandments before the rabbinical court.

Although an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances (such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert), children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood – which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy, as required by Jewish law.

Karaite Judaism does not accept the oral legal traditions of Rabbinic Judaism. It has different requirements for conversion and refrained from accepting any converts until recently. Traditionally non-proselytizing, on August 1, 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion came 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.

Syrian Jewish communities do not normally carry out conversions, particularly where the conversion is suspected of being for the sake of marriage. Nor do they accept such converts from other communities, or the children of mixed marriages or marriages involving such converts.

=== Jews who have practiced another religion ===

In general, Orthodox Judaism considers individuals born of Jewish mothers to be Jewish, even if they convert to or are raised in another religion. Reform Judaism views Jews who convert to or are raised in another religion as non-Jews. For example &quot;... anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew ...&quot; [Contemporary American Reform Responsa, #68].

Historically, a Jew who has been declared to be a heretic () or Christian (, meaning &quot;Nazarene&quot;) may have had a &quot;cherem&quot; (similar to excommunication) placed on him or her; but the practice of communal and religious exclusion does not affect their status of Jewish birth. Judaism also views as Jewish those who involuntarily convert from Judaism to another religion (Hebrew: &quot;anusim,&quot; אנוסים, meaning &quot;forced ones&quot;), and their matrilineal descendants are likewise considered to be Jewish.

Judaism has a category for those who are Jewish but who do not practice or who do not accept the tenets of Judaism, whether or not they have converted to another religion. The traditional view regarding these individuals, known as Meshumadim (), is that they are Jewish; however, there is much debate in the rabbinic literature regarding their status vis-a-vis the application of Jewish law and their participation in Jewish ritual, but not to their status as Jews.

A Jew who leaves Judaism is free to return to the religion at any time. In general, no formal ceremony or declaration is required to return to Jewish practices. All movements of Judaism welcome the return to Judaism of those who have left, or been raised in another religion. When returning to Judaism, these individuals would be expected to abandon their previous practices and adopt Jewish customs.

The same rules in principle apply to the matrilineal descendants of such persons, though some rabbinical authorities may require stricter proof of Jewish descent than others. Whether such persons are required to undergo a full formal conversion depends on the community and their individual circumstances. For example, a male who has had a brit milah, who has a general understanding of Judaism, but who has been raised in a secular home might not be required to undergo ritual conversion. However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion. For full participation in the community (for example, to marry with the participation of a rabbi), they may be required to display sincerity, such as a declaration of commitment to Judaism.

Another example of the issues involved is the case of converts to Judaism who cease to practice Judaism (whether or not they still regard themselves as Jewish), do not accept or follow halakha, or now adhere to another religion. Technically, such a person remains Jewish, like all Jews, provided that the original conversion is valid. However, in some recent cases, Haredi rabbinical authorities, as well as the current Religious Zionist Israeli Chief Rabbinate, have taken the view that a given convert&#x27;s lapse from Orthodox Jewish observance is evidence that he or she cannot, even at the time of the conversion, have had the full intention to observe the commandments and that the conversion must therefore have been invalid.

A valid Jewish court of sufficient stature has the ability to revoke a person&#x27;s or a group&#x27;s status as Jews. This was done for the lost Ten Tribes of Israel and the Samaritans.

== Religious definitions ==

=== Halakhic perspective ===

According to the traditional Rabbinic view, which is maintained by all branches of Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism, and some branches of Reform Judaism, only &quot;halakha&quot; can define who is or is not a Jew when a question of Jewish identity, lineage, or parentage arises about any person seeking to define themselves or claim that they are Jewish.

As a result, mere &quot;belief&quot; in the principles of Judaism does &quot;not&quot; make one a Jew. Similarly, non-adherence by a Jew to the 613 Mitzvot, or even formal conversion to another religion, does not make one lose one&#x27;s Jewish status. Thus, the immediate descendants of all female Jews (even apostates) are still considered to be Jews, as are those of all their female descendants. Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews or practice a religion other than Judaism, are defined by this perspective as Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent. As a corollary, the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother are not considered to be Jews by Halakha unless they formally convert according to Halakha, even if raised fully observant in the Mitzvot.

Those not born to a Jewish mother may become accepted as Jews by the Orthodox and Conservative communities through a formal process of conversion to Judaism in order to become &quot;righteous converts&quot; (&#x27;—). In addition, Halakha requires that the new convert commit himself to the observance of its tenets; this is called &#x27; (), &quot;Acceptance of the Yoke of the Commandments&quot;. &quot;&quot; () is used by Reform Judaism in accordance with reform responsa and Halakhah.

Both Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism accept a similar set of rules regarding Jewish status based on classical rabbinic Judaism, including both matrilineal descent and requirements that conversions be performed by Orthodox rabbis and that converts promise to strictly observe elements of traditional Judaism such as Shabbat and Niddah. However, their application of these rules have been different, and the difference has been increasing in recent years. Modern Orthodox authorities have been more inclined to rule in favor of Jewish status and to accept non-Orthodox Jews&#x27; word in doubtful cases involving people claiming to be Jews, while Haredi authorities have in recent years tended to presume non-Jewish status and require more stringent rules and standards of evidence in order for Jewish status to be proven, and have tended to distrust the evidence of Jews who are not personally Orthodox. Haredi rabbis have tended to look at a convert&#x27;s current personal observance and to regard deficiencies or lack of Orthodoxy in current observance as evidence that the convert never intended to validly convert. In addition, the contemporary situation is further complicated by the fact that some Haredi rabbis no longer regard some Modern Orthodox rabbis as reliable.

=== Karaite Judaism ===

Karaite Judaism relies on the Tanakh to indicate that Jewishness is passed down through the paternal line, not the maternal line as is maintained by Orthodox Judaism (though a minority holds that both parents need to be Jewish). Karaite Jews are eligible for Aliyah under the Law of Return. The eligibility of converts to Judaism through the Karaite movement to make Aliyah under the Law of Return has not yet been addressed in Israeli courts.

Several verses in the Bible mentioning about laws of family inheritance depending on the paternal lineage of the tribe:

=== Reform Judaism ===
Reform Judaism recognizes a child as being Jewish if either parent is Jewish and the child is being raised Jewish. Voices within the Reform movement say that the law, which changed to matriarchal around 2,000 years ago (originally in the Torah the offspring was determined by patriarchal descent) and was based on the tragic circumstances the Jewish people were facing, was once helpful but is no longer relevant.

Modern Progressive Jewish denominations have a conversion process based on their principles. In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 abolished circumcision as a requirement for converts, and Reform does not require converts to have &quot;tevilah,&quot; ritual immersion. A &quot;prospective convert declares, orally and in writing, in the presence of a rabbi and no less than two lay leaders of the congregation and community, acceptance of the Jewish religion and the intention to live in accordance with its &quot;mitzvot&quot;&quot;.

==== Controversies ====
The controversy in determining &quot;who is a Jew&quot; concerns four basic issues:

One issue arises because North American Reform and UK Liberal movements have changed some of the halakhic requirements for Jewish identity in two ways:

Secondly, Orthodox Judaism asserts that non-Orthodox rabbis are not qualified to form a &quot;beit din.&quot; This has led to non-Orthodox conversions generally being unaccepted in Orthodox communities. Since Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional standards for conversion – in which the commitment to observe halakha is required – non-Orthodox conversions are generally not accepted in Orthodox communities because the non-Orthodox movements perform conversions in which the new convert does not undertake to observe halakha as understood by Orthodox Judaism.

A third controversy concerns persons (whether born Jews or converts to Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish. Reform Judaism regards such people as apostates, and states regarding Messianic Jews: Messianic Jews&#x27; claim that they are Jews, but we must asked ourselves whether we identify them as Jews. We can not do so as they consider Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah who has fulfilled the Messianic promises. In this way, they have clearly placed themselves within Christianity. They may be somewhat different from other Christians as they follow various Jewish rites and ceremonials, but that does not make them Jews.&quot; Regardless, such people do not count as Jewish for the purposes of the Israeli citizenship laws.

A fourth controversy stems from the manner in which the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has been handling marriage and conversion decisions in recent years. Conversions and marriages within Israel are legally controlled by the Orthodox Israeli Chief Rabbinate; therefore, a person not proven to be a Jew to the Rabbinate&#x27;s satisfaction is not legally permitted to marry a Jew in Israel today. Although the Rabbinate has always refused to accept non-Orthodox conversions, until recent years it was more willing to accept the Jewish parentage of applicants based on personal testimony, and the validity of conversions based on the testimony of Orthodox Rabbis. However, in recent years the rabbinate, whose rabbis historically had a more Modern Orthodox orientation, has increasingly been filled by the more stringent Haredi camp. It has increasingly been inclined to presume that applicants are not Jewish until proven otherwise, and require more stringent standards of proof than in the past. It has implemented a policy of refusing to accept the testimony of non-Orthodox Jews in matters of Jewish status, on grounds that such testimony is not reliable. It also has been increasingly skeptical of the reliability of Orthodox rabbis ordained by institutions not subject to its accreditation, particularly in matters of conversion. Accordingly, non-Orthodox Jews born to Jewish parents, and some Jews converted by Orthodox rabbis, have been increasingly unable to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate&#x27;s satisfaction, because they are unable to find an Orthodox rabbi who is both acceptable to the Rabbinate, and familiar with and willing to vouch for the Jewishness of their maternal lineage or the validity of their conversion.

There have been several attempts to convene representatives of the three major movements to formulate a practical solution to this issue. To date, these have failed, though all parties concede the importance of the issue is greater than any sense of rivalry among them.

== Ethnic definitions ==

&quot;Ethnic Jew&quot; is a term generally used to describe a person of Jewish parentage and background who does not necessarily actively practice Judaism, but still identifies with Judaism or other Jews culturally or fraternally, or both. The term &quot;ethnic Jew&quot; does not specifically exclude practicing Jews, but they are usually simply referred to as &quot;Jews&quot; without the qualifying adjective &quot;ethnic&quot;.

The term can refer to people of diverse beliefs and backgrounds because genealogy largely defines who is &quot;Jewish&quot;. &quot;Ethnic Jew&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish non-practicing from practicing (religious) Jews. Other terms include &quot;non-observant Jew&quot;, &quot;non-religious Jew&quot;, &quot;non-practicing Jew&quot;, and &quot;secular Jew&quot;.

The term may also refer to Jews who do not practice the religion of Judaism. Typically, ethnic Jews are cognizant of their Jewish background and may feel strong cultural (even if not religious) ties to Jewish traditions and to the Jewish people or nation. Like people of any other ethnicity, non-religious ethnic Jews often assimilate into a surrounding non-Jewish culture, but, especially in areas where there is a strong local Jewish culture, they may remain largely part of that culture instead.

&quot;Ethnic Jews&quot; include atheists, agnostics, non-denominational deists, Jews with only casual connections to Jewish denominations or converts to other religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, or Islam. Religious Jews of all denominations sometimes engage in outreach to non-religious Jews. In the case of some Hasidic denominations (e.g. Chabad-Lubavitch), this outreach extends to actively proselytizing more secular Jews.

=== Public opinion ===
The 2013 Pew Research study of American Jews found that 62% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while 15% thought that it was mainly a matter of religion. Of those who stated themselves to be Jews by religion, 55% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while two-thirds thought that it was not necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.

=== Historical European definitions ===
During the Middle Ages there was no need to ask the question &quot;who is a Jew?&quot;, because the difference between the Jewish and the non-Jewish community was clear to both sides. For example, a person born to a Jewish family was Jewish, marriages between Jews and non-Jews were not allowed, and the only way to leave the Jewish identity was through not only leaving the religion, but also cutting all ties to the Jewish community, including family and friends. To Medieval Jews the most essential difference between them and others was not about faith but about the peoplehood, to which their religious community was tied into, and they called themselves &quot;Israel&quot;.

As the emancipation for Jews in Europe became relevant, the ideology of nationalism started rising and in parts of Western Europe religion became more clearly separated from ethnicity, the question of what kind of a group the Jews were - religious, cultural, racial, national or something else - became discussed more. Due to emancipation, Jews were expected to assimilate into European nations. Religious difference was tolerated better than ethnic, and Jews were now sometimes defined just as a religious group, e.g. Jews in Germany were defined as Germans who practice &quot;Mosaic faith&quot;. Jews themselves were usually not happy with this definition. Yet, as seeking for equal civil rights and to prove that Jews can be a part of Western civilizations as well, some Central European Jews started highlighting their identity more as a religious group, with some rejecting ethnic definitions of Jewishness completely and some consciously getting rid of their &quot;oriental&quot; habits. Many Jews however, especially in Eastern Europe, criticized Western Jews for losing their Jewishness. Still, simultaneously, the concept of &quot;Semitic race&quot;, which included the Jews, was coined. This also lead to pseudoscientific ideas of Jews being racially inferior to &quot;Aryans&quot;. Later the Holocaust caused some more Jews to avoid attaching ethnic or racial elements to being Jewish. In the former Soviet Union, &quot;Jewish&quot; was a nationality by law, as with other nationalities such as Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and others, and Soviet Jews themselves had a strong sense of ethnic Jewishness (&quot;Yiddishkeit&quot;) which would have separated them from surrounding ethnic groups. There were certain restrictions on their civil liberties in the early years of the Soviet Union.

=== DNA ===

The modern genealogical DNA test of ethnicity is a non-religious definition of &#x27;who is a Jew?&#x27; as increasing numbers of persons discover their biological and cultural origins outside the traditional religious setting. There has been controversy about the use of DNA tests in Israeli rabbinical courts as a test of Jewishness.

=== &quot;Half-Jewish&quot; ===

In the United States and Europe, because of intermarriage, the population of &quot;half-Jews&quot; is beginning to rival that of Jews with two Jewish parents. Self-identified &quot;half-Jews&quot; consider the term a familial category, which reflects multiple heritages and possible Jewish cultural or spiritual practices. Other similar terms that have been used include: &quot;part-Jewish&quot; and &quot;partial-Jews&quot;. The term &quot;Gershom&quot;, &quot;Gershomi&quot; or &quot;Beta Gershom&quot; has also been seldom used as an alternative to &quot;half-Jewish&quot; and &quot;part-Jewish&quot; in connection with descendants of intermarriage, Gershom being the biblical son of Moses and his Midianite wife Zipporah. The term typically has no religious meaning, as terms like Jewish Christian do, but rather describes ethnic Jewry.

== Other non-religious definitions ==

The Society for Humanistic Judaism defines a Jew as &quot;someone who identifies with the history, culture and fate of the Jewish people&quot;. In their view it is, therefore, possible for a non-religious individual to adopt Judaism and join a Humanistic Jewish community, and for the Society for Humanistic Judaism to adopt the person wanting to be part of the Humanistic Jewish family. As Israeli author Amos Oz puts it, &quot;a Jew is anyone who chooses or is compelled to share a common fate with other Jews.&quot; Oz summed up his position more succinctly in a monologue published in &quot;Tikkun&quot;, saying &quot;Who is a Jew? Everyone who is mad enough to call himself or herself a Jew is a Jew.&quot;. From a similar perspective it is possible for a person born and raised as a Jew to leave Judaism and no longer be a Jew: famous historical examples are Heinrich Heine, Benjamin Disraeli, Gustav Mahler, Georg Brandes.

== Legal structure in Israel ==

Israeli constitutional documents have not defined &quot;who is a Jew&quot; although the decision whether someone is Jewish or not has important legal, social and financial ramifications. This lack of definition has given rise to legal controversy in Israel and there have been many court cases in Israel that have addressed the question.

=== Judaism test ===

, anyone who immigrated to Israel after 1990 and wishes to marry or divorce via the Jewish tradition within the state limits must go through a &quot;Judaism test&quot; at an Orthodox Rabbinical court. In this test, a person would need to prove their claim to be Jewish to an investigator beyond a reasonable doubt. They would need to present original documentation of their matriline up to their great-grandmother (4 generations), or in the case of Ethiopian Jews, 7 generations back. In addition, they should provide government documents with nationality/religion shown as Jewish (e.g., birth/death certificates, marriage documents, etc.).

In the case of people whose original documents have been lost or never existed, it may take considerable effort to prove they are Jewish.
The court rulings are not final, and any clerk has the power to question them even 20 years later, changing one&#x27;s citizenship status to &quot;on hold&quot;, and putting them in jeopardy of deportation.

The two biggest communities affected by these documentation issues are:
* Immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) – a study conducted between 2003 and 2005 showed that 83% of people from the FSU who started the Judaism test process successfully finished it. An estimated 10% left the process before completion. In a later study, in 2011, a 90% success rate was achieved in the FSU immigrant community. Many Jews in the former Soviet Union took steps to hide their Jewishness. Besides post-Soviet copies of documents are suspected by the tribunal after widespread falsification, and the archived originals are difficult to access for genealogists.
* Immigrants from the United States, where government documents generally do not show religion or Jewish ethnicity.

=== Law of Return ===

Following the birth of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the Law of Return was enacted in 1950 to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen. However, due to an inability on the lawmakers to agree, the Law did not define who was a Jew, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of the Law, has resulted in the divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.

Besides the generally accepted halakhic definition of who is a Jew, in 1970, the Law extended the categories of person who are entitled to immigration and citizenship to the children and grandchildren of Jews, regardless of their present religious affiliation, and their spouses. Also, converts to Judaism whose conversion was performed outside the State of Israel, regardless of who performed it, are entitled to immigration under the Law. Once again, issues arose as to whether a conversion performed outside Israel was valid. The variation of the definition in the Law and the definition used by various branches of Judaism has resulted in practical difficulties for many people.

It has been estimated that between 1986 and 2006, about 200,000 non-Jews and even practicing Christians have entered Israel from the former Soviet Union on the basis of being a child or grandchild of a Jew or by being married to a Jew.

However, there is an exception in the case of a person who has formally converted to another religion. This is derived from the &quot;Rufeisen Case&quot; in 1962, in which the Supreme Court ruled that such a person, no matter what their halakhic position, is not entitled to immigration under the Law; they concluded that &quot;no one can regard an apostate as belonging to the Jewish people&quot;.

Current Israeli definitions specifically exclude Jews who have openly and knowingly converted to or were raised in a faith other than Judaism, including Messianic Judaism. This definition is not the same as that in traditional Jewish law; in some respects it is deliberately wider, so as to include those non-Jewish relatives of Jews who may have been perceived to be Jewish, and thus faced antisemitism.

The Law of Return does not, of itself, define the Jewish status of a person; it only deals with those who have a right to immigration to Israel.

In the early 1950s, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate originally objected to the immigration of Karaite Jews to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007 Rabbi David Chayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netanya, was quoted in the Jerusalem Post as saying: &quot;A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary.&quot;

=== Israeli laws governing marriage and divorce ===
In relation to marriage, divorce, and burial, which are under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Interior Ministry, the halakhic definition of who is a Jew is applied. When there is any doubt, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate generally determines the issue.

In terms of social relations, most secular Jews view their Jewish identity as a matter of culture, heritage, nationality, or ethnicity. Ancestral aspects can be explained by the many Jews who view themselves as atheists and are defined by matrilineal descent or a Cohen (Kohen) or Levi, which is connected by ancestry. The question of &quot;who is a Jew&quot; is a question that is under debate. Issues related to ancestral or ethnic Jews are dealt with by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.

Orthodox halachic rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow halachic standards to be recognised as valid. The rabbinate even scrutinizes Orthodox conversions, with some who have converted by orthodox authorities outside Israel not being permitted to marry in Israel.

If one&#x27;s ancestral line of Jewishness is in doubt, then a proper conversion would be required in order to be allowed to marry in the Orthodox community, or in Israel, where such rules govern all marriages.

=== Israeli definition of nationality ===
The Jewish status of a person in Israel is considered a matter of &quot;nationality&quot;.

In the registering of &quot;nationality&quot; on Israeli identity cards, which is administered by the Ministry of the Interior, a person had to meet the Halakhic definition to be registered as a &quot;Jew&quot;. However, in a number of cases the Supreme Court of Israel has ordered the Ministry of Interior to register Reform and Conservative converts as Jews. The right of people who convert in the Diaspora under Reform or Conservative auspices to immigrate to Israel and claim citizenship as Jews is detailed in Israeli law.

Until recently, Israeli identity cards had an indication of nationality, and the field was left empty for those who immigrated not solely on the basis of being Jewish (i.e. as a child, grandchild or spouse of a Jew only) to indicate that the person may not be a Jew. Many Israeli citizens who are not recognised by the Rabbinate as Jewish have been issued with Israeli identity cards that do not include their Hebrew calendar birth date.

=== Outside Israel ===
In 2010 the Labour Court of South Africa addressed the question of who is a Jew for the purposes of the Employment Equity Act. The question has also arisen in the United Kingdom, where religious schools are allowed to select all or a proportion of their intake based upon religion. A 2009 ruling, &quot;R(E) v Governing Body of JFS&quot;, determined that the definition of Jewish religion based upon descent constituted discrimination on ethnic grounds, and therefore contravened racial discrimination laws. Also in the UK, under the Sunday Trading Act 1994 &quot;a person of the Jewish religion&quot; who observes the Jewish Sabbath can open their shops on Sundays. The Act defines &quot;person of the Jewish religion&quot; as someone who holds a certificate that they are Jewish from a Rabbi, synagogue secretary or the representative body of British Jewry, the Board of Deputies.

== Other definitions ==
There have been other attempts to determine Jewish identity beside the traditional Jewish approaches. These range from genetic population studies to controversial evolutionary perspectives including those espoused by Kevin B. MacDonald and Yuri Slezkine. Historians, such as the late Kamal Salibi, have utilized etymology and geography to reconstruct the prehistoric origin of the Jewish people in the Arabian Peninsula.

=== Sociology and anthropology ===

As with any other ethnic identity, Jewish identity is, to some degree, a matter of either claiming that identity or being perceived by others (both inside and outside the ethnic group) as belonging to that group, or both. Returning again to the example of Madeleine Albright—during her Catholic childhood, her being in some sense Jewish was presumably irrelevant. It was only after she was nominated to be Secretary of State that she, and the public, discovered her Jewish ancestry.

Ido Abram states that there are five aspects to contemporary Jewish identity:
#Religion, culture, and tradition.
#The tie with Israel and Zionism.
#Dealings with antisemitism, including issues of persecution and survival.
#Personal history and life-experience.
#Relationship with non-Jewish culture and people.

The relative importance of these factors may vary enormously from place to place. For example, a typical Dutch Jew might describe their Jewish identity simply as &quot;I was born Jewish,&quot; while a Jew in Romania, where levels of antisemitism are higher, might say, &quot;I consider any form of denying as a proof of cowardice.&quot;

=== The Inquisition ===
During the time of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, conversion to Roman Catholicism did not result in total termination of the person&#x27;s Jewish status. Legally, the converts were no longer regarded as Jews and thus allowed to stay in the Iberian Peninsula. During the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal, however, many Jews were forced to convert, but thereafter were regarded by many people, though not in a legal form, as New Christians, distinguishing them as separate from the Old Christians of non-Jewish lineage. Since legal, political, religious and social pressure pushed many people to untrue conversions (public behaviour as Christians while retaining some Jewish beliefs and practices privately, a kind of crypto-Judaism), they were still treated with suspicion, a stigma sometimes carried for several generations by their identifiable descendants.
The &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; (&quot;Cleanliness of blood&quot;) required public officials or candidates for membership of many organizations to prove that they did not have Jewish or Muslim ancestry.

=== Secular philosophy ===

Jean-Paul Sartre, who was not Jewish, suggested in &quot;Anti-Semite and Jew&quot; (1948) that Jewish identity &quot;is neither national nor international, neither religious nor ethnic, nor political: it is a quasi-historical community.&quot; While Jews as individuals may be in danger from the antisemite who sees only &quot;Jews&quot; and not &quot;people&quot;, Sartre argues that the Jewish experience of antisemitism preserves—even creates—the sense of Jewish community. In his most extreme statement of this view he wrote, &quot;It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew.&quot; Conversely, that sense of specific Jewish community may be threatened by the democrat who sees only &quot;the person&quot; and not &quot;the Jew&quot;.

Hannah Arendt repeatedly asserted a principle of claiming Jewish identity in the face of antisemitism. &quot;If one is attacked as a Jew, one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world-citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man, or whatever&quot;; &quot;A man attacked as a Jew cannot defend himself as an Englishman or a Frenchman. The world can only conclude from this that he is simply not defending himself at all.&quot;

Wade Clark Roof (1976), a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed that social sectors in modern life, in which traditional symbols and rituals are meaningful, provide an alternative approach for explaining the social basis of religion in a secular order, in doing so, he turned to the local community as a sphere in modern society that still persists &quot;as a complex system of friendship and kinship networks, formal and informal associations, as well as symbolic attachments, very much rooted in family life and ongoing socialization processes&quot;.

=== Antisemitic definitions ===

The question &quot;who is a Jew?&quot; is also sometimes of importance to non-Jews. Historically, it had exceptional significance when it was considered by anti-Jewish groups for the purpose of targeting Jews for persecution or discrimination. The definition can have an impact on whether a person may have a certain job, live in certain locations, receive a free education, live or continue to live in specific countries, be imprisoned, or executed.

==== Nazism ====

The question was of critical importance during the rule of the Nazi party in Germany, which persecuted the Jews and defined them for the government&#x27;s purposes by the Nuremberg Laws. In 2009, a United Kingdom court considered whether the question was a racial issue, in the case &quot;R(E) v Governing Body of JFS&quot; (2009).

The Nazi regime instituted laws which discriminated against Jews, declared a race by the Nazis, and thus needed a working definition of who is a Jew as to its law-defined race system. These definitions almost completely categorised persons through the religions followed by each individual&#x27;s ancestors, according to membership registries. Thus, personal faith or individual observance, as well as the religious definitions of Judaism as given by the Halacha, were mostly ignored.

In Germany itself, the Ahnenpass and the Nuremberg Laws classified people as being of the Jewish race if they were descended from three or four grandparents enrolled in Jewish congregations. A person with one or two grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation could be classified as &quot;Mischling&quot;, a crossbreed, of &quot;mixed blood&quot;, even if they were not a member of a Jewish congregation at the time the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. The Mischling Test was introduced in order to identify Europeans with Jewish blood, and these were classified as &quot;Jews of the first or second degree&quot;. Only people with at least two grandparents of &quot;German blood&quot; could be German Reich citizens. Other Germans were dropped into a new second class group of citizens, the so-called &quot;state subjects&quot; (Staatsangehörige).

If a person with grandparents of the same religious combination was enrolled as a member of a Jewish congregation in 1935, or later enrolled, they switched from the discriminatory class of Mischlinge into that of Geltungsjude, &quot;Jew by legal validity&quot; even if they did not meet the criterion of descent from three or four Jewish grandparents. In the eyes of the Nazi government, one could not become a non-Jew by seceding from one&#x27;s Jewish congregation, becoming non-practicing, marrying outside the religion, or converting to Christianity. Thus any Mischling could move into the class of Geltungsjude by joining a Jewish congregation, but the Nuremberg Laws provided that the classification of any Geltungsjude would not change even she or he tried to evade harm by withdrawing from their Jewish congregation after 1935, considering such secessions as being of no effect. Similarly, after 1935, any Mischling with two Jewish grandparents (colloquially called a half-Jew) who married anybody classified as a Jew would drop into the Geltungsjude class. Mischlinge with one Jewish grandparent were usually forbidden from marrying anybody with any Jewish grandparents.

In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws forbade new marriages between people who were classified as Jews and people who belonged to other classifications. Earlier contracted marriages between spouses of different classifications (so-called mixed marriages; Mischehe) provided the Jewish-classified spouse with uncertain protection from some discriminations and atrocities.

There were very few Karaites in Europe during the Nazi era; most of them lived in Turkey, Greece, and the Crimea. Karaites were not considered Jewish for the purpose of the Holocaust extermination policy; according to SS Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger, writing on November 24, 1944, discrimination against the Karaites had been prohibited due to their proximity to the Crimean Tatars, to whom Berger views the Karaites as being related. Nazis still retained hostility towards the Karaites, on grounds of their religion; and there were a number of small scale massacres of Karaites.

In German-occupied France, an ordinance defined a Jew as an individual who belonged to the Jewish religion or who had more than two Jewish grandparents.

The Vichy régime in southern France defined a Jew as an individual with three Jewish grandparents or two grandparents if his/her spouse was Jewish. Richard Weisberg points out that this was a potentially broader classification than the one used in Occupied France, for example, a Mischling could not be classified a Jew under the Nazi dictate, by her/his spouse&#x27;s classification if the marriage was contracted before the imposition of antisemitic marriage laws there, but would be deemed one under the Vichy act if he/she had married a Jew, regardless when.

== Israelite identity loss claims ==
There are various groups besides Jews which have claimed to be descended from the biblical Israelites. The question nowadays arises in relation to Israel&#x27;s Law of Return, with various groups seeking to migrate there. Some claims have been accepted, some are under consideration, while others have been rejected by Israel&#x27;s rabbinate.

=== Cochin Jews (Indian Jews) ===
Some sources say that the earliest Jews of Cochin, India, were those who settled in the Malabar Coast during the times of King Solomon of Israel, and after the Kingdom of Israel split into two. There is historical documentation of the Jews being in Cochin after the fall of the Second Temple, from around the first century CE. Later additions were smaller immigration of Sephardic Jews from Europe in the sixteenth century after the expulsion from Spain, and Baghdadi Jews, Arabic-speaking Jews who arrived in the late eighteenth century, at the beginning of the British colonial era. Following the independence of India and the establishment of Israel, most Cochin Jews emigrated to Israel in the mid-1950s. Some have gone on to North America or Britain.

=== Bene Israel ===
The Bene Israel in India claim to be descended from Jews who escaped persecution in Galilee in the 2nd century BCE. The Bene Israel resemble the non-Jewish Marathi people in appearance and customs, which indicates some intermarriage between Jews and Indians. The Bene Israel, however, maintained the practices of Jewish dietary laws, male circumcision and observation of the Sabbath as a day of rest. From the late eighteenth century, other Jewish communities instructed them in normative Judaism.

Initially, the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel said that the Bene Israel would have to undergo conversion in order to marry other Jews, as matrilineal descent could not be proven. In 1964 the Israeli Rabbinate declared that the Bene Israel are &quot;full Jews in every respect&quot;.

The Bene Israel claim a lineage to the Kohanim, the Israelite priestly class, which claims descent from Aaron, the brother of Moses. In 2002, DNA testing revealed that the Bene Israel shared some genetic markers of the Kohanim. These are not exclusive to the Kohanim, but appear among them at a higher frequency. These are also shared with some non-Jewish Semitic peoples.

Many of the Bene Israel emigrated from India to Israel, where around 6,000 Jews of this group reside. About 5,000 remain in India. They maintain 65 synagogues in Israel.

=== Beta Israel ===
The Beta Israel or Falasha is a group formerly living in Ethiopia who have a tradition of descent from the lost tribe of Dan. They have a long history of practicing such Jewish traditions as kashrut, Sabbath and Passover, and had Jewish texts. In 1975, their claim of Jewishness was accepted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and the Israeli government. The government assisted them in emigrating &quot;en masse&quot; to Israel during the 1980s and 1990s as Jews under the Law of Return, when Ethiopia was undergoing a civil war. Some who claim to be Beta Israel still live in Ethiopia.

=== Bnei Menashe ===
The Bnei Menashe is a group in India claiming to be descendants of the half-tribe of Menashe. Members who have studied Hebrew and who observe the Sabbath and other Jewish laws in 2005 received the support of the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel to arrange formal conversion to Judaism. Some have converted and immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return.

=== The Kaifeng Jews ===
The Kaifeng Jews, a Mandarin-speaking group from Henan Province, China, experienced first contact with Europeans in 1605 via the religious scholar Matteo Ricci. Modern researchers believe these Jews were descended from Persian merchants who settled in China during the early Song dynasty. They prospered during the Ming dynasty as Confucian civil servants, soldiers, and merchants, but they quickly assimilated and lost much of their Jewish heritage. By the beginning of the 19th century, the last rabbi with knowledge of Hebrew died, leaving no successor. The community had become extinct religiously by the late Qing dynasty due to anti-foreign persecutions brought on by the Taiping Rebellion and Boxer Rebellion. There are a small number of Chinese people today who consider themselves to be descendants of these Jews.

Despite their isolation from the rest of the Jewish diaspora, the Jews of Kaifeng preserved Jewish traditions and customs for many centuries. In the 17th century, assimilation began to erode these traditions. The rate of intermarriage between Jews and other ethnic groups, such as the Han Chinese, and the Hui and Manchu minorities in China, increased. The destruction of the synagogue in the 1860s led to the community&#x27;s demise. However, J. L. Liebermann, the first Western Jew to visit Kaifeng in 1867, noted that &quot;they still had a burial ground of their own&quot;. S. M. Perlmann, the Shanghai businessman and scholar, wrote in 1912 that &quot;they bury their dead in coffins, but of a different shape than those of the Chinese are made, and do not attire the dead in secular clothes as the Chinese do, but in linen&quot;. To date, there is only one scholar, Zhou Xu, who doubts the Kaifeng community&#x27;s Jewishness and claims them to have been a western construct.

Today, 600–1,000 residents of Kaifeng trace their lineage to this community. After contact with Jewish tourists, the Jews of Kaifeng have reconnected to mainstream Jewry. With the help of Jewish organizations, some members of the community have emigrated to Israel. In 2009, Chinese Jews from Kaifeng arrived in Israel as immigrants.

=== The Lemba ===

The Lemba, group of people from southern Africa, primarily Zimbabwe and South Africa, speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam, which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition. They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population. More recent research argues that DNA evidence does not support claims for a specifically Jewish genetic heritage.

=== New Mexico&#x27;s Crypto-Jews ===
A small Hispano group of Sephardic Jews in northern New Mexico may be one of the oldest groups of practicing Jews in North America, dating back to the early Spanish settlers of Jewish descent who had been forcibly converted to Catholicism as Conversos or New Christians, or both after 1492. Some families of Conversos began to settle in Mexico City in the 1530s and 1540s. Some converted back to Judaism; others maintained some Jewish beliefs and practices in secret. After the Spanish Inquisition came to the New World in 1571, the conversos were threatened with death if it was found they were practicing Judaism.

In 1598, the first expedition was made to New Mexico and included conversos. After that, other conversos fled to the northwestern frontier of the Spanish Empire, today the southwestern United States, to evade the scrutiny and threat of discovery in the more monitored settlements. Outwardly Catholic, these forced converts maintained Jewish practices and customs for generations in secret, hence their name, &quot;Crypto-Jews&quot;. They have been the subject of recent academic study. Some of New Mexico&#x27;s Crypto-Jews have begun to return to normative Judaism in recent years, through study and ritual conversion. Others feel enlarged by learning this part of their history but continue as practicing Catholics.

A genetic study of men in the early 2000s showed that many Hispanos of the North-American Southwest are descended from Anusim (Sephardic Jews who were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism). Only Catholic Spanish were allowed to go to the New World with the exploration and colonial expeditions. Families first kept their secrets for protection and then out of habit. Michael Hammer, a research professor at the University of Arizona and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites possessed the male-specific &quot;Cohanim marker&quot; or Cohen Modal Haplotype, which is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests. 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%), were found to have Y-DNA with the Cohanim marker. Wider DNA testing of Hispanic populations has revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome associated with the Middle East. Their history makes it most likely that they are Jewish rather than Arabic Muslims.

In 2008, a gene mutation that is typically found only in Ashkenazi Jews, and is linked to a virulent form of breast cancer in women, was discovered in a cluster of Hispanic Catholic women in southern Colorado, many of whom trace their family&#x27;s roots to northern New Mexico. It was conclusively shown to be related to Jewish ancestry, given the history of the people in the area, and many families reported knowledge of a high incidence of cancer. After testing and notification of families, researchers worked with the extended families on genetic counseling and to develop health strategies for monitoring, early detection and treatment, as they were faced with the higher risk associated with the gene.

<text>A spetum is a polearm that was used in Europe during the 13th century. Other names include chauve souris, corseca, corsèsque, korseke, runka, and rawcon. It consists of a pole, some long, on which is mounted a spear head with two projections at its base. Many variations of this design flourished over time; some feel that the ranseur is a variation of the spetum. According to antiquarian John Hewitt, the spetum is a variation of the partisan. The spetum is usually distinguished from the ranseur and partisan by its &quot;prongs&quot; being single edged and used for slashing. The main blade is long [I have not found any sources supporting this measurement, the spetum shown in the image&#x27;s head is measured at 46 in (118.1 cm) meaning the blade is only marginally shorter than 46 inches], and the side blades are only about half that length and are set at acute angles.

The design of a spetum is for combat. The main blade is long enough to destroy any significant organ in the human body with a thrust. The side blades could bind weapons, similar to a jitte or sai. The blunt backs of the side blades give the spetum a variety of uses such as tripping and knocking aside shields while providing far more strength to the sharpened side and points than is possible with a dual-edged construction.

The word &quot;spetum&quot; comes meaning &quot;spit&quot;.

<doc id="1040161" wikidata="Q857647" url="?curid=1040161" title="Constructivism (philosophy of education)">
<text>Constructivism in education is a theory that suggests that learners do not passively acquire knowledge through direct instruction. Instead, they &quot;construct&quot; their understanding through experiences and social interaction, integrating new information with their existing knowledge. This theory originates from Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development.

== Background ==
Constructivism in education is rooted in epistemology, a theory of knowledge concerned with the logical categories of knowledge and its justification. It acknowledges that learners bring prior knowledge and experiences shaped by their social and cultural environment and that learning is a process of students &quot;constructing&quot; knowledge based on their experiences. While behaviorism focuses on understanding what students are doing, constructivism emphasizes the importance of understanding what students are thinking and how to enrich their thinking.

Constructivism in educational psychology can be attributed to the work of Jean Piaget (1896–1980) and his theory of cognitive development. Piaget&#x27;s focus was on how humans make meaning by integrating experiences with ideas, emphasizing human development as distinct from external influences Another influential figure, Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934), emphasized the importance of sociocultural learning in his theory of social constructivism, highlighting how interactions with adults, peers, and cognitive tools contribute to the formation of mental constructs. Building upon Vygotsky&#x27;s work, Jerome Bruner and other educational psychologists introduced the concept of instructional scaffolding, where the learning environment provides support that is gradually removed as learners internalize the knowledge.

Views more focused on human development within the social sphere include the sociocultural or socio-historical perspective of Lev Vygotsky and the situated cognition perspectives of Mikhail Bakhtin, Jean Lave, and Etienne Wenger. Additionally, the works of Brown, Collins, and Duguid, as well as Newman, Griffin, Cole, and Barbara Rogoff.

The concept of constructivism has impacted a number of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, education, and the history of science. In its early stages, constructivism focused on the relationship between human experiences and their reflexes or behavior patterns. Piaget referred to these systems of knowledge &quot;schemes.&quot;

Piaget&#x27;s theory of constructivist learning has significantly influenced learning theories and teaching methods in education. It serves as a foundational concept in education reform movements within cognitive science and neuroscience.

==Overview==
The formalization of constructivism from a within-the-human perspective is commonly credited to Jean Piaget. Piaget described the mechanisms by which information from the environment and ideas from the individual interact to form internalized structures developed by learners. He identified processes of &quot;assimilation&quot; and &quot;accommodation&quot; as crucial in this interaction, as individuals construct new knowledge from their experiences.
When individuals &quot;assimilate&quot; new information, they integrate it into their existing framework without altering that framework. This can happen when their experiences align with their internal view of the world, but it can also occur if they fail to update a flawed understanding. &quot;Accommodation&quot; is the process of adjusting one&#x27;s mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. It can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning.

It is important to note that constructivism is not a specific pedagogy, but rather a theory explaining how learning occurs, regardless of the learning environment. However, constructivism is often associated with pedagogic approaches that promote active learning, or learning by doing. While there is much enthusiasm for constructivism as a design strategy, some experts believe that it is more of a philosophical framework than a theory that can precisely describe instruction or prescribe design strategies.

==Constructivist pedagogy==
===Nature of the learner===
Social constructivism recognizes and embraces the individuality and complexity of each learner, actively encouraging and rewarding it as a vital component of the learning process.

====Background and culture====
Social constructivism, also known as socioculturalism, emphasizes the role of an individual&#x27;s background, culture, and worldview in shaping their understanding of truth. According to this theory, learners inherit historical developments and symbol systems from their culture and continue to learn and develop these throughout their lives. This approach highlights the significance of a learner&#x27;s social interactions with knowledgeable members of society. It suggests that without such interactions, it is challenging to grasp the social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to effectively use them. Social constructivism also points out that young children develop their thinking abilities through interactions with peers, adults, and the physical world. Therefore, it is essential to consider the learner&#x27;s background and culture throughout the learning process, as these factors help shape the knowledge and truth that the learner acquires.

==== Motivation and responsibility for learning ====
Social constructivism emphasizes the importance of the student being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the learner played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world even in the absence of full or complete information.

When considering students&#x27; learning, it is essential to take into account their motivation and confidence. According to Von Glasersfeld, a student&#x27;s motivation to learn is strongly influenced by their belief in their potential for learning This belief is shaped by their past experiences of successfully mastering problems, which is more influential than external acknowledgment and motivation. This idea aligns with Vygotsky&#x27;s concept of the &quot;zone of proximal development,&quot; where students are challenged at a level slightly above their current development. By successfully completing challenging tasks, students build confidence and motivation to take on even more complex challenges.

According to a study on the impact that COVID-19 had on the learning process in Australian University students, a student&#x27;s motivation and confidence depends on self-determination theory. This theory requires support from the educational environment to fulfill three basic needs to achieve growth, including autonomy, relatedness, and competency. During the historical event of COVID-19, the basic needs were hindered in some way, along with environments that were meant to foster education and growth, which was hindered through the change from traditional in-person classes to online classes that left students with significantly less opportunities for social interactive and active learning opportunities.

===Role of the instructor===
==== Instructors as facilitators ====
According to the social constructivist approach, instructors are expected to adapt to the role of facilitators rather than traditional teachers. While a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator assists the student in developing their own understanding of the content. This shift in roles places the focus on the student&#x27;s active involvement in the learning process, as opposed to the instructor and the content itself.

As a result, a facilitator requires a different set of skills compared to a teacher. For instance, a teacher imparts information, whereas a facilitator encourages questions; a teacher leads from the front, while a facilitator provides support from the background; and a teacher delivers answers based on a set curriculum, whereas a facilitator offers guidance and creates an environment for the learner to form their own conclusions. Furthermore, a teacher typically engages in a monologue, whereas a facilitator maintains an ongoing dialogue with the learners.

Additionally, a facilitator should be able to dynamically adapt the learning experience by taking the lead in guiding the experience to align with the learners&#x27; interests and needs in order to create value.

The learning environment should be created in a way that both supports and challenges the student&#x27;s thinking While it is advocated to give the student ownership of the problem and solution process, it is not the case that any and all activities or solutions are adequate. The critical goal is to support the student in developing effective thinking skills.

==== Relationship between instructor and students ====
In the social constructivist viewpoint, the role of the facilitator involves both the instructor and the students being actively engaged in learning from each other. This dynamic interaction requires that the instructor&#x27;s culture, values, and background play a significant part in shaping the learning experience. Students compare their own thoughts with those of the instructor and their peers, leading to the development of a new, socially validated understanding of the subject matter. The task or problem serves as the interface between the instructor and the student, creating a dynamic interaction. As a result, both students and instructors need to develop an awareness of each other&#x27;s viewpoints and consider their own beliefs, standards, and values, making the learning experience both subjective and objective at the same time.

Several studies highlight the significance of mentoring in the learning process. The social constructivist model underscores the importance of the relationship between the student and the instructor in facilitating learning.

Interactive learning can be facilitated through various approaches such as reciprocal teaching, peer collaboration, cognitive apprenticeship, problem-based instruction, anchored instruction, and other methods that involve collaborative learning.

=== Learning is an active process ===
Social constructivism, which is strongly influenced by Vygotsky&#x27;s work, proposes that knowledge is initially built within a social setting and is then taken in by individuals. According to social constructivists, the act of sharing individual viewpoints, known as &quot;collaborative elaboration&quot;, leads to learners jointly constructing understanding that would not be achievable on their own.

Social constructivist scholars view learning as an active process in which students are encouraged to discover principles, concepts, and facts independently. Therefore, it is crucial to promote speculation and intuitive thinking in students.

According to other constructivist scholars, individuals create meanings through their interactions with each other and the environment they inhabit. Knowledge is created by people and is shaped by social and cultural influences. McMahon (1997) also emphasizes the social nature of learning, stating that it is not solely a mental process or a result of external factors shaping behavior. Instead, meaningful learning occurs when individuals participate in social activities.

According to Vygotsky (1978), an important aspect of intellectual development is the convergence of speech and practical activity. He emphasized that as children engage in practical activities, they construct meaning on an individual level, and through speech, they connect this meaning to their culture and the interpersonal world they share with others.

====Collaboration among learners====
Another tenet of social constructivism is that collaboration among individuals with diverse skills and backgrounds is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of a particular subject or field.

In some social constructivist models, there is an emphasis on the importance of collaboration among learners, which contrasts with traditional competitive approaches. One concept from Vygotsky that is particularly relevant to peer collaboration is the zone of proximal development. This is defined as the gap between a learner&#x27;s actual developmental level, determined by independent problem-solving, and the level of potential development, determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. It differs from Piaget&#x27;s fixed biological stages of development. Through a process called &quot;scaffolding,&quot; a learner can be extended beyond the limitations of physical maturation, allowing the development process to catch up to the learning process.

When students present and teach new material to their peers, it fosters a non-linear process of collective knowledge construction.

====Importance of context====
The social constructivist paradigm emphasizes that the environment in which learning takes place plays a crucial role in the learning process.

The concept of the learner as an active processor is based on the idea that there are no universal learning laws that apply to all domains. When individuals possess decontextualized knowledge, they may struggle to apply their understanding to real-world tasks. This is due to the lack of engagement with the concept in its complex, real-world environment, as well as the absence of experience with the intricate interrelationships that influence the application of the concept.

One concept within social constructivism is authentic or situated learning, which involves students participating in activities directly related to the practical application of their learning within a culture similar to the real-world setting. Cognitive apprenticeship is a suggested effective model of constructivist learning that aims to immerse students in authentic practices through activity and social interaction, similar to the successful methods used in craft apprenticeship.[

Holt and Willard-Holt (2000) highlight the concept of dynamic assessment, which offers a distinct approach to evaluating learners compared to traditional tests. Dynamic assessment extends the interactive nature of learning to the assessment process, emphasizing interaction between the assessor and the learner. It involves a dialogue between the assessor and the learner to understand the current performance level on a task and explore ways to improve future performance. This approach views assessment and learning as interconnected processes, rather than separate entities.

According to this viewpoint, instructors should approach assessment as an ongoing and interactive process that evaluates the learner&#x27;s achievements, the quality of the learning experience, and course materials. The feedback generated by the assessment process is crucial for driving further development.

===Selection, scope, and sequencing of subject matter===
The organization of knowledge should prioritize integration over division into separate subjects or compartments. This again emphasizes the significance of presenting learning within a specific context. The world in which learners operate is not divided into separate subjects but rather comprises a complex array of facts, problems, dimensions, and perceptions.

==== Engaging and challenging the student ====
Students benefit from being challenged with tasks that require them to apply skills and knowledge slightly beyond their current level of mastery. This approach can help to maintain their motivation and build on past achievements to boost their confidence. This is in line with Vygotsky&#x27;s zone of proximal development, which refers to the gap between a person&#x27;s current level of ability and their potential level of development under the guidance of adults or more capable peers.

Vygotsky (1978) argued that effective instruction should be slightly ahead of a learner&#x27;s current developmental stage. By doing so, instruction can stimulate the development of a range of functions that are in the learner&#x27;s zone of proximal development. This highlights the crucial role of instruction in fostering development.

In order to effectively engage and challenge students, it is important that the tasks and learning environment mirror the complexity of the real-world environment in which the students are expected to operate upon completing their education. Students should not only take ownership of the learning and problem-solving process but also take ownership of the problems themselves.

When it comes to organizing subject matter, the constructivist perspective suggests that the fundamental principles of any subject can be taught to anyone at any point, in some capacity. This approach entails introducing the foundational concepts that makeup topics or subject areas initially and then consistently revisiting and expanding on these ideas.

Instructors should recognize that while they are given a set curriculum to follow, they inevitably personalize it to reflect their own beliefs, thoughts, and emotions about the subject matter and their students. As a result, the learning experience becomes a collaborative effort, influenced by the emotions and life experiences of all involved. It&#x27;s important to consider the student&#x27;s motivation as central to the learning process.

==== Structuredness of the learning process ====
Incorporating an appropriate balance between structure and flexibility into the learning process is essential. According to Savery (1994), a highly structured learning environment may pose challenges for learners in constructing meaning based on their existing conceptual understandings. A facilitator should strive to provide adequate structure to offer clear guidance and parameters for achieving learning objectives, while also allowing for an open and flexible learning experience that enables learners to discover, interact, and arrive at their own understanding of truth.

=== Teaching techniques ===
A few strategies for cooperative learning include: 
* Reciprocal questioning: students work together to ask and answer questions
*Jigsaw: students become &quot;experts&quot; on one part of a group project and teach it to the others in their group
* Structured controversies: Students work together to research a particular controversy
The &quot;Harkness&quot; discussion method is named after Edward Harkness, who funded its development at Phillips Exeter Academy in the 1930s. This method involves students sitting in a circle, guiding their own discussion. The teacher&#x27;s role is minimized, with the students initiating, directing, and focusing the discussion. They work together as a team, sharing responsibility and goals. The ultimate aim is to illuminate the subject, interpret different viewpoints, and piece together a comprehensive understanding. Discussion skills are crucial, and every participant is expected to contribute to keeping the discussion engaging and productive.

== Criticism ==
Many cognitive psychologists and educators have raised concerns about the core principles of constructivism, arguing that these theories may be misleading or inconsistent with well-established findings.

In neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, it is proposed that learning is influenced by the processing and representational resources available at a particular age. This implies that if the demands of a concept to be learned exceed the available processing efficiency and working memory resources, then the concept is considered unlearnable. This approach to learning can impact the understanding of essential theoretical concepts and reasoning. Therefore, for effective learning to occur, a child must operate in an environment that aligns with their developmental and individual learning constraints, taking into account any deviations from the norm for their age. If this condition is not met, the learning process may not progress as intended.

Many educators have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this approach to instructional design, particularly when it comes to creating instruction for beginners. While some proponents of constructivism claim that &quot;learning by doing&quot; improves learning, critics argue that there is insufficient empirical evidence to support this assertion, especially for novice learners. Sweller and his colleagues argue that novices do not possess the underlying mental models, or &quot;schemas&quot; necessary for &quot;learning by doing&quot;. Additionally, Mayer (2004) conducted a review of the literature and concluded that fifty years of empirical data do not support the use of pure discovery as a constructivist teaching technique. In situations requiring discovery, he recommends the use of guided discovery instead.

Some researchers, such as Kirschner &quot;et al.&quot; (2006), have characterized the constructivist teaching methods as &quot;unguided methods of instruction&quot; and have suggested more structured learning activities for learners with little to no prior knowledge. Slezak has expressed skepticism about constructivism, describing it as &quot;fashionable but thoroughly problematic doctrines that can have little benefit for practical pedagogy or teacher education.&quot; Similar views have been stated by Meyer, Boden, Quale and others.

Kirschner et al. grouped several learning theories together, including discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based learning, and suggested that highly scaffolded constructivist methods such as problem-based learning and inquiry learning may be ineffective. They described several research studies that were favorable to problem-based learning given learners were provided some level of guidance and support.

===Confusion with maturationism===
Many people confuse constructivism with maturationism. The constructivist (or cognitive-developmental) stream &quot;is based on the idea that the dialectic or interactionist process of development and learning through the student&#x27;s active construction should be facilitated and promoted by adults&quot;. The romantic maturationist stream emphasizes the natural development of students without adult interventions in a permissive environment. In contrast, constructivism involves adults actively guiding learning while allowing children to take charge of their own learning process.

==Subtypes==
=== Contextual constructivism ===

According to William Cobern (1991) Contextual constructivism is &quot;about understanding the fundamental, culturally based beliefs that both students and teachers bring to class, and how these beliefs are supported by culture. Contextual constructivists not only raise new research questions, they also call for a new research paradigm. The focus on contextualization means that qualitative, especially ethnographic, techniques are to be preferred&quot; (p. 3).

=== Radical constructivism ===
Ernst von Glasersfeld developed radical constructivism by coupling Piaget&#x27;s theory of learning and philosophical viewpoint about the nature of knowledge with Kant&#x27;s rejection of an objective reality independent of human perception or reason. Radical constructivism does not view knowledge as an attempt to generate ideas that match an independent, objective reality. Instead, theories and knowledge about the world, as generated by our senses and reason, either fit within the constraints of whatever reality may exist and, thus, are viable or do not and are not viable. As a theory of education, radical constructivism emphasizes the experiences of the learner, differences between learners and the importance of uncertainty.

=== Relational constructivism ===
Björn Kraus&#x27; relational constructivism can be perceived as a relational consequence of radical constructivism. In contrast to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception. Despite the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focuses on the relational conditions that apply to human perceptional processes.

=== Social constructivism ===
In recent decades, constructivist theorists have extended the traditional focus on individual learning to address collaborative and social dimensions of learning. It is possible to see social constructivism as a bringing together of aspects of the work of Piaget with that of Bruner and Vygotsky.

=== Communal constructivism ===
The concept &quot;communal constructivism&quot; was developed by Leask and Younie, in 1995, through their research on the European SchoolNet, which demonstrated the value of experts collaborating to push the boundaries of knowledge, including communal construction of new knowledge between experts, rather than the social construction of knowledge, as described by Vygotsky, where there is a learner to teacher scaffolding relationship. &quot;Communal constructivism,” as a concept, applies to those situations in which there is currently no expert knowledge or research to underpin knowledge in an area. &quot;Communal constructivism&quot; refers, specifically, to the process of experts working together to create, record, and publish new knowledge in emerging areas. In the seminal European SchoolNet research where, for the first time, academics were testing out how the internet could support classroom practice and pedagogy, experts from a number of countries set up test situations to generate and understand new possibilities for educational practice.

Bryan Holmes, in 2001, applied this to student learning, as described in an early paper, &quot;in this model, students will not simply pass through a course like water through a sieve but instead leave their own imprint in the learning process.&quot;

===Critical constructivism===
Critical constructivism is a theory of learning that combines elements of constructivism and critical theory. It emphasizes the role of social and cultural factors in shaping knowledge construction. Critical constructivists argue that learners actively construct knowledge through their interactions with the world, but also recognize the power imbalances and social structures that can influence this process.

Key concepts in critical constructivism include:
* critical consciousness – ability to critically analyze social and political structures 
* empowerment – process of gaining control over one&#x27;s own life and the lives of others
* social justice – pursuit of fairness and equality for all

Critical constructivism has implications for education, as it suggests that teachers should create learning environments that foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and social justice.

== Influence on computer science and robotics ==

Constructivism has influenced the course of programming and computer science. Some famous programming languages have been created, either wholly or in part, for educational use, to support the constructionist theory of Seymour Papert. These languages have been dynamically typed and reflective. Logo and its successor, Scratch, are the best known of them. Constructivism has also informed the design of interactive machine learning systems, whereas radical constructivism has been explored as a paradigm to design experiments in rehabilitation robotics and more precisely in prosthetics.

==List of notable constructivists==

<text>The modern Celts ( , see pronunciation of &quot;Celt&quot;) are a related group of ethnicities who share similar Celtic languages, cultures and artistic histories, and who live in or descend from one of the regions on the western extremities of Europe populated by the Celts.

A modern Celtic identity emerged in Western Europe following the identification of the native peoples of the Atlantic fringe as Celts by Edward Lhuyd in the 18th century. Lhuyd and others (notably the 17th century Breton chronologist Pezron) equated the Celts described by Greco-Roman writers with the pre-Roman peoples of France, Great Britain, and Ireland. They categorised the ancient Irish and British languages as Celtic languages. The descendants of these ancient languages are the Brittonic (Breton, Cornish, and Welsh variants) and Goidelic (Irish, Manx, and Gaelic variants) languages, and the people who speak them are considered modern Celts.

The concept of modern Celtic identity evolved during the course of the 19th century into the Celtic Revival. By the late 19th century, it often took the form of ethnic nationalism, particularly within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, where the Irish War of Independence resulted in the secession of the Irish Free State, in 1922. There were also significant Welsh, Scottish, and Breton nationalist movements, giving rise to the concept of Celtic nations. After World War II, the focus of the Celtic movement shifted to linguistic revival and protectionism, e.g. with the foundation of the Celtic League in 1961, dedicated to preserving the surviving Celtic languages.

The Celtic revival also led to the emergence of musical and artistic styles identified as Celtic. Music typically drew on folk traditions within the Celtic nations. Art drew on the decorative styles of Celtic art produced by the ancient Celts and early medieval Christianity, along with folk styles. Cultural events to promote &quot;inter-Celtic&quot; cultural exchange also emerged. 

In the late 20th century, some authors criticised the idea of modern Celtic identity, usually by downplaying the value of the linguistic component in defining culture and cultural connection, sometimes also arguing that there never was a common Celtic culture, even in ancient times. Malcolm Chapman&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;The Celts: The Construction of a Myth&quot; led to what archaeologist Barry Cunliffe has called a &quot;politically correct disdain for the use of &#x27;Celt.

==Definitions==
Traditionally, the essential defining criterion of Celticity is seen as &quot;peoples and countries that do, or once did, use Celtic languages&quot; and it is asserted that an index of connectedness to the Celtic languages has to be borne in mind before branching out into other cultural domains. 

An alternative approach to defining &quot;the Celts&quot; is the contemporary inclusive and associative definition proposed by Vincent and Ruth Megaw (1996) and Raimund Karl (2010). It holds that a Celt is someone who uses a Celtic language or produces or uses a distinctive Celtic cultural expression (such as art or music) or has been referred to as a Celt in historical materials or has identified themselves or been identified by others as a Celt or has a demonstrated descent from the Celts (such as family history or DNA ancestry).

Since the Enlightenment, the term &quot;Celtic&quot; has been applied to a wide variety of peoples and cultural traits present and past. Today, &quot;Celtic&quot; is often used to describe people of the Celtic nations (the Bretons, the Cornish, the Irish, the Manx, the Scots and the Welsh) and their respective cultures and languages. Except for the Bretons (if discounting Norman and Channel Islander connections), all groups mentioned have been subject to strong Anglicisation since the Early Modern period, and hence are also described as participating in an Anglo-Celtic macro-culture. By the same token, the Bretons have been subject to strong Frenchification since the Early Modern period, and can similarly be described as participating in a Franco-Celtic macro-culture.

Less common is the assumption of &quot;Celticity&quot; for European cultures deriving from Continental Celtic roots (Gauls or Celtiberians). These were either Romanised or Germanised much earlier, before the Early Middle Ages. Nevertheless, &quot;Celtic&quot; origins are many times implied for continental groups such as the Asturians, Galicians, Portuguese, Swiss, Northern Italians, Belgians and Austrians. The names of Belgium and Aquitaine hark back to &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot; and &quot;Gallia Aquitania&quot;, respectively, in turn named for the Belgae and the Aquitani. The Latin name of the Swiss Confederacy, &quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot;, harks back to the Helvetii, the name of Galicia to the Gallaeci and the Auvergne of France to the Averni.

==Celtic revival and romanticism==
&#x27;Celt&#x27; has been adopted as a label of self-identification by a variety of peoples at different times. &#x27;Celticity&#x27; can refer to the inferred links between them.

During the 19th century, French nationalists gave a privileged significance to their descent from the Gauls. The struggles of Vercingetorix were portrayed as a forerunner of the 19th-century struggles in defence of French nationalism, including the wars of both Napoleons (Napoleon I of France and Napoleon III of France). Basic French history textbooks emphasised the ways in which Gauls (&quot;Nos ancêtres les Gaulois...&quot;, &#x27;our ancestors the Gauls&#x27;) could be seen as an example of cultural assimilation. In the late Middle Ages, some French writers believed (incorrectly) that their language was primarily Celtic, rather than Latin. A similar use of &quot;Celticity&quot; for 19th-century nationalism was made in Switzerland, when the Swiss were seen to originate in the Celtic tribe of the Helvetii, a link still found in the official Latin name of Switzerland, &quot;Confœderatio Helvetica&quot;, the source of the nation code CH and the name used on postage stamps (Helvetia).

Before the advance of Indo-European studies, philologists established that there was a relationship between the Goidelic and Brythonic languages, as well as a relationship between these languages and the extinct Celtic languages such as Gaulish, spoken in classical times. The terms Goidelic and Brythonic were first used to describe the two Celtic language families by Edward Lhuyd in his 1707 study and, according to the National Museum Wales, during that century &quot;people who spoke Celtic languages were seen as Celts.&quot;

At the same time, there was also a tendency to stress other heritages in the British Isles at certain times. For example, in the Isle of Man, in the Victorian era, the &quot;Viking&quot; heritage was emphasised, and in Scotland, both Norse and Anglo-Saxon heritage was emphasised.

A romantic image of the Celt as a noble savage was cultivated by the early William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, Lady Charlotte Guest, Lady Llanover, James Macpherson, Chateaubriand, Théodore Hersart de la Villemarqué and the many others influenced by them. This image coloured not only the English perception of their neighbours on the so-called &quot;Celtic fringe&quot; (compare the stage Irishman), but also Irish nationalism and its analogues in the other Celtic-speaking countries. Among the enduring products of this resurgence of interest in a romantic, pre-industrial, brooding, mystical Celticity are Gorseddau, the revival of the Cornish language, and the revival of the Gaelic games.

==Contemporary Celtic identity==

The &quot;modern Celtic&quot; groups&#x27; distinctiveness as &quot;national&quot;, as opposed to regional, minorities has been periodically recognised by major British newspapers. For example, a &quot;Guardian&quot; editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and said that they should be constitutionally recognised:

Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are &quot;distinctly national&quot; in ways which &quot;proud people from Yorkshire&quot;, much less proud people from Berkshire will never know. Any new constitutional settlement &quot;which ignores these factors&quot; will be built on uneven ground.

The Republic of Ireland, on surpassing Britain&#x27;s GDP per capita in the 1990s for the first time, was given the moniker &quot;Celtic tiger&quot;. Thanks in part to campaigning on the part of Cornish regionalists, Cornwall was able to obtain Objective One funding from the European Union. Scotland and Wales obtained agencies like the Welsh Development Agency, and in the first two decades of the 21st century Scottish and Welsh Nationalists have supported the institutions of the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). More broadly, distinct identities in opposition to that of the metropolitan capitals have been forged and taken strong root.

These latter evolutions have proceeded hand in hand with the growth of a pan-Celtic or inter-Celtic dimension, seen in many organisations and festivals operating across various Celtic countries. Celtic studies departments at many universities in Europe and beyond, have studied the various ancient and modern Celtic languages and associated history and folklore under one roof.

Some of the most vibrant aspects of modern Celtic culture are music, song and festivals. Under the &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Festivals&quot; and &quot;Dance&quot; sections below, the richness of these aspects that have captured the world&#x27;s attention are outlined.

Sports such as hurling, Gaelic football and shinty are seen as being Celtic.

The USA has also taken part in discussions of modern Celticity. For example, Virginia Senator James H. Webb, in his 2004 book &quot;Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America&quot;, controversially asserts that the early &quot;pioneering&quot; immigrants to North America were of Scots-Irish origins. He goes on to argue that their distinct &quot;Celtic traits&quot; (loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and military readiness), in contrast to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; settlers, helped construct the modern &quot;American identity&quot;. Irish Americans also played an important role in the shaping of 19th-century Irish republicanism through the Fenian movement and the development of view that the Great Hunger was a British atrocity.

==Criticism of modern Celticism==
In 1996, Ruth Megaw and Emeritus Professor Vincent Megaw of Flinders University in the &quot;Antiquity&quot; article &quot;Ancient Celts and modern ethnicity&quot; examined &quot;ethnic identity&quot; particularly in relation to &quot;Celtic identity&quot; in arguing against critics seemingly motivated by an English nationalist agenda opposed to further integration with Europe who saw modern Celtic identity as a threat.

In 1998, Simon James of the University of Leicester in the &quot;Antiquity&quot; article &quot;Celts, politics and motivation in archaeology&quot; replied to Ruth and Vincent Megaw&#x27;s article questioning the suitability of the term &quot;Celtic&quot; in the historic sense. The core of his argument was that the Iron Age peoples of Britain should be considered not as generic Celts, but as a mosaic of different societies, each with their own traditions and histories.
Later in 1998, this line of reasoning came under criticism, being labelled an intellectual extension of modern British cultural colonialism, as well as for simplifying the anthropological correlation between material culture and ethnicity. Ruth and Vincent Megaw in the Antiquity article &quot;The Mechanism of (Celtic) Dreams?&#x27;: A Partial Response to Our Critics.&quot; attacked &#x27;Celt-sceptics&#x27; for being motivated by English nationalism or anxieties about the decline of British imperial power.

Simon James, in 1998, wrote a response arguing that the rejection of a Celtic past was not &#x27;nationalist&#x27; but partly due to archaeological evidence, and usually by a post-colonial and multi-cultural agenda with recognition that Britain has always been home to multiple identities.

Recently, the Insular Celts have increasingly been seen as part of an Atlantic trading-networked culture speaking Celtic languages of the Atlantic Bronze Age and probably earlier.

In 2003, Professor John Collis of the University of Sheffield wrote a book titled &quot;The Celts: Origins, Myths and Invention&quot;, itself criticised in 2004 by Ruth and Vincent Megaw in &quot;Antiquity&quot;.

==Celtic nations==
Six nations tend to be most associated with a modern Celtic identity, and are considered the &quot;Celtic nations&quot;.

:* Brittany
:* Ireland
:* Scotland
:* Wales
:* Isle of Man
:* Cornwall

These six nations alone are considered Celtic by the Celtic League and the Celtic Congress, amongst others. These organisations ascribe to a definition of Celticity-based mainly upon language. Celtic languages have survived (or in some cases been revived) and continue to be used to varying degrees in these six geographical areas. There are also Celtic nomads: Irish Travellers called &quot;Pavee&quot; that speak a language called Shelta that is a creole of Irish Gaelic and other languages, and Indigenous Highland Scottish Travellers called &quot;Tinkers&quot; who speak a language called Beurla Reagaird that is an acrolect of Scottish Gaelic.

A number of activists on behalf of other regions/nations have also sought recognition as modern Celts, reflecting the wide diffusion of ancient Celts across Europe. Notable regions include Galicia, Northern Portugal, Asturias and Cantabria.

A Celtic language did not survive in Galicia / Northern Portugal (together Gallaecia), Asturias nor Cantabria, and as such they fall outside of the litmus test used by the Celtic League, and the Celtic Congress. Nevertheless, many organisations organised around Celticity consider that Galicia / Northern Portugal (Douro, Minho and Tras-os-Montes) and Asturias &quot;can claim a Celtic cultural or historic heritage&quot;. These claims to Celticity are rooted in the long historical existence of Celts in these regions and ethnic connections to other Atlantic Celtic peoples (see Celtiberians, Celtici and Castro culture). In 2009, the Gallaic Revival Movement, sponsored by the Liga Celtiga Galaica (the Galician Celtic League), claimed to be reconstructing the Q-Celtic Gallaic language based on the &quot;Atebivota Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Old Celtic Dictionary&quot; compiled by Vincent F. Pintado.

Elements of Celtic music, dance, and folklore can be found within England (e.g. Yan Tan Tethera, well dressing, Halloween), and the Cumbric language survived until the collapse of the Kingdom of Strathclyde in about 1018. England as a whole comprises many distinct regions, and some of these regions, such as Cumbria, Lancashire, Northumbria, Western Yorkshire and Devon can claim more Celtic heritage than others. In 2009, it was claimed that revival of the Cumbric language was being attempted in Cumberland, England, however the idea that &quot;Cumbric&quot; was separate from Old Welsh has been criticised as stemming from the difficulty that many English historians have with accepting Old Welsh as the language once spoken all over England. It was suggested by Colin Lewis in Carn magazine that revivalists in the north of England use Modern Welsh to enable use of Welsh&#x27;s existing rich cultural basis rather than having to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; in much the same way as has been done successfully in Derbyshire, another area where elements of Celtic culture survive.

Similarly, in France outside of Brittany, in Auvergne chants are sung around bonfires remembering a Celtic god. There are also modern attempts to revive the polytheistic religion of the Gauls.

==Ancestry==

A profound interest in genealogy and family history is noted as a feature of the culture of the Celtic nations and regions and people with a Celtic heritage. Historically, some people in Celtic areas could recite their genealogy back though the generations as history, moving rhythmically from one name to another using only Christian names as illustrated by lyrics of the Runrig song Sìol Ghoraidh &quot;The Genealogy of Goraidh&quot;.

The genetic disorder hereditary haemochromatosis has by far its highest prevalence rate among people of Celtic ancestry. Other traits far more prevalent among people of Celtic ancestry include lactase persistence and red hair, with 46% of Irish and at least 36% of Highland Scots being carriers of red-head variants of the MC1R gene, possibly an adaptation to the cloudy weather of the areas where they live.

Although they are not usually considered a Celtic nation, the Faroe Islands have a population with a large Celtic heritage in genetic terms. Recent DNA analyses have revealed that Y chromosomes, tracing male descent, are 87% Scandinavian, whereas the mitochondrial DNA, tracing female descent, is 84% Celtic. The same can be said about Icelanders. The founder population of Iceland came from Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia: studies of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomes indicate that 62% of Icelanders&#x27; matrilineal ancestry derives from Scotland and Ireland (with most of the rest being from Scandinavia), while 75% of their patrilineal ancestry derives from Scandinavia (with most of the rest being from the Irish and British Isles). In addition, there are some areas of the accepted Celtic countries whose population are mostly not of Celtic heritage: for example, the Orkney and Shetland Islands in Scotland have populations of mostly Scandinavian descent.

==Migration from Celtic countries==
A significant portion of the populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is composed of people whose ancestors were from one of the &quot;Celtic nations&quot;. This concerns the Irish diaspora most significantly (see also Irish American), but to a lesser extent also the Welsh diaspora and the Cornish diaspora.

There are three areas outside Europe with communities of Celtic language speakers:
*the province of Chubut in Patagonia with Welsh-speaking Welsh Argentines (known as &quot;Y Wladfa&quot;)
* Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia with Scottish Gaelic-speaking Scottish Canadians
*southeast Newfoundland with Irish-speaking Irish Canadians.

The most common mother-tongue amongst the Fathers of Confederation which saw the formation of Canada was Gaelic.
There is a movement in Cape Breton for a separate province in Canada, as espoused by the Cape Breton Labour Party and others.

In some former British colonies, or particular regions within them, the term Anglo-Celtic has emerged as a descriptor of an ethnic grouping. In particular, Anglo-Celtic Australian is a term comprising about 80% of the population.

==Music==

The claim that distinctly Celtic styles of music exist was made during the nineteenth century, and was associated with the revival of folk traditions and pan-Celtic ideology. The Welsh anthem &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; was adopted as a pan-Celtic anthem. Though there are links between Scots Gaelic and Irish Gaelic folk musics, very different musical traditions existed in Wales and Brittany. Nevertheless, Gaelic styles were adopted as typically Celtic even by Breton revivalists such as Paul Ladmirault.
Celticism came to be associated with the bagpipe and the harp. The harp is considered to be the national instrument of Wales and is used to accompany penillion singing (or cerdd dant) where the harpist plays a melody and the singer sings in counterpoint to it. The roots revival, applied to Celtic music, has brought much inter-Celtic cross-fertilisation, as, for instance, the revival by Welsh musicians of the use of the mediaeval Welsh bagpipe under the influence of the Breton &quot;binioù&quot;, Irish &quot;uilleann&quot; pipes and famous Scottish pipes, or the Scots have revived the &quot;bodhran&quot; from Irish influence. Charles le Goffic introduced the Scottish Highland pipes to Brittany.

Unaccompanied or A cappella styles of singing are performed across the modern Celtic world due to the folk music revival, popularity of Celtic choirs, world music, scat singing and hip hop rapping in Celtic languages. Traditional rhythmic styles used to accompany dancing and now performed are Puirt a beul from Scotland, Ireland, and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Sean-nós singing from Ireland and Kan ha diskan from Brittany. Other traditional unaccompanied styles sung currently are waulking songs and psalm singing or lining out, both from Scotland.

The emergence of folk-rock led to the creation of a popular music genre labelled Celtic music which &quot;frequently involves the blending of traditional and modern forms, e.g. the Celtic-punk of The Pogues, the ambient music of Enya ... the Celtic-rock of Runrig, Rawlins Cross and Horslips.&quot; Pan-Celtic music festivals were established, notably the Festival Interceltique de Lorient founded in 1971, which has occurred annually since.

==Festivals==


The Scottish Mod and Irish Fleadh Cheoil (and Gaelic Céilidh) are seen as an equivalent to the Breton Fest Noz, Cornish Troyl and Welsh Eisteddfod.

The Celtic Media Festival is an annual 3-day event that promotes the languages and cultures of the Celtic Nations and Regions in media. This festival takes place in a different Celtic nation every year and has been running since 1980.

The birthdays of the most important Celtic Saints of Celtic Christianity for each Celtic nation have become the focus for festivals, feasts and marches: Ireland – Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, Wales – Saint David&#x27;s Day, Scotland – Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, Cornwall – Saint Piran&#x27;s Day, Isle of Man – St Maughold&#x27;s Feast Day and Brittany – Fête de la St-Yves and Grand Pardon of Sainte-Anne-d&#x27;Auray Pilgrimage.

Attitudes and customs associated with the routine of the year&#x27;s work, religious beliefs and practices survived the coming of Christianity in the conservative rural areas of much of the Celtic countries. All over these lands there were sacred places which had earned their status in pre-Christian times and which had only been gingerly adopted by the Christian church and given a garnish of Christian names or dedications, hills, stones, and especially wells which can still be seen festooned with rags in observance of an old ritual.

Certain days in the year were marked as festivals, and time was counted forward and backwards from them without reference to the ordinary calendar. In her fine study of the festival of the beginning of harvest, in Irish &quot;Lughnasa&quot;, Máire MacNeill has demonstrated the continuity between the myth known from the early Middle Ages and the customs which survive in the 21st century. Lughnasa, called Calan Awst in Welsh, is a summer feast and was dedicated to the god Lug. Of great interest is the use in the Coligny calendar of the word &quot;Saman&quot;, a word that is still in use in Gaelic refer to Hallowe&#x27;en (evening of the saints), an important day and night and feast among the Celts (in Welsh it is called Calan Gaeaf). In Gaelic folklore, it was considered a particularly dangerous time, when magical spirits wandered through the land, particularly at nightfall. The other important feast days that also continued to be celebrated under Christian guise, but often with a pagan spirit were Imbolc (Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau in Welsh), the start of lambing, now the feast day of St Brigit and Beltane, the spring feast, now May Day (Calan Mai in Welsh).

In their pilgrimages the people combined the celebration of a holy place and a holy day. Pilgrimages are still an important feature of country life, particularly in Ireland, Brittany and Galicia. The most impressive pilgrimages include Croagh Patrick on the west coast of Ireland on the last Sunday in July (the beginning of harvest) and Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. The inspiration for famous Celtic singer and harpist Loreena McKennitt&#x27;s million-selling CD &quot;The Mask and the Mirror&quot; came in part from a visit to Galicia and in particular Santiago de Compostela. Some of her songs are about Celtic feast days such as &quot;All Souls Night&quot; about Samhain on &quot;The Visit&quot; CD which featured in the erotic thriller film Jade starring David Caruso and &quot;Huron Beltane Fire Dance&quot; on the Parallel Dreams CD.

==Dance==
To signal the coming of summer and the return of real warmth, on Beltane (&quot;Bel&#x27;s Fire&quot;), the May Day festival time, dances such as the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss dance festival at Padstow in Cornwall are held with the maypole as its focus point. The celebrations are tied to the promotion of fertility and a fruitful growing season with the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss dancing to the music through streets decked out in flowers, and sycamore, ash and maple boughs. Shortly afterwards, on 8 May, the ancient rites of Spring are celebrated with the Furry Dance procession to an ancient tune made famous in the song &quot;The Floral Dance&quot; through the streets of nearby Helston together with the mystery play Hal an Tow. Fertility festivals like this used to be celebrated all over Britain.

In the early 1980s seven-time world champion step-dancer, Michael Flatley toured the world with The Chieftains and performed five solo dances (including a triple spin) at Carnegie Hall, New York, in a defining moment that led more than a decade later to a show at the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin that soon developed into the Irish dance extravaganza the world came to know as Riverdance Jean Butler, one of the original leads, also worked with The Chieftains. Flatley later put up his own show, Lord of the Dance. The spectacular success of both shows can certainly take the credit for the revitalised Celtomania of the last half of the 1990s.

==Arts and crafts==

Revival of Celtic art has been seen in the Celtic jewellery that revived ancient traditions based on the museum pieces that archaeologists had recovered. An example is the Claddagh ring produced in Galway since at least 1700, but popularised in the 1840s.

Textile craft industries based on Celtic fisher designs such as Aran jumpers were developed in the early 1900s by enterprising island women to earn income.

Following the authoritative publications on Celtic Art of the Hallstatt and La Tene periods by Joseph Déchelette (1908–1914) and Paul Jacobsthal (1944), Scottish artist George Bain popularized the revival of Celtic Art with his bestselling book &quot;Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction&quot; first published in 1951. Irish artist and writer Jim Fitzpatrick started to hold popular attention from the mid-1970s adopting Irish mythology in comic strip form in his series of books and posters &quot;Nuada of the Silver Arm&quot;. From the 1980s, public fascination with Celtic Art spawned a small industry in Celtic art books and reinterpretations of ancient Celtic art works, such as the works of Welsh artist Courtney Davies.

==Literature and mythology==
Similarly, there has been a rebirth of interest in fantasy fiction based on Celtic themes inspired by history and the vast body of Celtic myths and legends.

<doc id="1040179" wikidata="Q4839985" url="?curid=1040179" title="Bacterial fruit blotch">
<text>Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) affects cucurbit plants around the world and can be a serious threat to farmers because it spreads through contaminated seed. BFB is the result of an infection by Gram-negative &quot;Acidovorax citrulli&quot; bacteria, which has only been recently studied in detail. Members of A. citrulli are Gram-negative rod shaped bacteria with the dimensions 0.5× 1.7 μm. They move via polar flagella. No known reliable sources of BFB resistance exist today, so seed hygiene and thorough testing of breeding facilities are the best way to control spreading. No known control methods, however, are extremely reliable for reducing BFB infection.

== Hosts and symptoms ==
&quot;A. citrulli&quot; causes disease in the family Cucurbitaceae, with the most significant losses in melon and watermelon. It also affects pumpkin, zucchini and cucumber but these are not as economically devastated by fruit blotch as the melons. &quot;A. citrulli’s&quot; economic hosts are cucurbits, but the bacteria can also infect volunteer seedlings of other families. This makes it easier for the pathogen to spread. Symptoms of melon with BFB include water soaked lesions on cotyledons, and hypocotyls, leading to collapse and death. Lesions will look necrotic and may be near veins. On fruit, water soaked lesions will be small and irregular (they average 1 cm diameter and may be sunken) but then progress through the rind. The fruit then decays and cracks when the pathogen causes necrosis. These lesions open the plant to secondary infections as well. &quot;A. citrulli&quot; then colonizes the pulp, eventually allowing the seed to become contaminated. On adult leaves, the symptoms appear the same as the ones left by other abiotic or biotic stressors so diagnosis is not as straight forward. They include large irregular leaf lesions which are brown to black in watermelon and reddish brown in melon. Bacterial fruit blotch lesions spread along main midrib in adult leaves.

== Disease cycle ==
&quot;Acidivorax citrulli&quot; is primarily seed transmitted. Seeds containing &quot;A. citrulli&quot; are difficult to treat, as the bacteria is found deep within the tissue, and can be viable for 35 years or more. There are still some aspects of the epidemiology that are unknown. It has been found that the pathogen initially starts its life as a saprophyte, relying on the seed&#x27;s degrading action of complex sugars, and switches to a pathogenic growth mode when the seedling emerges. While this is a step forward, there is little knowledge of the pathogen&#x27;s movement in the plant, how it overwinters, or its alternate hosts. Without this knowledge, its complete mode of reproduction (an important tool in reducing epidemic) is still unknown.

The infection of fruit is better understood. Bacteria typically enter the fruit through their stomata, three to four weeks after fruit set. As the fruit develops, wax fills and blocks stomata, eliminating entry to the bacteria. While the maturation of fruit restricts entry to the bacteria, mature fruits are more susceptible to symptoms of the bacteria than immature fruit. Fruit typically show symptoms in the final weeks of development, leaving a lag period between infection and symptoms. The fruit typically becomes infected early in development, and shows symptoms near harvest, making diagnosis and prevention difficult. The only known way for the bacteria to get into production fields is by introduction of infected seeds. This makes sanitation highly important.

== Environment ==
&quot;A. citrulli’s&quot; ability to infect hosts depends on environmental factors. It relies on temperature and humidity to thrive. High temperatures and humidity, plus high levels of bacteria on/within the seed are required to see infection. The amount of bacteria on/within seed is based on the intensity of fruit infection in the previous season (the seed is infected when the fruit tissue surrounding it transmits the bacteria). Greenhouses are perfect environments for seed to seedling transfer of &quot;A. citrulli&quot; because it is warm, humid, and tightly filled with host plants. For this reason, many transplants are infected before they are transplanted to the field. When direct seeded, cucurbits may have a better chance for survival because the environment in the field is more variable and may be cooler/drier than the greenhouse. This makes it more difficult for the pathogen to infect.

== Management ==
If seed is to be transported from country to country, it generally needs to be free of pathogens before the company will accept it. Japan legally restricts the admission of seeds carrying &quot;Acidivorax citrulli&quot; bacteria. Seed can be cleaned using a dry heat treatment to remove the pathogen with some success. A treatment of 85° for 3–5 days is effective for removing the pathogen. Different cucurbit seeds respond to this treatment in different ways, and some species (large-seeded squash, wax gourd, bottle gourd) have reduced germination following a dry heat treatment. This cleaning method can remove other pathogens found within seeds, but has been found to be especially useful for BFB. Prior to planting, seed should be checked to ensure that it is not infected with BFB. Companies such as Eurofins STA Laboratories and Summit Plant Labs test seed for cleanliness.

Since the pathogen is difficult to eradicate, plant resistance to the pathogen can provide an alternative to removing the pathogen. While research is being carried out to produce cultivars that are resistant, progress has not been quick. Several accessions have been reported to have resistance to BFB in watermelon and melon, but are not widely accepted to date. While these advances are promising, there are still no commercial cultivars with significant resistance to BFB.

== Importance ==
The first plant pathogenic bacteria was determined in 1878 and many more have been identified since. However, research on Bacterial Fruit Blotch began much later than many other plant diseases. It was not until the 1980s that the disease began to impact the fruit industry economically. Since the discovery of BFB, millions of dollars have been lost to crop rot, however no exact dollar amount has been identified. The first report of BFB research came in 1965 when a seed-borne phytobacterium was isolated from diseased plant tissue from Turkey. The USDA originally thought the disease was exclusively in seedlings, however the first BFB outbreak in 1987 proved that entire fields could be lost to fruit decay. Today, many outbreaks in the United States result in 90-100% fruit loss per diseased field, prompting lawsuits by farmers over contaminated seed. In the 1990s, &quot;A. citrulli&quot; was found to infect most other cucurbit species. During this time, Bacterial Fruit Blotch spread through cucurbit fields around the globe very quickly. It appears to spread only through contaminated seed, however non-economic host plants can carry the disease on seed as well, making it difficult to control. BFB is a unique disease because its late discovery gives scientists an opportunity to track the outbreak from the start. Like all plant diseases, the BFB epidemic is related to the interactions of a triangle of disease components (Pathogen, Host, and Environment). Therefore, BFB provides an opportunity to better understand how to track these interactions in real time while this disease spreads.

<text>Professor Sir Brian John Hoskins (born 17 May 1945) is a British dynamical meteorologist and climatologist based at the Imperial College London and the University of Reading. He is a recipient of the 2024 Japan Prize along with Professor John Michael Wallace in the field of &quot;Resources, Energy, the Environment, and Social Infrastructure&quot; for &quot;Establishment of a scientific foundation for understanding and predicting extreme weather events&quot;. He is a mathematician by training, his research has focused on understanding atmospheric motion from the scale of fronts to that of the Earth, using a range of theoretical and numerical models. He is perhaps best known for his work on the mathematical theory of extratropical cyclones and frontogenesis, particularly through the use of potential vorticity. He has also produced research across many areas of meteorology, including the Indian monsoon and global warming, recently contributing to the Stern review and the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.

In 1996, he and the meteorologist Mark J. Rodwell , formulated the Rodwell–Hoskins mechanism hypothesis on the climatic teleconnection between the Indian/Asian summer monsoon and the climate of the Mediterranean.

== Career ==

Hoskins gained a B.A. (1st Class Honors) and PhD in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, UK, in 1966 and 1970, respectively. He was then Reader in atmospheric modelling (1976–1981) and professor of meteorology (1981–present) at the University of Reading. He was Head of the Department of Meteorology (1990–1996) at the University of Reading and President of the Royal Meteorological Society (1998–2000). He was a Royal Society council member (1999–present) and research professor (2001–present) and the first Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London (2008–2014).

Hoskins has spoken on behalf for the use of meteorology in government, industry and society. He was also part of establishing the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, an international centre for climate change research. He has been Council member for the Natural Environment Research Council that funds and supports most of the environmental research in the UK, and has held numerous roles for the Met Office, most recently as non-executive director and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board.

He has made contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific assessments. He contributed to the Stern review of the economics of climate change and was also a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution which recommended that the UK should aim for a 60% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050. He was appointed to the UK Committee on Climate Change, which has been influential in the Government&#x27;s decision to commit to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

<text>A military fork is a polearm which was used in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries. Like many polearms, the military fork traces its lineage to an agricultural tool, in this case the pitchfork. 
Unlike a trident used for fishing, the military fork was rarely barbed and normally consisted only of two tines (prongs) which were straight compared to the original pitchfork. The pair of tines usually ran parallel or slightly flared. This weapon was relatively easy to use compared to a sword, which could take years to learn how to wield effectively. It was usually used in absence of a spear. Like a spear, the military fork could be used in tight formations and was often made with various minor customizations to improve use; in the example of the image above, the fork has a hook parallel to the prongs intended to &quot;catch&quot; the blow of a weapon, as well as two &quot;hooks&quot; intended to dismount a knight from his horse.

<text>Cannaiola is a village of 730 inhabitants in the Italian province of Perugia in east central Umbria in the floodplain of the Clitunno River; altitude 218 m (715 ft) above sea-level. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Trevi, which lies 3.5 km (about 2 mi) to the east.

==History and main sights==

The origin of the town&#x27;s name is, strictly speaking, unknown; but the two most likely possibilities have to do with water: Latin &quot;canna&quot;, rushes, or Italian &quot;cannaviola&quot;, canal; an indication of the rôle of water in the town&#x27;s history.

Cannaiola dates to the 13c when a tributary of the Clitunno, a creek called the Tatarena, was shifted west to its present course and the people who had been living closer to the foot of Trevi&#x27;s hill, but in an unhealthy location, found a place ready-made for them, a few meters higher than their old homes: the old bed of the Tatarena is now the main street of Cannaiola.

Cannaiola must have been quite small until the 19th or 20th century, since it regularly fails to appear in detailed 17th- and 18th-century maps of the creeks and villages of the plain between Trevi and Montefalco. It did have, however, at least two churches that are now vanished: a chapel of S. Niccolò di Bari, demolished in 1869 in spite of its 15c frescoes; and a church of S. Francesco di Paola, which was at La Cuccia near the Maroggia river about 1 km away — although its precise location is now unknown.

Three churches remain: the parish church of St. Michael, since 1988 also known as the Sanctuary of the Bl. Pietro Bonilli, who was its pastor for many years in the late 19th century; and the two much smaller churches of S. Antonio Abate and of S. Fedele di Sigmaringen.

<doc id="1040219" wikidata="Q4673675" url="?curid=1040219" title="Achievement gaps in the United States">
<text>Achievement gaps in the United States are observed, persistent disparities in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity and gender. The achievement gap can be observed through a variety of measures, including standardized test scores, grade point average, dropout rates, college enrollment, and college completion rates. The gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K. Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.

Research into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot;), commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education. The report found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist David Berliner, home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.

The achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), has become a focal point of education reform efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented. These efforts include establishing affirmative action, emphasizing multicultural education, and increasing interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.

==Racial achievement gap==

The education of African Americans and some other minorities lags behind those of other U.S. ethnic groups, such as White Americans and Asian Americans, as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of white Americans 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of African immigrant population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born black people born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.

Asian Americans of Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean descent score the highest on average, with the difference primarily on mathematics subtests, in all scholastic standardized tests such as the SAT, GRE, MCAT, USMLE exams and IQ tests followed by White Americans who score in the intermediate range. Hispanic American and African American scores tend to follow White scores. U.S. students as a whole have in general attained average scores on the International PISA test while other wealthy industrialized developed East Asian countries, such as China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, achieve the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is anticipated that over half of public education students will be required to pass standards-based assessments which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college.

Researchers have not reached consensus about the causes of the academic achievement gap; instead, there exists a wide range of studies that cite an array of factors, both cultural and structural, that influence student performance in school. Sociologist Annette Lareau suggested that students who lack middle-class cultural capital and have limited parental involvement are likely to have lower academic achievement than their better resourced peers. Other researchers suggest that academic achievement is more closely tied to race and socioeconomic status and have tried to pinpoint why.

==Gender achievement gap==

For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.

Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious job fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data.

===Literacy===

Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year. On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.

On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school. In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.

All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.

===Math and science===

Which gender is disadvantaged by the gap in math and science achievement largely depends on how academic achievement is being measured. Female students generally have better grades in their math classes, and this gap starts off very minimal but increases with age. However, males score higher on standardized math tests, and these score gaps also increase with age. Male students also score higher on measures of college readiness, such as the AP Calculus exams and the math section of the SAT.

The differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds. This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a student&#x27;s completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys. The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.

At least one study has challenged the existence of the gender gap in mathematics. In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on No Child Left Behind standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items. This raised questions about whether there is still a gender gap in math achievement. However, a different study published after Hyde&#x27;s using NAEP data from all 50 states found a small mean sex difference in favor of males in grades 4, 8, and 12 that had remained stable through the 1990s and 2000s, as well as a 2:1 male to female ratio at the highest scores.

There is also a large discrepancy between the number of men and women working in STEM fields. Women have been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields. This underrepresentation is evident in the distribution of college majors among men and women; from 1997 to 2007, women earned only 18% of engineering bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

===Degree attainment===
 (Issued August 2003) Educational attainment by race and gender: 2000
 Census 2000 Brief
 Percent of Adults 25 and over in group
 Men . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80.1 52.5 26.1 10.0
 Women. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80.7 51.1 22.8 7.8
 HS = high school completed SC = some college
 BA = bachelor&#x27;s degree AD = advanced degree

According to 2007 data, 55 percent of college students were females and 45 percent were males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent. Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.

In 2014, the percentage of women with bachelor&#x27;s degrees was higher than the percentage of men with bachelor&#x27;s degrees for the first time in America. Women also earn more master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates than men.

===Lifetime earnings===

Although more women are graduating with undergraduate degrees, men are still earning disproportionately more in their lifetimes. This could be due to many factors, including different types of jobs for males and females. Females are greatly underrepresented in science and engineering fields, which are typically correlated with high lifetime earnings. Males and females also have vastly different labor market histories based on type of job and time spent in each job.

===Possible causes===

====Teacher interactions====
How a student interacts with and is evaluated by his or her teachers is closely correlated with that student&#x27;s future academic achievement. According to researcher Thomas Good, there are two competing views of how teachers can indirectly impact the achievement of their students. The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more of and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.

====Teacher evaluations====
How teachers perceive students&#x27; knowledge and abilities varies by gender and influences classroom processes and student achievement in both reading and math. Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect. A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.

Teachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males&#x27; reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected. The opposite trend has been found in math classes. Teachers still tend to view math as a &quot;masculine&quot; subject and tend to have higher expectations for and better attitude towards their male students in these classes.

A study by Fennema et al. has also shown that teachers tend to name males when asked to list their &quot;best math students&quot;. Females are more likely than males to be negatively impacted by this underestimation of their math abilities. These gender-specific evaluations from teachers are implicit; usually the teachers have no idea that they are favoring one gender over the other until they are shown concrete evidence, such as a video recording of their classroom. However, even though the discrimination is implicit, it still has negative effects on both male and female students.

There is conflicting evidence about whether teacher assessments of student performance and ability are consistent with cognitive assessments like standardized tests. Teacher assessment evidence comes from a relatively small number of classrooms when compared to standardized tests, which are administered in every public school in all fifty states.

====Stereotyping====

There is speculation that gender stereotyping within classrooms can also lead to differences in academic achievement and representation for female and male students. Math and science are often perceived as &quot;masculine&quot; subjects because they lead to success in &quot;masculine&quot; fields, such as medicine and engineering. English and history, on the other hand, are often perceived as &quot;feminine&quot; subjects because they are more closely aligned with &quot;feminine&quot; jobs, such as teaching or care work. These stereotypes can influence student achievement in these areas.

Research on stereotype threat has shown that gender stereotypes decrease the mathematical self-esteem of many female students, and that this lack of academic confidence leads to anxiety and poorer performance on math exams.

====Parent socialization====
How a child&#x27;s parents view his or her skills can also contribute to the gender achievement gap in education. A study by Jacobs and Eccles has shown that adults rate female children as having better social skills than male children, and that girls are more likely to be seen as &quot;good children&quot; than boys. These gender-based stereotypes can perpetuate the gender achievement gap in education by influencing parents&#x27; perceptions of their children&#x27;s skills, and these perceptions can influence the types of activities and subjects parents steer their children toward.

==== Socio-economic factors ====
The gender achievement gap, measured by standardized test scores, suspensions, and absences, in favor of female students, is larger at worse schools and among lower-income households. So poverty and school quality are partially responsible for the gap.

==== Self-regulation and conscientiousness ====
Girls tend to have better self-regulation skills than boys. Self-regulation skills correlate with time spent on homework and time spent taking notes in class. This contributes to girls getting better grades than boys in all subjects. See Sex differences in psychology.

==== Biology ====
The idea that one gender is on average inherently, genetically intellectually inferior is controversial and critics of the idea attribute it to historical or contemporary sexism.

Most researchers have argued for no significant sex differences in &quot;g&quot; factor or general intelligence, while others have argued for greater intelligence for males, and others for females. These results depend on the methodology, tests researchers used for their claims, and the personal performances of the participants.

Assuming there are real gender differences in general intelligence, it is difficult to answer the nature versus nurture question—whether any such differences are inherently genetic, or are caused by environmental factors. Differences in gender roles in a particular culture, as well as sexism, can influence a person&#x27;s interests, opportunities, and activities in a way that might increase or decrease intellectual abilities for any particular task. For ethical and practical reasons, it is not generally feasible to perform an experiment that raises children without a gender identity or which randomly assigns a gender identity, to distinguish the effects of socialization from genetics.

Researchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.

The differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.

===Implications===

It is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.

If the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all &quot;masculine&quot; fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as &quot;nerdy&quot; or &quot;geeky&quot;, and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.

Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.

The careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a gender wage gap. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.

===Attempts to reduce the gender gap===

There have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women&#x27;s achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as stereotype threat.

Values affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women&#x27;s achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.

==LGBT achievement gap==

The LGBT achievement gap refers to the difference in academic performance and achievement between LGBT youth and their heterosexual peers. Historically, the circumstance of LGBT youth in education has received little attention from scholars and the media. The term LGBT refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons but often is understood to encompass the sexual minority. Before the turn of the century, little research went into the topic of the LGBT population in schools. However, with the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network&#x27;s (GLSEN) recurring study on school climate in the U.S. for LGBT students, there is now more information indicating the existence of an achievement gap. LGBT students in the U.S. tend to have lower GPAs than their heterosexual peers, as well as higher truancy and dropout rates. There are many supposed causes of this achievement gap, as well as efforts to alleviate the disparity.

In United States secondary schools, LGBT youth often have more difficult experiences compared to their heterosexual peers, leading to observed underachievement, though current data is limited. In Massachusetts, LGBT youth are 12% less likely to make A and B grades than their heterosexual peers. The GLSEN reports that 92.3% of LGBT youth report experienced harassment in 2011, compared to about 25% of the general youth population (as reported by the United States Department of Justice). Among LGBT youth, those who endure more severe harassment report significantly lower GPAs than LGBT youth who endure less harassment (2.9 to 3.2, respectively). Less-harassed LGBT youth are also twice as likely to plan for higher education than their highly victimized peers, indicating a general lack of interest in school among LGBT youth.

Dropping out and absenteeism are also concerns with LGBT youth. According to the National Education Association&#x27;s report on LGBT students, gay and bisexual students are almost twice as likely to consider dropping out as heterosexual students, and transgendered students are even more likely. High instances of dropping out prevent LGBT students from pursuing higher education. Because most studies focus on students enrolled in school and it is hard to find a sample of student youth out of school, an accurate count of LGBT youth who have dropped out of school is hard to obtain. While many LGBT students do not drop out, they often miss school because they feel unsafe. Nationwide, about 50% of students enduring severe verbal harassment, and 70% of students enduring severe physical harassment miss school once a month out of concern for their safety. Studies in Massachusetts schools indicate that LGBT students are up to six times more likely than heterosexual students to miss school. Likewise, students in California who endure harassment &quot;because of actual or perceived sexual orientation&quot; are three times as likely as non-harassed heterosexual students to miss school, meaning even heterosexual students harassed for suspected sexual orientation endure some of these problems.

Despite such evidence of negative experiences, some LGBT find positive benefits in coming out. Students who are out, while receiving increased harassment from homophobic peers, have lower instances of depression and a greater sense of belonging, a phenomenon well documented in other LGBT studies as well.

Though popular belief attributes homosexuality to higher education levels, more current studies suggest otherwise, at least among women. An extensive nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that, among women, LGBT identity is inversely related to education level, meaning that for every progressive education level, the percentage of women identifying as LGBT steadily decreases. For instance, while 6.7% of women with no high school diploma identify as lesbian, bisexual, or something else, only 2.9% of women with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher identify that way. The same study showed no statistically significant correlation between LGBT identity and education for men. Studies on LGBT students in college show that LGBT students, while not enduring the same harassment and struggles as LGBT youth in high schools, still have different experiences than their heterosexual peers, sometimes for the better: gay men in college have significantly higher GPAs and are more involved in extra-curricular activities than their heterosexual peers. A study has in fact found a positive correlation between educational attainment and homosexuality and non-exclusive heterosexuality among men. In the study, gay men were significantly less likely to fail to graduate from high school compared to completely heterosexual men (3.94% vs. 9.91%) and were more likely to complete college (43.86% vs. 26.46%). Additionally, about 52% of gay men age 25 and older hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree, which is higher than the national average. Joel Mittleman, a sociologist from the University of Notre Dame finds that gay men tend to value studying over activities like video games or sports that heterosexual men typically enjoy. Mittleman states that gay men consistently perform better than straight men regardless of race, but the same cannot be said for lesbian women—black gay women perform much worse than their white counterparts. Lesbian and bisexual women, however, report being much less satisfied with their education than heterosexual women in college.

=== Causes ===

There are many possible explanations for the LGBT achievement gap. With extensive studies into the personal experiences of LGBT youth by the GLSEN, the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and other organizations, some issues relevant to LGBT youth stand out as affecting academic outcomes.

The most highly documented and widely studied cause of underachievement by LGBT students is the problem of bullying in schools. Out of students of any sexual identity who feel unsafe at school, 60% feel so because of their sexual orientation. More specifically, a bully&#x27;s perception of a student&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender-nonconformity—not necessarily the individual&#x27;s actual sexual identity—leads to bullying. Because of this, a gender-nonconforming yet heterosexual student could experience some of the same academic outcomes attributed to the LGBT students. 33% of LGBT students nationwide have skipped school at least once in a single month for personal safety, and these students who have missed school are three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who have not missed school.

In addition to their schooling experience, LGBT youth often have negative home environments. LGBT youth have a very unique situation in that the may not find any support from their family. Upon coming out to their parents, 50% of LGBT teens met a negative reaction. Two studies indicate that approximately 30% of LGBT youth encountered physical violence and 26% were kicked out of the house. This risk is higher for transgender teens. Because of these negative home environments, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, based on studies in Seattle, estimates that 40% of all homeless youth in the United States are LGBT, compared to roughly 3.5% of the general population. In addition to these homeless youths&#x27; higher risk for sexual violence, drug abuse, and prostitution, all of which would affect performance (or general attendance) in school, these youth may not be able to enroll in school at all. Some public schools are either reluctant to or ignorant about enrolling homeless students, significantly thwarting a teen&#x27;s pursuit of educational opportunities.

===Proposed solutions===

Government-based as well as independent organizations focusing on education or LGBT issues have proposed solutions to improving the experiences of LGBT youth in schools. One such solution is the inclusion of LGBT-related subjects in a school&#x27;s curriculum, shown to improve LGBT youths&#x27; performance in school. When surveyed, school personnel in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota ranked lesson plans as the top need in addressing LGBT concerns. The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States proposes including LGBT curriculum in school health and sex education classes. Their proposed curriculum would aim to teach students, over the course of their K–12 education, to understand sexual orientation as well as gender roles, and treat others with respect, among other key concepts. However, many states in the U.S. including Alabama, Texas, Arizona, and others, have laws explicitly prohibiting the inclusion of homosexuality in education. Alabama and Texas laws even require teachers to refrain from presenting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Significant opposition to changing these statutes exist in these states, preventing the inclusion of LGBT curriculum.

The NEA recommends the inclusion of specific school policies protecting LGBT from harassment and bullying. LGBT students in Massachusetts who attend schools with safety policies explicitly regarding LGBT students are 3.5 times more likely to make A and B grades than LGBT youth in other schools. Additionally, student organizations such as gay-straight alliances (GSAs) can improve the experience of LGBT youth in schools. Even when LGBT students do not participate in their school&#x27;s GSA, the very presence of the organization can reduce threat and injury of LGBT students by one-third, and reduce LGBT suicide attempts by almost 50%. LGBT students in Massachusetts schools with GSAs were twice as likely to earn A and B grades than LGBT students in schools without GSAs.

== Immigrant and native-born gap ==
Educational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. No matter which race is examined, immigrants of that race outperform natives of the same race. For example, Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S. report having higher levels of education than any other group. Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States. They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English. This trend was first reported in the 1990s by the &quot;Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot;, and still continues today.

According to data from the 2000 United States Census, &quot;43.8 percent of African immigrants had achieved a college degree, compared with 42.5 of Asian Americans, 28.9 percent of immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole.&quot; The educational attainment amount varies by group. According to the U.S. Census, out of the African populations, Nigerians reported to having the highest level of education.

== Religion ==

The amount of education completed varies greatly between members of religions in the United States. Hindus and Jews, for example, are more likely than general population to have completed a college education, whereas members of Evangelical churches, historically Black Protestant churches and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness are less likely (21%, 15% and 12% respectively).

US religions ranked by percentage reporting a college degree:

<text>The 1904 Canadian federal election was held on November 3, 1904 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 10th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier led the Liberal Party of Canada to a third term in government, with an increased majority, and over half of the popular vote.

Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s Conservatives and Liberal-Conservatives were unable to challenge the Liberals effectively, and lost a small portion of their popular vote, along with four seats, including his own. Borden re-entered parliament the next year in a by-election.

This was the last election until 1949 in which parts of the Northwest Territories were granted representation in the House of Commons. During this parliament, most of the settled region of the NWT was hived off the NWT as the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan on 1 September 1905, although the NWT MPs continued to sit as representatives of their old ridings until the 10th Parliament&#x27;s dissolution.

One of the key issues in the election was Imperial Preference.

<text>Peter Morville is president of Semantic Studios, an information architecture and findability consulting firm. He may be best known as an influential figure and &quot;founding father&quot; of information architecture, having coauthored the best-selling book in the discipline, &quot;Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&quot;. For over a decade, he has advised such clients as AT&amp;T, Dow Chemical, Ford, the IMF, the Library of Congress, and Microsoft. Morville was a co-founder and past president of the Information Architecture Institute, and has served on their advisory board. He delivers keynotes and seminars at international events, and his work has been featured in major publications, including &quot;Business Week&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Biography==
Peter Morville was born in Manchester, England. He holds a graduate degree in Library and Information Science, having graduated from the University of Michigan School of Information in 1993. He has since served on their faculty and received an Alumni Achievement Award for his work in information science.

In the 1990s, together with Louis Rosenfeld, he headed Argus Associates, the consulting firm which supported one of the precursors of the Information Architecture Institute, the Argus Center for Information Architecture. The company began in January 1994 as a full-solution web design business, but Morville and Rosenfeld decided to specialize by applying principles of library science to solve issues of grouping and labeling on the early Web. The two dubbed their work &quot;information architecture,&quot; although they did not mean it in the sense of Richard Saul Wurman&#x27;s use of the term, who according to Morville, &quot;focused on the presentation and layout of information on a two-dimensional page. We focused on the structure and organization of sites.&quot; Argus worked with clients such as AT&amp;T, Borders Books and Music, and Microsoft.

In 1998, Morville and Rosenfeld co-authored &quot;Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&quot;, which was published by O&#x27;Reilly Media in 1998. This book, known as the &quot;Polar Bear book&quot; because of the Polar Bear on its cover, became a bestseller and was awarded Amazon.com&#x27;s &quot;best computer book of 1998.&quot; It has been described as the &quot;seminal&quot; book on information architecture. The book sparked enough of a growth in interest in information architecture that two years later, the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T) helped organize the first annual Information Architecture Summit.

Along with Christina Wodtke, Rosenfeld, and a number of other information architects, Morville co-founded the Information Architecture Institute in 2002 and subsequently served as its president. He has been an independent consultant since 2001 through his company Semantic Studios, which focuses on information architecture and user experience for a wide range of clients.

In 2024, Peter founded Sentient Sanctuary, a nonprofit think tank and animal sanctuary, and wrote a philosophical IA novel, &quot;Animals Are People&quot;. He blogs at intertwingled.org.

<doc id="1040233" wikidata="Q1067079" url="?curid=1040233" title="2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)">
<text>Listed below are the dates and results for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds for Africa. 51 teams took part (only Comoros and Djibouti did not enter), competing for 5 World Cup places.

==Format==
The qualification composed of two rounds. Nine teams entered the competition directly in the second round: the five teams that qualified for the 2002 World Cup Finals (Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia) and the four highest-ranking teams in the 25 June 2003 FIFA world rankings (Congo DR, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Egypt, and Morocco). The other 42 teams were paired to play knock-out matches home and away. The 21 winners would advance to the second round.

In the second round, the 30 teams were divided into five groups of six teams each. Teams in each group would play home and away against each other. The team with most points in each group would qualify to the World Cup.

The competition also constituted the qualification competition for the 2006 African Nations Cup with the top three nations of each group qualifying (except for Egypt, which qualifies as the host nation, the fourth nation in Egypt&#x27;s group qualifying in Egypt&#x27;s place).

The African qualifying zone saw four out of five finals places going to World Cup debutants (Angola, Togo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Ghana). Nigeria missed out on a fourth consecutive finals appearance while Cameroon did not reach their fifth consecutive finals.

The African zone also featured a group of death — Group 3, which brought together Africa&#x27;s most frequent World Cup qualifier Cameroon with the two eventual finalists of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations: Egypt and the Ivory Coast.

<text>Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003) is a two-disc compilation album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on November 16, 2004 through Epic Records. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States. It was reissued in 2013 as The Essential Pearl Jam.

==Overview==
The compilation debuted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 96,000 copies in its first week of release. &quot;rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003)&quot; has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

The album&#x27;s two discs are both devoted to different sides of the band&#x27;s catalogue: the first disc, or &quot;Up Side&quot;, contains heavier rock songs while the second disc or &quot;Down Side&quot; consists of slower songs and ballads. Both discs are in chronological order, with the exception of the last song on the &quot;Down Side&quot;, regular show closer &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;.

The tracks &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;Black&quot; were remixed by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. Pearl Jam&#x27;s version of the Victoria Williams song &quot;Crazy Mary&quot; was supposed to appear on disc two, but was replaced with &quot;Man of the Hour&quot; before release. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam&#x27;s contractual agreement with Epic Records.

AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars. He said that the album &quot;does an expert job not only of capturing the moment when Pearl Jam were monstrously popular, but proving that they still turned out good music even when they were fading from the spotlight. Unlike most career-spanning, multi-disc retrospectives, &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; does not emphasize latter-day albums in order to achieve a sense of balance that&#x27;s inherently phony.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Christian Hoard gave the album four out of five stars, saying, &quot;Pearl Jam have spent much of this decade courting devotees with a series of live bootlegs, so &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; is a welcome concession to casual fans, rounding out the hits with concert staples and non-album cuts. The rockers on the &quot;Up Side&quot; disc sum up the band&#x27;s continually evolving relationship with effects pedals and emotional catharsis; the slower &quot;Down Side&quot; disc offers gold sounds that are long on big choruses and well-worn sincerity.&quot;

<text>The Cray-3 was a vector supercomputer, Seymour Cray&#x27;s designated successor to the Cray-2. The system was one of the first major applications of gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors in computing, using hundreds of custom built ICs packed into a CPU. The design goal was performance around 16 GFLOPS, about 12 times that of the Cray-2.

Work started on the Cray-3 in 1988 at Cray Research&#x27;s (CRI) development labs in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Other teams at the lab were working on designs with similar performance. To focus the teams, the Cray-3 effort was moved to a new lab in Colorado Springs, Colorado later that year. Shortly thereafter, the corporate headquarters in Minneapolis decided to end work on the Cray-3 in favor of another design, the Cray C90. In 1989 the Cray-3 effort was spun off to a newly formed company, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC).

The launch customer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, cancelled their order in 1991 and a number of company executives left shortly thereafter. The first machine was finally ready in 1993, but with no launch customer, it was instead loaned as a demonstration unit to the nearby National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. The company went bankrupt in May 1995, and the machine was officially decommissioned.

With the delivery of the first Cray-3, Seymour Cray immediately moved on to the similar-but-improved Cray-4 design, but the company went bankrupt before it was completely tested. The Cray-3 was Cray&#x27;s last completed design; with CCC&#x27;s bankruptcy, he formed SRC Computers to concentrate on parallel designs, but died in a car accident in 1996 before this work was delivered.

== History ==

===Background===
Seymour Cray began the design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray generally set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would be needed to meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.

Cray had always attacked the problem of increased speed with three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components to allow for a higher clock speed. Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components that were already in widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.

For the Cray-2, he introduced a novel 3D-packaging system for its integrated circuits to allow higher densities, and it appeared that there was some room for improvement in this process. For the new design, he stated that all wires would be limited to a maximum length of . This would demand the processor be able to fit into a block, about that of the Cray-2 CPU. This would not only increase performance but make the system 27 times smaller.

For a 12x performance increase, the packaging alone would not be enough, the circuits on the chips themselves would also have to speed up. The Cray-2 appeared to be pushing the limits of the speed of silicon-based transistors at 4.1 ns (244 MHz), and it did not appear that anything more than another 2x would be possible. If the goal of 12x was to be met, more radical changes would be needed, and a &quot;high tech&quot; approach would have to be used.

Cray had intended to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was not up to the task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided it was the only way forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.

Describing the system in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times performance increase would be made up of a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due to the use of more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.

===Development===
The Cray-3 was originally slated for delivery in 1991. This was during a time when the supercomputer market was rapidly shrinking from 50% annual growth in 1980, to 10% in 1988. At the same time, Cray Research was also working on the Y-MP, a faster multi-processor version of the system architecture tracing its ancestry to the original Cray-1. In order to focus the Y-MP and Cray-3 groups, and with Cray&#x27;s personal support, the Cray-3 project moved to a new research center in Colorado Springs.

By 1989, the Y-MP was starting deliveries, and the main CRI lab in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, moved on to the C90, a further improvement in the Y-MP series. With only 25 Cray-2s sold, management decided that the Cray-3 should be put on &quot;low priority&quot; development. In November 1988, the Colorado Springs lab was spun off as Cray Computer Corporation (CCC), with CRI retaining 10% of the new company&#x27;s stock and providing an $85 million promissory note to fund development. Cray himself was not a shareholder in the new company, and worked under contract. As CRI retained the lease on the original building, the new company had to move once again, introducing further delays.

By 1991, development was behind schedule. Development slowed even more when Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory cancelled its order for the first machine, in favor of the C90. Several executives, including the CEO, left the company. The company then announced they would be looking for a customer that needed a smaller version of the machine, with four to eight processors.

The first (and only) production model (serial number S5, named &quot;Graywolf&quot;) was loaned to NCAR as a demonstration system in May 1993. NCAR&#x27;s version was configured with 4 processors and a 128 MWord (64-bit words, 1 GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was also discovered that the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, one of the four CPUs was not running reliably.

CCC declared bankruptcy in March 1995, after spending about $300 million of financing. NCAR&#x27;s machine was officially decommissioned the next day. Seven system cabinets, or &quot;tanks&quot;, serial numbers S1 to S7, were built for Cray-3 machines. Most were for smaller two-CPU machines. Three of the smaller tanks were used on the Cray-4 project, essentially a Cray-3 with 64 faster CPUs running at 1 ns (1 GHz) and packed into an even smaller space. Another was used for the Cray-3/SSS project.

The failure of the Cray-3 was in large part due to the changing political and technical climate. The machine was being designed during the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and ending of the Cold War, which led to a massive downsizing in supercomputer purchases. At the same time, the market was increasingly investing in massively parallel (MP or MPP) designs. Cray was critical of this approach, and was quoted by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as saying that MPP systems had not yet proven their supremacy over vector computers, noting the difficulty many users have had programming for large parallel machines. &quot;I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever be universally successful, at least not in my lifetime&quot;.

==Architecture==

===Logical design===
The Cray-3 system architecture comprised a &quot;foreground processing system&quot;, up to 16 &quot;background processors&quot; and up to 2 gigawords (16 GB) of &quot;common memory&quot;. The foreground system was dedicated to input/output and system management. It included a 32-bit processor and four synchronous data channels for mass storage and network devices, primarily via HiPPI channels.

Each background processor consisted of a &quot;computation section&quot;, a &quot;control section&quot; and &quot;local memory&quot;. The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic. The control section provided instruction buffers, memory management functions, and a real-time clock. 16 kwords (128 kbytes) of high-speed local memory was incorporated into each background processor for use as temporary scratch memory.

Common memory consisted of silicon CMOS SRAM, organized into &quot;octants&quot; of 64 banks each, with up to eight octants possible. The word size was 64-bits plus eight error-correction bits, and total memory bandwidth was rated at 128 gigabytes per second.

===CPU design===
As with previous designs, the core of the Cray-3 consisted of a number of modules, each containing several circuit boards packed with parts. In order to increase density, the individual GaAs chips were not packaged, and instead several were mounted directly with ultrasonic gold bonding to a board approximately square. The boards were then turned over and mated to a second board carrying the electrical wiring, with wires on this card running through holes to the &quot;bottom&quot; (opposite the chips) side of the chip carrier where they were bonded, hence sandwiching the chip between the two layers of board. These &quot;submodules&quot; were then stacked four-deep and, as in the Cray-2, wired to each other to make a 3D circuit.

Unlike the Cray-2, the Cray-3 modules also included edge connectors. Sixteen such submodules were connected together in a 4×4 array to make a single module measuring . Even with this advanced packaging the circuit density was low even by 1990s standards, at about 96,000 gates per cubic inch. Modern CPUs offer gate counts of millions per square inch, and the move to 3D circuits was still just being considered .

Thirty-two such modules were then stacked and wired together with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a single processor. The basic cycle time was 2.11 ns, or 474 MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. Key to the high performance was the high-speed access to main memory, which allowed each process to burst up to 8 GB/s.

===Mechanical design===
The modules were held together in an aluminum chassis known as a &quot;brick&quot;. The bricks were immersed in liquid fluorinert for cooling, as in the Cray-2. A four-processor system with 64 memory modules dissipated about 88 kW of power. The entire four-processor system was about tall and front-to-back, and a little over wide.

For systems with up to four processors, the processor assembly sat under a translucent bronzed acrylic cover at the top of a cabinet wide, deep and high, with the memory below it, and then the power supplies and cooling systems on the bottom. Eight and 16-processors system would have been housed in a larger octagonal cabinet. All in all, the Cray-3 was considerably smaller than the Cray-2, itself relatively small compared to other supercomputers.

In addition to the system cabinet, a Cray-3 system also needed one or two (depending on number of processors) &quot;system control pods&quot; (or &quot;C-Pods&quot;), square and high, containing power and cooling control equipment.

===System configurations===
The following possible Cray-3 configurations were officially specified:

===Software===

The Cray-3 ran the Colorado Springs Operating System (&quot;CSOS&quot;) which was based upon Cray Research&#x27;s UNICOS operating system version 5.0.
A major difference between CSOS and UNICOS was that CSOS was ported to standard C with all PCC extensions that were used in UNICOS removed.

Much of the software available under the Cray-3 was derived from Cray Research and included for instance the X Window System, vectorizing FORTRAN and C compilers, NFS and a TCP/IP stack.

<doc id="1040255" wikidata="Q5354684" url="?curid=1040255" title="Elections in Georgia (U.S. state)">
<text>Elections in [[Georgia (US State)|Georgia]] are held to fill various state and federal seats. Regular elections are held every even year. The positions being decided each year varies, as the terms of office varies. The State Senate, State House and U.S. House will typically be up for election, as all of those positions have two-year terms. Special elections are held to fill vacated offices. Georgia is one of seven states that require a run-off election if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in a primary election and one of only two states (the other being Mississippi) that require a run-off election for state and congressional offices if no candidate wins a majority of the vote in a general election; Louisiana has a similar requirement, but it operates under a different election system.

In a 2018 ranking of U.S. states by perceived electoral integrity (PEI), Georgia ranked 51st among all U.S. states and District of Columbia. While all other states&#x27; perceived electoral integrity was valued at very high, high or moderate, Georgia was the only state in the rankings to be designated as a state with low perceived electoral integrity. It scored 49 out of 100 in the 2018 PEI index, getting lowest marks in voting boundaries (18 out of 100) and the highest in Party and candidate registration (67 out of 100). In the 2020 PEI index, Georgia&#x27;s score had risen from 49 to 74. 

A 2020 study ranked Georgia as the second most difficult state for citizens to vote in, primarily for a reduction of polling stations by 50 percent or more since 2012 in parts of the state. 

==History==

















Following the end of martial law and readmission to the Union during Reconstruction, Georgia was overwhelmingly dominated by the Democratic Party for a hundred years, as were many other states of the Confederacy. White voters often perceived the Republican Party as the party of the North standing for Yankee values, growing industrialisation, and an excessively powerful and interfering federal government, all arrayed against their localized agricultural society. The abolition of slavery by amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the legacy of an economy damaged by war and social upheaval led many to bitterly oppose a wide variety of national policies.

Elections to the U.S. Congress during this period saw almost exclusively Democratic senators and either totally or almost-totally Democratic House rule. From 1872 to 2002, Georgia voters consistently elected Democrats as governor and Democratic majorities to the state legislature. Like many other Southern states, the Democratic-controlled legislature established run-off elections for primaries in which no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote. In addition, the Democratic primaries were further defined by their usage of the white primary to exclude African Americans and other ethnicities from participation, as well as the usage of the county unit system from 1898 to 1963 to allocate votes to winners along rural-biased lines.

Historically, elections at all levels of government in the U.S. state of Georgia were dominated by conservative white Democrats in the period between Reconstruction and the end of the New Deal Coalition. For decades, Republicans were a tiny minority, generally associated with Union military victory at the end of the Civil War. Indeed, for several years, the Republicans did not even field a candidate for governor or any other statewide elected office.

Beginning in the 1950s, the credible enforcement of new laws inspired by the Civil Rights Movement began to steadily erode the preponderance of Democrats in elective office in Georgia. The repeal of Jim Crow laws allowed previously disenfranchised African Americans to vote in elections and be active in politics. As many of these people joined with some white Democrats to work for more immediate liberal and pluralistic policies, a growing number of conservative white Democrats who supported either gradual change or none at all either began splitting their tickets at the national level or switching outright to the GOP. The strong showing in Georgia by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1956 presidential race proved to be a turning point. Georgia would remain competitive at the national level for most of the rest of the 20th century. the Republican Party appeared positioned to gain even more ground in the coming years. The Democratic Party did not carry the state from the 1960 election until Jimmy Carter ran for the White House 16 years later.

=== Modern times and the shift to Republican control ===
Beginning with Barry Goldwater&#x27;s presidential bid in 1964, the Republican Party began making inroads in Georgia. The state swung over dramatically to support Goldwater—the first time it had gone Republican in a presidential election in American history. In time, the Republican Party of Georgia would field competitive candidates and win races for seats in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans also began making gains at the state level, mostly in the Atlanta suburbs. However, conservative Democrats continued to hold most offices at the local level well into the 1990s.

In presidential races, Georgia has given its electoral college votes to the Republican candidate all but five times since 1964: in 1968, segregationist George Wallace won a plurality of Georgia&#x27;s votes on the American Independent Party ticket; former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter won his home state by landslide margins in 1976 and 1980 (sweeping every county in the state in 1976); then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won a plurality of votes in 1992 against incumbent Republican George H. W. Bush and Independent Ross Perot; and former Delaware Senator and Vice-President Joe Biden won a plurality of votes in 2020 against incumbent Republican Donald Trump. Republican George W. Bush won Georgia by double digits in 2000 and 2004, with 54.67% and 57.97%, respectively, of the vote, making him the only Republican presidential candidate to carry Georgia twice. In 2008, John McCain won the state by a narrower margin of only 5 points, winning 52% to Democrat Barack Obama&#x27;s 47%. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the state with 53% to Obama&#x27;s 45%. In 2016, Donald Trump won the state with 51% to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 46%.

By 2007, conservative Republicans had become the dominant force in state elections, with Republicans holding the offices of governor and lieutenant governor and significant majorities in both houses of the state General Assembly.

As in many states, Democratic strongholds in Georgia include urban and minority-dominated areas. Democrats typically fare well in cities such as Atlanta (and its suburbs such as Gwinnett County), Macon, and Columbus, which have large minority populations, as well as Athens, home of the University of Georgia. The Republican Party dominates state elections through its hold on rural south Georgia, with a very notable exception in the southwestern part of the state; the Appalachian north; and many of Atlanta&#x27;s further suburbs and exurbs. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, co-author of the Contract with America and architect of the 1994 &quot;Republican Revolution,&quot; represented a district in Cobb County, a suburban Atlanta county which has since flipped to supporting Democratic candidates since 2016.

A feature of Georgia elections is the requirement for 50%-plus-one majorities in general and primary elections, triggering runoff elections if no candidate receives a majority. From 1898 to 1962, the Democratic Party used a combination of the white primary and the county unit system to ensure that only white rural voters&#x27; preferences were reflected in the de facto election of political offices across the state, although the white primary was abolished in the federal case &quot;King v. Chapman&quot; (1945). After the county unit system was struck down by the Supreme Court case &quot;Gray v. Sanders&quot; (accompanied by the election of Carl Sanders, who became the first Democrat to be nominated for governor by popular vote since the establishment of the county unit system), the General Assembly passed a bill to switch future Georgia elections to runoff voting. The bill was introduced and sponsored by Macon legislator Denmark Groover, who proposed that runoff voting &quot;would again provide protection which … was removed with the death of the county unit system&quot; and warned that &quot;[W]e have got to go the majority vote because all we have to have is a plurality and the Negroes and the pressure groups and special interests are going to manipulate this State and take charge.&quot;

However, the following ascendance of the Republican Party culminated in the 1992 defeat of incumbent Wyche Fowler by Republican Paul Coverdell by runoff, despite Fowler leading the first round by a plurality. This led the Georgia Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, to change the state&#x27;s laws requiring a run-off election only if the winning candidate received less than 45% of the vote. In the 1996 Senate election, the winner, Democrat Max Cleland won with only 48.9% (1.4% ahead of Republican Guy Millner) thus avoiding a run-off. In 2005 after Republicans took control of the legislature, the run-off requirement was changed back to 50%, in the same bill which implemented a requirement for Voter ID.

===Current status===
The current Governor of Georgia is Brian Kemp, who was elected as a Republican in 2018. The Lieutenant Governor is Burt Jones. Other elected state executive officials include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Attorney General Chris Carr, Commissioner of Insurance Jim Beck, and Superintendent of Schools Richard Woods.

The Georgia General Assembly has been controlled by the Republicans since 2004. They have majorities over the Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives by margins of 33 to 23 and 101 to 78 respectively as of 2023. In congressional elections. The state also sends 14 members to the U.S. House of Representatives.

In 2020, Democrats won both Senate seats and the 2020 Presidential election. The state voted for Joe Biden for president‚ and senators Jon Ossoff, the state&#x27;s first Jewish senator, and Raphael Warnock, the state&#x27;s first Black senator. The win was due in part to the increased turnout in African-American voters due to the work of Stacey Abrams and LaTosha Brown. In 2024, Donald Trump flipped Georgia back into the Republican column winning it by 2.2%.

== Election rules ==

=== In-person voting ===

In Louisville, Georgia, in October 2018, Black senior citizens were told to get off a bus that was to have taken them to a polling place for early voting. The bus trip was supposed to have been part of the &quot;South Rising&quot; bus tour sponsored by the advocacy group Black Voters Matter. A clerk of the local Jefferson County Commission allegedly called the intended voters&#x27; senior center to claim that the bus tour constituted &quot;political activity,&quot; which is barred at events sponsored by the county. LaTosha Brown, one of the founders of Black Voters Matter, described the trip&#x27;s prevention as a clear-cut case of &quot;...voter intimidation. This is voter suppression, Southern style.&quot; The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund sent a letter to the county calling for an &quot;immediate investigation&quot; into the incident, which it condemned as, &quot;an unacceptable act of voter intimidation,&quot; that &quot;potentially violates several laws.&quot;

Georgia made efforts to correct voting problems that had occurred in the 2018 election. In the 2020 statewide primary, however, many irregularities were reported, including missing machines at polling places and mail-in ballots that never arrived at voters&#x27; houses. 

=== Voter ID ===

Since 2006, only public university and college students can use their student ID to vote.

=== Voter roll management ===
Georgia&#x27;s Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, was the official in charge of determining whether or not voters were allowed to vote in the November 2018 election and has been accused of voter suppression. Minority voters are statistically more likely to have names that contain hyphens, suffixes or other punctuation that can make it more difficult to match their name in databases, experts noted, and are more likely to have their voter applications suspended by Kemp&#x27;s office. Barry C. Burden, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of its Elections Research Center said, &quot;An unrealistic rule of this sort will falsely flag many legitimate registration forms. Moreover, the evidence indicates that minority residents are more likely to be flagged than are whites.&quot; Kemp has suspended the applications of 53,000 voters, a majority of whom are minorities. Strict voter registration deadlines in Georgia prevented 87,000 Georgians from voting because they had registered after the deadline. &quot;Even if everyone who is on a pending list is eventually allowed to vote, it places more hurdles in the way of those voters on the list, who are disproportionately black and Hispanic,&quot; said professor Charles Stewart III in 2018.

Georgia has a law prohibiting felons on probation for crimes involving moral turpitude from voting or registering to vote, with a similar law in Alabama having been criticized by the United States Supreme Court in 471 U.S. 222 (1985) as having roots in white supremacy.

The ACLU of Georgia released a report in 2020 arguing that 200,000 voters were unlawfully removed from voter rolls, which accounted for 63.3% of all voters who were removed.

After 2020, the State Legislature allowed citizens to submit an unlimited number of challenges to people&#x27;s voter registration. The mass challenges that followed have overwhelmed some election workers around Georgia who are forced to respond to every request even when many of the challenges to voters would have been removed anyway through standard list maintenance.

On July 29, 2024 the state added another way to cancel a voter&#x27;s registration through an online portal, which has drawn criticism from groups like Fair Fight Action worried that it would be abused to unregister lawful voters. By August 5, cybersecurity researcher Jason Parker discovered a vulnerability in Georgia’s voter cancellation portal that allowed users to bypass the requirement for a driver’s license number, enabling the submission of voter registration cancellations with minimal, publicly available information. The discovery drew attention to weaknesses in the system and the importance of continued efforts to secure election infrastructure.

=== Election worker protections ===
As a result of lies about the reliability of the 2020 elections, election workers have faced threats to their safety which have required new measures to try and protect the civil servants. Some of the protections in Georgia include signs on the wall warning about suspicious packages, the requirement to wear gloves when opening the mail, new trainings by the Department of Homeland security on &quot;spoofing&quot; and &quot;swatting&quot;, and trainings on deescalation tactics should a potentially violent election denier enter a polling place.

=== Election certification ===
In 2021, the State of Georgia changed the rules (Senate Bill 202) around who can serve on election boards to make it easier for the state to replace board members as a part of a Republican effort to take control of election administration nationwide.

In August 2024, the Georgia State Elections Board enacted two new rules that could deputize local election officials more discretion on whether they certify the election, contrary to state and national precedent. The Democratic party has filed a lawsuit to stop the new rules from taking effect, and it was blocked by a judge on October 16. According to a September 2024 &quot;New York Times&quot; newsletter, Georgia seems the most likely state to overturn election results on unfounded claims of fraud in 2024 due to recent changes in who oversees elections.

In September 2024, the Board of Elections made controversial rule changes including around hand-counting the number of ballots cast over the objections of most state election officials. The rule was blocked by a judge on October 15.

<text>Alexandra Pauline &quot;Sasha&quot; Cohen (born October 26, 1984) is a retired American figure skater. She is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World Championship medalist, the 2003 Grand Prix Final Champion, and the 2006 U.S. Champion. She is known for her artistry, flexibility and body lines, and musical interpretation. , Cohen is the most recent American woman to medal individually in figure skating at the Olympics.

== Early life ==
Cohen was born in Westwood, California, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Her nickname &quot;Sasha&quot; is a Russian diminutive of &quot;Alexandra&quot;. Her mother, Galina Cohen (née Feldman), is a Jewish immigrant from Odesa, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union and a former ballet dancer. Her father, Roger Cohen, is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law and formerly a law partner at Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison. Cohen has a younger sister, Natalia (nicknamed &quot;Natasha&quot;). She understands and can speak Russian, but refuses to speak it in public.

Cohen graduated from Futures High School in Mission Viejo, California in 2002. Cohen graduated from Columbia University in 2016 with a degree in political science. As a university student, she has used the name Alex rather than Sasha.

In 2005, Cohen published her autobiography, &quot;Fire on Ice&quot;. The autobiography was republished in 2006 with a new chapter on the 2006 season.

==Skating career==
===Early career===
A gymnast from an early age, Cohen switched to figure skating when she was seven years old, but it wasn&#x27;t until she was eleven that she began to take the sport seriously. One of her early skating coaches was Victor Yelchin, father of late actor Anton Yelchin.

Cohen rose to prominence in the skating community during the 2000 U.S. Championships. Just up from juniors, Cohen was first in the short program and finished second overall after the free skate, provisionally qualifying for the senior World team. A loophole in the ISU&#x27;s age rules at the time would have allowed her to compete at the senior World Championships if she medaled at the World Junior Championships but she finished 6th at the junior event.

===Senior development===

Cohen did not compete at the 2001 U.S. Nationals due to a stress fracture in her back. She resumed full training in June 2001. Cohen won the silver medal at the 2002 U.S. Championships, earning her a trip to the Olympics. Cohen competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, finishing 4th. She also finished 4th at the 2002 World Championships, held in Nagano. Cohen was coached by John Nicks in California.

In the summer of 2002, Cohen moved to the East Coast to train with Tatiana Tarasova at the International Skating Center of Connecticut in Simsbury, Connecticut. She won her first ISU Grand Prix event at the 2002 Skate Canada and then won the 2002 Trophée Lalique. She won the silver medal at the 2002 Cup of Russia. These three placements earned her a spot to the 2002–03 Grand Prix Final, where she became the champion. At the 2003 U.S. championships she won the bronze medal, and at the 2003 World Championships, held in Washington, D.C., Cohen placed 4th, repeating her placement in the previous season.
Her best season was 2003–04, when she took gold at the 2003 Skate America, at the 2003 Skate Canada (setting a world record in the short program) and at the 2003 Trophée Lalique and won silver at the 2003–04 Grand Prix Final. In late December 2003, she changed coaches and began training with Robin Wagner in Hackensack, New Jersey. She placed second at both the 2004 U.S. Championships and the 2004 World Championships, getting a medal at Worlds for the first time in her career.

In the 2004–05 season, Cohen withdrew from her Grand Prix events due to a recurring back injury. In late December 2004, Cohen decided to return to California and train again with her first coach John Nicks. She placed 2nd at the 2005 U.S. Championships in Portland and the 2005 World Championships in Moscow, Russia.

===2006 Olympic season===
Cohen started her Olympic season by placing first at the Campbell&#x27;s International Figure Skating Challenge. Soon after she withdrew from Skate America due to a hip injury. She took second place at Trophée Eric Bompard, where she fell on a triple salchow during her free skate. In 2006, Cohen overcame the flu to capture her first U.S. championship. With this victory Cohen automatically secured her place on the U.S. Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics, a spot made official on January 14 of that year by the United States Figure Skating Association.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Cohen was in first after the short program, leading Russia&#x27;s Irina Slutskaya by a mere .03 points. In the final free skate, Cohen fell on her first jump, a triple lutz, and had her hands down on her second jump, the triple flip. She completed the rest of her elements, including five triples. Cohen finished with an Olympic silver medal, 7.98 points behind gold medalist Shizuka Arakawa of Japan.

A month later at the 2006 World Championships in Calgary, Canada, Cohen was in first place after the short program. Completing only one jump combination and falling on the triple salchow, she placed fourth in the free skate and won the bronze medal, finishing almost ten points behind her teammate, gold medalist Kimmie Meissner.

===Champions on Ice and hiatus===

In April 2006, Cohen started the Champions on Ice tour, participated in the second annual &quot;Skating with the Stars, Under the Stars&quot; gala in Central Park and performed in the Marshalls U.S. Figure Skating International Showcase. On April 15, 2006, Cohen announced that she intended to compete in the 2010 season and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She said via her official website, &quot;I will decide after the COI Tour how much skating and what events I will do next season.&quot;

In December 2006, Cohen announced that she needed &quot;a little downtime from competing&quot; and that she would not defend her U.S. Figure Skating Championship title in 2007. She said that her &quot;major goals&quot; were the 2009 World Championships and the 2010 Olympics; &quot;I know I want to be in Vancouver for the 2010 Olympics.&quot;

Cohen did not compete in 2007, 2008, or 2009, although she did not give up her Olympic eligibility. She performed in exhibitions, including the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting and USFSA-approved events. She was a headliner in the 2007–08 and 2008–09 Stars on Ice tour.

===Return to competition===
Cohen announced on May 6, 2009, that she planned to make a comeback for the 2010 Winter Olympics. She said she would train with Rafael Arutyunyan. Cohen received invitations to compete in the 2009 Trophée Eric Bompard and in the 2009 Skate America in the 2009–10 Grand Prix series but withdrew from both due to tendinitis in her right calf. In November 2009, she changed coaches to John Nicks, who worked closer to where she lived.

On January 21, 2010, Cohen competed for the first time in four years at the 2010 U.S. Championships in Spokane, Washington. She debuted her program to España cañí, and skated a strong performance landing a triple lutz-double toe, a triple flip, a double Axel, along with her signature spiral sequence and spins earning 69.63 points putting her in second place, just 0.43 from first-place finisher Mirai Nagasu. In her free skate, set to Moonlight Sonata, she fell on a triple flip and had two-footed landings on a number of other jumps. She finished fourth in the championships, behind Rachael Flatt, Mirai Nagasu and Ashley Wagner, and was not selected for the Olympic team, rather appointed as second alternate to the 2010 U.S. Olympic team and the 2010 World Championship team. She retired from figure skating in 2010.

==Halls of Fame==
In 2015, Cohen was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. The next January 22, U.S. Figure Skating made her part of the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame Class of 2016.

==Skating trademarks==
Cohen is the first skater to receive +3s for spirals under the International Skating Union Judging System (IJS) for &quot;Grade of Execution (GOE)&quot;, and was also the first female skater to break the +130 barrier on a free skate under the IJS. At the beginning of her senior career she was labeled as one in the generation of &quot;Baby Ballerinas&quot; (alongside Naomi Nari Nam) due to her body lines and the ability to point her toes during difficult skating maneuvers such as triple jumps, spiral sequences and footwork. She is known for her 180º arabesque penchée spiral and Charlotte spiral, as well as the variety of positions in her spins. She popularized the I-spin position, which is sometimes informally referred to as the &quot;Sasha spin&quot;, due to her exceptional execution of the move.

==Ice shows==
Cohen has participated in the ice show Stars On Ice for several years, as well as starring in the 2010 Art On Ice alongside Stéphane Lambiel. She joined 2010 Olympic ladies champion Yuna Kim in the All That Skate ice show, scheduled for July 23–25, 2010 in Goyang, South Korea, alongside other skaters including Michelle Kwan, Stéphane Lambiel and Brian Joubert.

==Television and film==
Cohen has appeared, as herself and as an actress playing a role, in commercials, television episodes, documentaries and feature films.

===Television===
Cohen has done commercials for Citizen Watch, Simply Saline, and Got Milk?. She appeared in Episode 7 of the second season of &quot;Project Runway&quot; wherein designers were challenged to design a skating dress for her. The winning dress (by Zulema Griffin) did not fit and the dress had to be resized. Cohen made a brief appearance guest starring as herself on the May 5, 2006 episode of the NBC drama, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In April 2008, she appeared as a contortionist on the premiere episode of &quot;Secret Talents of the Stars&quot; and advanced to the semifinals, although the show was cancelled before she could perform again. She made a guest appearance as an ice skater in &quot;&quot; season 3 episode 12 &quot;Silent Night&quot;. Cohen also participated in the 2013 edition of &quot;Tornado Week&quot; on The Weather Channel, helping break the myth that small tornadoes are not as destructive by demonstrating a tight spin.

===Film===
Cohen played Fiona Hughes, Moondance Alexander&#x27;s archenemy, in the Don Johnson movie &quot;Moondance Alexander&quot;. At the 2006 Academy Awards, Cohen served as a guest correspondent for &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. This experience led to an encounter with Ben Stiller and a discussion about having a part in a future comedy about figure skating, which Cohen said she would enjoy. In 2007, she appeared as herself in &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;. Later that year, she also had a role in &quot;&quot;. In 2017, Cohen appeared as herself in the SyFy TV movie, &quot;Sharknado 5&quot;.

Cohen was featured in &quot;The Weight of Gold&quot; (2020), an HBO Sports Documentary which &quot;explor(es) the mental health challenges that Olympic athletes often face.&quot;

==Personal life==
On July 5, 2015, it was announced that Cohen was engaged to hedge fund manager Tom May. On August 20, 2016, the couple married in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In February 2018, she and May were living apart and going through divorce proceedings. Cohen now works as an associate at Morgan Stanley.

<doc id="1040268" wikidata="Q1354184" url="?curid=1040268" title="Wakanohana Masaru">
<text>is a Japanese former professional sumo wrestler. As an active wrestler he was known as , and his rise through the ranks alongside his younger brother Takanohana Kōji saw a boom in sumo&#x27;s popularity in the early 1990s. He is the elder son of the former &quot;ōzeki&quot; Takanohana Kenshi, who was also his stablemaster, and the nephew of Wakanohana Kanji I, a famous &quot;yokozuna&quot; of the 1950s. Wakanohana was a long serving &quot;ōzeki&quot; who won five tournament championships, and eventually joined his brother at &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank in 1998, creating the first ever sibling grand champions. After a brief and injury plagued &quot;yokozuna&quot; career he retired in 2000, becoming a television personality and restaurant owner. The death of his father in 2005 saw a very public falling out with his brother.

==Sumo career==

===Early career===

He entered sumo in March 1988, at the same time as his younger brother Takanohana, and joined his father&#x27;s training stable, then known as Fujishima stable. The two brothers moved out of the family quarters and joined all the other new recruits in the communal area, and were instructed to refer to their father as &quot;oyakata&quot; (coach) only. Future rivals Akebono and Kaiō made their professional debuts in the same month. In the early part of his career he wrestled under the name , being given his uncle&#x27;s fighting name a few tournaments prior to his promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;. Wakanohana means &quot;young flower&quot; in Japanese.

He entered the top division for the first time in September 1990, alongside Akebono and Takatōriki. He first reached a &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; rank in November 1991 when he was promoted to &quot;komusubi&quot;. In January 1992 he defeated Asahifuji in what was to be the &quot;yokozuna&quot;″s last ever bout, to earn the second of his two &quot;kinboshi&quot; or gold stars. Lacking his brother&#x27;s weight and strength, he took longer to rise up the ranks, still being a &quot;maegashira&quot; wrestler as late as January 1993, the tournament that Takanohana earned promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;. However in the following tournament Wakanohana won his first top division championship or &quot;yūshō&quot; with a 14–1 record. After a 10–5 in May 1993 and runner-up honours in July, he joined his brother at &quot;ōzeki&quot;, the first time that two brothers had held the rank simultaneously. His second tournament title came in November 1995, when he defeated Takanohana (by then a &quot;yokozuna&quot;) in a playoff. This was to be the only time he fought his brother in a competitive match. Wakanohana was injured in the next tournament however, and the same thing happened after his third championship in January 1997. On that occasion he missed two tournaments and only just preserved his &quot;ōzeki&quot; status with a bare majority of wins upon his return in July 1997. He was a tournament runner-up on five occasions at &quot;ōzeki&quot;, four of those coming in 1996. Due to the dominance of Futagoyama stable (which Fujishima stable was absorbed into in 1993), he was excused from having to fight several top wrestlers including Takanonami, Takatōriki and Akinoshima.

===&quot;Yokozuna&quot;===

Wakanohana finally earned promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot; in 1998 after winning two consecutive championships in March and May of that year. He had spent 29 tournaments at &quot;ōzeki&quot; before reaching the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank, the third longest wait ever. He and Takanohana became the first pair of brothers to become &quot;yokozuna&quot;. However his time at sumo&#x27;s highest rank was brief and injury plagued, and he was unable to add to his tally of championship wins. The best result he had as a &quot;yokozuna&quot; was in January 1999 when he came into the final day of the tournament as leader on 13–1. However he was defeated by Chiyotaikai and, in the subsequent playoff between them for the championship, he lost a rematch after the first bout was deemed by the judges to be too close to call, despite many observers feeling Wakanohana had clearly won the match. He was unable to complete the next three tournaments due to a leg sprain, and then his refusal to withdraw from his comeback tournament in September 1999 despite suffering a torn thigh muscle on the tenth day ensured that he became only the second &quot;yokozuna&quot; ever to finish a 15-day tournament with more losses than wins (the other &quot;yokozuna&quot; to suffer this fate was Ōnokuni, exactly ten years previously). He resolved to continue wrestling after consulting with his father, and was also supported by the head of the Japan Sumo Association, the former Yutakayama Katsuo, who said he saw no reason for retirement as his poor record was directly caused by injury.

After sitting out the next two tournaments Wakanohana returned in March 2000, even though he was not fully recovered from his injury, with most observers expecting him to wait until May. After losing three of his first five bouts he announced his retirement from sumo. He had been at sumo&#x27;s top rank for only 11 tournaments, withdrawing from or missing six of them, and at 29 years of age, he was the sixth youngest &quot;yokozuna&quot; to retire. It was noted by a member of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council that had he not been promoted he would have been remembered as a fine &quot;ōzeki&quot; like his father, rather than as a disappointing &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

===Fighting style===
Wakanohana was noted for his wide range of techniques, winning the prestigious Technique prize on six occasions. His favourite grip on his opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot; was &quot;hidari-yotsu&quot;, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning &quot;kimarite&quot; was &quot;yorikiri&quot;, or force out, followed by &quot;oshidashi&quot; or push out. Together these two techniques accounted for almost fifty percent of his career victories. He had knowledge of a wide range of throwing moves, such as &quot;uwatenage&quot; (overarm throw), &quot;shitatenage&quot; (underarm throw), &quot;sukuinage&quot; (scoop throw) and &quot;kubinage&quot; (neck throw), as well as extremely rare techniques such as &quot;amiuchi&quot; (the fisherman&#x27;s throw), &quot;kawazugake&quot; (hooking backward counter throw) and &quot;susoharai&quot; (rear footsweep).

==After sumo==
After a brief spell as a member (or elder) of the Japan Sumo Association, he eventually left sumo completely and has worked as an entertainer in Japan, as well as trying to enter the professional world of American football. On March 23, 2002, Hanada signed with the Arizona Rattlers. Wakanohana owned and operated a chain of &quot;chanko nabe&quot; (literally &quot;meal pot&quot;, the staple food of sumo wrestlers) restaurants in Japan called &quot;Chanko Dining Waka&quot;. On May 6, 2010, it was announced in the news that the &quot;Chanko Dining Waka&quot; chain was filing for bankruptcy, citing debts of over 147 million yen.

Wakanohana published his autobiography, in 2000. He wrote of his constant fear during his career that he could be badly injured in a bout, and revealed that he never slept well during tournaments.

It was announced in October 2007, he was divorcing his wife Mieko, whom he married in June 1994 and with whom he had four children. He has since remarried and has another child with his new wife.

In 2011, Hanada started spelling his name professionally.

He stepped onto the &quot;dohyō&quot; at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan for the first time since his retirement in 2000 when he attended the 2018 Hakuhō Cup, an amateur sumo event for children.

In 2019 he appeared on Abema as a sumo commentator. This was his first work in sumo broadcasting in 15 years, having last appeared on NHK in 2004.

==Relationship with Takanohana==
At the time of the death of their father on May 30, 2005, a bitter rift between Wakanohana and Takanohana was widely reported in the Japanese media. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Takanohana was very critical of both his brother and his mother: his attacks on his brother (Wakanohana) relating to the struggle between them to control their father&#x27;s funeral rites; the attacks on his mother condemning her for her extramarital affair (which led to her divorce from Futagoyama, and had only been rumored up to that point). There had been some speculation that all of this was related to who would control their father&#x27;s estate. However, Wakanohana forfeited claim to the estate not long after his father&#x27;s funeral.

<doc id="1040285" wikidata="Q2145220" url="?curid=1040285" title="Huld">
<text>In Scandinavian mythology, Huld is only referenced by &quot;völva&quot; or &quot;seiðkona&quot;, that is a woman who practiced the seiðr. She is mentioned in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Sturlunga saga&quot; and a late medieval Icelandic tale. In the latter source, she is Odin&#x27;s mistress and the mother of the demi-goddesses Þorgerðr and Irpa. As her name suggests, Huld may be in origin the same being as the Hulder and the German Holda.

==Attestations==
In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; it is related that she was first hired to kill the Swedish king Vanlade, by his wife Drífa. She &quot;hag-rode&quot; him to death. 

Snorri also quoted some lines from &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; composed in the 9th century:

Later she was hired by Vanlade&#x27;s grandchildren to kill his son Visbur.

It is said in &quot;Sturlunga saga&quot; that Sturla Þórðarson entertained King Magnús lagabœtir with a story about Huld in 1263, which he told &quot;better and more cleverly than any of those present had heard before&quot; (&quot;betr ok fróðligar en nokkurr þeira hafði fyrr heyrt, er þar váru&quot;). According to Sturlunga saga, the story was about a great troll-woman and was well received by the king&#x27;s followers and by the queen; it took a good part of the day to tell.

<doc id="1040286" wikidata="Q217094" url="?curid=1040286" title="List of withdrawn drugs">
<text>Drugs or medicines may be withdrawn from commercial markets because of risks to patients, but also because of commercial reasons (e.g. lack of demand and relatively high production costs). Where risks or harms is the reason for withdrawal, this will usually have been prompted by unexpected adverse effects that were not detected during Phase III clinical trials, i.e. they were only made apparent from postmarketing surveillance data collected from the wider community over longer periods of time.

This list is not limited to drugs that were ever approved by the FDA. Some of them (lumiracoxib, rimonabant, tolrestat, ximelagatran and ximelidine, for example) were approved to be marketed in Europe but had not yet been approved for marketing in the US, when side effects became clear and their developers pulled them from the market. Some drugs in this list (e.g. LSD) were never approved for marketing in the US or Europe.

<text>Trevor Butler is a TV personality, best known for being a contestant and winner of &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; series 4 (airing in 2004). He known for being the first, and currently only, contestant to win the million-dollar prize, as opposed to previous seasons when the prize money was $250,000. The amount is also the highest amount of prize money awarded in Australian game show history, making Butler one of the highest paid Australian TV personalities.

Butler also boosted interest in the final eviction night by proposing to his then-girlfriend Breea Forrest live on the eviction stage.

There was some controversy regarding how much of his winnings could be claimed as tax. At one point the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) considered it to be payment for spending the time in the house, and therefore wanted to take nearly half of the winnings away. The ATO eventually gave in and did not take the money.

Butler returned as a contestant for &quot;Big Brother 14&quot; alongside other previous contestants.

==Biography==

Butler was born in on the Pacific Island nation of Fiji, and lived most of his life in Broken Hill, New South Wales, before appearing in &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Butler was one of seven celebrities to feature in a television program named &quot;Celebrity Overhaul&quot;. The program aired in February and March 2005. All five episodes won the highest audience numbers for the Sunday 6:30 p.m. timeslot. Butler lost 15 kg.

Butler appeared in episode 6 of Summer Heights High as a special guest on &quot;Polynesian Cultural Appreciation Day&quot;.

Butler currently works for the Gold Coast Radio Station 102.9 Hot Tomato.

Butler and his wife Breea, live in Tweed Heads in far north New South Wales. On 11 October 2007, Breea gave birth to their first child, a boy named Maika Jeremy Butler. On 31 December 2010, Breea gave birth to their second son, Creedance Heath Butler.

Known as Big Trev, he works on the &quot;Drive Home Show&quot; alongside Moyra Major on Hot Tomato.

In 2022, Trevor returned for &quot;Big Brother 14&quot; as one of eight returning housemates. Butler was one of three former winners to enter the house, alongside &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; winner Regina Bird and &quot;Big Brother 10&quot; winner Tim Dorner. He was the sixth housemate to be evicted, finishing in 16th place.

<text>Clive Finkelstein (born ca. 1939 died 9/12/2021) is an Australian computer scientist, known as the &quot;Father&quot; of information engineering methodology.

== Life and work ==
In 1961 Finkelstein received his Bachelor of Science from the University of New South Wales in Sydney. After graduation Finkelstein started working in the field of database processing for IBM in Australia and in the USA. Back in Australia in 1976 he founded the IT consultancy firm Infocom Australia.

In 1972 Finkelstein was elected Fellow of the Australian Computer Society. Finkelstein was a distinguished member of the International Advisory Board of the Data Administration Management Association (DAMA International), with John Zachman. In 2008 he was awarded a position in the Pearcey Hall of Fame of the ACS in Australia.

From 1976 to 1980 Finkelstein developed the concept of information technology engineering, based on original work carried out by him to bridge from strategic business planning to information systems. He wrote the first publication on information technology engineering: a series of six in-depth articles by the same name published by US Computerworld in May - June 1981. He also co-authored with James Martin the influential Savant Institute Report titled: &quot;Information Engineering&quot;, published in Nov 1981. He also wrote a monthly column, &quot;The Enterprise&quot; for DM Review magazine.

Finkelstein died from Parkinsons Disease in September 2021 (per phone call with Jill Finkelstein)

<text>William H. Inmon (born 1945) is an American computer scientist, recognized by many as the father of the data warehouse. Inmon wrote the first book, held the first conference (with Arnie Barnett), wrote the first column in a magazine and was the first to offer classes in data warehousing. Inmon created the accepted definition of what a data warehouse is - a subject oriented, nonvolatile, integrated, time variant collection of data in support of management&#x27;s decisions. Compared with the approach of the other pioneering architect of data warehousing, Ralph Kimball, Inmon&#x27;s approach is often characterized as a top-down approach.

== Biography ==
William H. Inmon was born July 20, 1945, in San Diego, California. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1967, and his Master of Science degree in computer science from New Mexico State University.

He worked for American Management Systems and Coopers &amp; Lybrand before 1991, when he founded the company Prism Solutions, which he took public. In 1995 he founded Pine Cone Systems, which was renamed Ambeo later on. In 1999, he created a corporate information factory web site for his consulting business. 

Inmon coined terms such as the government information factory, as well as data warehousing 2.0. Inmon promotes building, usage, and maintenance of data warehouses and related topics. His books include &quot;Building the Data Warehouse&quot; (1992, with later editions) and &quot;DW 2.0: The Architecture for the Next Generation of Data Warehousing&quot; (2008).

In July 2007, Inmon was named by Computerworld as one of the ten people that most influenced the first 40 years of the computer industry.

Inmon&#x27;s association with data warehousing stems from the fact that he wrote the first book on data warehousing he held the first conference on data warehousing (with Arnie Barnett), he wrote the first column in a magazine on data warehousing, he has written over 1,000 articles on data warehousing in journals and newsletters, he created the first fold out wall chart for data warehousing and he conducted the first classes on data warehousing. 

In 2012, Inmon developed and made public technology known as &quot;textual disambiguation&quot;. Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of TextualETL.

Inmon owns and operates Forest Rim Technology, a company that applies and implements data warehousing solutions executed through textual disambiguation and TextualETL.

== Awards ==
*(2002) DAMA International Professional Achievement Award for, &quot;major contributions as the &#x27;father of data warehousing&#x27; and a recognized thought leader in decision support&quot; from DAMA International, The Global Data Management Community. 
*(2018) Received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Data Modelling Zone. 
*(December 2020) Received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Project Management Institute (PMI).

== Publications ==
Bill Inmon has published more than 60 books in nine languages and 2,000 articles on data warehousing and data management.

<text>The Black Banner Organisation (Arabic: تنظيم الراية السودة, &quot;Tandhīm Al Rāyah Al Sawdāh&quot;) was an Iraqi guerrilla organization that battled multinational troops in Iraq. The organization&#x27;s ideology was believed to be radical Sunni Islamism. 

==Organization==
Black Banners has been identified as the armed battalion of the Secret Islamic Army. The group&#x27;s leader has been identified as Omar (variant: Umar) Hadid al-Falluji, an Iraqi who is believed to have international militant Islamist links. Some U.S. and Iraqi officials believe Hadid was close to Jordanian terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose al-Qaida-linked movement allegedly used Fallujah as a headquarters. A large share of its membership is believed to be composed of non-Iraqi fighters, especially from Syria. 

This group was an active member of the Iraqi insurgency, sharing joint control of Falluja with other militant groups, where it imposed strict Sharia law, and was responsible for a number of kidnappings. This included the abduction of three Indians, two Kenyans, and an Egyptian working for a Kuwaiti company operating in Iraq in 2004. The aim was to compel the company to stop its activities in Iraq. The hostages were later released.

==Attacks against==

Coalition military officials believe that a campaign of airstrikes against insurgent safehouses and positions in Fallujah seriously disrupted the network of the Black Banner Organization. Omar Hadid is said to have narrowly avoided capture by U.S. forces twice.

<text>Matthew and Son is the debut studio album by British singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, released in March 1967.

==Overview==
Stevens began writing songs during his early teenage years. His earliest influences included the sound of early British bands, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, influenced by popular American rhythm and blues. At the same time, folk influences from artists such as Bob Dylan and Simon &amp; Garfunkel left a strong mark on him, along with some of the musicals being performed so close to his childhood home in Soho that he could often hear them drifting through his room. Stevens&#x27;s older brother, David Gordon, attracted the attention of music producer Mike Hurst, formerly of the Springfields, in the hope of finding a producer interested in his younger brother&#x27;s music. After a demo was recorded, a deal was struck between the two. The album was not released until 1967; however, recording began on 10 July 1966, with a few advance singles appearing around that time.

== Advance singles ==
Although the album was not released until 1967, the first advance single, &quot;I Love My Dog&quot;, was released in 1966. It was initially recorded only by Stevens&#x27; guitars, piano and vocals. Hurst, however, encouraged Stevens to add a staccato and tympani–and–viola arrangement. Session bassist John Paul Jones played on the first singles two years before becoming a member of Led Zeppelin. The lyrics for the B-side of the first single, &quot;Portobello Road&quot;, were written by Kim Fowley, who encouraged Stevens to compose a melody for the song. The single initially reached No. 28 on the UK charts, followed by &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;, the next single and title track, which went to No. 2 on the UK charts, making Stevens into a popular and clean-cut teenage crooner.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Matthew and Son&quot; was released in 1967, eventually reaching No. 7 in the UK. The album track &quot;Here Comes My Baby&quot; was initially recorded and released by the Tremeloes, and was a hit, reaching No. 4 in the UK. &quot;I&#x27;ve Found a Love&quot; was covered by British singer David Garrick but failed to chart, while Stevens&#x27;s own &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Get Me a Gun&quot; reached No. 6.

&quot;Here Comes My Baby&quot; was used in the Wes Anderson film &quot;Rushmore&quot;.

Music critic Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; later called &quot;Matthew and Son&quot; &quot;a rarity: a forgotten record that shouldn&#x27;t be&quot;, and said that both its title track and &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; were &quot;two rock songs we should have heard more of in 1967&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and said that &quot;it&#x27;s very distant from the sound that Stevens was ultimately known for, and in many ways, it&#x27;s more dated than what he did for Island/A&amp;M, but it&#x27;s much more self-consciously accessible, arranged in different styles&quot;.

== Track listing ==
&quot;Portobello Road&quot; and &quot;Come On and Dance&quot; were omitted from original US LPs.

<doc id="1040324" wikidata="Q5393149" url="?curid=1040324" title="Ernest Gowers">
<text>Sir Ernest Arthur Gowers (; 2 June 1880 – 16 April 1966) was a British civil servant and author who is best remembered for his book &quot;Plain Words,&quot; first published in 1948, and his revision of Fowler&#x27;s classic &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;. Before making his name as an author, he had a long career in the Civil Service, which he entered in 1903. His final full-time appointment was as Senior Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence, London Region (1940–45). After the Second World War, he was appointed chairman of numerous government inquiries, including the 1949 Royal Commission into Capital Punishment. He was also chairman of the Harlow New Town Development Corporation.

== Education and early life ==
Gowers was born in London, the younger son of the neurologist Sir William Gowers and his wife, Mary, (daughter of Frederick Baines, one of the proprietors of the&quot; Leeds Mercury&quot;). The family lived in Queen Anne Street, W1. Ernest followed his elder brother, William Frederick Gowers (1875–1954), to Rugby School, where he excelled academically and in sport. At Rugby, Ernest was also noted as an outstanding organist, an accomplishment that became a lifelong hobby. Both boys won scholarships to read Classics at Cambridge--(William to Trinity College, Cambridge and Ernest to Clare College, Cambridge). Their sisters, Edith and Evelyn, mainly schooled at home, both lost their sight after developing Retinitis pigmentosa in early adult life.

In 1905 Gowers married Constance Greer, daughter of Thomas Macgregor Greer (member of the Senate of Northern Ireland, and a Deputy-Lieutenant for Co. Antrim). They had two daughters and one son. Gowers&#x27;s elder brother, William, went to Africa, joined the colonial civil service and rose to become Governor of Uganda (1925–32) and Senior Crown Agent for the Colonies (1932–38).

==Career==
===Civil service career===
In 1902 Gowers graduated from Cambridge with a First in the Classical Tripos and attended Wren&#x27;s, a civil service crammer in London, to study for the highly competitive Civil Service Examination. He also sat for the Inner Temple Bar exam, which he passed in 1906. In December 1903 he passed the Civil Service Examination, and embarked on the career that led to the claim that he &quot;may be regarded as one of the greatest public servants of his day.&quot;

Gowers entered the home civil service as an upper division clerk in the Department of Inland Revenue. He moved to the India Office in September 1904, and from March 1907 to October 1911, he was private secretary to successive Parliamentary Under-Secretaries for India, most notably Edwin Montagu. In October 1911 he was promoted to HM Treasury as private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, at a time when Lloyd George was introducing his controversial National Insurance Bill. In November 1912 Lloyd George appointed him to the National Health Insurance Commission, as one of a team of promising young civil servants (including John Anderson, Warren Fisher, Arthur Salter, and Claud Schuster) nicknamed the &quot;Loan Collection&quot; as they had been hand-picked from across the civil service. Gowers wrote later, &quot;This gigantic task of bringing the National Health and Unemployment Insurance Acts into operation taught the Service what it could do, and the control of the whole of the social and economic life of the nation during the war drove home the lesson.&quot; The members of the loan collection were deployed to other departments during the First World War. While nominally continuing to hold his post, Gowers was attached to the Foreign Office working under Charles Masterman MP at Wellington House, Britain&#x27;s top-secret wartime propaganda unit.

===Grappling with the coal industry===
In 1917 Gowers was appointed secretary of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for government employees. In 1919 he began a 25-year involvement with the coal industry, joining the Board of Trade as director of production in the mines department. The following year he was promoted to head the department as permanent under-secretary for mines, a position he retained throughout the Miners&#x27; Strike. In 1927 he became chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue.

In 1930 Gowers was appointed chair of the newly established Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission, set up under the Coal Mines Act of 1930, in an attempt to improve the efficiency of British coal mines, but deficiencies in the Act soon became evident. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Sir Ernest Gowers and his colleagues struggled manfully with their difficulties, but Parliament had inadvertently tied their hands behind their backs.&quot; A new and more powerful body, the Coal Commission, was set up in 1938, with Gowers as chairman. In July 1942 all unmined coal in Britain ceased to be the property of the colliery owners and was vested in the Coal Commission.

=== Senior Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence, London Region ===

Throughout the 1930s Gowers and his colleagues had also been involved in preparing for possible war, and invasion. From 1935 onwards he combined his frustrating work with the coal industry with civil defence planning, attached to the Department for the Co-ordination of Defence. John Anderson was given control of civil defence planning in 1938 and set up a network of civil defence regions. Euan Wallace MP was appointed head of London Region, but ill-health forced him to retire in 1940. Gowers, his deputy, became Senior Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence in London, running civil defence through the Blitz from a concrete bunker underneath the Natural History Museum, with Harold Scott and Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Evans as his deputies.

The prime minister, Winston Churchill, told Gowers, &quot;If communication with the Government becomes very difficult or impossible, it may be necessary for you to act on behalf of the Government… without consultation with ministers.&quot; Churchill promised that in such an event Gowers would have the Government&#x27;s backing. In a biographical sketch of Gowers, his great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers comments that this potentially gave him direct responsibility for governing seven million people, though at the time he wrote of himself as &quot;but a transient and embarrassed phantom flitting across the stage of history.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of Gowers, &quot;In this post he showed his full powers as an administrator, and indeed as a leader. Energetic, forceful, always cheerful, with an unfailing eye for the essential, he gave the impression of being master of every unexpected development and, as a result, infused confidence into all who came in contact with him.&quot; His wife became a member of the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service and ran the Gordon Services Club, a hostel for soldiers on leave in London.

===Post-war reconstruction===
After the war Gowers was appointed chairman of the Harlow New Town Development Corporation, one of several new towns being built to provide housing for people displaced by wartime bombing, but he fell foul of the bureaucracy in the Ministry for Town and Country Planning and his three-year contract was not renewed. He was told that he was too old. This did not prevent his being invited to chair a series of committees of inquiry on Women in the Foreign Service (1945); Closing Hours of Shops (1946); Houses of Outstanding Historic or Architectural Interest (1948); and Foot-and-mouth Disease (1952).

In 1949 Gowers was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1949–53), set up by the Attlee government in an attempt to defuse the long-term political debate over capital punishment, but the terms of reference did not include provision for recommending its abolition. He was profoundly affected by the evidence presented to the commission and said later that what he learned as chairman of the commission converted him from vague support of capital punishment to strong opposition. As a result, he wrote &quot;A Life for a Life? The Problem of Capital Punishment&quot; (1956), of which H L A Hart wrote, &quot;Certainly the publication of this report in England introduced altogether new standards of clarity and relevance into discussions of a subject which had too often been obscured by ignorance and prejudice.&quot; The political debate dragged on and it was not until 1965 that capital punishment was effectively abolished in England.

===&quot;Plain Words&quot; and &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;===
Gowers first went into print on the subject of bureaucratic English usage, in 1929. in an article entitled &quot;Mainly About the King&#x27;s English&quot;, and he continued this crusade throughout his career. After the Second World War, Sir Edward Bridges, head of the home civil service, invited him to write a pamphlet on English usage for use in civil service training courses.

 The resulting &quot;Plain Words&quot;, a work 94 pages long, became an instant success, not only within the civil service but internationally. It was published in April 1948 and by Christmas of that year, it was in its eighth impression, with more than 150,000 copies sold. It was followed by the &quot;ABC of Plain Words&quot; (1951), and the two books were combined in 1954 and published by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office as &quot;The Complete Plain Words.&quot; This was revised in 1973 by Sir Bruce Fraser, and then in 1986 by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut. In March 2014, a new revision, by Gowers&#x27;s great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers, was published by Penguin Books.

In 1956, at the age of 76, Gowers accepted a commission from the Oxford University Press to undertake the first revision of HWFowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;, which had been in print since 1926 with only very minor changes. It took Gowers nine years to complete the task. In 1996, Gowers&#x27; edition was succeeded by a more radical revision, edited by Robert Burchfield.

Gowers bought a house in Sussex in the 1930s and lived there permanently after the war, writing books and managing a small farm. He became chairman of the board of the hospital where his father had worked, the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases (now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery), Queen Square, London, and was on the board of Le Court Cheshire Home near Petersfield.

Gowers died in April 1966, at King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, Sussex, age 85, nine months after his revision of Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; was published.

===Honours and awards===
Gowers was appointed CB in 1917, Chevalier of the Order of the Crown of Belgium in 1918, KBE in 1926, KCB in 1928, GBE in 1945, and GCB in 1953. He was Gentleman Usher of the Purple Rod of the Order of the British Empire, 1952–60. He was a Freeman of Royal Borough of the Kingston-on-Thames.

Gowers received an honorary doctorate from Manchester University, was an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and an honorary Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was elected president of the English Association (1956–57).

==Personal life==
Ernest Gowers and Constance (Kit) had three children and six grandchildren, for whom they always offered an open house in the school holidays. When Kit died in 1952, one of their daughters, the oboist Peggy Shiffner, gave up her career and moved in to look after him, also working as a volunteer at Le Court. The composer Patrick Gowers was his grandson, and the mathematician Sir Timothy Gowers is his great-grandson.

<text>USS &quot;E-1&quot; (SS-24) was an E-class submarine of the United States Navy. Originally named Skipjack, the boat was launched on 27 May 1911 by the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. D. R. Battles; renamed &quot;E-1&quot; on 17 November 1911; and commissioned on 14 February 1912, Lieutenant Chester W. Nimitz in command. She was the first American submarine to be powered by diesel engines.

==Service history==
Six days after commissioning, &quot;E-1&quot; sailed from Boston for Norfolk via Newport and New York. Off the Virginia Capes, she underwent tests through April. Her engines were overhauled at New London, and she began operations off southern New England. On 28 September, she arrived at New York Navy Yard for alterations, repairs, and installation of a Sperry gyrocompass, for which she became a pioneer underwater test ship. She also experimented with submerged radio transmission.

&quot;E-1&quot; conducted tests of these and other important developments under the direction of Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, Lieutenant (and future Fleet Admiral) Chester W. Nimitz. Throughout his career, Nimitz played a progressive and leading role in the incorporation into the Navy of the vast scientific and technological developments of this century, many of them pioneered by the Navy. Nimitz&#x27;s appreciation of the capabilities of submarines contributed to them becoming a decisive factor under his command in the War in the Pacific during World War II.

On 14 October &quot;E-1&quot; proudly passed in review with the fleet in the North River before Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer.

&quot;E-1&quot; continued important experimental development and training with the Atlantic Fleet for the next five years. In 1916 she became the first American submarine to cross the Atlantic. This was in response to the crossing of the Atlantic by the German submarines and earlier that year.

On 4 December 1917, when she left Newport for the Azores and different duty. From 12 January 1918, she patrolled between Ponta Delgada and Horta, protecting the islands from German attack and use as a haven by U-boats. She returned to New London on 17 September. After overhaul, &quot;E-1&quot; trained new submariners and tested experimental listening gear.

Placed in commission in reserve on 20 March 1920, &quot;E-1&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 22 April. There she was placed in commission in ordinary on 18 July 1921, and on 17 September sailed for Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 20 October and sold on 19 April 1922.

<doc id="1040340" wikidata="Q497844" url="?curid=1040340" title="Marmaray">
<text>Marmaray () is a commuter rail line located in Istanbul, Turkey. The line runs from Halkalı, on the European side, to Gebze, on the Asian side, along the north shore of the Sea of Marmara. Mostly using the right-of-way of two existing commuter rail lines, the Marmaray line linked the two lines via a tunnel under the Bosporus strait, becoming the first standard gauge rail connection between Europe and Asia (all prior connections ran through Russia and used the incompatible Russian broad gauge). The two existing sections of the line were rebuilt and expanded from two tracks to three tracks, to allow for higher capacity with intercity and freight rail. The name &quot;Marmaray&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;Marmara&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, which is Turkish for &quot;rail&quot;.

== History ==
Construction started in 2004 and was originally intended to be completed by April 2009. After multiple delays caused – among other things – by the discovery of historical and archaeological sites along the route as new stations were built, the first phase of the project was finally opened by president Erdoğan on October 29, 2013. The second phase of the project was scheduled to open in 2015 but work once again stopped in 2014. It was restarted in February 2017 and the line finally opened in its entirety on March 12, 2019. The trains came with completely new rolling stock, with carriages that can be walked through from end to end.

The line can carry 75,000 passengers per hour in each direction (PPHPD). Travel time from Halkali to Gebze normally takes 104 minutes.

The Marmaray is integrated with other parts of the Istanbul public transport network, including the Metro and the Metrobus network, via a number of interchanges. It is also integrated with the YHT high-speed train network to Ankara, Eskişehir and Konya, as well as with the international trains to Sofia in Bulgaria which depart from Halkalı.

==Project==
The project involved building a tunnel under the Bosphorus and upgrading of existing suburban railway lines to create a high-capacity passenger line between Halkalı and Gebze, along with the provision of 440 electric multiple unit carriages.

=== First phase ===
The contract for the project was awarded to a Japanese-Turkish consortium led by Taisei Corporation in July 2004. The consortium included Gama Endustri Tesisleri Imalat ve Montaj and Nurol Construction.

The Bosphorus (Istanbul Strait) is crossed by a earthquake-proofed immersed tube, assembled from 11 sections – eight are long, two are , and one element is . Each section weighs up to 18,000 tons. The tube was placed below sea level, beneath of water and of earth. It is accessed via tunnels bored from Kazlıçeşme on the European side and Ayrılıkçeşmesi on the Asian side of Istanbul and represents the world&#x27;s deepest undersea immersed tube tunnel. Fire-resistant concrete developed in Norway was essential for the safety of the project.

Construction started in May 2004 and the Marmaray tunnel was completed on September 23, 2008, with a formal ceremony to mark its completion on October 13.

=== Second phase ===
The second phase of the project involved the renewal of the old suburban railway that ran between Halkalı and Kazlıçeşme on the European side of Istanbul and between Ayrılıkçeşmesi and Gebze on the Asian side. The work was meant to be completed at the same time as the first phase (the tunnel and underground sections), but was delayed until March, 2019.

A third line was added to enable the electric multiple unit (EMU) cars and other railway carriages to move separately. Thirty-six above-ground stations along the line were rebuilt or completely refurbished. Signalling was also modernised to allow trains to travel as close as two minutes apart (although in reality far fewer trains than that actually run).

The suburban-rail upgrade part of the project, known originally as CR1, was first awarded to the AMD Rail Consortium, comprising Marubeni of Japan, Dogus Insaat of Turkey and Alstom of France. However, they were unable to complete the work and it was re-tendered as contract CR3 in early 2011. The replacement contract worth €932.8 million was awarded to a joint venture between OHL and Invensys Rail.

=== Freight ===
In February 2010, &quot;Railway Gazette International&quot; reported that the tunnel&#x27;s administrators were hiring consultants to analyse options for carrying freight traffic. The Prime Minister and other officials have suggested that the Marmaray will help to create a modern &quot;Iron Silk Road&quot; by allowing freight trains to travel between Europe and China. Freight trains that are not carrying dangerous goods will be able to use the tunnel when commuter services are not operating (between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.). At other times only passenger trains will be in the tunnels.

=== Financing ===
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the European Investment Bank (EBI) provided much of the financing for the project. By April 2006, the JICA had lent 111 billion yen and the EIB 1.05 billion euro for the work. The original cost was estimated at $4.5 billion although it finally cost almost twice that.

== Rolling stock ==
The Marmaray uses TCDD E32000 rolling stock manufactured by Hyundai Rotem in ten- and five-car EMU configurations. The original contract called for 440 vehicles to be produced locally by Eurotem, Hyundai Rotem&#x27;s joint venture with Turkish rolling stock manufacturer TÜVASAŞ. Hyundai Rotem was chosen ahead of Alstom, CAF, and a consortium of Bombardier, Siemens, and Nurol.

There are two depot and maintenance yards on the line (one at each end) where the sets are stocked.
== Archaeological discoveries during work on the Marmaray ==
The project was delayed by four years, largely due to the discovery of Byzantine-era and other 8,000-year-old archaeological finds on the proposed site of the European tunnel terminal at Yenikapı in 2005. Excavations then produced evidence of the city&#x27;s largest harbour, the 4th-century Harbour of Eleutherios (originally known as the Harbour of Theodosius). Archaeologists also uncovered traces of the city wall of Constantine the Great, and the remains of several ships, including what appears to be the only ancient or early medieval galley ever discovered, preventing the project from proceeding as planned. In addition, archaeologists uncovered the oldest evidence of settlement in Istanbul, with artefacts, including amphorae, pottery fragments, shells, pieces of bone and horse skulls, and nine human skulls found in a bag, dating back to 6,000 BCE. Glass artefacts and fragments dating from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods were also found during excavations at Sirkeci.

== Opening ==

On August 4, 2013, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, test-drove the Marmaray from Ayrılıkçeşmesi station (originally İbrahimağa station) on the Asian side under the Bosphorus and back again.

On October 29, 2013, the first stage of the Marmaray project, the underground tunnel between Europe and Asia, was inaugurated on the 90th anniversary of the Turkish Republic&#x27;. The maiden journey took place after a grand opening ceremony attended by President Abdullah Gül and Prime Minister Erdoğan, as well as by the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta, the Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and a number of foreign civil servants.

On November 7, 2019, the first Chinese freight train to Europe ran through the tunnel. This demonstrated that the China to Turkey transportation time could be reduced from a month to 12 days as part of the Iron Silk Road concept.

== Earthquake protection ==
The tunnel construction is only about away from the active North Anatolian Fault and has worried some engineers and seismologists. &quot;Since AD 342, it has seen large earthquakes that each claimed more than 10,000 lives.&quot; Some scientists have estimated a 77% probability that, at some time in the next 30 years, Istanbul will suffer an earthquake measuring 7.0 or more on the Richter magnitude scale. The waterlogged, silty soil on which the tunnel is constructed has been known to liquefy during an earthquake so engineers injected industrial grout to below the seabed to keep it stable. The walls of the tunnel are made of waterproof concrete coated with a steel shell, each section independently watertight. The tunnel is made to flex and bend in the way that tall buildings are constructed to react if an earthquake hits. Floodgates at the joints of the tunnel are able to close and isolate water in the event of the walls failing.

Steen Lykke, project manager for Avrasyaconsult, the international consortium that oversaw the construction, summed the problems up by saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of any challenge this project lacks&quot;.

<text>New Masters is the second studio album by singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, released in December 1967 by Deram Records (a new subsidiary of Decca Records) as a follow-up to the highly successful debut album, &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;.

==Overview==
The label was disappointed by Cat Stevens&#x27; second album&#x27;s poor sales, given that the previous album made the UK Top Ten and produced several hit singles. &quot;New Masters&quot; generated little interest, failing to chart in either the UK or the United States. The single &quot;Kitty&quot;/&quot;Blackness of the Night&quot; languished at number 47, becoming Stevens&#x27; first single to miss the top 40. This was a sudden and steep commercial decline from the considerable success that Stevens enjoyed with his earlier recordings.

&quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; has been covered successfully by several artists. Prior to the release of &quot;New Masters&quot;, Stevens had sold the song for £30 to P. P. Arnold (formerly of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue) which gave the former Ikette her first UK hit. In the decades to come it would also be a hit for Rod Stewart, Sheryl Crow, James Morrison and Keith Hampshire. Hampshire&#x27;s version reached no. 1 on the Canadian charts in 1973. Other versions have been rendered by singer Barbara Jones, Colm Wilkinson of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; fame, Duffy and the Jools Holland Rhythm &amp; Blues Orchestra.

<doc id="1040344" wikidata="Q3320409" url="?curid=1040344" title="Kappa number">
<text>The Kappa number is an indication of the residual lignin content or bleachability of wood pulp by a standardized analysis method.

== Measuring method ==
The Kappa number is determined by ISO 302:2004. ISO 302 is applicable to all kinds of chemical and semi-chemical pulps and gives a Kappa number in the range of 1–100. The Kappa number is a measurement of standard potassium permanganate solution that the pulp will consume. The measurement is inflated by the presence of hexenuronic acids in the pulp. These compounds are formed during the chemical pulping process, from the hemicelluloses.

The Kappa number can be monitored by online Kappa analysers in a pulp mill, but these have to be calibrated with the ISO 302:2004 method.

== Application ==
The Kappa number estimates the amount of chemicals required during bleaching of wood pulp to obtain a pulp with a given degree of whiteness. Since the amount of bleach needed is related to the lignin content of the pulp, the Kappa number can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the lignin-extraction phase of the pulping process. It is approximately proportional to the residual lignin content of the pulp.

: K ≈ c × L

Where:
: K: Kappa number;
: c: constant ≈ 6,57 (dependent on process and wood);
: L: lignin content in percent.

The Kappa number for bleachable pulps are in the range of 25–30, sack paper pulps in the range 45-55 and pulps for corrugated fiberboard are in the range 60-110.
