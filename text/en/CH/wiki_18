<text>The John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame is a presidential memorial at the grave site of assassinated United States President John F. Kennedy, in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. This permanent site replaced a temporary grave and eternal flame used at the time of Kennedy&#x27;s state funeral on November 25, 1963, three days after his assassination. The site was designed by architect John Carl Warnecke, a longtime friend of Kennedy. The permanent John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame grave site was consecrated and opened to the public on March 15, 1967.

==Original grave site==
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Dignitaries from 92 countries attended his state funeral on November 25.
Initial press reports indicated that Kennedy would be buried at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts, where his son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (who had died on August 9, 1963, two days after his premature birth) was buried. But the site for Kennedy&#x27;s grave was quickly changed to the hillside just below Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery; some months earlier Kennedy had admired the location&#x27;s peaceful atmosphere while visiting it with his friend, architect John Carl Warnecke.

The initial suggestion to bury Kennedy at Arlington appears to have been made by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy agreed to the change. Although Kennedy&#x27;s sisters and many of his longtime associates from Massachusetts were opposed to burial at Arlington, his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy visited the site with McNamara on Saturday, November 23, and concluded that Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s wishes should be honored.

On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy requested an eternal flame for Kennedy&#x27;s grave. According to several published accounts, she drew inspiration from a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which she and Kennedy had seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot; (the fourth book from the collection &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (the cast recording was a favorite of the Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, worried that it might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery; but she remained adamant.

Kennedy&#x27;s funeral was set for Monday, November 25, which left very little time to manufacture and install an eternal flame. Overnight, Colonel Clayton B. Lyle and a United States Army Corps of Engineers team built the eternal flame: A propane gas-fueled tiki torch was procured from the Washington Gas and Light Company, tested, and slightly modified for emplacement. The Corps also installed a gas line to a propane tank away to feed the torch. A mound of evergreens was placed around the base of the flame to cover the tubing and torch mechanism, and the head of the grave dug in front of the flame.

The grave was set in a plot of grass roughly on each side. The site was about halfway up the hill on which Arlington House stands. The grave was placed so that it had a view of the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument, and was aligned with them. Jacqueline Kennedy lit a taper from a candle held by a nearby soldier, and then brought the eternal flame to life at the end of the burial service. Kennedy&#x27;s brothers, Robert and Ted, symbolically lit the flame after her.

On the evening of November 26, the site was surrounded by a white picket fence. The fencing covered an expanded area long by wide. The enlarged site was due to Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s desire to have her deceased children, Patrick and Arabella (a stillborn daughter born in 1956), reinterred next to their father. She had read that in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln had been buried next to his deceased son, Willie, and she recalled Kennedy&#x27;s desire to be buried with his family. A small white cross was placed at the head of Arabella&#x27;s grave, and a small white headstone placed at the head of Patrick&#x27;s.

During the funeral, flowers were laid on the hillside above the grave site. After the erection of the fence, flowers were placed inside the enclosure, leaning against the uphill side of the fence. A canvas-covered circular wooden walkway was built from Sheridan Drive to the grave site to give members of the public access to the grave.

==Development of a permanent grave site==

John Carl Warnecke, a friend of the Kennedys, visited the grave with Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy on November 28, to discuss themes and plans for a permanent memorial. The following day, Warnecke was chosen by now former-first lady to design Kennedy&#x27;s tomb. Warnecke immediately concluded that the permanent grave must be simple and incorporate the eternal flame. A few days later, Warnecke agreed that, although it was not required, he would submit the design for the permanent Kennedy grave site to the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts.

Initially, there was some concern that an eternal flame might not be approved by the cemetery. The Army Corps of Engineers was studying the installation of a permanent flame just a week after Kennedy&#x27;s burial. But the Army was also considering removing the flame, as no such memorials were permitted in Arlington National Cemetery. On December 3, 1963, the Army concluded that the Kennedy plot was not part of the official burial section of Arlington National Cemetery, and agreed to continue to allow an eternal flame.

The U.S. government formally set aside a site surrounding Kennedy&#x27;s grave on December 5, 1963. The grave design process was placed under tight secrecy. An extensive research project was conducted in which hundreds of famous tombs (such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and Grant&#x27;s Tomb) as well as all existing presidential burial sites were documented and images of them collected. Warnecke discussed design concepts with more than 40 architects, sculptors, painters, landscape architects, stonemasons, calligraphers, and liturgical experts—including the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, architectural model maker Theodore Conrad, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. Noguchi counseled Warnecke to add a large sculptural cross to the site and to eliminate the eternal flame (which he felt was kitschy). Warnecke consulted with Jacqueline Kennedy about the design of the grave many times over the following year. Hundreds of architectural drawings and models were produced to explore design ideas. On April 6, 1964, Warnecke sent a memorandum to her in which he outlined his desire to retain the eternal flame as the centerpiece of the burial site and to keep the site&#x27;s design as simple as possible. In the course of the research and conceptualization effort, Warnecke considered the appropriateness of structures or memorials at the site (such as crosses, shafts, pavilions, etc.), the history of Arlington National Cemetery, the vista, and how to handle ceremonies at the site. By August 1964, Warnecke and his assistants had written a 76-page research report which concluded that the grave site was not a memorial nor monument, but a grave. &quot;This particular hillside, this flame, this man and this point in history must be synthesized in one statement that has distinctive character of its own. We must avoid adding elements that in later decades might become superficial and detract from the deeds of the man,&quot; Warnecke wrote This conclusion drove the final design. The walkways and elliptical overlook were conceptualized very early in the design process. Landscape architects Hideo Sasaki and Lawrence Halprin helped design the approaches and setting, but not the grave site. For some time in the spring and summer of 1964, the design process appeared to slow as Warnecke and his associates struggled to design the grave site. But in the summer of 1964 Sargent Shriver, Kennedy&#x27;s brother-in-law, forcefully told Warnecke that &quot;There must be something there when we get there.&quot; This spurred the design efforts forward. In the late summer and early fall, Warnecke considered massive ledger stone, a sarcophagus, a sunken tomb, a raised tomb, and sculpture to mark the graves. Very late in the design process, two abstract sculptures were designed but ultimately rejected.
The final design was unveiled publicly at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 1964. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara unveiled the design, with Kennedy&#x27;s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, and sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, in attendance. The final design had won the approval of the Kennedy family, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission. Two overarching design concerns guided the design of the site. First, Warnecke intended the grave itself to reflect the early New England tradition of a simple ledger stone set flat in the ground surrounded by grass. Second, the site was designed to reflect Kennedy&#x27;s Catholicism. As originally envisioned, a circular granite walkway was envisioned which would create two approaches to the grave site. The walkways were intended to overcome the steep 45-degree incline of the hill up to the burial plot. Kennedy was buried so that his grave faced northeast toward the Washington Monument. The entrance to the circular walkway was from the southeast, which created a southern, shorter leg of the circular walkway. Warnecke intended for this shorter walkway to be used by family members and dignitaries who were making private visits to the grave, while the longer walkway would not only separate the public from these VIPs but also accommodate the long lines of people wishing to pay their respects. A small elliptical plaza ( long and wide) made of marble was set at the top of and inside the circle. The northeastern side of the elliptical plaza would be enclosed by a low wall inscribed with quotes from Kennedy&#x27;s speeches. Marble steps would lead up from the plaza to a rectangular terrace long and wide. Flowering magnolia trees would be planted on either side of the steps up to the terrace. Centered in the terrace would be a rectangular plot of grass long and wide, raised slightly above the ground level, which would accommodate the graves. Flat black ledger stones ( by ) would mark each grave, listing the name and date of birth and death in raised lettering. The ledger stone would be set flush with the earth. A high and long retaining wall, inscribed with the presidential seal, formed the rear of the burial site. The walkways, elliptical plaza, and terrace were designed to accommodate more than 50,000 visitors per day. The eternal flame itself would be placed in the center of the grassy plot in a flat, triangular bronze sculpture intended to resemble a votive candle or brazier. Rachel Lambert Mellon was employed to landscape the approaches with flowering trees (magnolia, cherry, and hawthorn). At the time of the design&#x27;s unveiling, the quotations for the low wall had not yet been selected by Mrs. Kennedy. The original design won near-universal praise.

==Construction of the new grave site==
The plan was for work to begin in the fall of 1965 and be completed by the fall of 1966. The design required that the bodies of Kennedy, Patrick and Arabella be moved downhill about . A 150-year-old oak tree, which was off-center in the circular pathway, was to be retained. The total cost of the tomb was estimated at $2 million. The Kennedy family offered to pay for the entire cost, but the U.S. government refused and asked them to pay only the $200,000–300,000 cost of the grave itself. Most of the cost was attributed to the need to reinforce and strengthen the site to accommodate the weight of such large crowds. The U.S. Department of Defense formally hired Warnecke to design the approaches (although this was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;).

Work on the John F. Kennedy burial site continued over the next two and a half years. The Washington Gas and Light Company offered to build, maintain, and supply gas to the eternal flame at no expense. The final burner was a specially designed torch created by the Institute of Gas Technology with an electrical ignition which kept the flame lit in wind or rain and which fed the gas oxygen to create the correct color. A debate broke out between providers of bottled propane gas and line-fed natural gas as to which source of fuel should be used to supply the eternal flame. The debate was so vigorous that it broke out in public in March 1964. The cost of construction of the approaches, elliptical plaza, walls were estimated at $1.77 million in February 1965. The cost of construction of the actual grave site was estimated at $309,000. Fifteen firms were invited to bid on the construction contract and nine did so. A $1.4 million contract for construction was awarded to Aberthaw Construction in mid-July 1965. The Army Corps of Engineers consulted with the Kennedy family before letting the award. A second contract for structural design consulting in the amount of $71,026 went to Ammann &amp; Whitney. At this time, contracts for the quotation inscriptions, the marble base for the flame, the bronze brazier, and the slate markers had yet to be let. The white marble for the plaza, terrace, and steps came from Proctor, Vermont, and the granite for the approaches came from Deer Isle, Maine.

Prior to construction, several design changes were made to the Kennedy grave site. The retaining wall behind the grave was removed, and the hill landscaped to allow an unobstructed view of Arlington House. Concerned that the grass on the burial plot would wither in Washington&#x27;s hot summers, in the fall of 1966 the decision was made to replace the grass with rough-hewn reddish-gold granite fieldstone set in a flagstone pattern. The fieldstones used had been taken more than 150 years before from a quarry on Cape Cod near where Kennedy used to spend his summers. The burial plot, originally designed to be raised a substantial height above the surrounding terrace, was lowered so that it was just three to four inches higher. The bronze brazier shape for the Eternal Flame was also replaced. Instead, a wide beige circular fieldstone (found on Cape Cod in 1965) was set nearly flush with the earth and used as a bracket for the flame.
Construction of the approaches required regrading the hill. Crews were forced to work with picks and shovels around the oak tree to protect its roots while engaged in regrading work. The tree&#x27;s roots were reinforced with concrete to provide stability to the plant, and a &quot;breathing system&quot; incorporated into the concrete to allow the roots to still secure nourishment. Twenty tons of steel were used to build the terrace, and 280 tons of concrete poured to build the grave vaults and the eternal flame site. The first fieldstones for the graves were placed April 11, 1966. At the same time, the ground was prepared for the emplacement of the granite blocks which would form the low memorial wall on the downslope side of the elliptical plaza. Jacqueline Kennedy, with assistance of Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen, selected the inscriptions for the wall by November 1965, all of which came from Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural 1961 address (although some were shortened for artistic reasons). John E. Benson inscribed the quotations onto the seven granite blocks. The lettering is in Roman majuscule. In November 1965, the contractors estimated that the site would be finished by July 1966. The government announced that the bodies of Kennedy, Patrick and Arabella would be reburied in a private ceremony at night after the cemetery had closed on the day before the site was opened to the public. For a time in the fall of 1966, the Army considered floodlighting the site to permit night-time ceremonies, but this plan was quickly discarded. In mid-October 1966, design changes and construction delays had forced the opening of the new burial site to early 1967.

==Consecration of the new grave==
The permanent John F. Kennedy grave site opened with little announcement or fanfare on March 15, 1967. A few days before, the eternal flame had been moved from its temporary location to the new site. The reburial of the bodies occurred on the evening of March 14, after Arlington National Cemetery had closed. Earth over the existing grave was removed, and a small crane was used to lift the burial vault (which remained unopened) from the old grave and place it in the new one. The event was unannounced. The transfer was witnessed by U.S. senators Robert and Ted Kennedy, and Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston. Exhumation began at 6:19 PM and was complete at 9:00 PM. Consecration of the new burial site occurred at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain. The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Jacqueline Kennedy, and several members of the Kennedy family. Cardinal Cushing presided over the consecration. The final cost of the entire project was $2.2 million. Landscaping around the permanent site was not complete at the time of its consecration, and continued for several more weeks.

==Operation of the site==
One spontaneous act of respect at the site was curbed almost immediately. Jacqueline Kennedy had requested that a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) be part of the military honor squad at Kennedy&#x27;s burial service. She specifically asked that the Special Forces soldier wear a green beret rather than formal Army headgear. After the funeral, the six military personnel in the honor guard (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard, and Special Forces) had spontaneously removed their covers and laid them on the evergreen boughs around the eternal flame. Also laid on the greenery were the insignia of a U.S. Army military policeman and the shoulder braid from a soldier in the 3rd US Infantry Regiment. The presence of the headgear was widely criticized after the dedication of the permanent grave site, and the U.S. Army (which administers Arlington National Cemetery) ordered all such memorabilia removed from the grave in April 1967.

===Alterations caused by new burials at the grave site===

Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on June 6, 1968, in Los Angeles, California. An expansion to the John F. Kennedy grave site was dedicated in 1971 to accommodate Robert Kennedy&#x27;s grave. Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s resting place is only about southwest from the terrace at the John F. Kennedy site. Robert Kennedy is buried on the upslope side of the walkway, his burial vault marked by a white cross and a slate headstone set flush with the earth. Opposite his grave is a granite plaza designed by architect I. M. Pei and dedicated on December 6, 1971. A low granite wall similar to the one at the John F. Kennedy terrace contains quotations from famous Robert F. Kennedy speeches, and a small reflecting pool. As with his brother, Robert Kennedy&#x27;s first grave was a temporary one, about upslope from its current location.

The Kennedy grave site&#x27;s approaches were altered at the time the Robert F. Kennedy memorial was built. Previously, the approach consisted of a series of long steps. But several individuals in wheelchairs appealed to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and the steps were replaced by long ramps in June 1971.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was buried at the site alongside Kennedy following her death in May 1994. Senator Edward M. Kennedy was buried about south of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s memorial between two maple trees shortly after his death on August 25, 2009, from brain cancer.

===The Arlington Oak===
The 220-year-old &quot;Arlington Oak&quot;, which stood off-center within the Kennedy memorial grave site area, was uprooted and killed on August 27, 2011, during Hurricane Irene. The grave site was closed to the public for two days to remove the tree and stump, but reopened on August 30.

On Arbor Day, April 27, 2012, a sapling grown from an acorn of the Arlington Oak was planted at the same site. Two other Arlington Oak saplings were planted nearby, while a fourth was planted in Section 26 near Tanner Amphitheater and a fifth in Section 36 near Custis Walk.

===Maintenance===
Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. Its original, custom-manufactured ignition system, contained in a box buried a few feet from the grave, controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and activated a 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner whenever the flame was extinguished.

In 2012, the automatic ignition system began clicking audibly. In early 2013, a $350,000 contract was awarded for upgrading the system. During the work the permanent flame was extinguished after being transferred to a temporary flame to one side. The refurbishment replaced the original burner with one not requiring a separate oxygen supply, laid new gas lines, relocated gas pressure regulators, added controls to improve energy efficiency, and replaced electrical lines. The flame was returned to the upgraded permanent eternal flame on May 17, 2013, and the temporary flame extinguished.
In 2010, the carved inscriptions in the low stone wall in front of the site were renewed, which power cleaning and weather had made difficult to read. The Knights of Columbus donated $6,000 to have the letters darkened and more deeply incised in time for the 50th anniversary of Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration. Gordon Ponsford, a sculptor who restored several major monuments at Arlington National Cemetery, performed the work.

On December 10, 1963, a group of Catholic schoolchildren accidentally extinguished the temporary flame while sprinkling it with holy water. A cemetery official quickly relit the flame by hand. In August 1967, an exceptionally heavy rain extinguished the permanent flame and flooding of electrical equipment disabled the spark igniter. In both cases the flame was quickly relit manually.

===The Emigrant Flame===
In 2013, the Eternal Flame was shared for the first time in its history. On June 18, a U.S. Army honor guard accompanied Irish Minister of State Paul Kehoe, T.D., in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Kennedy grave site. An Irish Army officer, accompanied by an Irish Army honor guard, lit a lamp in a metal burner from the Eternal Flame. (The lamp and burner were created by the Bullfinch company, which also designed the torches for the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.) The &quot;spark&quot; traveled back to Ireland aboard a special Aer Lingus flight, accompanied by Kehoe, Irish Army personnel, and a delegation from the New Ross Town Council.

The &quot;spark&quot; arrived at Dublin Airport on June 20, where Kehoe transferred the flame to Colonel Brendan Delaney. Delaney transferred the flame to officers of the Irish Naval Service. The flame was taken by the Naval vessel , which traversed the Irish Sea and sailed up the River Barrow to New Ross (the town which John F. Kennedy&#x27;s great-grandfather emigrated from in 1848). On June 22, several Irish Special Olympians carried the flame from the &quot;Orla&quot; to a ceremony at the Kennedy Homestead. Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Jean Kennedy Smith, and Caroline Kennedy used the burner to jointly light an &quot;Emigrant Flame&quot; in an iron globe to mark the 50th anniversary of Kennedy&#x27;s trip to Ireland. The Emigrant Flame is now the centerpiece of the expanded homestead visitor center. Four days later, the flame went out, but was reignited with fire from the miner&#x27;s lamps that were lit at Arlington.

==Cultural influence==
Immediately after Kennedy&#x27;s burial, the grave and Eternal Flame were being visited by 50,000 people per day. More than 16 million people visited the site in its first three years. In 1971, the grave attracted more than 7 million people.
The presence of the grave also boosted attendance at Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral had been televised live, with 93 percent of all American homes watching. Satellites beamed the proceedings to another 23 countries, where another 600 million viewers watched. The television coverage transformed Arlington National Cemetery from a quiet veterans&#x27; cemetery into one of the Washington area&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. Average yearly attendance rose from 1 million people in 1962 to 9 million in the first six months of 1964.

In 1964, the United States Post Office Department used an image of the Eternal Flame on a five cent official postage stamp issued to commemorate the assassinated president. The stamp also used the words &quot;And the glow from that fire can truly light the world&quot;—an excerpt from Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address.

The Kennedy Eternal Flame has also attracted some unwanted attention as well. The leader of a group protesting segregation in housing was briefly detained at the grave site in August 1967 after attempting to lead a group of protesters in the singing of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. A mentally ill individual attempted to throw red paint on the grave in August 1971. A 23-year-old Army veteran committed suicide at the grave in 1972 by plunging a knife into his chest. The cross and the headstone marking Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s grave were stolen in 1981 and never recovered. In December 1982, an intoxicated Salvadoran immigrant broke into the cemetery at night and knelt before the Eternal Flame. He experienced a fatal heart attack, and fell into the flame. In 1997, thieves pried loose one of the paving stones from the terrace in front of the Eternal Flame and attempted to make off with it. They gave up after realizing the stone was too heavy to move.

<text>Campos Novos Paulista is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 4,997 (2020 est.) in an area of . The elevation is .

==History==
Its original given name in 1880 was Campos Novos do Paranapanema, being later simplified to Campos Novos, and finally acquiring its current name around 1940. The region was originally inhabited by the Caingangues people, being later colonized by immigrants and having its lands dedicated to the production of coffee.

The municipality was created in 1885 and reinstalled by state law in 1948.
== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>RAF Carlisle (previously RAF Kingstown) was a Royal Air Force establishment, now closed after being used for a variety of roles over a period of fifty eight years and formerly located north of Carlisle city centre in Cumbria, England.

The station was latterly the home of No. 14 Maintenance Unit and occupied the various sites originally used by RAF Kingstown&#x27;s Elementary Flying Training School during the Second World War. The site was usually known both locally and within the RAF by its shortened form of 14 MU. The site had also served for a short period in the 1930s as a civilian municipal airport for the City of Carlisle, but proved to be underused and uneconomic.

The maintenance unit was located on the northern edge of Carlisle, just past the present Asda supermarket, and spread across several different sites. The smallest storage site of Harker was 0.7 km north east of RAF Kingstown and, together with Heathlands which was 0.5 km north, was on the opposite side on the A74 (now the M6). The largest site of Rockcliffe was 1.2 km north west and Cargo site was 1.5 km south west. The maintenance unit was used by the RAF to store and maintain various pieces of equipment ranging from aircraft engine parts to firearms, ammunition to office furniture, aircrew clothing and small hardware items.

Routine requests for items were dealt with by civilian warehousemen during normal working hours. At night a uniformed RAF Duty Officer dealt with urgent and essential &quot;flash&quot; requests from operational flying stations.

==History==

===Origins===
In the early 1930s, the Carlisle County Borough Council opened Kingstown municipal airport. At that time it was outside the city boundaries, on the land that is today the Kingstown and Kingmoor Park industrial estates. This early airport was a typical 1930s grass field airstrip with no metalled runways. Although used by the Border Flying Club as its base, the new airport proved to be underused and uneconomic so the airfield was eventually sold to the Air Ministry in 1936. 

The RAF installed concrete runways, hangars, a full range of administrative buildings, and several estates of married quarter housing for officers and other ranks. The new station opened for operations on 26 September 1938 as RAF Kingstown and became home to two operational bomber squadrons flying Fairey Battle bombers with three man crews.

===The War years===
With the outbreak of war in 1939, Kingstown&#x27;s runways proved too short for the latest generation of larger multi-engined bombers and there was no room for runway expansions, so the RAF built and developed a new airfield at Crosby-on-Eden. The new facility came into operation in February 1941, the station designated as RAF Crosby on Eden which, following its wartime service, today serves as Carlisle Lake District Airport. RAF Kingstown was retained by the RAF, and converted to No 24 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS).

As the war developed and the need for pilots increased, the EFTS expanded its operations onto several local grass fields at nearby Harker, Heathlands, Rockcliffe and Cargo. There was even a satellite grass field at RAF Kirkpatrick just across the Scottish border, near Gretna Green. The main trainers used at the school were Tiger Moths and Miles Magisters. On 3 June 1940 a Fairey Battle was taken for an unauthorised flight by an unqualified pilot and crashed after several failed landing attempts; the aircraft was destroyed and the pilot killed.

In 1941 RAF Kingstown was re-designated as No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School RAF where new cadets would learn to be pilots. Also pilots who had already undergone basic flying training elsewhere were assessed for their suitability for conversion to either fighter or bomber operations. The station retained this function until the end of hostilities in 1945, when the base was closed and placed on a care and maintenance status.

The following units were also here at some point:
* No. 3 Air Observers Navigation School RAF
* No. 6 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF
* No. 38 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF
* No. 189 Gliding School RAF

===Involved in a POW escape attempt===

RAF Kingstown featured in one of the most audacious escape attempts by any German prisoners of war during World War Two. On 24 November 1941, two German pilots, held at POW Camp No 15 at Shap in a former hotel and now again the &quot;Shap Wells Hotel&quot;, escaped with flying jackets over their Luftwaffe uniforms and carrying forged identity documents that purported them to be Dutch airmen attached to the RAF.

They were fighter pilot Leutnant Heinz Schnabel from 1/JG3 Jagdstaffell and Heinkel bomber pilot Oberleutnant Harry Wappler from KG27. Without any apparent difficulty they entered RAF Kingstown and, with the help of an RAF ground mechanic, started up a Miles Magister trainer aircraft and took off. Short of fuel they landed at another RAF airfield and refuelled. Setting off for the Netherlands they suddenly realised the aircraft&#x27;s range was insufficient and they turned back. Landing in a field near Great Yarmouth they were recaptured and taken to RAF Horsham St Faith. Returned to the Shap POW camp to spend 28 days in solitary, both airmen were then shipped to more secure confinement in Canada.

===A change of use===
During the 1950s the station was reactivated, re-designated as RAF Carlisle, and retasked as No 14 Maintenance Unit, the RAF&#x27;s most northerly storage facility in England. The original RAF Kingstown site was established as the station headquarters and the runways were removed. The ballast from them was used in the foundations for a major building programme on the satellite sites of Harker, Heathlands, Rockcliffe and Cargo; hangars, storage buildings and administration offices were built there.
In 1957, RAF Carlisle became the parent administrative station to the new missile testing establishment at the nearby satellite station of RAF Spadeadam on the remote Cumberland moorland. Spadeadam no longer tests ballistic missiles and remains today as the RAF&#x27;s electronic warfare training and testing range.

By the 1980s the headquarters site consisted of the original guard room staffed by civilian MOD Police, a helipad mainly used by the Royal Navy during aerial marine surveys of the Solway Firth, the small non-standard officers&#x27; mess with living accommodation for eight officers, the station HQ, the rifle range, a water tower, an MOD Fire Station with a single fire engine appliance and various other minor admin buildings. The station was unusual within the RAF as there were no other ranks or NCOs stationed at RAF Carlisle, only a small cadre of 12 - 15 RAF Supply Branch officers who controlled a civilian workforce of storekeepers and warehousemen.

RAF Carlisle was just one in a chain of several Maintenance Units forming RAF Support Command, later to become RAF Logistics Command in 1994. Logistics Command was faced with a contracting air force that had fewer airfields, fewer aircraft, and fewer personnel. The logical answer was a reduction in the number of maintenance units. 14 MU was the farthest flung location in the UK, now isolated with most northern RAF stations already closed. RAF Carlisle would prove to be an early target for closure in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) which marked the beginning of a modernisation that moved towards a unified tri-service logistics support.

===Final closure===

After three years of closure threats by the Ministry of Defence and extended negotiations with Carlisle Council, the RAF Carlisle base was finally closed in September 1996, and stood unused for several years. The site was eventually bought by a local entrepreneur and businessman, Brian Scowcroft, who made a sizeable investment developing the site into the extensive regional business park known as Kingmoor Park, the role that continues today.

The main site is as much the hub of operations today as it was when it was in RAF service. It houses the site admin blocks, many local businesses have converted hangars into workshops, several national and international businesses have depots there. The helipad area disappeared under The Capita Group&#x27;s new building, where Capita Business Services now operates various services for Cumbria County Council under tender for fifteen years. Capita Symonds also works out of the same building, where they develop computer software and act as consultants on highways, amongst other functions. The Cargo site has been cleared and a new residential housing estate is now under construction.

The stock of RAF Carlisle officers&#x27; and other ranks&#x27; married-quarter housing was sold originally to Carlisle City Council and is now almost completely owner-occupied. The last &quot;gate guardian&quot; aircraft at RAF Carlisle was the Phantom FGR2 No XV406, ex 64 Sqn/228OCU at Leuchars. After RAF Carlisle was closed, this aircraft was transferred to the Solway Aviation Museum at Carlisle Lake District Airport where it still stands. Other &quot;gate guardians&quot; at RAF Carlisle have included a Gloster Meteor NF14, a Vampire T11 and a Hawker Hunter F1.

===Radioactive contamination===
During 1992 radioactive radium was discovered at the RAF Carlisle site by accident when a member of the Royal Observer Corps walked across a patch of ground testing a recently recalibrated PDRM82 geiger counter. After further investigations it was realised that the RAF had incinerated thousands of luminous dials from the old wartime trainer aircraft in accordance with the disposal policy of the 1940s and 1950s known as &quot;bash, bury or burn&quot;. The resulting radioactive ash had been scattered and used during later landscaping of the site.
The radioactive ash had also been used as packing around fence posts on the airfield boundary. Hotspots of up to 250,000 Bq of radioactivity were identified where unburnt dials had been abandoned in piles on the ground. Such levels would be harmful inside the body and could burn the skin in hours.

Since 1992, scientists have analysed up to 10,000 soil samples from the closed RAF Carlisle site and so far have published thirty separate reports. Over three hundred cubic metres of soil contaminated with radium-226 at levels of at least 4 becquerels per gram were condemned as radioactive waste and transported to the low-level waste dump run by Low Level Waste Repositorory near Drigg. Up to twice that volume of less radioactive soils have been tipped onto nearby industrial waste sites.

==Royal Observer Corps, Carlisle Group==
During the Second World War the air raid warning organisation No 32 Group Carlisle Royal Observer Corps operated from a city centre building on Norfolk Road, The Laurels, although it was controlled administratively from RAF Kingstown. The association with Kingstown developed further in 1962 when the ROC ceased its aircraft spotting role for the RAF and took on a new role of plotting nuclear explosions and warning the public of approaching radioactive fallout for the UKWMO. A new administration building and a protected, hardened Nuclear Reporting bunker was built at RAF Carlisle. The nuclear bunker was a standard above-ground structure and both the bunker and Headquarters hutting stood on a separate site at Crindledyke just outside the main gates of RAF Carlisle and roughly opposite the station&#x27;s officers mess. The Carlisle group was redesignated no 22 Group ROC.

The ROC also constructed a smaller nuclear reporting post called Kingstown post (OS ref:NY 3837 5920), on the main RAF Carlisle site. The post was also an underground protected bunker but designed for a crew of three observers. The headquarters bunker accommodated an operational crew of around 100 with dormitory and canteen facilities included with the operations room and life support plant. 

The Royal Observer Corps and its parent organisation the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation were stood down in December 1995 after the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence. The ROC buildings were demolished in 1996 and replaced by a cellphone communications mast. The foundations of the nuclear bunker can still be partially seen outlined in the concreted yard, which also contains the Air Training Corps hut during recent further development of the site.

==Continuing RAF links==
The Royal Air Force still retains close links with the local area, through RAF Spadeadam, the only electronic warfare range still in the UK and one of two in Europe, which holds an annual thanksgiving service in Carlisle Cathedral on Battle of Britain Sunday. 

Other links with the area are No. 1862 (City of Carlisle) Squadron, Air Training Corps, based near the redundant station, the Carlisle and District Branch of the Royal Air Forces Association and the Royal Observer Corps Association (22 Group Chapter).

<text>Campos do Jordão () is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in southeastern Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 52,405 (2020 est.) in an area of . The city is situated above sea level and is the highest city in Brazil.

There are numerous outdoor activities for tourists and winter residents. These include hiking, mountain climbing, treetop cable swings (&quot;arborismo&quot;), horseback riding, and ATV and motorbike riding. July, of winter season vacations, sees an enormous influx of visitors (more than quadrupling the city&#x27;s population), due in part to the winter festival of classical music.

Its attractions throughout the year include German, Swiss and Italian cuisine restaurants, bars, and a cable car. There are many &quot;pousadas&quot; (inns) and chalets. Also, in order to cater to the large number of visitors, several bars, lounges, discos and clubs open during the winter months.

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s economy is based mainly on tourism; due to its location at high elevation in the Mantiqueira Mountains, and traditional European-style architecture. Buildings are mostly vernacular architecture from German, Swiss, or Italian models. Many of the wealthiest residents in the state of São Paulo have winter country houses here.

Despite the high income of many visitors, the HDI (0.820 in 2004) of Campos do Jordão is not very high because the owners of the houses in the best neighbourhoods are not regular inhabitants; these houses are used only during the holidays. The city can be reached from São Paulo mainly by road through the Rodovia Floriano Rodrigues Pinheiro. There is also a picturesque railroad from Pindamonhangaba, used mostly by tourists. At the end of the main road going through Campos do Jordão, there is a state park called Horto Florestal.

==Geography==
The municipality contains the Campos do Jordão State Park, created in 1941.
It contains the Mananciais de Campos do Jordão State Park, created in 1993 to protect the water supply of the municipal seat.
It also contains the Campos do Jordão Environmental Protection Area, created in 1984.

The Mantiqueira Mountains provide unique panoramic views, and the municipality&#x27;s region still has undeveloped old growth Atlantic Forest habitat. The native Brazilian Paraná pine (&quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;) is found here.

A former state governor had a winter residence in the city, the Boa Vista Palace, which is now a museum in the city.

The city is located in the northeastern side of the State of São Paulo, bordering Minas Gerais in the north. Campos do Jordão is at a distance of 180 km (112 miles) from the City of São Paulo, 334 km (208 miles) from the City of Rio de Janeiro, and 486 km (302 miles) from Belo Horizonte.

Campos do Jordão is located on a crystalline plateau where the High Felds are located (in Portuguese: Altos Campos) formed from the quaternary, increasing the geomorphological risks with the increase of urbanization and seen inadequate occupations as in straight slopes. These areas may be at risk of landslide. The municipality has rounded topos and amphitheaters where organic clay is found due to erosive processes and due to this constitution its characteristic is the concentration of water.

===Climate===
Campos do Jordão features an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;), characterized with warm, wet summers and cool, moderately dry winters.

Although at a higher elevation than the higher portions of Santa Catarina, the latitude compensates for such a difference by providing slightly warmer winters with sporadic snowfall over an extended period, associated with the drier mid-year air. As it is a montane vegetation and with mild temperatures, trees like &quot;Araucaria augustifolia&quot; is part of the ecosystem of the highest part of the Mantiqueira Mountains. The annual evaporation rate is one of the lowest of the cities of São Paulo, which can lead to water deficiencies in the driest months.

The average annual precipitation is approximately 1850 mm annually, with the majority falling in December and January. The average annual compensated temperature is 14.5°C. While there are cooler cities, the cooler weather tends to persist longer, averaging lower temperatures than municipalities like Curitiba, Lages or Canela. Temperatures can drop below zero in winter, reaching a few degrees Celsius in the Paraíba Valley, with a thermal sensation that may be even lower. However, there are years when temperatures rise above freezing, as was the case in 1999. As previously mentioned, despite the high altitude and latitude, the conditions are not conducive to regular snowfall in the city. As a result, snow occurrences are rare, with recorded events in years such as 1928, 1942, 1947 and 1966. These occurrences occurred at intervals of approximately two decades, but such events seem to have ceased in recent times. Additionally, the recorded dates of snowfall are not universally agreed upon, and the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), which has been operational since 1944, has not documented any instances of snowflakes in the area.

According to data from INMET, since 1961 the absolute minimum temperature recorded in Campos do Jordão was -7.2°C, on June 6, 1988. According to the Forecast Center (CPTEC), the winter of 1988 was the coldest on record. In contrast, between 2008 and 2018, the lowest temperature recorded was only -3.8°C, indicating that urbanization can moderate colder conditions. Prior to 1988, unofficial records show even lower temperatures: -7.4°C on 26 June 1918, -8°C on 25 July 1923, and -8.7°C in July 1926. The absolute maximum temperature during this period was 30.5 °C on September 17, 1961. Temperatures also reached 30 °C on two other occasions: September 21, 1961, and October 14, 1963, with limited available data. Cold temperatures are more common in June and July, but during the afternoon, temperatures typically rise above freezing, although they remain cool. September and April generally consist of pleasant days, with temperatures above 30 °C being rare occurrences.

The largest accumulated precipitation in 24 hours in Campos do Jordão was 146.7 mm on March 10, 1965. Other significant precipitation events include 129.5 mm on October 14, 1995, 121.1 mm on January 24, 1964, 118.2 mm on March 8, 1966, 111.4 mm on December 24, 1971, 108.4 mm on May 25, 2005, 106.4 mm on December 14, 1971, 104.2 mm on December 2, 1963, 102.8 mm on November 20, 1971, and 101.2 mm on December 22, 1966. The month with the highest precipitation in Campos do Jordão was December 1971, with a recorded total of 606.6 mm. Interestingly, Christmas Day has the highest average rainfall in Campos do Jordão, with a 75% chance of precipitation. This trend of high rainfall continues throughout December and January. It is also notable that 75% of the annual rainfall in Campos do Jordão occurs between spring and summer. The variation in altitude and the presence of valleys contribute to differences in the total precipitation across the municipality, with humidity levels decreasing towards the interior of the plateau.

The seasonal variation of cloudiness is notable. The period from the beginning of April to the middle of October is the most conducive for sunlight, with the end of August experiencing the least cloud cover, allowing for up to 70% of clear skies. The remainder of the year tends to be cloudier, with mid-January seeing up to 77% of overcast skies. The duration between the shortest and longest days of the year typically aligns with astronomical cycles.

The second half of the year usually experiences stronger winds, particularly between September and October, with average speeds of 8 km/h. In contrast, the period between February and March is characterized by calmer winds, with average speeds of 6 km/h. The prevailing wind direction is from the north for about two-thirds of the year, especially from the end of April to the end of September. The second most common wind direction, from the east, occurs for nearly four months of the year. 
== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Sevan ( ) is a town as well as one of the most popular resorts in Armenia, located in the Sevan Municipality of the Gegharkunik Province on the northwestern shores of Lake Sevan. The town is built at a height of more than above sea level, northeast of the capital Yerevan, and north of the provincial centre Gavar.

Sevan is surrounded by the Sevan National Park, a natural protected area extending from the northeastern parts of the town to the southwest, while Lake Sevan forms the natural border of the city to the east.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 19,229, and as per the 2016 official estimate, the population of Sevan is 19,200. As of the 2022 census, the population of the town was 18,705.

==Etymology==
Sevan was founded as Yelenovka (, ) in 1842 to become a Russian-populated village. It was named after Yelena Pavlovna the daughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia.

The town was known as Yelenovka until 1935 when it was renamed Sevan after the Lake Sevan. The scholarly consensus is that the word &quot;Sevan&quot; originated from the Urartian word &quot;su(i)n(i)a&quot;, usually translated as &quot;lake&quot;. The term is found on an 8th-century BC cuneiform inscription by the Urartian king Rusa I, found in Odzaberd, on the southern shore of the lake. Per folk etymology, &quot;Sevan&quot; is either a combination of &quot;sev&quot; (&quot;black&quot;) + Van (i.e., Lake Van) or &quot;sev&quot; (&quot;black&quot;) and &quot;vank’&quot; (&quot;monastery&quot;).

==History==

The territory of modern-day Sevan has been populated since the 3rd millennium BC. The cyclopean fortress of Metsep dating back to the 3rd millennium BC stands just north of the city. Another cyclopean fortress known as &quot;Mashtotsner&quot; is located in the Tsamakaberd neighborhood of Sevan.

After the establishment of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, the territory of modern-day Sevan was included within the Mazaz and Varazhnunik cantons at the east of the historic Ayrarat province of Armenia Major.

The Sevan peninsula, located east of present-day Sevan, is home to one of the most notable samples of medieval Armenian architecture, the Sevanavank Monastery of the 9th century. The monastery was mainly intended for monks from Echmiadzin who had sinned. Currently, the monastery consists of two churches: Surp Arakelots (Holy Apostles) and Surp Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God). The monastery is famous for its variety of the medieval Armenian Khachkars (cross-stones). Initially the monastery was built at the southern shore of a small island, that later turned into a peninsula during the 1st half of the 20th century, as a result of the artificial draining of Lake Sevan under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule, causing the water level to fall around 20 meters.

Eastern Armenia became part of the Russian Empire in 1828 as a result of the Treaty of Turkmenchay. In 1842, members of Russian Molokan religious sect escaping prosecutions in mainland Russia, arrived in the region and founded the village of Yelenovka. The village remained Russian-populated until the end of the 19th century.
After World War I, Yelenovka was included within independent Armenia from 1918 until its Sovietization in 1920.

In 1930, Yelenovka became the centre of the newly-formed &quot;Sevan raion&quot; of Soviet Armenia. In 1935, the settlement was renamed &quot;Sevan&quot; after the nearby lake. In 1961, Sevan was granted the status of an urban settlement. In 1965, the nearby villages of Tsamakaberd and Gomadzor were included within the territory of the town of Sevan. In 1967, Sevan became a town of republican subordination.

The 1st urban development plan of Sevan was introduced in 1954, with the purpose of accommodating around 11,000 residents in the town until 1970. The 2nd plan introduced in 1967, was envisaged for a population of 20,000 until 1980. However, the new plan of 1974 was designed for a population growth up to 40,000 until 2000.

Under the Soviet rule, Sevan was turned into an important industrial hub within the Armenian SSR. In 1958, the Sevan factory of mechanical devices was opened, followed by the Sevan glass insulators factory in 1962. In 1978, the Sevan flour mill and bakery factory was opened, followed by the fish-processing factory in 1981. Many other small plants for dairy products and building materials were also founded in the town. As a result of the industrial growth, the population of the town has grown 3 times between 1959 and 1979, jumping from 6500 to 20,500.

However, after the independence of Armenia in 1991, most of the development plans were abandoned and the majority of the industrial plants were closed. In 1995, Sevan was included within the newly-formed administrative province of Gegharkunik

In 2004, the Vaskenian Theological Academy of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin was opened in the Sevan peninsula. The peninsula is also home to the summer presidential residence of Armenia.

Licensed fishing around the lake is also regulated.

The national reserve occupies major territories around the Lake Sevan, extended from the northeastern parts of the town to the southwest. The area comprises , of which are lakeside lands. It is surrounded with the slopes of mountain chains of Areguni, Geghama, Vardenis, Pambak and Sevan. Some 1600 plant and 330 animal species are found here. The park is divided into 3 zones: national reserve, recreation zone and economic use zone.

The basin of Lake Sevan is a crossroad for mesophile and Armenian-Iranian xerophile flora belts.

However, scientific researches about the mammals of the Sevan basin are quite poor. Wolf, jackal, fox, marten and cat, are usually found in the national reserve.

===Sevan Botanical Garden===

<doc id="1014142" wikidata="Q1173809" url="?curid=1014142" title="David Braben">
<text>David John Braben (born 2 January 1964) is an English video game developer and designer, founder and President of Frontier Developments, and co-creator of the &quot;Elite&quot; series of space trading video games, first published in 1984. He is also a co-founder of and works as a trustee for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which in 2012 launched a low-cost computer for education.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Braben was born in West Bridgford, Nottingham. He attended Buckhurst Hill County High School in Chigwell, Essex. He studied Natural Sciences at Jesus College, Cambridge, specialising in Electrical Science in his final year.

=== Career ===
In 2008, Braben was an investor and non-executive director of Phonetic Arts, a speech generation company led by Paul Taylor. Phonetic Arts was acquired by Google in 2010, for an undisclosed sum.

In May 2011, Braben announced a new prototype computer intended to stimulate the teaching of basic computer science in schools. Called Raspberry Pi, the computer is mounted in a package the size of a credit card, has a USB port on one end with a HDMI monitor socket on the other, and provides an ARM processor running Linux for an estimated price of about £15 for a configured system, cheap enough to give to a child to do whatever he or she wants with it. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity whose aim is to &quot;promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing&quot;.

==== Game development ====
Braben has been called &quot;one of the most influential computer game programmers of all time&quot;, based on his early game development with the &quot;Elite&quot; series in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed him in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, chiefly due to the original &quot;Elite&quot;.

&quot;Elite&quot; was developed in conjunction with programmer Ian Bell while both were undergraduate students at Cambridge University. &quot;Elite&quot; was first released in September 1984 and is known as the first game to have 3D hidden-line removal. In 1987, Braben published &quot;Zarch&quot; for the Acorn Archimedes, ported in 1988 as &quot;Virus&quot; for the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, and PC.

After &quot;Zarch&quot;, Braben went on to develop the sequel to &quot;Elite&quot;, &quot;&quot;, published in 1993, and founded Frontier Developments, a games development company whose first project was a version of &quot;Frontier&quot; for the Amiga CD32. Braben is still the CEO and majority shareholder of the company, whose projects since 2000 have included &quot;Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Kinectimals&quot;, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, &quot;LostWinds&quot;, &quot;Planet Coaster&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Jurassic World Evolution&quot;, &quot;Kinect Disneyland Adventures&quot;, &quot;Zoo Tycoon&quot;, &quot;Coaster Crazy,&quot; and games based on the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; franchise.

In 2006, Braben was working on an ambitious next-generation game called &quot;The Outsider&quot;, being developed by Frontier Developments. As said in an interview, he was planning to start working on &quot;&quot; – as a space MMORPG game – as soon as &quot;The Outsider&quot; went gold. Braben said explicitly that this title was of special value to him. &quot;The Outsider&quot; was abandoned due to the removal of publisher support and was never published.

In 2012, Braben explained in an interview with developer website Gamasutra his opinion that the sale of secondhand games negatively affects the development of new titles, also holding the price of games in general much higher than they would otherwise be. However, later in 2014 he acknowledged: &quot;Piracy goes hand in hand with sales. If a game is pirated a lot, it will be bought a lot. People want a connected experience, so with pirated games we still have a route in to get them to upgrade to the real version. And even if someone&#x27;s version is pirated, they might evangelise and their mates will buy the real thing.&quot;

On 6 November 2012, Braben&#x27;s Frontier Developments announced a new &quot;Elite&quot; sequel called &quot;&quot; on the Kickstarter crowdfunding site. &quot;Elite: Dangerous&quot; achieved its funding goal and was listed as one of the most funded Kickstarter campaigns. The game was released on 16 December 2014, and by April 2015 had sold over 500,000 copies. As of August 2017, the game has sold over 2.75 million copies.

In August 2022, Frontier announced David’s transition to his new role of President and Founder, stepping down as CEO.

== Personal life ==
In May 1993, he married Katharin Dickinson in Cambridge. His current wife is Wendy Irvin-Braben, and he has two sons. According to the Sunday Times Rich List in 2020, Braben and his wife have an estimated combined worth of £182 million, an increase of £50 million from the previous year.

==Awards==

On 5 September 2005, Braben received the Development Legend Award at the Develop Industry Excellence Awards in Cambridge.

In 2012, Braben was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

In 2013, Braben was co-award winner of Tech Personality of the Year at the UK Tech Awards 2013. In the same year, he was awarded an honorary degree by Abertay University.

Braben was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to the UK computer and video games industry.

In January 2015, he received the 2015 Pioneer, Game Developers Choice Award (GDCA), for his work on the Raspberry Pi and for working more than 30 years as a game developer.

On 12 March 2015, Braben was awarded the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award in video gaming at the 11th British Academy Games Awards.

Braben is the recipient of three honorary doctorates from Abertay University (2013), the Open University (2014), and the University of York (15 July 2015).

<doc id="1014148" wikidata="Q861949" url="?curid=1014148" title="Bill Boner">
<text>William Hill Boner (born February 14, 1945) is an American educator and former Democratic politician from Tennessee. He was the third mayor of the Metropolitan government of Nashville and Davidson County, serving from 1987 to 1991. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Representative from the 5th District of Tennessee, from 1979 to 1987.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
In high school, Bill Boner was a basketball player and tennis player for the East Nashville Eagles. On March 13, 1962, his team won the state championship. &quot;The Tennesseean&quot; wrote that Boner &quot;emerged as the biggest hero&quot; of the game, noting that he &quot;crammed 18 points through the nets within a period of 6 minutes and 48 seconds in the second quarter,&quot; adding that the opposing team &quot;lost because of a Boner.&quot; He was elected student body president for the 1962-1963 school year, his senior year. He was also elected governor of Boy&#x27;s State despite not planning to run until the last minute. He and his teammate missed part of the basketball season that year due to injuries from a car accident. A cheerleader from the nearby Glencliff High School cheerleader was critical condition. Nonetheless, he was selected for the first team All-Nashville in 1963. Boner attended Middle Tennessee State University, where he was elected president of the freshman class and played basketball. He participated in campus life, including a panel on religion, and gave a presentation called &quot;Decision-Making in Personal Life&quot; at a church&#x27;s study series called &quot;Moral Man and Moral Society&quot;. After university, he became the manager of a Shell station in Smyrna. On February 1, 1969, he became the basketball coach for Trevecca Nazarene College and took on a teaching role in the physical education department. During his first year coaching, the Tennessean called the team &quot;loveable losers&quot; for its remarkably poor performance.

===Congress===

Several other persons had also decided to challenge Allen, a long-time Nashville political figure who appeared to be in declining health and who seemed vulnerable. Shortly before the deadline for candidates to withdraw from the race, Allen suffered a massive stroke. All of Allen&#x27;s opponents except Boner withdrew from the race, apparently out of concern for &quot;kicking a man when he&#x27;s down.&quot; When Allen died on the day after the withdrawal deadline, Boner was virtually unopposed for the nomination, facing only a write-in campaign that went nowhere. This was tantamount to victory in November, as the Republicans had lost interest in a district they hadn&#x27;t won since 1874. He was reelected four times with no substantive opposition.

Boner&#x27;s tenure in Congress was largely uneventful. He established a reputation for a staff devoted to excellent constituent service, and otherwise as a moderate Southern Democrat backbencher, whose largest legislative accomplishment was a bill recognizing &quot;National Sewing Month&quot;, something which subsequent opponents would later point to with glee. In 1986, he came under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for misusing campaign funds, not disclosing conflicts of interest, receiving an undisclosed gift and receiving a bribe from a government contractor.

===Mayor===
In 1987, Nashville Mayor (and former Fifth District Congressman) Richard Fulton was prevented from running for a fourth term. Boner quickly jumped into the race, seeing an opportunity to come home, and also to end the investigation. He was opposed by a large field, notably managed health care executive Phil Bredesen. Boner won the first round, but came up short of a majority. Under the Metro Charter, Boner faced runner-up Bredesen in a runoff. Boner won, largely by emphasizing that he was a Nashville native and Bredesen was a Northerner (he was born in New Jersey and grew up in Upstate New York). He was the last native-born Tennessean to serve as Nashville mayor until David Briley became mayor in 2018.

===Appearance on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;===
During his term as mayor, Boner made a controversial appearance on the October 15, 1990 episode of &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;.

Boner appeared on the show with Traci Peel, a country singer in Nashville. The couple were engaged, making their romance controversial, as Boner was still married to his third wife. It was reported that Peel had previously told a Nashville reporter that the Mayor&#x27;s passion could last for seven hours. At one point in the &quot;Donahue&quot; appearance, Boner played harmonica, while Peel sang &quot;Rocky Top&quot;.

Boner and Peel would eventually marry and then divorce after Peel caught Boner cheating two years into the marriage.

==After term as mayor==
Boner opted not to seek reelection for a second term, the only mayor not to do so from the creation of the Metro government until Megan Barry did not seek reelection in 2019 after resigning from office in 2018. Following retirement from political office, Boner briefly became a businessman, owning a pallet factory in Tompkinsville, Kentucky, and then becoming a restaurant franchisee in Atlanta.

Boner eventually returned to the Nashville area, becoming a social studies teacher at Franklin High School in Franklin, Tennessee. Sources had said that Boner had become a driver&#x27;s ed instructor for the Williamson School System, and was &quot;honest and open about the fact that he screwed up in office.&quot;

In 1995 and 1996, Boner hosted a nightly hour-long television interview show on Nashville&#x27;s WNAB called &quot;Prime Talk&quot;.

Boner is reportedly retired and living with his wife, Kay, in Franklin, Tennessee.

<text>João Vaz Corte-Real (c. 1420 – 1496) was a Portuguese sailor, claimed by some accounts to have been an explorer of a land called &quot;Terra Nova do Bacalhau&quot; (&quot;New Land of the Codfish&quot;), speculated to possibly have been a part of North America. These accounts assert that Corte-Real was awarded the donatário–captaincies of São Jorge and Angra for his accomplishments, but contemporary documents contradict this claim.

==Biography==
A member of the Corte-Real family, João Vaz was the father of Miguel and Gaspar Corte-Real, who some claim accompanied him on his voyage. Fragmentary evidence suggests the expedition in 1473 was a joint venture between the kings of Portugal and Denmark, and that Corte-Real accompanied the German sailors Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst, as well as (the possibly mythical) John Scolvus.

The claim that he discovered &quot;Terra Nova do Bacalhau&quot; (literally, &quot;New Land of the Codfish&quot;) originated from Gaspar Frutuoso&#x27;s book &quot;Saudades de terra&quot; from around 1570–80. There is speculation that this otherwise unidentified isle was Newfoundland. Frutuoso further suggested that Corte-Real was granted part of Terceira because of this discovery. This is contradicted by contemporary documents which state the grant was made for &quot;expenses he had incurred&quot; and &quot;services rendered&quot;, with no mention of any discoveries. Because of the lack of corroborating evidence, the claims of discovery remain entirely speculative.

===Donatário===
It is known that Corte-Real was originally granted the island of São Jorge in the archipelago of the Azores in 1472, which he held until 1474. From this point onward he was granted the captaincy of Angra on Terceira by the Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu, and approved by the King, following the disappearance of Jacome de Bruges. Bruges was the original Captain-Donatário, but following his disappearance, the King had divided the island between Angra and Praia, granting Praia to Álvaro Martins Homem, while Corte-Real obtained Angra. He took-up residence in the burgh and set about promoting its settlement, but the division of the island into two Captaincies did not assist the island&#x27;s growth.

===Later life===
Corte-Real and his wife, Maria de Abarca, were buried in the presbytery of the church of the Convent of São Francisco. His descendants did not live in the Capitania of Angra, instead sending &quot;ouvidores&quot;, magistrates, to the territory to administer the possessions.

<text>A recreational kayak is a type of kayak that is designed for the casual paddler interested in recreational activities on a lake or flatwater stream; they presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales. 

==Comparison with other types of kayaks==

As compared to the other big kayaks, a recreational kayak has characteristics which are different like a larger cockpit that is easy to open, make an entry and exit from. It has a wider beam of about for more stability in water and is generally less than in length. This smaller dimensions of the recreational kayak makes it smaller than a longer boat. As compared to the big kayaks, a recreational kayak is light, and thus it is easier to handle both in and out of water. This recreational kayak is cheaper as compared to a big kayak. Since the recreational kayak has a wider hull, recreational kayaks will not track lines, especially straight lines as compared to longer and narrower models. A recreational kayak has limited cargo carrying capacity as compared to a touring kayak. The materials used to manufacture the recreational kayak is rotomolded polyethylene which is less expensive and has fewer options. 
Recreational kayaks are generally used for flatwater paddling on lakes or Class 1-2 rivers and streams. 
Fishing kayaks are a type of recreational kayak specialized with rod holders, tackle boxes, and paddle rests. Other models may be inflatable, this can make for easier storage, but would require an air pump to inflate once it is brought to the desired destination.

<text>Canitar is a municipality in the southwestern part of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 5,292 (2020 est.) in an area of 57.5 km². It was a district of the municipality of Chavantes until 1991, when it became an independent municipality. Like Chavantes, Canitar belongs to the comarca of Ourinhos, its neighboring city and seat of the comarca to the West. Canitar also has borders with Chavantes to the North, East &amp; South. The Raposo Tavares state road separates Canitar from Irapé, a district in Chavantes and one of the oldest settlements in the region. The economy is based on agriculture, particularly sugar cane plantations of the Sao Luis processing plant in Ourinhos, one of the major cities in the Paranapanema River valley area.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1014170" wikidata="Q3420069" url="?curid=1014170" title="Ratio Club">
<text>The Ratio Club was a small British informal dining club from 1949 to 1958 of young psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, mathematicians and engineers who met to discuss issues in cybernetics.

==History==
The idea of the club arose from a symposium on animal behaviour held in July 1949 by the Society of Experimental Biology in Cambridge. The club was founded by the neurologist John Bates, with other notable members such as W. Ross Ashby.

The name &quot;Ratio&quot; was suggested by Albert Uttley, it being the Latin root meaning &quot;computation or the faculty of mind which calculates, plans and reasons&quot;. He pointed out that it is also the root of &quot;rationarium&quot;, meaning a statistical account, and &quot;ratiocinatius&quot;, meaning argumentative. The use was probably inspired by an earlier suggestion by Donald Mackay of the &#x27;MR club&#x27;, from &quot;Machina ratiocinatrix&quot;, a term used by Norbert Wiener in the introduction to his then recently published book &quot;Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&quot;. Wiener used the term in reference to &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;, a calculating machine constructed by Leibniz.

The initial membership was W. Ross Ashby, Horace Barlow, John Bates, George Dawson, Thomas Gold, W. E. Hick, Victor Little, Donald MacKay, Turner McLardy, P. A. Merton, John Pringle, Harold Shipton, Donald Sholl, Eliot Slater, Albert Uttley, W. Grey Walter and John Hugh Westcott. Alan Turing joined after the first meeting with I. J. Good, Philip Woodward and William Rushton added soon after. Giles Brindley was also a member for a short period.

The club was the most intellectually powerful and influential cybernetics grouping in the UK, and many of its members went on to become extremely prominent scientists.

<text>The Extra Flugzeugbau EA300 is a two-seat aerobatic monoplane capable of Unlimited category competition. It was designed in 1987 by Walter Extra, a German aerobatic pilot, and built by Extra Flugzeugbau.

==Design and development==
Design of the Extra 300 was based on the Extra 230, an early 1980s monoplane having a wing made of wood. The Extra 300 has a welded steel tube fuselage covered in aluminium and fabric. The midset wing has a carbon fiber composite spar and carbon composite skins. A symmetrical airfoil, mounted with a zero angle of incidence, provides equal performance in both upright and inverted flight. The landing gear is fixed taildragger style with composite main legs and fiberglass wheel pants. The powerplant is a fuel-injected Lycoming AEIO-540 which produces 300 horsepower (224 kW).

The first two-seat Extra 300 made its maiden flight on 6 May 1988, with German type certification following on 16 May 1990. The single-seat Extra 300S flew on 4 March 1992.

The Extra 300 is stressed for ±10 G with one person on board and ±8 G with two. Some Extra 300s are registered in the experimental category under a Special Certificate of Airworthiness in the U.S., while others are type certified in the aerobatic category.


==Variants==
;300
:Original two-seat version
;300S
:The 300S is a single-seat version, with a wingspan reduced by , and fitted with larger ailerons.
;300SP
:The 300SP is a performance version of the 300S single-seater. Weight was reduced, and the tail of the 330SX installed. It is discontinued, being replaced by the 330SC.
;300SHP
:The 300SHP (HP = high performance) is an uncertified version of the 300SP with a Lycoming AEIO-580 engine.
;300SR

<text>Michael Fielding Barnsley (born 1946) is a British mathematician, researcher and an entrepreneur who has worked on fractal compression; he holds several patents on the technology. He received his Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry from University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1972 and BA in mathematics from Oxford in 1968. In 1987 he founded Iterated Systems Incorporated, and in 1988 he published a book entitled &quot;Fractals Everywhere&quot; and in 2006 &quot;SuperFractals&quot;.

He has also published these scientific papers: &quot;Existence and Uniqueness of Orbital Measures&quot;, &quot;Theory and Applications of Fractal Tops&quot;, &quot;A Fractal Valued Random Iteration Algorithm and Fractal Hierarchy&quot;, &quot;V-variable fractals and superfractals&quot;, &quot;Fractal Transformations&quot; and &quot;Ergodic Theory, Fractal Tops and Colour Stealing&quot;.

He is also credited for discovering the collage theorem.

Iterated Systems was initially devoted to fractal image compression (epitomised by the Barnsley fern), and later focused on image archive management and was renamed to MediaBin. It was acquired in 2003 by Interwoven, by which time Barnsley was no longer affiliated with the company.

As of 2005, he is on the faculty of the Mathematical Sciences Institute of the Australian National University. Barnsley previously held a faculty position at Georgia Tech.

Michael Barnsley is the son of author Gabriel Fielding (Alan Fielding Barnsley) and a descendant of Henry Fielding.

<doc id="1014183" wikidata="Q2889538" url="?curid=1014183" title="Secondary orality">
<text>Secondary orality is orality that is dependent on literate culture and the existence of writing, such as a television anchor reading the news or radio. While it exists in sound, it does not have the features of primary orality because it presumes and rests upon literate thought and expression, and may even be people reading written material. Thus, secondary orality is usually not as repetitive, redundant, agonistic, etc. the way primary orality is, and cultures that have a lot of secondary orality are not necessarily similar to primarily oral cultures. Secondary orality should not be confused with &quot;oral residue&quot; in which a culture has not fully transitioned to literate / written culture and retains many of the characteristics of primary oral cultures. Secondary orality is a phenomenon of post-literacy, whereas oral residue is a stage in the transition from pre-literate to literate.

== Terminology ==
Walter J. Ong first described the concept of secondary orality in his publication &quot;Rhetoric, Romance, and Technology&quot; (1971):

Secondary orality is founded on—though it departs from—the individualized introversion of the age of writing, print, and rationalism which intervened between it and primary orality and which remains as part of us. History is deposited permanently, but not inalterably, as personality structure.

Ong&#x27;s most popular exposition of primary orality and secondary orality came with his book &quot;Orality and Literacy&quot; (1982; 2nd ed. 2002), which discussed the differences between oral and literate cultures. Ong used the phrase &quot;secondary orality,&quot; describing it as &quot;essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print.&quot; According to his way of thinking, secondary orality is not primary orality, the orality of pre-literate cultures. Oral societies operated on polychronic time, with many things happening at once—socialization played a great role in the operation of these cultures, memory and memorization were of greater importance, increasing the amount of copiousness and redundancy. Oral cultures were additive rather than subordinate, closer to the human life world, and more situational and participatory than the more abstract qualities of literate cultures. 
==The Gutenberg Parenthesis==
Ong notes that human communication has been dominated by oral culture, and the first signs of literacy date only 6 000 years ago. Tom Pettitt agrees with Ong, by considering literate learning more the anomaly than the rule. He considers this to be a post-Gutenberg era where knowledge is formed through digital media, delivered over the internet. Calling the previous 500 years a &quot;Gutenberg Parenthesis,&quot; a term coined by Lars Ole Sauerberg, Pettitt explains that before Gutenberg, knowledge was formed orally and, now, in this post-Gutenberg era, knowledge is formed—increasingly—through &quot;secondary orality&quot; on the Internet.

==McLuhan&#x27;s Global Village==
Marshall McLuhan discusses in &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; (1962) his notion of the &quot;global village&quot;, a concept that can be related to Ong&#x27;s account of secondary orality. Liliana Bounegru notes the emergence of social media (e.g. Facebook) and microblogging (i.e.Twitter) are re-tribalizing our cultures. Conversations in these social spaces are written, but are more conversational in tone than written communications; they are &quot;rapid communication with large groups of people in a speed that would resemble oral storytelling, without having to share the same physical space with your audience.&quot;

She has occasionally re-shared several posts made by members of the Cabinet in quick succession.

Some of Ho&#x27;s public posts have drawn significant media attention and have been the subject of public controversy in Singapore and abroad.

On 11 April 2020, Ho shared an article on Facebook about Taiwan’s donation of masks to Singapore with the following caption: &quot;Errr&quot;. Her comment was made shortly after media reports suggested that a ban on the export of masks imposed by Taipei during the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented ST Engineering from exporting masks produced in Taiwan to Singapore. Some commentators suggested that Ho was ungrateful for the donation of masks to Singapore by Taiwan. Ho subsequently amended her caption to state that she was &quot;forever grateful... to all our friends and friends of friends in Taiwan&quot;.

In August 2023, amidst public debate over then-presidential candidate Tan Kin Lian&#x27;s posts about &#x27;pretty girls&#x27;, Ho shared her views on Facebook, suggesting that the Presidential Elections Committee should not be expected to be the &quot;arbiter of moral standards&quot; and that &quot;[m]aybe TKL had asked for permission to take the pictures or to post&quot;.

<text>The Echo class were nuclear cruise missile submarines of the Soviet Navy built during the 1960s. Their Soviet designation was [[Echo-class submarine|Project 659]] for the first five vessels, and Project 675 for the following twenty-nine. Their NATO reporting names were Echo I and Echo II. All were decommissioned by 1994.

== Echo I class ==
The Soviet Echo I class (Project 659 class) were completed at Komsomolsk in the Soviet far east in 1960 to 1963. The Echo I class were classed as SSGNs armed with six launchers for the P-5 Pyatyorka (SS-N-3C, &quot;Shaddock&quot;) land-attack cruise missile. The Echo I class had to operate in a strategic rather than anti-shipping role because of the lack of fire control and guidance radars.

As the Soviet SSBN force built up, the need for these boats diminished so they were converted to the Project 659T SSNs between 1969 and 1974. The conversion involved the removal of the cruise missiles, the plating over and the streamlining of the hull to reduce underwater noise of the launchers and the modification of the sonar systems to the standard of the SSNs.

All the Echo Is were deployed in the Pacific Fleet. The last two boats were scrapped in the early 1990s.

=== Boats ===
== Echo II class ==
The Echo II class (Project 675 class) were built at Severodvinsk (18 vessels) and Komsomolsk (11 vessels) between 1962 and 1967 as anti-carrier missile submarines. The Echo II class carried eight P-6 (SS-N-3a &quot;Shaddock&quot;) anti-ship cruise missiles mounted in pairs above the pressure hull.


To fire the missiles, the ship had to surface and the missile was elevated to 15 degrees. The Echo II class also had fire control and guidance radar. The Echo II class could fire all eight missiles in 30 minutes, but would have to wait on the surface until the missile mid-course correction and final target selection had been sent unless guidance had been handed over to a third party.

From the mid-1970s, fourteen of the 29 Echo II class were converted during overhauls to carry the P-500 Bazalt (SS-N-12 &quot;Sandbox&quot;) anti-ship cruise missile, with a range of . The conversions (Project 675M) could be distinguished by the fitting bulges either side of the sail.

Three of these modified units were further upgraded under Project 675MKV towards the end of the Cold War. The P-1000 Vulkan (GRAU 3M70) flew faster (Mach 2.3–2.5) than the P-500 and its range was extended to . It replaced steel components with titanium to reduce weight, and had an improved propulsion system. It appeared to have used a similar fire-control system to the P-500, the Argon-KV and Argument radar. The P-1000 was installed on three units of the Northern Fleet between 1987 and 1993. The conversion of two boats of the Pacific Fleet, &quot;K-10&quot; and &quot;K-34&quot;, was abandoned due to lack of funds.

The Echo II class were divided evenly between the Pacific and Northern Fleets. The boats were obsolete by the mid-1980s, and were deleted in 1989 and 1995.

<text>The Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española, Sociedad Anónima, S. M. E. (; ) known as Radiotelevisión Española (acronym RTVE, branded in logo in all lowercase), is the state-owned public corporation that assumed in 2007 the indirect management of the Spanish public radio and television service known as Ente Público Radiotelevisión Española.

It provides multi-station television (Televisión Española) and radio services (Radio Nacional de España), as well as online and streaming services (RTVE Play). Since the entry into force of the &quot;Ley de Financiación de RTVE&quot; in 2009, RTVE is primarily funded by a combination of subsidies from the General State Budget and a fee levied on the private agents&#x27; gross revenue (3.0% for private free-to-air channels, a 1.5% for private subscription channels and a 0.9% for telecom companies).

RTVE is a full member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The corporation&#x27;s central headquarters, Prado del Rey, are located in Pozuelo de Alarcón.

==History==
=== Precedents ===
Spanish state-wide public broadcasting services have undergone numerous restructurings and reorganisations throughout its history, and have assumed several identities. Their history may be traced back to the first radio broadcasts of Radio Nacional de España (RNE) from Salamanca, developed as a propaganda tool for the Rebel faction during the Spanish Civil War. RNE was founded on 19 January 1937 and was subservient to the State Delegation for Press and Propaganda led by Vicente Gay Forner.

Throughout the Francoist dictatorship, the national radio service depended successively on the FET y de las JONS&#x27;s Vice-Secretariat for Popular Education (VSEP), on the (since 1945) and on the Ministry of Information and Tourism, since the creation of the latter in 1951. In July 1945, in the wake of the transfer of responsibilities over Press and Propaganda to the Ministry of National Education, radio broadcasting became a standalone directorate general: the &quot;Dirección General de Radiodifusión&quot; (&#x27;Directorate General for Radio Broadcasting&#x27;).

After some time on trial, the first Televisión Española (TVE) signal was broadcast on 28 October 1956 from the Paseo de la Habana in Madrid, reaching the roughly 600 television receivers existing in the city at the time. On 11 October 1973, the two networks for respectively radio and television broadcasting, RNE and TVE, were consolidated into the &quot;Servicio Público Centralizado Radiotelevisión Española&quot; (&#x27;RTVE Centralised Public Service&#x27;). Up until the 1980s, with the creation of regional broadcasters ETB and TV3, TVE held the monopoly on television broadcasting in the country.

Further consolidations followed in 1977, at which time RTVE became an . In 1979, TVE and RNE were joined by (RCE), an old radio service that, unlike RNE, could broadcast commercials. Under the purview of the 1980 , the public broadcasting services were configured as a legal public entity () with its own jurisdiction, the .
The former cinema newsreels service NO-DO was merged into RTVE to be dismantled in 1981. Since then, the NO-DO archives are property of RTVE and its conservation is in their hands and Filmoteca Española&#x27;s. In 1989, RCE was dismantled and its radio service was merged into RNE.

=== RTVE Corporation ===

In accordance with the Law of State Radio and Television of 5 June 2006, and in the face of an enormous deficit, the RTVE Public Body and the companies TVE, S.A. and RNE, S.A. were dissolved, and on 1 January 2007, Corporación RTVE came into existence. RTVE was thus constituted as a fully autonomous &quot;sociedad mercantil estatal&quot;, assuming the corporate form of a &quot;sociedad anónima&quot; fully participated by the State. For the first time, the chair of the public broadcasting services was appointed by the Cortes Generales (the legislative) rather than by the Government of Spain (the executive), as it had been previously the case with the directors-general of the &quot;ente público&quot; and the &quot;servicio público de radiodifusión&quot;.

As part of the 2007 restructuring, a controversial plan was implemented to reduce the workforce by 4,855 through attrition and retirement incentives.

In 2012 political tensions associated with the austerity policies enacted by the ruling right-leaning People&#x27;s Party (PP) resulted in departures of personnel, which were interpreted by interviewed journalists as an effort to purge critical political comment from RTVE&#x27;s content. In 2012 the PP began staffing RTVE with party veterans. Considerable controversy was caused when Ana Pastor was fired.

On 11 June 2013, RTVE was one of the few known European broadcasters to condemn and criticize the closure of Greece&#x27;s state broadcaster ERT.

In December 2018, RTVE launched a web with Filmoteca Española, which is available via Internet with more than 4000 videos of Spanish films and documentaries.

Amid the inability to reach a parliamentary agreement for the renovation of the administration board of RTVE, Rosa María Mateo was appointed as Provisional Sole Administrator in July 2018. In February 2021, the renovation was unblocked and José Manuel Pérez Tornero was shortlisted as the future chairman of the corporation. Thus, the new board was constituted on 26 March 2021.

In October 2021, the corporation&#x27;s decision to deny a travel of a group of RTVE journalists to Tindouf to attend an event organised by the Polisario Front and thus be presumably able to interview Brahim Ghali stirred controversy and led to the renunciation of both TVE and RNE heads of the international informative services.

=== Corporate identity ===
== Services ==
===Television ===
RTVE&#x27;s television service comes under its Televisión Española (TVE) division. Although almost all the programming of its channels is in Spanish and is the same for all of Spain, TVE has territorial centers in every autonomous community and produces and broadcasts some local programming in regional variations in each of them in the corresponding co-official language such as the broadcast of Catalan-language segments for Catalonia produced in its in Sant Cugat del Vallès.

The domestic offer provided by TVE through the digital terrestrial television comprises two generalist channels (La 1 and La 2) and three thematic channels: Teledeporte (sports programming), 24 Horas (news), and Clan (children&#x27;s programming). All available only in high-definition in 1080i, except for La 1 that is also available in ultra-high-definition in 4K resolution.

Regarding international broadcasting, TVE provides TVE Internacional, 24 Horas Internacional, , and Clan Internacional.

===Radio ===
RTVE&#x27;s radio stations come under its Radio Nacional de España (RNE) division. RNE has also territorial centers in every autonomous community and produces and broadcasts some local programming in regional variations in each of them.

The domestic offer provided by RNE includes the following radio stations: Radio Nacional (generalist radio station), Radio Clásica (classical music), Radio 3 (cultural and alternative programming aimed at young people), Ràdio 4 (Catalan-language station broadcast in Catalonia and Andorra), and Radio 5 (24-hour radio news station).

Radio Exterior (REE) is the RNE&#x27;s international broadcasting service on short wave, with an audience of eighty million listeners (surpassed only by the BBC and Vatican Radio). This station is also transmitted via DAB for Spain and by satellite. Besides Spanish, REE also transmits programming in French, Arabic, Ladino, Portuguese, Russian and English.

===Internet===
RTVE&#x27;s online portal is located at &#x27;rtve.es&#x27;. The website is managed by RTVE&#x27;s Interactive Media department (). It hosts the corporation&#x27;s over-the-top media service, RTVE Play, which replaced the old &#x27;RTVE a la carta&#x27; in June 2021, adding additional features. RTVE streams content in the Americas on the &#x27;RTVE Play+&#x27; pay subscription service.

Besides the catalogue from the RTVE Archive, it allows users to listen and watch live feeds of the network&#x27;s radio and television stations, as well as original programming from Playz, a hub of streaming content aimed towards a young audience. The RTVE.es portal also features blogs and news stories.

=== Other ===
RTVE is also responsible for the and the RTVE Symphony Orchestra and Choir. RTVE (as RNE) was admitted to full active membership of the European Broadcasting Union in 1955. TVE joined the Eurovision Network in 1960. The corporation has contributed to the production of more than 300 films, many of which have received awards at international film festivals around the world. From 1979 to 1987, a second radio network known as Radiocadena Española was also a part of RTVE. RCE stations, unlike RNE, showed advertising. RCE was merged into RNE between 1987 and 1989. NO-DO was also merged into RTVE in 1980. Since NO-DO&#x27;s closure in 1982, RTVE and Filmoteca Española are responsible for maintaining NO-DO&#x27;s archives.

== Management ==

Pursuant to the 2006 Law of State Radio and Television, management of the national public service is entrusted to &#x27;. The Board (&#x27;) of the RTVE is the main body of RTVE, and appoints the executive officers of RTVE and its companies, approves its organisation, and approves most major activities. The Board is composed of twelve members; eight members are chosen by Congress and four by the Senate, each by two-thirds majority and each for a non-renewable mandate of six years, and two members appointed by Congress must be proposed by the two main trade unions at RTVE.

The Chair has operational control of day-to-day operations, in order to execute the decisions and guidance of the Board. The Chair is appointed by, and may be dismissed by, Congress. Before the 2006 Act, this position was filled by the role of the Director General, which had a &quot;de facto&quot; total control of RTVE. In practice, the Director General had been chosen by the Government for their political profile.

Corporación RTVE is described as a &quot;state mercantile society&quot; (&quot;sociedad mercantil estatal&quot;) with special autonomy and independence from the government and the general state administration, and it performs its functions through Televisión Española (TVE) and Radio Nacional de España (RNE).

Most staff are civil servants. The News Council is an internal supervisory body composed of RTVE journalists with the aim of safeguarding RTVE&#x27;s independence.

The current RTVE board, constituted on 2 December 2024, is chaired by José Pablo López.

== Funding ==
Since the entry into force of the &quot;Ley de Financiación de RTVE&quot; in 2009, RTVE is primarily funded by a combination of subsidies from the General State Budget and a fee levied on the private agents&#x27; gross revenue (3.0% for private free-to-air channels, a 1.5% for private subscription channels and a 0.9% for telecom companies).

As of 2021, a preliminary draft for the &quot;Ley General de Comunicación Audiovisual&quot; reportedly foresees the extension of the 1.5% fee on gross revenues to international streaming platforms offering services in Spain (such as Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video or YouTube) and the drop of the 0.9% fee for telecom companies. However, the latter will continue contributing in terms of the fee levied for the occupation of the spectrum. RTVE will also be able to monetize limited forms of advertising, such as sponsorships and advertising in its international channels.

<text>The CAP Aviation CAP-23x family is a family of aircraft designed for competition aerobatics. The CAP 230 airframe was a direct development of the CAP 21 competition single seater strengthened to cope with a 6-cylinder Lycoming AEIO-540 engine instead of the original 4-cylinder Lycoming AEIO-360.

==Design and development==
The CAP 230 was primarily developed in 1985 for the French Air Force. From the basic CAP 21 airframe, trailing edge apex triangular surfaces were added to the basic trapezoidal wing and a full wooden construction. It withstood +10/-10 G-forces, had a 270 degrees/second roll rate and a top speed of 400 km/h. Between 1986-1990 this was the mount of the French Air Force aerobatics team (French: &quot;Equipe de Voltige de l&#x27;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;).

The CAP 231 was developed in 1990. The fuselage design remained unchanged and only leading edge triangular apex surfaces were added to reduce buffeting during high G pullups. The CAP 231 was world champion in 1990. Between 1990-1998 this was the mount of the French Air Force aerobatics team.

To increase performance, in 1991, a carbon-fiber wing taken from an EXTRA 260 (thus the -EX name) was adapted to a few CAP 231 airframes.

The CAP 231EX evolved in 1994. While the fuselage construction retained wood, a carbon-fiber wing was specially designed for durability and light weight. The design has won the World Championships in 1998, 2000 and 2007, as well as a number of other national-level competitions. It has a roll rate of 420° per second and a climb rate of nearly 3,300 feet per minute.

The CAP 232 just like the -230 and -231/-231EX were slightly modified to strengthen the fuselage structure after a fatal accident in 2005 which grounded them for a full year. Fuselage rib n°2 holding the landing gear and the wing spar has been reinforced externally and internally. The planes are now back to competition and came second (individual with a -231EX), sixth with a -232, and first team at the WAC 2007. In the years 1999-2005, examples were flown by the French Air Force aerobatics team.

<text>The Indigirka (; ) is a river in the Sakha Republic in Russia between the Yana to the west and the Kolyma to the east. It is long. The area of its basin is .

==History==
The isolated village of Russkoye Ustye, located on the delta of the Indigirka, is known for the unique traditional culture of the Russian settlers whose ancestors came there several centuries ago. Some historians have speculated that Russkoye Ustye was settled by Pomors in the early 17th century.

In 1638 explorer Ivan Rebrov reached the Indigirka. In 1636–42 Elisei Buza pioneered the overland route to the Indigirka river system. At about the same time, Poznik Ivanov ascended a tributary of the lower Lena, crossed the Verkhoyansk Range to the upper Yana, and then crossed the Chersky Range to the Indigirka. In 1642 Mikhail Stadukhin reached the Indigirka overland from the Lena.

Zashiversk on the Indigirka was an important colonial outpost during the early days of Russian colonization. It was subsequently abandoned in the 19th century. Other historical settlements, now long abandoned, were Podshiversk and Uyandinskoye Zimov&#x27;ye.

In 1892–94 Baron Eduard Von Toll carried out geological surveys in the basin of the Indigirka (among other Far-eastern Siberian rivers) on behalf of the Russian Academy of Sciences. During one year and two days the expedition covered , of which were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.

==Course==
It originates at the confluence of the long Tuora-Yuryakh (also known as Khastakh, Khalkan or Kalkan) river and the long Taryn-Yuryakh, both of which originate on the slopes of the Khalkan Range.

In its higher course, the river flows northwestwards along the Yana-Oymyakon Highlands, through the lowest part of the Oymyakon Plateau. Turning north, it cuts through several subranges of the Chersky Range. At the point where it crosses the Chemalgin Range the river narrows and flows into a deep gorge, forming rapids. 
Where it is joined by the Moma river from the southeast, the Indigirka reaches the Momo-Selennyakh Depression, a wide intermontane basin and the middle course of the river begins, where its valley expands. Turning northwards, the Indigirka cuts deeply across the Moma Range and flows northeastwards meandering across the Aby Lowland and widening to . After flowing between the neck formed by the eastern end of the Polousny Range and the western end of the Ulakhan-Chistay Range, it flows north with the Kondakov Plateau to the east across the Yana-Indigirka Lowland, part of the greater East Siberian Lowland. Further north, where the terrain becomes completely flat, the Indigirka divides into branches from the mouth, forming a wide delta. Its waters end up in the Kolyma Bay, East Siberian Sea. Gusinaya Bay is located to the northwest of the mouths of the Indigirka. 

The Indigirka freezes up in October and stays under the ice until May–June. 

===Tributaries===
The main tributaries of the Indigirka are, from source to mouth:

*Khastakh (Tuora-Yuryakh) (left)
*Taryn-Yuryakh (right)
*Kuydusun (left)
*Kyuyente (left)
*Elgi (left)
*Nera (right)
*Chibagalakh (left)
*Moma (right)
*Selennyakh (left)
*Druzhina (left)
*Badyarikha (right)
*Uyandina (left)
*Shangina (right)
*Bolshaya Ercha (right)
*Allaikha (left)
*Byoryolyokh (left, into Russko-Ustyinskaya)
*Shandrin (right, into Kolymskaya)
==Ports, settlements and economy==
Main ports on the river are: 
*Khonuu
*Druzhina
*Chokurdakh
*Tabor
There is a gold prospecting industry in the Indigirka basin. Ust-Nera, a gold-mining center, is the largest settlement on the river.

The Indigirka teems with a variety of fishes. Among the most valuable are several whitefish species, such as vendace, chir, muksun, inconnu (&quot;nelma&quot;), omul, etc.

==Mouths==
The Indigirka forms a large delta, consisting of a number of streams (each one being labeled on Russian maps as a &quot;photo ka&quot; (river arm)) and islands. About before reaching the East Siberian Sea (), the river splits into two major northeast-flowing streams. The left (westernmost) arm is known as the &quot;Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka&quot;; the right arm, the &quot;Srednyaya Protoka&quot; (Russian for the &quot;Middle Arm&quot;). Further downstream, the third major arm, the &quot;Kolymskaya Protoka&quot; splits off the &quot;Srednyaya Protoka&quot; as its right (eastern) distributary, thus justifying the &quot;middle&quot; moniker for the Srednyaya Protoka.

While &quot;Srednyaya Protoka&quot; means the &quot;Middle Arm&quot;, the names of the main western and eastern arms indicate their relative location as well. The &quot;Kolymskaya Protoka&quot;, or &quot;Kolymskoye Ustye&quot; is the arm one located on the eastern side, i.e. the &quot;Kolyma side&quot; of the delta (the arm closest to the Kolyma, the eastern neighbor of the Indigirka). The &quot;Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka&quot;, apparently known earlier as simply &quot;Russkoye Ustye&quot; is the arm one located on the western side, i.e. the &quot;Russian side&quot; of the delta (meaning, the side closest to the (European) Russia). These days the name of the &quot;Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka&quot; appears as if it were formed from the name of the old Russian village Russkoye Ustye situated there, but originally the opposite is likely to have been the case, the village is named after the river arm (the &quot;Russkoye Ustye&quot;) on which it was located.

Several flat islands are formed by the channels of the delta. Listed from the east to the west, the major ones are:

* Usun-Ary lies longitudinally along the coast east of the Srednyaya mouth. It is and wide.
* Uparovskiy Island lies completely detached offshore from the Srednyaya mouth. It is about long and 1 km wide.
* Ploskiy Island is the farthest offshore of a cluster of islands at the Srednyaya mouth. It is C-shaped and about 3  km long.
* Bolshoy Fedorovskiy lies between the two mouths of the Indigirka. It is 6 km long and has a maximum width of 4 km.
* Vkodnoy and Oleniy islands lie right at the Prot. Russko Ust&#x27;inskaya mouth . Both are of similar size, about 4 km in length.
* Krestovyy Island lies quiet isolated directly to the south of the Lopatka Peninsula, offshore to the northwest of the main Indigirka mouths. It is 6 km long and 1.6 km wide.

<text>A sceat or sceatta ( ; , ) was a small, thick silver coin minted in England, Frisia, and Jutland during the Anglo-Saxon period that normally weighed 0.8–1.3 grams. It is now (as of 2024) more commonly known in England as an &#x27;early penny&#x27;.

==History==
Its name derives from Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;wealth&quot;, &quot;money&quot;, and &quot;coin&quot;, which has been applied to these coins since the 17th century based on interpretations of the legal codes of Mercia and of Kent under its king Æthelberht. It is likely, however, that the coins were more often known to contemporaries as &quot;pennies&quot; (), much like their successor silver coins. They are very diverse, organized into over a hundred numbered types derived from the British Museum Catalogue of the 1890s and by broader alphabetical classifications laid out by British numismatist Stuart Rigold in the 1970s.

The huge volume of finds made in the last thirty years using metal detectors has radically altered understanding of this coinage and, while it is now clear that these coins were in everyday use across eastern and southern England in the early 8th century, it is also apparent that the current organization is in considerable need of adjustment.

==Legends==

Sceattas rarely carry legends of any kind, though a small number do name the mint of London and others carry short runic legends such as &#x27;Aethiliraed&#x27; and &#x27;Efe&#x27;, which probably refer to moneyers rather than kings.

==Imagery==
Although sceattas present many problems of organization, attribution, and dating, they also carry a variety of designs bespeaking extensive Celtic, classical, and Germanic influences. These designs include human figures, animals, birds, crosses, plants, and monsters, all of which have been elucidated by Anna Gannon. Tony Abramson has published an illustrated guide for nonexperts. One series (U), has been linked to King Aethelbald of Mercia (716-57) on the basis of its iconography, though this attribution is tenuous and recent research suggests it is very unlikely. It has also been suggested on the basis of the iconography of certain sceattas that they were issued by ecclesiastical authorities, such as bishops or abbots. Minting may not have been a strictly urban or secular prerogative, and coins were used for many payments and purposes beyond pure commercial buying and selling.

==Minting==

Associating sceattas with particular mints or kingdoms is very difficult and must be based primarily upon study of find-spots. Most have been found using metal detectors since the 1970s. In this way, it has been possible to attribute some types with considerable confidence, such as series H with Wessex (and in particular Southampton) and series S with Essex. In Denmark, series X has been plausibly associated with the early trading center at Ribe.

The chronology of the sceattas is also very hard to unravel. Some of the earliest series use the same designs as the pale gold thrymsas (similar to the continental ; notionally one-third of a pure gold solidus) and, by analogy with coins from the better-understood Frankish material, can be dated to the 680s. It is known that sceattas were minted in the Frisian town of Dorestad (just south of Utrecht in the Netherlands); they were a commonly circulating currency in the Frankish realm until the monetary reform of Pepin the Short instituted at Ver in 755.

The thirty or forty years after 680 saw the production and circulation of the &quot;primary series&quot; of sceattas, which were generally of good metal quality and weight They were largely minted in Kent and the Thames Estuary, though a few were produced in Northumbria bearing the name of King Aldfrith The &quot;secondary series&quot;, struck from to saw a massive expansion of minting all over southern and eastern England to every major Anglo-Saxon kingdom. One or more types can be attributed with more or less confidence to Wessex, Mercia, Sussex, Essex, Kent, Northumbria, and East Anglia.

There was much copying and debasement, and weight could fluctuate considerably There are relatively few hoards from this period with which to construct even a relative chronology, and any new discovery could radically alter current scholarly understanding. The end of the sceattas is especially difficult to pinpoint, and it is likely that there was a period of some decades in the middle of the 8th century when very few if any coins were produced in England.

<doc id="1014227" wikidata="Q62913" url="?curid=1014227" title="Mark Weiser">
<text>Mark D. Weiser (July 23, 1952 – April 27, 1999) was an American computer scientist and chief technology officer (CTO) at Xerox PARC. Weiser is widely considered to be the father of ubiquitous computing, a term he coined in 1988. Within Silicon Valley, Weiser was broadly viewed as a visionary and computer pioneer, and his ideas have influenced many of the world&#x27;s leading computer scientists.

==Early life and education==
Weiser was born in Chicago, Illinois, to David and Audra Weiser. He grew up in Stony Brook, New York. He moved to Sarasota, Florida, to study philosophy at New College of Florida but dropped out in his second year when he ran out of money. He then moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he found a job as a computer programmer. While working as a computer programmer he began taking computer science classes and excelled to the point that he was directly admitted into a master&#x27;s program at the University of Michigan. He studied Computer and Communication Science at the University of Michigan, receiving an M.A. in 1976, and a Ph.D. in 1979. 

==Career==
Weiser later taught computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park and became associate chairman of the department in 1986.

Weiser joined PARC (then Xerox PARC) in 1987 and became manager of its computer science laboratory in 1988, the same year he pioneered the concept of ubiquitous computing. He became PARC&#x27;s chief technology officer in 1996.

==Honors==
In 2001, the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s special interest group in operating systems (SIGOPS) established the Mark Weiser Award for individuals who innovate within operating systems research. The Mark D. Weiser Excellence in Computing Scholarship Fund at the University of California, Berkeley was also established in Weiser&#x27;s memory.

==Personal life==
In addition to his work in the field of computer science, Weiser was also the drummer for the avant-garde/experimental rock band, Severe Tire Damage, which was the first band to broadcast live over the Internet.

On April 27, 1999, Weiser died of liver failure that was caused by cancer.

==Ubiquitous computing and calm technology==
During one of his talks, Weiser outlined a set of principles describing ubiquitous computing:

* The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
* The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
* The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your &quot;unconscious&quot;.
* Technology should create calm.

In &quot;Designing Calm Technology&quot;, Weiser and John Seely Brown describe &quot;calm technology&quot; as &quot;that which informs but doesn&#x27;t demand our focus or attention.&quot;

==Low-powered portable computing==
Weiser advocated to look at performance in non traditional ways. Instead of measuring computational performance in MIPS, he focused on increasing the instructions per joule of energy, pushing the computer industry toward low-powered portable computing.

<text>Napoleon and Samantha is a 1972 American adventure drama film directed by Bernard McEveety and written by Stewart Raffill. Filmed in and around John Day, Oregon, it stars Johnny Whitaker and Jodie Foster (in her feature film debut) in the title roles.

==Plot==
Eleven-year-old Napoleon lives with his grandfather. He and his grandfather adopt a lion named Major when by chance they meet an old clown who cannot take him back to Europe. The old lion has bad teeth and only drinks milk so they put Major in the chicken cage to look after him. When Napoleon&#x27;s grandfather dies of old age, Napoleon asks a young grad student named Danny to help bury his grandfather. Uncertain about his future, Napoleon runs off with the lion, a pet rooster, and his eight year old friend Samantha to try to find Danny, now a goat herder who lives in the mountains, and so Napoleon can avoid being sent to an orphanage.

Along their way, the two children encounter many dangers. Napoleon nearly falls off a cliff, but Major manages to pull him up with a rope. They have to cross a river which Major does not like, since most cats are afraid of water. A cougar attacks Napoleon&#x27;s rooster, but Major easily defeats the much smaller cat and chases it up a tree. While Napoleon is out looking for wood he comes across an angry black bear that chases him back to where Samantha is resting with Major. At first, Major is too tired and wants to sleep while Samantha desperately tries to wake him. But as soon as the lion hears the roar of the bear, he stands up to challenge his opponent and protect the children. As the bear is much closer in size to Major than the cougar was, the two beasts fight hard but Major eventually gains the upper hand and the bear runs away.

Eventually the children find Danny&#x27;s cabin and he takes them in with the hope of convincing Napoleon that orphanages really aren&#x27;t that bad. Danny leaves the kids with a man named Mark Pierson and attempts to find Samantha&#x27;s family to notify them, but he is arrested and accused of kidnapping the children. While at the police station, Danny notices a photo of Mark, who happens to be a dangerous psychopath, and he escapes to rescue them. He steals a motorcycle and the police chase him all the way back to his cabin, where they find and arrest the wanted man.

When things are back to normal, Napoleon takes Major and tries to run away again to live with the Indians, but Danny catches up. Danny explains that the Indians don&#x27;t really live out in the wild anymore, and that Napoleon should give foster care a try, with a promise that Major could stay in the mountains and live with him. Napoleon agrees and they go back to Danny&#x27;s cabin.

==Production==
It was the second film written by Stewart Raffill, who was an animal supervisor-turned-writer-and-director. He sold the script to Disney and worked on the film as an animal supervisor and producer.

The film was largely shot in John Day, Oregon.
Foster was mauled by a substitute lion used on the film set and still has scars on her back and stomach (the same lion nearly mauled Bob Denver in the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode &quot;Feed the Kitty&quot;, also as a stand-in for Zamba). &quot;I was walking ahead of him. He was on an invisible leash, some piano wire. He got sick of me being slow, picked me up and held me sideways and shook me like a doll.&quot; &quot;I was in shock and thought it was an earthquake. I turned around and saw the entire crew running off in the other direction. The trainer then said, &#x27;Drop it&#x27; and he opened his mouth and dropped me.&quot; The incident left her with lifelong ailurophobia.

In response to claims that Zamba (the main lion in the movie) was involved in the mauling incident, Foster fiercely defended Zamba, insisting that the lion that attacked her was a substitute.

<doc id="1014230" wikidata="Q3112908" url="?curid=1014230" title="Sgt. Rock">
<text>Sergeant Franklin John Rock, also known as simply Sgt. Rock, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Sgt. Rock first appeared in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #83 (June 1959), and was created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert. The character is a World War II soldier who served as an infantry non-commissioned officer.

==Publication history==
Sgt. Rock&#x27;s prototype first appeared in &quot;G.I. Combat&quot; #68 (January 1959). His rank is not given in this story; instead, he is merely called &quot;The Rock&quot;. The Rock returned as a sergeant in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #81 (April 1959) named &quot;Sgt. Rocky&quot; with his unit, Easy Company (the precise US Army infantry regiment to which Easy belonged was never identified during the history of the character). This second prototype story was written by Bob Haney, but the character&#x27;s creator, Robert Kanigher, was the editor. Kanigher would go on to create the bulk of the stories with Joe Kubert as the artist. In issue #82 (May 1959), he is called &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; (name only) and by issue #83 (June 1959), he makes his first full appearance as Sgt. Rock.

&quot;Our Army at War&quot; steadily gained popularity, until, in 1977, the name of the comic was changed to &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;. The comic ran until &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #422 (July 1988). In addition to the semi-regular comic, several &quot;digests&quot; were sold, under the &quot;DC Special Blue Ribbon Digest&quot; banner, reprinting stories from &quot;Our Army at War&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;. Some were subtitled as &quot;OAAW&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;, some as &quot;Sgt. Rock&#x27;s Prize Battle Tales&quot; (the &quot;Prize Battle Tales&quot; title was also used on earlier 80-page annual specials). The digest format was &quot; × &quot;, softcover, with 98 full-color pages and no advertisements.

A 21-issue run of reprints followed from 1988 to 1991, and two &quot;Sgt. Rock Specials&quot; with new content saw publication in 1992 and 1994. A Christmas-themed story appeared in &quot;DCU Holiday Bash II&quot; in 1997, again featuring new content.

According to John Wells, in &quot;Fanzing 36&quot; (July 2001), an online fan magazine:

In at least one Sgt. Rock comic book published in the late 1960s, it was revealed that Sgt. Rock had a brother who was an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, fighting in the Pacific Theater. In this episode, Sgt. Rock told his fellow soldiers about a weird combat incident that his brother had taken part in on a Pacific island, shown in the comic in a &quot;flashback&quot; style. Larry Rock became an aide to general Douglas Mac Arthur and was kidnapped by the Nazis and tortured for information on the planned re-taking of the Philippines. Sgt. Rock attempted to rescue him but Larry was presumed dead when he fell from a mountain cable car (SGT.ROCK ANNUAL #2). One of the last Kanigher SGT.ROCK issues showed Larry living as a peaceful amnesiac in neutral Switzerland. Rock never reported his survival, figuring Larry had earned his peace.

A Viet Nam soldier by the name of Adam Rock appears in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #16 (May 1975), though it is never specifically stated if he is intended to be a relative of Frank Rock.

DC Comics published &quot;Sgt. Rock: The Lost Battalion&quot;, written and drawn by William Tucci, starting in November 2008. The story places Rock and Easy Company with the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry, which was surrounded by German forces in the Vosges Mountains on October 24, 1944, and eventually rescued by the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team.

&quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; also revives other World War II–era DC characters, such as the Haunted Tank, and &quot;Navajo Ace&quot; Johnny Cloud, and the story itself is mainly narrated by combat journalist William J. Kilroy, and German General Friedrich Wiese.

==Fictional character biography==
During World War II, Sgt. Rock fought in the infantry branch of the U.S. Army in the European Theatre and eventually rose to authority within his unit, Easy Company. The unit was a collection of disparate individuals who managed to participate in every major action in the European war. Rock&#x27;s dog-tag number was 409966, which had been, it was claimed, Robert Kanigher&#x27;s own military serial number.

Robert Kanigher mused in letters columns in the 1970s and 1980s that Rock probably belonged to &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (First US Infantry Division) given his appearance on battlefields in North Africa, Italy, and Northwest Europe. Rock&#x27;s backstory was fleshed out in different comics over the years; generally he is considered to have come from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he worked in a steel mill. Enlisting after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to North Africa as a private but promotion came quickly as his superiors were killed, to assistant squad leader, squad leader, and then platoon sergeant. During the main series, his unit is only ever given as &quot;Easy Company&quot;, but no regiment or division is named nor is unit insignia ever shown. Rock is shown to have two siblings (&quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #421): Larry, a Marine fighting in the Pacific and Amy, a nun.

In the 2009 six-issue miniseries &quot;Sgt. Rock: The Lost Battalion&quot; Rock&#x27;s unit is still referred to as &quot;Easy Company&quot; but is of the 141st Infantry Regiment. However, in the closing pages of the last issue, the narration states that, following the end of the story, &quot;as usual, Sgt. Rock&#x27;s &#x27;Combat-Happy Joes&#x27; moved out to fill the ranks of another Easy Company left fractured by war&quot;, moving them to the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division, under 2nd Lieutenant Audie Murphy. A famous tagline of Rock&#x27;s is: &quot;Nothin&#x27;s easy in Easy Company&quot;.

Rock also usually wears the chevrons and rockers of a Master Sergeant on his uniform and also applied, oversize, to the front of his helmet.

It is likely Rock&#x27;s official position in Easy Company was of senior platoon sergeant though dialogue and scripts are usually vague on his actual responsibilities and duties. He usually leads patrols and appears to have powers of command over the men of the company. Several officer characters also appeared in the comic, as both platoon and company commanders, all of whom were regarded by Rock as superiors. Ever the model NCO, Sgt. Rock always rendered proper respect to these officers, and was always quick to give advice to not only ensure success, but for that officer to gain confidence and experience as a leader. Easy&#x27;s commander was usually referred to as &quot;the skipper&quot; by Rock. Rock in turn was referred to by others as the &quot;topkick&quot;, or senior non-commissioned officer in the company. Most infantry companies did not have master sergeants; significantly, Rock does not have the diamond of a first sergeant on his rank insignia.

In a flashback in &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, the Unknown Soldier presents Sgt. Rock and Easy Company with information about Per Degaton&#x27;s Nazi experiments.

==Powers and abilities==
* Rock is a crack shot, able to shoot down several German fighter planes with a single submachine gun, and able to throw hand grenades with amazing accuracy.
* Rock is a highly effective close combat fighter, mostly shown using a style of street fighting mixed with boxing and judo.
* Rock seems to have close to superhuman endurance and strength, surviving a large number of gunshot wounds, fragments from hand grenades, exposure to freezing water and other hazards. Rock&#x27;s powers seem to be more realistic in Bob Kanigher&#x27;s stories than in Joe Kubert&#x27;s.
* Rock&#x27;s &quot;Combat Antenna&quot; is what he calls a kind of sixth sense to warn him of impending enemy attack. This usually allows him at least some time to warn Easy Co. even if it rarely allows them to get out of harm&#x27;s way entirely.
* With very few exceptions, Rock maintains complete calm and determination under fire, even when the odds are stacked high against his and Easy Co.&#x27;s success.
* Rock also has a heart. The one thing that (almost) had him breaking down is when the Nazis scraped the very bottom of the barrel and were sending teenage boys out against Rock and his men, or when he and his company were guarding a group of children who had to be evacuated from an orphanage, and one died from a German bullet.

== Equipment ==
The classic Rock was usually dressed in olive drab fatigues, with a .45-caliber M1A1 Thompson submachine gun (although sometimes he is shown using an M50 Reising instead) and .45-caliber Colt M1911A1 semi-automatic pistol as his armament. Oddly, the classic artwork almost always depicts Rock with an M1 Garand cartridge belt which would be useless to him, as well as two belts of .50-caliber ammunition (drawn as .30 caliber fabric belted for M1917 Browning machine gun), which Rock considers lucky charms. Artists John Severin and Russ Heath sometimes attempted a more realistic portrayal of Rock&#x27;s equipment, but the .50-caliber ammunition remained a personal trademark. Rock is always shown with a number of hand grenades secured to his equipment.

==Fates of Sgt. Rock==
The ultimate fate of Sgt. Frank Rock is complicated. There were initially two versions of the character, one residing on Earth-One and the other residing on Earth-Two. According to a number of stories, he was killed on the last day of the war by the last enemy bullet fired. However, DC has also published a number of stories incorporating a post-war Rock into the modern stories of superheroes, including appearances alongside Batman, Superman, and the Suicide Squad.

In stories told after the demise of his own comic book, Rock&#x27;s character was revived, explained to have survived the war, and went on to perform covert missions for the United States government. He also battled his old foe, the Iron Major, and went on an adventure to Dinosaur Island with his old second in command, Bulldozer. According to John Wells:Kanigher had established Frank&#x27;s post-war survival in &quot;OAAW&quot; #168, wherein he had Rock visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and Bob Haney picked up on that fact in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. In issue #84, he&#x27;d had Rock and Easy cross paths with Bruce Wayne during the war (in an episode obviously set on Earth-Two) and followed up with a present-day sequel in &quot;Brave &amp; the Bold&quot; #96. In that one, Bruce arrived at the United States Embassy in South America and was introduced to &quot;our Military Attache and Chief of Embassy Security ... Sergeant Rock, U.S. Army&quot;. Two subsequent present-day episodes found Rock tracking a Satanic figure that he believed was Adolf Hitler (&quot;B&amp;B&quot; #108) and an Easy Company &quot;ghost&quot; that he&#x27;d been ordered to execute at the Battle of the Bulge (&quot;B&amp;B&quot; #117). In the bizarre &quot;Brave &amp; the Bold&quot; #124, Bob Haney and Jim Aparo actually guest-starred as Rock and Batman trailed a terrorist organization called the 1000. Following this, he appeared as a general and a Chief of Staff for Lex Luthor&#x27;s administration. However, Frank Rock was involved with an incarnation of the Suicide Squad. At the end of the title, he peels off a mask and walks away from the team, while his companion &quot;Bulldozer&quot;, assumed to be the original, stands up from his wheelchair, comments on how it was good to feel young again, and also walks away. Whether this was the real Frank Rock in disguise or an impostor is unknown; the series concludes with the line &quot;Frank Rock died in 1945&quot;.

The use of the Rock character in post-war stories had one major effect on Rock&#x27;s backstory, according to Wells:All of the super-hero crossovers were more than Kanigher could take. In the letter columns of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #316 and 323 and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #347 and 348, he announced that his hero had not lived past 1945, blunting most of Haney&#x27;s &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; episodes if nothing else. He also proclaimed: &quot;It is inevitable and wholly in character that neither Rock nor Easy survived the closing days of the war&quot;. Indeed, in the letter column for &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #374, Kanigher stated that:As far as I&#x27;m concerned ROCK is the only authentic World War II Soldier. For obvious reasons. He and Easy Company live only, and will eventually die, to the last man, in World War II.

The first use of the Rock character after the demise of the series was an issue of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, six months after the release of &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #422. The story was set in May 1945, intimating that Sgt. Rock had survived the war in Europe and raised the question of whether Rock transferred to the Pacific theater.

During the Imperiex War set in the early 2000s, Rock acted as head of the Joint Chiefs, volunteering for the suicide mission to pilot a plane loaded with nuclear bombs as part of a plan to crack Imperiex&#x27;s armor and drain his energy. In a conversation with Strange Visitor, he states that he would prefer to be dead rather than live for so long after the war and seeing so many other good men die while he survived. Following the victory against Imperiex, Amanda Waller oversees his symbolic funeral in Arlington with other World War II heroes, informing Luthor over the phone that Rock had no interest in being remembered and would simply want to rest in peace with his peers.

In keeping with Robert Kanigher&#x27;s often-mentioned (in letter columns and interviews) but never-scripted conclusion to Rock&#x27;s wartime adventures (Kanigher did not get the chance to write this tale himself before he died in 2002), Len Wein and Joe Kubert&#x27;s 2010 back-up story &quot;Snapshot: Remembrance&quot; from the retrospective miniseries &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot; #4 (depicting a July 4, 1976 DC war heroes&#x27; reunion) reveals that Sgt. Rock did die at the close of WWII. Flashbacks illustrate Rock being killed on the last day of the war in Europe, while using his body to shield a small child who had wandered into crossfire. Easy Company learns later that the final bullet that killed him was the last bullet fired in the war. The other DC war heroes attending this bicentennial reunion (and toasting the memory of Sgt. Rock) are Jeb Stuart of the Haunted Tank, all four Losers, Ulysses Hazard/Gravedigger, Mademoiselle Marie (who introduces her unnamed son, a soldier almost identical in appearance to Sgt. Rock—who is strongly implied to be his father) and the Unknown Soldier disguised (with one of his signature latex masks) as Bob the bartender.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Sgt. Rock appears in &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. This version is a member of Team 7 before being killed during an attack on a terrorist camp.

==Reception==
Sgt. Rock was ranked as the 183rd-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also listed Sgt. Rock as the 78th-greatest comic book hero of all time stating that Sgt. Rock represents the epitome of DC&#x27;s often overlooked World War II comics.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Sgt. Rock appears in the &quot;Justice League&quot; three-part episode &quot;The Savage Time&quot;, voiced by Fred Dryer.
* Sgt. Rock appears in the teaser for the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Plague of the Prototypes!&quot;, voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

===Film===
* In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Arnold Schwarzenegger was attached to play Sgt. Rock in a film produced by Joel Silver, with screenplays written by David Peoples (1987), Steven E. de Souza (1988), John Milius (1993), and Brian Helgeland (1996) depicting Rock as German-American before John Cox wrote a new screenplay unrelated to the previous drafts. Eventually, Cox stated that Schwarzenegger was no longer attached to star in the project. In April 2007, David Gambino, VP of Silver Pictures said, &quot;The good news is we have a fantastic screenplay and everybody&#x27;s really happy with it. It&#x27;s really just about trying to attach cast right now and really decide what the movie is going to be, how we&#x27;re going to make it&quot;. Bruce Willis was reportedly in consideration for the role and Guy Ritchie rumored to direct. However, in December 2008, Ritchie said that while the film was shelved due to his work on &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, he confirmed that the &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; film would be set during World War II and include the Easy Company. In February 2010, Silver announced that the film would now be set in the near future. Francis Lawrence was later announced to be directing the film with Chad St. John writing the screenplay, but there has been no development since.
* Sgt. Rock appears in &quot;DC Showcase: Sgt. Rock&quot;, voiced by Karl Urban.

* On September 3, 2024, it was reported that Luca Guadagnino was attached to directing a Sgt. Rock film, with 2024 collaborator Justin Kuritzkes writing. On November 19, 2024, it was announced that the studio and Guadagnino were seeking recent &quot;Queer&quot; collaborator Daniel Craig to play the titular role, but later in February 2025, Craig was reported to never have been attached to the film and the studio were now looking at Jeremy Allen White in the lead role. Filming is expected to begin in late 2025.

=== Video games ===
* Activision confirmed at E3 1997 that they were developing a Sgt. Rock game for the PlayStation, set for release in 1998, but the game was never mentioned again.

==Merchandise and collectibles==

* A line of &quot; action figures bearing the Sgt. Rock name was released in the 1980s by Remco Toys, likely as a result of the popularity of Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe toy line. The figures had little resemblance to the World War II characters of the comic books. The Sgt. Rock figure was depicted in Vietnam-era fatigues and gear and had an M16 rifle instead of a Thompson submachine gun. Other generic figures were sold, with no other characters recognizable from the comics. These US troops also had Vietnam-era equipment and helmets/helmet covers or berets, and were collectively referred to as &quot;Tough Action Soldiers&quot;. &quot;Enemy&quot; soldiers were simply toys produced from the same molds used to make the US soldiers, painted black with blue helmets. Each figure came with a plastic dog tag on which purchasers could ink their name and rank. A serial number was printed on a paper sticker affixed to the plastic tag, which also came with a silver-colored string to suspend the tag around the neck. Playsets included plastic machine gun and mortar bunkers. The quality of these toys was very low; soft plastic was used, and joints had limited movement, especially compared to the G.I. Joe line of &quot; action figures.
* There was also a range of diecast metal vehicles, produced by Universal Toys for Azrak-Hamway of New York. These were packaged on cards similar to the Remco Action Figures. The range included two tanks, a Jeep, a staff car and an ambulance.

* In 2002, a limited edition of 12&quot; Sgt. Rock figures was released by Hasbro, as part of the 12&quot; G.I. Joe line, including four other characters from the comic book series; Bulldozer, Little Sure Shot, Jackie Johnson and Wildman. The figures wore World War II-era fatigues and mostly carried the same weapons as in the comic books (though the Bulldozer figure carries an M-1 rifle instead of an air-cooled Browning .30-calibre machine gun). A female figure was also released, portraying French Resistance fighter Mademoiselle Marie, Sgt. Rock&#x27;s only love interest during the comic book series. A number of playsets were also produced by Dreams and Visions in 2003.
* Sgt. Rock received a figure in the HeroClix line as part of the &quot;Cosmic Justice&quot; expansion. Additionally, a limited edition tournament prize figure of &quot;General Frank Rock&quot; was released as well.

==In pop culture==
* In the graphic novel &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, Tank Girl&#x27;s helmet has &quot;Sgt. Rock Can&#x27;t Dock&quot; written on it.
* The English rock band XTC included a song called &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; on their 1980 album &quot;Black Sea&quot;. The song was released as a single that December and reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart. Songwriter Andy Partridge would later pen songs about two other DC Comics characters, Supergirl (on their 1986 album Skylarking) and Brainiac&#x27;s Daughter (on the 1987 Dukes of Stratosphear album Psonic Psunspots).
* The character Xander Harris made frequent references to Rock on the TV series &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;.
* During the end credits of the 1987 film &quot;Predator&quot;, Lt. Hawkins (Shane Black) is shown reading &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #408 (February 1986).
* One issue of the underground comic &quot;Dopin&#x27; Dan&quot; had a Sgt. Rock parody called Sgt. Jock. It featured the main character leading a dispirited platoon in the Vietnam War and taking out two deliberately anachronistic foes by impossible means, namely destroying a Tiger Tank with nothing but a brass knuckles assisted punch, then downing a Stuka dive bomber by throwing a bayonet through the windshield, killing the pilot.
* On the TV series &quot;Trucks!&quot;, host Stacey David built an off-road truck out of a 1941 Dodge WC-14 and named it Sgt. Rock.
* Sgt. Rock is mentioned in Elliott Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Color Bars&quot;.
* The back cover art of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1974 album &quot;Endless Summer&quot; depicts Carl Wilson reading a Sgt. Rock comic.
* In the film &quot;&quot;The Package&quot;&quot;, the character played by Tommy Lee Jones is compared to Sgt. Rock.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a number of trade paperbacks:

<doc id="1014242" wikidata="Q887192" url="?curid=1014242" title="Horse Feathers">
<text>Horse Feathers is a 1932 American pre-Code comedy film starring the Marx Brothers. It stars the Four Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo), Thelma Todd and David Landau. It was written by Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S. J. Perelman, and Will B. Johnstone. Kalmar and Ruby also wrote the original songs for the film. Several of the film&#x27;s gags were taken from the Marx Brothers&#x27; stage comedy from the 1900s, &quot;Fun in Hi Skule&quot;. The term &quot;&quot; is U.S. slang for &quot;nonsense, rubbish, balderdash,&quot; attributed originally to Billy DeBeck. As a work published in 1932 and renewed within 28 years, it will enter the public domain on January 1, 2028.

==Plot==
The film revolves around college football and a game between the fictional Darwin and Huxley Colleges. Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, the new president of Huxley College, is convinced by his son Frank, a student at the school, to recruit professional football players to help Huxley&#x27;s losing football team. Baravelli is an &quot;iceman&quot;, who delivers ice and bootleg liquor from a local speakeasy. Pinky is also an &quot;iceman&quot; and a part-time dogcatcher. Through a series of misunderstandings, Baravelli and Pinky are accidentally recruited to play for Huxley instead of the actual professional players.

The climax of the film, which ESPN listed as first in its &quot;top 11 scenes in football movie history,&quot; includes the four protagonists winning the football game by successfully performing a version of the hidden ball trick and then scoring the winning touchdown in a horse-drawn garbage wagon that Pinky rides like a chariot. A picture of the brothers in the &quot;chariot&quot; near the end of the film made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1932.

==Cast==
* Groucho Marx as Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff
* Harpo Marx as Pinky
* Chico Marx as Baravelli
* Zeppo Marx as Frank Wagstaff
* Thelma Todd as Connie Bailey
* David Landau as Jennings
;Uncredited Cast
==Musical numbers==
* &quot;I&#x27;m Against It&quot;
* &quot;I Always Get My Man&quot;
* &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; 
* &quot;Collegiate&quot; (Chico playing)
* &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot;
* &quot;Wedding March&quot;

The film prominently features the song &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;, by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. (This song was later the title song of a 1996 Woody Allen movie). All four brothers perform the song, almost every time as a serenade to Connie Bailey. Zeppo leads with a &quot;straight&quot; verse:

Harpo whistles it once to his horse, and he later plays it on the harp to serenade Miss Bailey. Chico sings a comic verse, with his standard fake Italian accent, while playing piano:

Groucho sings a sarcastic verse, sitting in a canoe strumming a guitar as Miss Bailey paddles. This is in line with his suspicions about the college widow&#x27;s intentions throughout the film.

==Notable scenes==

In the opening number Wagstaff and a group of college professors sing and dance in full academic robes and mortarboard hats:

A later scene features Baravelli guarding the speakeasy and Wagstaff trying to get in. The password for entry is &quot;Swordfish&quot;. This sequence degenerates into a series of puns:

At the door, Pinky is also asked the password. He responds by pulling a fish from his coat and sticking a small sword down its throat.

Later Wagstaff and Baravelli debate the cost of ice. Wagstaff argues that his bill should be much smaller than it is:

And on another subject: 


A notable scene taken from the earlier revue &quot;Fun in Hi Skule&quot; consists of the brothers disrupting an anatomy class. The professor asks for a student to explain the symptoms of cirrhosis. Baravelli obliges:

The professor protests that his facts are in order: Baravelli and Pinky bear him out. Wagstaff takes over the class and continues the lecture.

A little later, Wagstaff advises Pinky that he can&#x27;t burn the candle at both ends. Pinky then reaches into his trenchcoat, and produces a candle burning at both ends.

Foreshadowing the &quot;stateroom&quot; scene from the 1935 film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, all four Marx brothers and the main antagonist take turns going in and out of Connie Bailey&#x27;s room, and eventually their movements pile up on each other, resulting in a crowded, bustling scene, notable both by Groucho&#x27;s breaking of the fourth wall during Chico&#x27;s piano solo, and his constant opening of his umbrella and removing his overshoes upon entering the room. The overshoes were commonly known as &#x27;rubbers&#x27;, a reference to contraceptives, a visual gag about Groucho&#x27;s intentions towards Connie.

Eventually, Pinky and Baravelli are sent to kidnap two of the rival college&#x27;s star players to prevent them from playing in the big game. The intended victims (who are much larger men than Pinky and Baravelli) manage to kidnap the pair instead, removing their outer clothing and locking them in a room. Pinky and Baravelli make their escape by sawing their way out through the floor. The saws came from a tool bag Pinky carried with them that held their kidnappers&#x27; tools, which included, among other things, rope, chisels, hammers and at one point, a small pig. This is an example of the surreal edge of Marx Brothers humor.

One direct example of that influence occurs in the speakeasy scene. Two men are playing cards, and one says to the other, &quot;cut the cards&quot;. Pinky happens to walk by at that moment, pulls a hatchet out of his trenchcoat and chops the deck in half. This none-too-subtle gag, recycled from the brothers&#x27; first Broadway show, &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot; (1924), was repeated by Curly Howard against Moe Howard in The Three Stooges&#x27; short &quot;Ants in the Pantry&quot; (1936), and by Bugs Bunny in &quot;Bugs Bunny Rides Again&quot; (1948).

==Reception==

Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;aroused riotous laughter from those who packed the theatre&quot; on opening night. &quot;Some of the fun is even more reprehensible than the doings of these clowns in previous films,&quot; Hall wrote, &quot;but there is no denying that their antics and their patter are helped along by originality and ready wit.&quot; &quot;Laffs galore, swell entertainment,&quot; wrote &quot;Variety&quot;, while &quot;Film Daily&quot; reported, &quot;Full of laughs that will rock any house.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a rather more slight and trivial affair than the other Marx offerings,&quot; but still acknowledged the Marxes as &quot;very special; there is no one else like Groucho or Harpo on stage or screen, and probably never will be. So familiar now is the sense of humor they arouse that the mere idea of their presence starts a laugh.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

==Production==
The caricatures of the four brothers that are briefly flashed during the credits are taken from a promotional poster from their previous film, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. 
===Chico&#x27;s injury=== 
Production of the film was hindered when Chico was severely injured in a car accident, suffering a shattered knee and multiple broken ribs. This delayed production by more than two months and limited Chico&#x27;s participation in filming.

As a result, the movie was filmed so that Chico was sitting down in the majority of scenes he was in. It required a body double to be used in some of the football scenes, most notably during the shot where the Four Marx Brothers chase a horse-drawn garbage wagon, climb in and head off in the opposite direction; Chico&#x27;s double is taller than the other brothers by several inches.

==Period references==
A term that occurs often in &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, but may not be familiar to modern viewers, is &quot;college widow&quot; (see also &quot;The College Widow&quot;, a 1904 play). The somewhat derogatory term referred to a young woman who remains near a college year after year to associate with male students. It is used to describe Connie Bailey. Such women were considered &quot;easy&quot;. Miss Bailey is shown to be involved with each of the characters played by the Brothers, as well as the principal antagonist Jennings.

At one point during the climactic football game, Wagstaff exclaims, &quot;Jumping anaconda!&quot; This is a ‘minced oath’, an expression used in sports stories of the time to show the colourful language used by coaches, without using actual samples, not then considered fit to print. This particular one also alludes to the notorious stock market performance of Anaconda Copper immediately preceding the Great Depression. All of the Marx Brothers had experienced severe losses in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Groucho had delivered other jokes related to the stock market in the Brothers&#x27; preceding films (for example, &quot;The stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today&quot; in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;), and used Anaconda itself in a Eugene O’Neill parody in 1930&#x27;s &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;.

==Missing sequences==

The only existing prints of this film are missing several minutes, owing to censorship and damage. The damage is most noticeable in jump cuts during the scene in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo visit Connie Bailey&#x27;s apartment.

:Connie: &quot;Baravelli, you&quot; overcome me.
:Baravelli: All right, but remember—&quot;it was your idea&quot;.

Several sequences were cut from the film, including an extended ending to the apartment scene, additional scenes with Pinky as a dogcatcher, and a sequence in which the brothers play poker as the college burns down. (A description of the latter scene still exists in a pressbook from the year of the film&#x27;s release, along with a still photograph.) The August 15, 1932 &quot;Time&quot; magazine review of the film says of Harpo in the speakeasy scene, &quot;He bowls grapefruit at bottles on the bar.&quot; This joke is also missing from the current print.

<text>Confidence is a small unincorporated community in Wayne County, Iowa, United States. Located in south central Iowa, the community lies along County Highway J18 in the northeastern corner of its county, just west of Rathbun Lake.

==History==
Confidence was originally platted in 1858, and its population and economic activity peaked in the 1920s, the peak of coal mining activity in the area. The first coal mines in the area date from approximately the 1860s, although in the 19th century, they were small, serving only the local market. By the end of the 19th century, L. Frye was the principal mine owner in the area. Frye&#x27;s mines were in the Mystic coal seam, which was not much over thick in this area. In 1905, he opened a new mine with a shaft and a steam hoist. This mine was just 1/4 mile south of an older Frye mine that had mined out just of coal. Other mines in the area included the J. Hayhurst Bank and the Jared Bank.
Confidence&#x27;s population was 51 in 1902, and 77 in 1925.

The town changed drastically as a result of the Great Depression. In its prime, the town boasted a millinery, a tavern, a shoe shop, and a bank. The bank paid off all its deposits upon closing in 1935.

The population was 77 in 1940.

By the end of the 20th century, Confidence was a virtual ghost town, with only a handful of occupied houses, a derelict church, a cemetery, a park, and the New Providence Baptist Church , housed in its current building since 1981. Its postal address designations are split between Melrose, ZIP code 52569, and Plano, ZIP code 52581. Its area is part of the Wayne Community School District, based in Corydon.

Other nearby towns include Russell, in Lucas County; Albia, seat of Monroe County; Centerville and Moravia, in Appanoose County.

<text>The Yana (; ) is a river in Sakha in Russia, located between the Lena to the west and the Indigirka to the east.

==Course==
It is long, and its drainage basin covers . Including its longest source river, the Sartang, it is long. Its annual discharge totals approximately . Most of this discharge occurs in May and June as the ice on the river breaks up. The Yana freezes up on the surface in October and stays under the ice until late May or early June. In the Verkhoyansk area, it stays frozen to the bottom for 70 to 110 days, and partly frozen for 220 days of the year.

The river begins at the confluence of the rivers Sartang and Dulgalakh in the Yana-Oymyakon Highlands. It flows north across the vast Yana-Indigirka Lowland, part of the greater East Siberian Lowland, shared with the Indigirka to the east. As the river flows into the Yana Bay of the Laptev Sea, it forms a huge river delta covering . Yarok is a large flat island located east of the main mouths of the Yana.

There are approximately 40,000 lakes in the Yana basin, including both alpine lakes formed from glaciation in the Verkhoyansk Mountains (lowlands were always too dry for glaciation) and overflow lakes on the marshy plains in the north of the basin. The whole Yana basin is under continuous permafrost and most is larch woodland grading to tundra north of about 70°N, though trees extend into suitable microhabitats right to the delta.

Verkhoyansk, Batagay, Ust-Kuyga, and Nizhneyansk are the main ports on the Yana.

The Yana basin is the site of the so-called Pole of Cold of Russia, where the lowest recorded temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere are found. In the winter, temperatures in the centre of the basin average as low as and have reached as low as ; in the mountains it is believed that temperatures have reached . Yakut folklore says that, at such temperatures, if you shout to a friend and they cannot hear you, it is because the words have frozen in the air. However, when spring comes the words &quot;thaw&quot; and one can hear everything that was said months ago.

=== Tributaries===
The main tributaries of the Yana are the Adycha, Oldzho, Sartang and Abyrabyt from the right, and the Dulgalakh, Bytantay, Tykakh and Baky from the left. Most of these tributaries are short rivers flowing from the Verkhoyansk Mountains or the Chersky Range, part of the East Siberian Mountains.

==History==
Evidence of modern human habitation was found in the delta at the Yana RHS (Rhinoceros Horn Site) as early as 32,000 years ago. These people, designated as &quot;Ancient North Siberians”, genetically diverged 38,000 years ago from Western Eurasians, soon after the Western Eurasians split from East Asians.

In 1633–38 Ilya Perfilyev and Ivan Rebrov sailed down the Lena and east along the Arctic coast to the mouth of the Yana and reached the Indigirka estuary. In 1636–42 Elisei Buza followed essentially the same route. In 1638–40, Poznik Ivanov ascended a tributary of the lower Lena, crossed the Verkhoyansk Range to the upper Yana and then crossed the Chersky Range to the Indigirka.

In 1892–1894 Baron Eduard Von Toll, accompanied by expedition leader Alexander von Bunge, carried out geological surveys in the basin of the Yana (among other Far-eastern Siberian rivers) on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences. During one year and two days the expedition covered , of which were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.

<text>The simians, anthropoids, or higher primates are an infraorder (Simiiformes ) of primates containing all animals traditionally called monkeys and apes. More precisely, they consist of the parvorders Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini, the latter of which consists of the family Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys in the stricter sense) and the superfamily Hominoidea (apesincluding humans).

The simians are sister group to the tarsiers (Tarsiiformes), together forming the haplorhines. The radiation occurred about 60 million years ago (during the Cenozoic era); 40 million years ago, simians colonized South America, giving rise to the New World monkeys. The remaining simians (catarrhines) split about 25 million years ago into Cercopithecidae and apes (including humans).

==Taxonomy==
In earlier classification, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans – collectively known as simians or anthropoids – were grouped under Anthropoidea (; ), while the strepsirrhines and tarsiers were grouped under the suborder &quot;Prosimii&quot;. Under modern classification, the tarsiers and simians are grouped under the suborder Haplorhini, while the strepsirrhines are placed in suborder Strepsirrhini. Strong genetic evidence for this is that five SINEs are common to all haplorhines whilst absent in strepsirrhines — even one being coincidental between tarsiers and simians would be quite unlikely. Despite this preferred taxonomic division, &quot;prosimian&quot; is still regularly found in textbooks and the academic literature because of familiarity, a condition likened to the use of the metric system in the sciences and the use of customary units elsewhere in the United States. In the Anthropoidea, evidence indicates that the Old World and New World primates went through parallel evolution.

Primatology, paleoanthropology, and other related fields are split on their usage of the synonymous infraorder names, Simiiformes and Anthropoidea. According to Robert Hoffstetter (and supported by Colin Groves), the term Simiiformes has priority over Anthropoidea because the taxonomic term &quot;Simii&quot; by van der Hoeven, from which it is constructed, dates to 1833. In contrast, Anthropoidea by Mivart dates to 1864, while Simiiformes by Haeckel dates to 1866, leading to counterclaims of priority. Hoffstetter also argued that Simiiformes is also constructed like a proper infraorder name (ending in &quot;iformes&quot;), whereas Anthropoidea ends in -&quot;oidea&quot;, which is reserved for superfamilies. He also noted that Anthropoidea is too easily confused with &quot;anthropoïdes&quot;, which translates to &quot;apes&quot; from several languages.

Some lines of extinct simian also are either placed into the Eosimiidae (to reflect their Eocene origin) and sometimes in Amphipithecidae, thought to originate in the Early Oligocene. Additionally, &quot;Phileosimias&quot; is sometimes placed in the Eosimiidae and sometimes categorised separately.

== Evolution ==
The origin of anthropoid primates was initially thought to be Africa, however, fossil evidence, now suggests they originated in Asia. During the middle to late Eocene, multiple groups of Asian anthropoids crossed the Tethys Sea on natural rafts or floating islands, colonizing Africa alongside other Asian mammals. The earliest African anthropoid fossils appear in sites across northern Africa, including Algeria, Libya, and Egypt. This dispersal before Africa and Asia were connected by land was aided by size, Asian monsoons, and river systems. After reaching Africa, anthropoids underwent major evolutionary changes, with some groups later crossing the South Atlantic to establish the New World monkey lineage in South America.

The New World monkeys in parvorder Platyrrhini split from the rest of the simian line about 40 million years ago (mya), leaving the parvorder Catarrhini occupying the Old World. This latter group split about 25 mya between the Cercopithecidae and the apes, making Cercopithecidae more closely related to the apes than to the Platyrrhini.

==Classification==
The following is the listing of the various simian families, and their placement in the order Primates:
* Order Primates
** Suborder Strepsirrhini: nontarsier prosimians
** Suborder Haplorhini: tarsiers and monkeys, including apes
*** Infraorder Tarsiiformes
***Infraorder Simiiformes
**** Parvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeys
***** Family Callitrichidae: marmosets and tamarins
***** Family Cebidae: capuchins and squirrel monkeys
***** Family Aotidae: night or owl monkeys (douroucoulis)
***** Family Pitheciidae: titis, sakis, and uakaris
***** Family Atelidae: howler, spider, and woolly monkeys
**** Parvorder Catarrhini
***** Superfamily Cercopithecoidea: Old World monkeys
****** Family Cercopithecidae
***** Superfamily Hominoidea
****** Family Hylobatidae: gibbons
****** Family Hominidae: great apes, including humans
**** †Amphipithecidae
**** †Eosimiidae
**** †&quot;Aseanpithecus&quot;
Below is a cladogram with some of the extinct simian species with the more modern species emerging within the Eosimiidae. The simians originated in Asia, while the crown simians were in Afro-Arabia. It is indicated approximately how many Mya the clades diverged into newer clades.

Usually the Ekgmowechashalidae are considered to be Strepsirrhini, not Haplorhini. A 2018 study places Eosimiidae as a sister to the crown haplorhini. In 2020 papers, the Proteopithecidae are part of the Parapithecoidea, and &quot;Nosmips aenigmaticus&quot; (previously in Eosimidae) is a basal simian. In a 2021 paper, the following basal simians were found:

&quot;Dolichocebus annectens&quot; and &quot;Parvimico materdei&quot; would normally, given their South American location and their age and other factors, be considered Platyrrhini. The original Eosmiidae appear polyphyletic with &quot;Nosmips,&quot; &quot;Bahinia, and&quot; &quot;Phileosimias&quot; at different locations from other eosimians.

==Biological key-features==
In a section of their 2010 assessment of the evolution of anthropoids (simians) entitled &quot;What is an Anthropoid&quot;, Williams, Kay, and Kirk set out a list of biological features common to all or most anthropoids, including genetic similarities, similarities in eye location and the muscles close to the eyes, internal similarities between ears, dental similarities, and similarities on foot bone structure. The earliest anthropoids were small primates with varied diets, forward-facing eyes, acute color vision for daytime lifestyles, and brains devoted more to vision and less to smell. Living simians in both the New World and the Old World have larger brains than other primates, but they evolved these larger brains independently.

Simians characteristically have relatively large brains, fused mandibles, binocular and color vision, and the females have a single fused uterus. They also have fewer teeth and are more sexually dimorphic in terms of body size and anatomy.

The traits that separate New World simians from Old World simians are the nostrils and their dentation. New World simians have broad noses with forward facing nostrils and three premolars in each quadrant of the mouth, while Old World simians have narrower noses with downward facing nostrils and a narrow septum and only have two premolars.

<doc id="1014250" wikidata="Q559003" url="?curid=1014250" title="Social degeneration">
<text>Social degeneration was a widely influential concept at the interface of the social and biological sciences in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 18th century, scientific thinkers including Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Immanuel Kant argued that humans shared a common origin but had degenerated over time due to differences in climate. This theory provided an explanation of where humans came from and why some people appeared differently from others. In contrast, degenerationists in the 19th century feared that civilization might be in decline and that the causes of decline lay in biological change. These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of heredity (&quot;hereditary taint&quot;) with Lamarckian emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including militarism and scientific racism, and a preoccupation with eugenics. The theory originated in racial concepts of ethnicity, recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as Johann Blumenbach and Robert Knox. From the 1850s, it became influential in psychiatry through the writings of Bénédict Morel, and in criminology with Cesare Lombroso. By the 1890s, in the work of Max Nordau and others, degeneration became a more general concept in social criticism. It also fed into the ideology of ethnic nationalism, attracting, among others, Maurice Barrès, Charles Maurras and the . Alexis Carrel, a French Nobel Laureate in Medicine, cited national degeneration as a rationale for a eugenics programme in collaborationist Vichy France.

The meaning of &quot;degeneration&quot; was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism&#x27;s change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th-century conceptions of biological devolution. In scientific usage, the term was reserved for changes occurring at a histological level – i.e. in body tissues. Although rejected by Charles Darwin, the theory&#x27;s application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably Ernst Haeckel and Ray Lankester. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious pessimism about the of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.

== Theories of degeneration in the 18th century ==
In the second half of the eighteenth century, degeneration theory gained prominence as an explanation of the nature and origin of human difference. Among the most notable proponents of this theory was Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. A gifted mathematician and eager naturalist, Buffon served as the curator of the Parisian Cabinet du Roi. The collections of the Cabinet du Roi served as the inspiration for Buffon&#x27;s encyclopedic , of which he published thirty-six volumes between 1749 and his death in 1788. In the , Buffon asserted that differences in climate created variety within species. He believed that these changes occurred gradually and initially affected only a few individuals before becoming widespread. Buffon relied on an argument from analogy to contend that this process of degeneration occurred among humans. He claimed to have observed the transformation of certain animals by their climate and concluded that such changes must have also shaped humankind.

Buffon maintained that degeneration had particularly adverse consequences in the New World. He believed America to be both colder and wetter than Europe. This climate limited the number of species in the New World and prompted a decline in size and vigor among the animals which did survive. Buffon also applied these principles to the people of the New World. He wrote in the &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; that the indigenous people lacked the ability to feel strong emotions for others. For Buffon, these individuals were incapable of love as well as desire.

Buffon&#x27;s theory of degeneration attracted the ire of many early American elites who feared that Buffon&#x27;s depiction of the New World would negatively influence European perceptions of their nation. In particular, Thomas Jefferson mounted a vigorous defense of the American natural world. He attacked the premises of Buffon&#x27;s argument in his 1785 &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, writing that the animals of the New World felt the same sun and walked upon the same soil as their European counterparts. Jefferson believed that he could permanently alter Buffon&#x27;s views of the New World by showing him firsthand the majesty of American wildlife. While serving as minister to France, Jefferson wrote repeatedly to his compatriots in the United States, pleading with them to send a stuffed moose to Paris. After months of effort, General John Sullivan responded to Jefferson&#x27;s request and shipped a moose to France. Buffon died only three months after the moose&#x27;s arrival, and his theory of New World degeneration remained forever preserved in the pages of the .

In the years following Buffon&#x27;s death, the theory of degeneration gained a number of new followers, many of whom were concentrated in German-speaking lands. The anatomist and naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach praised Buffon in his lectures at the University of Göttingen. He adopted Buffon&#x27;s theory of degeneration in his dissertation &quot;De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa&quot;. The central premise of this work was that all of mankind belonged to the same species. Blumenbach believed that a multitude of factors, including climate, air, and the strength of the sun, promoted degeneration and resulted in external differences between human beings. However, he also asserted that these changes could easily be undone and, thus, did not constitute the basis for speciation. In the essay &quot;Über Menschen-Rassen und Schweine-Rassen&quot;, Blumenbach clarified his understanding of the relationship between different human races by calling upon the example of the pig. He contended that, if the domestic pig and the wild boar were seen as belonging to the same species, then different humans, regardless of skin color or height, must too belong to the same species. For Blumenbach, all people of the world existed as different gradations on a spectrum. Nevertheless, the third edition of &quot;De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa&quot;, published in 1795, is famed among scholars for its introduction of a system of racial classification which divided humans into members of the Caucasian, Ethiopian, Mongolian, Malayan, or American races.

Blumenbach&#x27;s views on degeneration emerged in dialogue with the works of other thinkers concerned with race and origin in the late eighteenth century. In particular, Blumenbach participated in fruitful intellectual exchange with another prominent German scholar of his age, Immanuel Kant. Kant, a philosopher and professor at the University of Königsberg, taught a course on physical geography for some forty years, fostering an interest in biology and taxonomy. Like Blumenbach, Kant engaged closely with the writings of Buffon while developing his position on these subjects.

In his 1777 essay &quot;Von der verschiedenen Racen der Menschen,&quot; Kant expressed the belief that all humans shared a common origin. He called upon the ability of humans to interbreed as evidence for this assertion. Additionally, Kant introduced the term &quot;degeneration&quot;, which he defined as hereditary differences between groups with a shared root. Kant also arrived at a meaning of &quot;race&quot; from this definition of degeneration. He claimed that races developed when degenerations were preserved over a long period of time. A group could only constitute a race if breeding with a different degeneration resulted in &quot;intermediate offspring.&quot; Although Kant advocated for a theory of shared human origin, he also contended that there was an innate hierarchy between existing races. In 1788, Kant wrote &quot;Über den Gebrauch teleologischer Prinzipien&quot;. He maintained in this work that a human&#x27;s place in nature was determined by the amount of sweat the individual produced, which revealed an innate ability to survive. Sweat emerged from the skin. Therefore, skin color indicated important distinctions between humans.

== History ==

The concept of degeneration arose during the European enlightenment and the industrial revolution – a period of profound social change and a rapidly shifting sense of personal identity. Several influences were involved.

The first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including urbanization, in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of social change and urban crowds, largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of William Cobbett, the novels of Charles Dickens and in the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including Gustav Le Bon and Georg Simmel. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in Humphrey Jennings&#x27; masterly anthology &quot;Pandaemonium 1660 – 1886&quot;. Victorian social reformers including Edwin Chadwick, Henry Mayhew and Charles Booth voiced concerns about the &quot;decline&quot; of public health in the urban life of the British working class, arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir James Cantlie in his influential 1885 lecture &quot;Degeneration Amongst Londoners&quot;. The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten middle-class culture.

Secondly, the proto-evolutionary biology and transformatist speculations of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and other natural historians—taken together with the Baron von Cuvier&#x27;s theory of extinctions—played an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The polygenic theories of multiple human origins, supported by Robert Knox in his book &quot;The Races of Men&quot;, were firmly rejected by Charles Darwin who, following James Cowles Prichard, generally agreed on a single African origin for the entire human species.

Thirdly, the development of world trade and colonialism, the early European experience of globalization, resulted in an awareness of the varieties of cultural expression and the vulnerabilities of Western civilization.

Fourthly, medical doctors of the time could diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome and congenital syphilis, and not absurdly come to the conclusion that behavioral problems can be inherited by offspring.

Finally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire&quot; (1776–1789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.
Degeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in Bénédict Morel&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species&quot; (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in Rouen) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de Gobineau&#x27;s &quot;Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1855). Morel&#x27;s concept of &quot;mental degeneration&quot; – in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations – is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking, and Morel&#x27;s medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding syphilitic infection (&quot;syphilography&quot;). Morel&#x27;s psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend Philippe Buchez, and through his political influence became an official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.

Arthur de Gobineau came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances, and his wife was widely rumored to be a Créole from Martinique. De Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that interracial marriage (&quot;miscegenation&quot;) resulted in social chaos. De Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translation—not least by the composer Richard Wagner—and the leading German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. De Gobineau&#x27;s writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the Third Reich – although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian Cesare Lombroso in his work on criminal anthropology with the notion of &quot;atavistic retrogression&quot;, probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in Calabria during the &quot;risorgimento&quot;.

In Britain, degeneration received a scientific formulation from Ray Lankester whose detailed discussions of the biology of parasitism were hugely influential; the poor physical condition of many British Army recruits for the Second Boer War (1899–1902) led to alarm in government circles. Psychiatrist Henry Maudsley initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the general population; Maudsley also warned against the use of the term &quot;degeneration&quot; in a vague and indiscriminate way. Anxieties in Britain about the perils of degeneration found legislative expression in the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 which gained strong support from Winston Churchill, then a senior member of the Liberal government.

In the &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; period, Max Nordau scored an unexpected success with his bestselling &quot;Degeneration&quot; (1892). Sigmund Freud met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the eugenicists and social Darwinists (for example, R. Austin Freeman; Anthony Ludovici; Rolf Gardiner; and see also Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s &quot;Letter to posterity&quot;). Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1919) captured something of the degenerationist spirit in the aftermath of the war.

== Psychology and Emil Kraepelin ==
Degeneration theory is, at its heart, a way of thinking, and something that is taught, not innate. A major influence on the theory was Emil Kraepelin, lining up degeneration theory with his psychiatry practice. The central idea of this concept was that in &quot;degenerative&quot; illness, there is a steady decline in mental functioning and social adaptation from one generation to the other. For example, there might be an intergenerational development from nervous character to major depressive disorder, to overt psychotic illness and, finally, to severe and chronic cognitive impairment, something akin to dementia. This theory was advanced decades before the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics and their application to medicine in general and to psychiatry in particular. Kraepelin and his colleagues mostly derived from degeneration theory broadly. He rarely made a specific references to the theory of degeneration, and his attitude towards degeneration theory was not straightforward. Positive, but more ambivalent. The concept of disease, especially chronic mental disease fit very well into this framework insofar these phenomena were regarded as signs of an evolution in the wrong direction, as a degenerative process which diverts from the usual path of nature.

However, he remained skeptical of over-simplistic versions of this concept: While commenting approvingly on the basic ideas of Cesare Lombroso&#x27;s &quot;criminal anthropology&quot;, he did not accept the popular idea of overt &quot;stigmata of degeneration&quot;, by which individual persons could be identified as being &quot;degenerated&quot; simply by their physical appearance. While Kraepelin and his colleagues may not have focused on this, it did not stop others from advancing the converse idea.

An early application of this theory was the Mental Deficiency Act supported by Winston Churchill in 1913. This entailed placing those deemed &quot;idiots&quot; into separate colonies, and included those who showed sign of a &quot;degeneration&quot;. While this did apply to those with mental disorders of a psychiatric nature, the execution was not always in the same vein, as some of the language was used to the those &quot;morally weak&quot;, or deemed &quot;idiots&quot;. The belief in the existence of degeneration helped foster a sense that a sense of negative energy was inexplicable and was there to find sources of &quot;rot&quot; in society. This forwarded the notion the idea that society was structured in a way that produced regression, an outcome of the &quot;darker side of progress&quot;.

Those who had developed the label of &quot;degenerate&quot; as a means of qualifying difference in a negative manner could use the idea that this &quot;darker side of progress&quot; was inevitable by having the idea society could &quot;rot&quot;. Considerations to the pervasiveness of an allegedly superior condition were, during the nineteenth century, frighteningly reinforced in the language and habits of this destructive thinking.

==As &quot;dark side&quot; of progress==
 
The idea of progress was at once a social, political and scientific theory. The theory of evolution, as described in Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, provided for many social theorists the necessary scientific foundation for the idea of social and political progress. The terms &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; were often used interchangeably in the 19th century.

According to the theory of degeneration, a host of individual and social pathologies in a finite network of diseases, disorders and moral habits could be explained by a biologically based affliction. The primary symptoms of the affliction were thought to be a weakening of the vital forces and willpower of its victim. In this way, a wide range of social and medical deviations, including crime, violence, alcoholism, prostitution, gambling, and pornography, could be explained by reference to a biological defect within the individual. The theory of degeneration was therefore predicated on evolutionary theory. The forces of degeneration opposed those of evolution, and those afflicted with degeneration were thought to represent a return to an earlier evolutionary stage.

==Development of the concept==

The earliest uses of the term &quot;degeneration&quot; can be found in the writings of Blumenbach and Buffon at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species. With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised general enquiries about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called &quot;polygenic theories&quot;, was also rejected by Charles Darwin, who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population.

The theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of Bénédict Morel (1809–1873), especially in his (&quot;Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species&quot;) (1857). This book was published two years &quot;before&quot; Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of &quot;hereditary degeneracy&quot;, bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel&#x27;s contribution was further developed by Valentin Magnan (1835–1916), who also stressed the role of alcohol—particularly &quot;absinthe&quot;—in the generation of psychiatric disorders.

Morel&#x27;s ideas were greatly extended by the Italian medical scientist Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909) whose work was defended and translated into English by Havelock Ellis. In his &quot;L&#x27;uomo delinquente&quot; (1876), Lombroso outlined a comprehensive natural history of the socially deviant person and detailed the &quot;stigmata&quot; of the person who was born to be &quot;criminally insane&quot;. These included a low, sloping forehead, hard and shifty eyes, large, handle-shaped ears, a flattened or upturned nose, a forward projection of the jaw, irregular teeth, prehensile toes and feet, long simian arms and a scanty beard and baldness. Lombroso also listed the features of the degenerate mentality, supposedly released by the disinhibition of the primitive neurological centres. These included apathy, the loss of moral sense, a tendency to impulsiveness or self-doubt, an unevenness of mental qualities such as unusual memory or aesthetic abilities, a tendency to mutism or to verbosity, excessive originality, preoccupation with the self, mystical interpretations placed on simple facts or perceptions, the abuse of symbolic meanings and the magical use of words, or &quot;mantras&quot;. Lombroso, with his concept of &quot;atavistic retrogression&quot;, suggested an evolutionary reversion, complementing &quot;hereditary degeneracy&quot;, and his work in the medical examination of criminals in Turin resulted in his theory of criminal anthropology—a constitutional notion of abnormal personality that was not actually supported by his own scientific investigations. In his later life, Lombroso developed an obsession with spiritualism, engaging with the spirit of his long dead mother.

In 1892, Max Nordau, an expatriate Hungarian living in Paris, published his extraordinary bestseller &quot;Degeneration&quot;, which greatly extended the concepts of Bénédict Morel and Cesare Lombroso (to whom he dedicated the book) to the entire civilization of western Europe, and transformed the medical connotations of degeneration into a generalized &quot;cultural criticism&quot;. Adopting some of Charcot&#x27;s neurological vocabulary, Nordau identified a number of weaknesses in contemporary Western culture which he characterized in terms of &quot;ego-mania&quot;, i.e., narcissism and hysteria. He also emphasized the importance of &quot;fatigue&quot;, &quot;enervation&quot; and &quot;ennui&quot;. Nordau, horrified by the anti-Semitism surrounding the Dreyfus affair, devoted his later years to Zionist politics. Degeneration theory fell from favour around the time of the First World War because of an improved understanding of the mechanisms of genetics as well as the increasing vogue for psychoanalytic thinking. However, some of its preoccupations lived on in the world of eugenics and social Darwinism. It is notable that the Nazi attack on western liberal society was largely couched in terms of degenerate art with its associations of racial miscegenation and fantasies of racial purity—and included as its target almost all modernist cultural experiment.

The role of women in furthering development of the concept of degeneration was reviewed by Anne McClintock, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, who found that women who were ambiguously placed on the so-called &quot;imperial divide&quot; (nurses, nannies, governesses, prostitutes and servants) happened to serve as boundary markers and mediators. These women were tasked with the purification and maintenance of boundaries and what was seen as &quot;inferior&quot; places in society they held at the time.

==Degenerationist devices==
Towards the close of the 19th century, in the fin-de-siècle period, something of an obsession with decline, descent and degeneration invaded the European creative imagination, partly fuelled by widespread misconceptions of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Among the main examples are the symbolist literary work of Charles Baudelaire, the Rougon-Macquart novels of Émile Zola, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;—published in the same year (1886) as Richard von Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;—and, subsequently, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s only novel (containing his aesthetic manifesto) &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891). In &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), Thomas Hardy explores the destructive consequences of a family myth of noble ancestry. Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen showed a sensitivity to degenerationist thinking in his theatrical presentations of Scandinavian domestic crises. Arthur Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; (1890/1894), with its emphasis on the horrors of psychosurgery, is frequently cited as an essay on degeneration. A scientific twist was added by H. G. Wells in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895) in which Wells prophesied the splitting of the human race into variously degenerate forms, and again in his &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; (1896) wherein forcibly mutated animal-human hybrids keep reverting to their earlier forms. Joseph Conrad alludes to degeneration theory in his treatment of political radicalism in the 1907 novel &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;.

In her influential study &quot;The Gothic Body&quot;, Kelly Hurley draws attention to the literary device of the &quot;abhuman&quot; as a representation of damaged personal identity, and to lesser-known authors in the field, including Richard Marsh (1857–1915), author of &quot;The Beetle&quot; (1897), and William Hope Hodgson (1877–1918), author of &quot;The Boats of the Glen Carrig&quot;, &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; and &quot;The Night Land&quot;. In 1897, Bram Stoker published &quot;Dracula&quot;, an enormously influential Gothic novel featuring the parasitic vampire Count Dracula in an extended exercise of reversed imperialism. Unusually, Stoker makes explicit reference to the writings of Lombroso and Nordau in the course of the novel. Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories include a host of degenerationist tropes, perhaps best illustrated (drawing on the ideas of Serge Voronoff) in &quot;The Adventure of the Creeping Man&quot;.

<doc id="1014256" wikidata="Q3040525" url="?curid=1014256" title="The Behemoth">
<text>The Behemoth is an American video game development company that was founded in 2003 by John Baez, artist Dan Paladin, and programmers Tom Fulp, Brandon LaCava, and Nick Dryburgh. Dryburgh and LaCava later left the company. The Behemoth development studio is located in San Diego, California. The company is known for producing simple games with Paladin&#x27;s signature 2D style. Its games are also known for their heavy arcade inspirations, especially among their early games, emulating genres common on the Neo Geo in particular (which Tom Fulp is a noted fan of).

== History ==

During August 2002, Tom Fulp and Dan Paladin collaborated in creating the Flash game &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; for Newgrounds. The game has since become extremely popular and generated over twenty million hits. Later in the year, Paladin was working on developing a console video game when co-worker Baez approached him. He was a fan of Alien Hominid and asked Paladin if he was interested in developing the game for consoles. When Baez offered to produce the game, Fulp and Paladin eventually agreed, recruited LaCava and Dryburgh, and formed The Behemoth in 2003. Several details in their games reveal a connected universe between all of them.

Their first console game, &quot;Alien Hominid&quot;, gained critical acclaim by the media and the members of The Behemoth quickly gained status as indie developers focused on bringing old-school styles of video games back into mainstream gaming. Some of the minigames from &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; were ported to iOS in 2011.

The Behemoth&#x27;s second game, &quot;Castle Crashers&quot;, was released August 27, 2008, originally for the Xbox Live Arcade service, eventually re-releasing for the PlayStation 3 on August 31, 2010, and Microsoft Windows/OS X on September 26, 2012. Since its release on Xbox Live Arcade, &quot;Castle Crashers&quot; has become one of the most downloaded games, with over 2 million copies sold as of year-end 2010.

A third title, &quot;BattleBlock Theater&quot;, was released on April 3, 2013 on Xbox Live Arcade. The Windows, Linux, and macOS versions of &quot;BattleBlock Theater&quot; were released on Steam on May 15, 2014.

&quot;Pit People&quot; is a turn-based strategy game that was released for early access on Steam and was released for Xbox One on January 13, 2017. It was released on March 2, 2018.

The Behemoth had long teased a &quot;Game 5&quot;, which was announced in January 2020 as Alien Hominid Invasion, which the developers said was not a remake or remaster of the original &quot;Alien Hominid&quot; but introduces new mechanics as an arcade shooter. It was released on November 1, 2023.

In 2024, The Behemoth released an endless runner titled BEHEMOTH on Steam. BEHEMOTH allows players to take control of their mascot chicken. The same year they also announced an &quot;update roadmap&quot; for all their previously released titles.

<text>Hartley Rogers Jr. (July 6, 1926 – July 17, 2015) was an American mathematician who worked in computability theory, and was a professor in the Mathematics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Biography==
Born in 1926 in Buffalo, New York, Rogers studied English as an undergraduate at Yale University, graduating in 1946. After visiting the University of Cambridge under a Henry Fellowship, he returned to Yale for a master&#x27;s degree in physics, which he completed in 1950. He studied mathematics under Alonzo Church at Princeton, earned a second master&#x27;s degree in 1951, and received his Ph.D. there in 1952.

He was a Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard University from 1952 to 1955. After holding a visiting position at MIT, he became a professor in the MIT Mathematics Department in 1956. His doctoral students included Patrick Fischer, Louis Hodes, Carl Jockusch, Andrew Kahr, David Luckham, Rohit Parikh, David Park, and John Stillwell. He chaired the MIT faculty senate from 1971 to 1973 and served as associate provost of the university from 1974 to 1980.

Beyond teaching and research, Rogers was an avid rower and rowing competitor.

He retired as a professor emeritus in 2009, and died on July 17, 2015.

==Mathematical work==
Rogers worked in mathematical logic, particularly recursion theory, and wrote the classic text &quot;Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability&quot;. The Rogers equivalence theorem is named after him.

Rogers won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1965 for his expository article &quot;Information Theory&quot;.

<doc id="1014273" wikidata="Q271113" url="?curid=1014273" title="Sarissa">
<text>The sarissa or sarisa was a long spear or pike about in length. It was introduced by Philip II of Macedon and was used in his Macedonian phalanxes as a replacement for the earlier dory, which was considerably shorter. These longer spears improved the strength of the phalanx by extending the rows of overlapping weapons projecting towards the enemy. After the conquests of Alexander the Great, the sarissa was a mainstay during the Hellenistic era (4th–1st centuries BCE) by the Hellenistic armies of the diadochi Greek successor states of Alexander&#x27;s empire, as well as some of their rivals.

==Composition and utility==

The sarissa is made of two core parts: a long wooden shaft and a metal tip. A third part that may have existed for some sarissas was a metal spear-butt at the reverse end. The metal butt of the sarissa could be used to safely stow it in the ground without damaging the shaft when not in use.

Two types of wood are favored as likely candidates for the shaft: ash wood combines length, flexibility, and being lightweight, while cornel wood is shorter but stronger. The shaft was probably slightly tapered, narrowing some toward the end. The size of the tip is disputed; much scholarship from 1970–2000 favored a comparatively large and heavy spearhead shaped like a leaf on the basis of an archaeological find by Manolis Andronikos of such an implement in a Macedonian tomb at Vergina, long. 21st-century scholarship has been more skeptical this was really a sarissa head that was found. Nicholas Victor Sekunda favors the metal tip being smaller at around , made of iron, and diamond shaped. Ancient writers say that the sarissa was capable of piercing both shield and armor, which suggests to Sekunda the use of a small but focused spearhead rather than a broad one. Additionally, the Alexander Mosaic seems to show small spearheads, and small spearheads match what later medieval pikemen found to work the best.

Ancient authorities are unanimous in saying the sarissa was distinguished by its great length, which made it difficult for opposing soldiers to safely engage phalangites. Exactly how long this length was is less clear, as different authors give varying descriptions, ancient units of measurement were not always consistent nor precise, and the wood used to create the Hellenistic sarissas has long since rotted away making archaeological evidence lacking. Many historians consider Polybius the most trustworthy account, as he had actual experience with observing the Hellenistic phalanx and his accounts are accurate elsewhere. Polybius writes that &quot;the length of the sarissae is sixteen cubits according to the original design, which has been reduced in practice to fourteen,&quot; presumably referring to the 2nd century BCE Antigonid Macedonian sarissa in context. The second most compelling surviving account is from Theophrastus, writing in the late 4th century BCE and early 3rd century BCE, who lived during the time of Alexander the Great. Theophratus, in an off-hand remark in &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;, mentions that the longest sarissa was 12 cubits long. Based on this, many historians have assumed that both accounts were basically correct, and that the sarissa grew longer during the post-Alexander Hellenistic era from the 12 cubits Theophratus reports to the 14 cubits that Polybius observed. However, other historians have offered different theories; Peter Connolly suggests that the lengths were basically the same. Converted to modern units, this would suggest around for the sarissa in the time of Alexander in the 4th century BCE, and around if the 3rd–1st century BCE sarissas really did become even longer.

In the scholarship based on Andronikos&#x27; discoveries and his and Markle&#x27;s journal articles, it is thought that the sarissa was heavy for a spear, weighing approximately . Later reconstructions have suggested that this was too heavy—Peter Connolly was able to reconstruct an infantry spear 5.8 meters long of cherry wood that weighed only , and an ash-wood spear would have been even lighter.

One possibility considered by some scholars is that to make such prodigiously long pikes, two separate tree branches were joined by a metal tube. This theory rested on the identification of such a tube in Andronikos&#x27;s Vergina finds as perhaps being the middle part of a sarissa, along with cornel wood being difficult to grow out to the longest lengths described. This theory has largely been discarded, though, as making an unwieldly weapon that is likely to break.

===Shields===
Infantry sarissa wielders in a phalanx generally also used a shield. An inscription in the Lindian Temple Chronicle records a gift of &quot;ten &quot;peltai&quot;, ten &quot;sarisai&quot;, and ten helmets&quot; dedicated to King Philip V of Macedon, suggesting that the Macedonians viewed the sarissa and the bronze pelta (shield) as a matched set. The bulk and size of the sarissa required soldiers to wield it with both hands, allowing them to carry only a smaller shield. The pelta was perhaps around in size in Alexander&#x27;s era, and perhaps only by the Hellenistic era if even longer sarissas were really used then. To make it easier to carry when both hands were occupied, a neck strap may have been used to help hold the shield and cover the left shoulder. However, other scholars suggest that larger shields were used in the Macedonian phalanx, ranging from . Some light-infantry peltasts in the Antigonid army appear to have been closer to a more mobile phalanx than the Alexander-era skirmishers, and they may have used a combination of smaller shields along with smaller sarissas to improve their mobility.

===Cavalry version===

The Macedonian army of Alexander&#x27;s time featured a unit of light cavalry (&quot;prodromoi&quot;) called the sarissophoroi who also wielded sarissas, albeit somewhat shorter versions. However, the term &quot;sarissophoroi&quot; eventually stops showing up in literature in the later Hellenistic age. Most surviving depictions of Macedonian cavalry depict it wielded under-arm, but it probably could have been wielded over-arm as well.

Minor Markle thought that based on ancient depictions, the cavalry sarissa would have been about . He also does not think that the cavalry always equipped themselves with sarissas; for scouting missions, they probably just carried two javelins and a sword instead, reserving the sarissa for use in major battles. Peter Connolly also researched the matter. Connolly wrote that the cavalry spear was depicted as a primary weapon (rather than a Roman &quot;pilum&quot; which could be thrown once, like a javelin) and thus should be able to be used repeatedly. Connolly arranged for a modern horse rider to test out reconstructed spears of several of the possible lengths, and found it plausible that a cavalry spear as long as could have been used. He thought that tactically, the longer (4.5 meters+) version would make for a more devastating initial charge, but that a spear would be easier to use in a prolonged melee. Both Markle and Connolly write that the cavalry sarissa, unlike the infantry sarissa, was almost certainly wielded one-handed, as a full heavy two-handed impact would probably knock the sarissa-wielding rider off their own horse.

While Hellenistic cavalry frequently wielded spears, whether their weapon is best classed as a shorter version of the sarissa or as a xyston () is disputed. Nicholas Victor Sekunda argues that the Macedonian cavalry spear was more properly classed as a xyston. The xyston was made of cornel wood, was shorter than an infantry sarissa, and had a larger and wider spearhead than the infantry sarissa. He also notes that Ancient Macedonians may have used the term &quot;sarissa&quot; broadly in the sense of any spear, even if other Greeks meant specifically the Macedonian variety.

==Tactics==
The standard Hellenistic army deployment was to have a heavy infantry phalanx in the center, cavalry on the sides capable of threatening to flank the enemy or to attack weak spots, and light infantry skirmishers such as slingers or javelineers in the front. Of these, the infantry phalanxes wielded sarissas, and the cavalry wielded somewhat shorter spears of which may or may not have qualified as a &quot;sarissa&quot;.

While marching and maneuvering, infantry sarissas were held vertically. Once the sarissas were leveled (that is, pointed horizontally forward for battle), the phalanx could advance straight forward, but turning the phalanx would be more difficult and require training and discipline. The sarissa was already so long that thrusting them forward likely didn&#x27;t extend their range much, comparatively — perhaps around an additional .

The sarissa-bearing phalanx would usually march to battle in open formation to facilitate movement. Before the charge, it would tighten its files to close formation or even compact formation (synaspismos). The tight formation of the phalanx created a &quot;wall of pikes&quot;, and the pike was so long that there were fully five rows of them projecting in front of the front rank of men—even if an enemy got past the first row, there were still four more to stop him. The back rows bore their pikes angled upwards in readiness, which served the additional purpose of deflecting incoming arrows.

The Macedonian phalanx was considered practically invulnerable from the front. Another phalanx could perhaps wear a phalanx down in a long battle from exhaustion, but this was far from guaranteed. The best way to defeat one was generally by one of a loss of morale from killing the enemy commander, breaking its formation, or outflanking it. For example, the Romans used a flanking tactic at the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC) to defeat the Antigonid Macedonians. A few years later, the Seleucid phalanx held up well at the Battle of Thermopylae (191 BCE); a Roman surprise flanking force caused the army to lose formation and retreat. Livy writes on the Roman victory at the Battle of Pydna (168 BCE) against the Antigonid Macedonian army that:
One possible technique that could have been used with a sarissa is planting them directly in the ground if an enemy charge was thought to be imminent. However, the only source that reports this tactic is the satirist Lucian of Samosata, writing centuries after the sarissa&#x27;s prominence, so if it was a real technique, it seems to have been a rare one.

Phalangites would carry a backup weapon, generally a sword or dagger. If a phalanx broke formation, or if a lone soldier found himself in close combat, the sarissa was nearly useless as a weapon, and the backup weapon would be used instead.

==History of use==
The adoption of the sarissa by the Macedonian infantry is usually credited to Philip II, father of Alexander the Great. Alexander used the sarissa armed phalanx in his wars across Asia, where he conquered Asia Minor, Persian Egypt, the Persian Empire&#x27;s homelands in Babylonia and Persia, and the Pauravas (northwest India). The sarissa-wielding phalanxes were vital in every early battle, including the pivotal Battle of Gaugamela where the Persian king&#x27;s scythe chariots were utterly destroyed by the phalanx, supported by the combined use of companion cavalry and peltasts (javelineers). During his later campaigning, Alexander gradually reduced the importance of the phalanx and the sarissa, as he modified his combined use of arms to incorporate Asian weapons and troops, not specifically trained in Macedonian battle tactics. 

The sarissa remained the core of Hellenistic armies of the Diadochi successor states to Alexander&#x27;s empire. 

The word remained in use throughout the Byzantine years to sometimes describe the long spears of their own infantry. Long pikes would eventually come back into vogue due to changing circumstances in the late medieval and early modern period (~1300–1700); scholars of military history have used reports of how Swiss mercenaries, German Landsknecht, and English and Irish pikemen fought to analyze how the similar Macedonian sarissa was likely used. In his 1521 book &quot;The Art of War&quot;, Niccolo Machiavelli wrote that &quot;I conjecture that a Macedonian Phalanx was nothing else than a battalion of Swiss is today, who have all their strength and power in their pikes.&quot; Preserved English pikes from this period tend to be long, and there are reports of pikes as long as . These reports suggest that usage of such long pikes by the Macedonians was plausible and militarily viable.

<text>Lintorf is a village at the transition of the Berg region into the lower Rhine plain in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Since 1975 it has been a quarter of the city of Ratingen.

==History, geography &amp; transport==
Lintorf was suburbanised in 1975. Ratingen belongs to the Mettmann district in the Düsseldorf region (North Rhine-Westphalia state). Before then, Lintorf was an independent municipality and seat of administration of Amt Angermund (since early 14th century; 1929-1950 &quot;Amt Ratingen-Land&quot;; 1950-1974 &quot;Amt Angerland&quot;).

Lintorf is on the Cologne-Ratingen-Duisburg line, but since 1985 has had no train stations. The place is connected by autobahns A52 (Essen—Düsseldorf, exit Ratingen Tiefenbroich), A524 (autobahn interchange Breitscheid—Krefeld, exit Ratingen-Lintorf), A3 (Oberhausen—Cologne, exit A52). The old boundary lies in the northern edge of the approach lane of the Düsseldorf Airport (3 km runway).

Lintorf was the site of a displaced persons camp after World War II, providing a home for Ukrainians, Poles and Yugoslavs awaiting immigration. Ratingen has been the site of a war crime in April 1945. The bodies of eight German anti-Nazis, one woman and two Polish men were found lying in woods near the town.
In the first half of the 20th century, lead, clay and gravel was mined. In the period after World War II, the auto manufacturer Hoffmann (licensed production of the Vespa scooter), the company Constructa (washing machines), as well as the company Hünnebeck (metal scaffold construction).

A rural scattered housing estate developed in the time after World War II from suburban residents of the surrounding cities, primarily from Düsseldorf (12 km). The surrounding forests are a popular scenic area.

Since 19th century, population has grown from 872 (1816) to 15,162 (2014).

<doc id="1014278" wikidata="Q1357612" url="?curid=1014278" title="Hell house">
<text>Hell houses are haunted attractions typically run by evangelical Protestant churches or parachurch organizations designed to act as moral instruction. They depict acts which the organizers deem sinful and their consequences, including the torments of the damned in Hell, and usually conclude with a depiction of Heaven. Scenes portrayed may include date rape, same-sex marriage, gambling, abortion, extramarital sex, raving, the use of alcoholic beverages and drugs, and teen suicide. Other hell houses focus on the theme of the seven deadly sins. Hell houses typically emphasize the belief that those who do not repent of their sins and choose to follow Christ are condemned to Hell.

A Hell house, like a conventional haunted-house attraction, is a space set aside for actors to frighten patrons with gruesome exhibits and scenes, presented as a series of short vignettes with a narrated guide. Unlike haunted houses, Hell houses focus on real-life situations and the effects of sin or the fate of unrepentant sinners in the afterlife. They are most typically operated in the days preceding Halloween.

==History==
The idea was first popularized by Jerry Falwell in the late 1970s. The first known hell house was set up in Lynchburg, Virginia, beginning production in 1972, and was called the &quot;ScareMare&quot;. Similar events began in several regions during that period.

Trinity Assembly of God in Cedar Hill, Texas is known to have presented a hell house since 1990.

From 1995, the concept was promoted and adapted by Keenan Roberts, originally of Roswell, New Mexico, who started a Hell house in Arvada, Colorado. Since that time, Hell houses have become a regular fixture of the Halloween season in parts of the United States. Roberts remained active in the Hell house ministry by providing kits and directions to enable churches to perform their own attractions. As of 16 January, 2017, the &quot;Hell House Kit&quot; was still available. As of 2023, a package of hell house scripts and scenes was being sold for $479.

In October 2000, documentary filmmaker George Ratliff filmed a production of a Hell house in Cedar Hill, Texas from scripting to the final night of the production. The resulting documentary, &quot;Hell House&quot;, has inspired numerous live plays and hell-house performances, including one based on Pastor Roberts&#x27; production, which played for a month during the 2006 Halloween season in an off-Broadway production in Brooklyn, New York by Les Freres Corbusier.

<text>Laura Kinney (designation X-23) is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with Wolverine, whose codename she has also used, and the X-Men. The character was created by writer Craig Kyle for the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; television series in 2003, before debuting in the &quot;NYX&quot; comic series in 2004. Since then she has headlined two six-issue miniseries written by Kyle and Christopher Yost, the &quot;X-23&quot; (2010) one-shot and the 2010 &quot;X-23&quot; (vol. 3) ongoing series written by Marjorie Liu, the 2015 &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; ongoing series by writer Tom Taylor, and the 2018 &quot;X-23&quot; (vol. 4) ongoing series by writer Mariko Tamaki. She is set to headline the ongoing series &quot;Laura Kinney: Wolverine&quot;, scheduled for release in December 2024, by writer Erica Schultz. Laura has also appeared in several team books such as &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, &quot;New X-Men&quot; (vol. 2), &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 3 &amp; 6), &quot;X-Men Red&quot; (vol. 1), &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 6), and &quot;NYX&quot; (vol. 2). The character also appears in other media from Marvel Entertainment.

Laura was apparently the clone and later the adoptive daughter of Wolverine, created to be the perfect killing machine. For years, she proved herself a capable assassin working for an organization called the Facility. A series of tragedies eventually led her to Wolverine and the X-Men. She attended school at the X-Mansion, and eventually became a member of X-Force. It is revealed later that she is not a clone, but the biological daughter of Wolverine. Like her father, Laura has a regenerative healing factor and enhanced senses, speed, and reflexes. She also has retractable adamantium-coated bone claws in her hands and feet. In 2015, the character succeeded her father in adopting the name and costume of Wolverine in the series &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot;.

Laura Kinney has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes. In addition to comics, the character has appeared in various media, including animated film and TV series and video games. Dafne Keen portrayed the character in the 2017 film &quot;Logan&quot; and the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==History==

Laura first appeared in season 3, episode 10 of the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; animated television series, titled &quot;X-23&quot;, voiced by Andrea Libman. She was later voiced by Britt Irvin in season 4, episode 3, titled &quot;Target X&quot;.

Laura was created by Craig Kyle. He revealed that the character was his attempt to make a Wolverine to &quot;connect more to the younger kids&quot;, as while &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; was a reinvention of the X-Men making the characters teenagers, &quot;Wolverine was one of the old, grizzled guys&quot;. The characterization went for the opposite of Wolverine, where instead of a man &quot;older than we know&quot; with no memory of his past and the life that he lost, Laura Kinney was a young girl &quot;shackled to the murders she&#x27;s committed&quot; whose entire life revolved around the project that made her a killer. Kyle added that the character is &quot;Pinocchio for Marvel Comics, she&#x27;s a samurai sword trying to become a real little girl&quot;. He and Christopher Yost were the writers of the two episodes of &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; in which Laura appears (&quot;X-23&quot; and &quot;Target X&quot;), with Yost stating that Kyle &quot;had all the beats of her origin in his head when I came on board&quot;.

==Transition to comic books and publication history==
=== 2004–2014 ===
Laura Kinney&#x27;s comic debut was in 2004 in the third issue of the Joe Quesada&#x27;s &quot;NYX&quot; series, where her history and past were never divulged but her abilities were showcased. In &quot;X-23&quot;, her first miniseries, Laura&#x27;s origin was fully explained. She became part of the X-Men supporting cast in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #450.

Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost also scripted &quot;X-23: Innocence Lost&quot;, a six-issue miniseries that details the character&#x27;s origin, as well as &quot;X-23: Target X&quot;, a six-issue miniseries that covers the character&#x27;s experiences between her origin story and her appearance in &quot;NYX&quot;. They continued to write for the character into their runs on &quot;New X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot; as a member of the teams.

Laura Kinney starred in a monthly comic book series in 2010, written by Marjorie Liu. The series was prompted by the success of Liu&#x27;s one-shot &quot;X-23&quot; from earlier in the year. On November 15, 2011, Marvel announced that the &quot;X-23&quot; (vol. 3) comic series would end at issue #21.

Laura Kinney appeared as a regular character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; from issue #23 (February 2012) through its final issue #39 (January 2013), and also appeared in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; (2012) a series by Dennis Hopeless and Kev Walker.

In 2014, Laura joined the &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; in issue 19 after the team finds her in Florida being chased by anti-mutant religious zealots.

=== 2015–2024 ===
In June 2015, it was announced that following that year&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Laura would take on the Wolverine mantle, as the main character in the series &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot;, by writer Tom Taylor and artist David López, and wearing a costume resembling Wolverine&#x27;s.

After the return of Logan, Laura&#x27;s title was relaunched as the fourth &quot;X-23&quot; volume and written by Mariko Tamaki and drawn by Juann Cabal. Tamaki said, &quot;This is a story about being in the very weird kind of family that someone like Laura finds herself in. It&#x27;s about what it means to wrestle with legacy and identity when you were created to be a weapon and not someone with a birthday and a sister.&quot; The series ran for 12 issues before ending in May 2019.

In 2018, Laura—once again under the mantle of Wolverine—and her sister Gabby Kinney joined Jean Grey&#x27;s &quot;X-Men Red&quot; team, written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by Mahmud Asrar. The series received critical acclaim, with several critics citing it as one of the best comics of the year.

During the Krakoan Age, as part of the Dawn of X relaunch of all X-Men-related titles, Laura joined the newest Fallen Angels series written by Bryan Edward Hill and drawn by Szymon Kudranski. The series ended after 6 issues. During Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 5) run in 2021, Laura goes on a mission into The Vault where time is accelerated and is seemingly killed after spending centuries within; the mutant resurrection protocols lead to Laura returning to life in a new body, however, her memories from The Vault were not stored so she is resurrected without them. During the Reign of X relaunch, debuting in the &quot;Hellfire Gala&quot; (2021), Laura as Wolverine is on the first team roster for Gerry Duggan&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 6) run. In the Destiny of X relaunch, Laura (as Wolverine) had a starring role in the &quot;X-Terminators&quot; (2022) five-issue limited series by writer Leah Williams and artist Carlos Gómez. Also in 2022, it is revealed the original Laura had actually survived; the younger, duplicate Laura continued to use the Wolverine codename while the older, original Laura used the new Talon codename. Talon continued to be a member of Duggan&#x27;s X-Men team until her death in &quot;X-Men&quot; #31 (February 2024) during Fall of X&quot;.&quot; The duplicate Laura, as Wolverine, joined the roster of Benjamin Percy&#x27;s &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 6) in issue #39 (April 2023) until the run ended with issue #50 (March 2024); she also appeared in Percy&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine&quot; (vol. 7) series which focused on Logan. Additionally in 2023, Laura was the focus of the five-issue limited series &quot;X-23: Deadly Regenesis&quot; by writer Erica Schultz and artist Edgar Salazar; this series was set in the past during the X-Men Utopia era.

=== 2024–present ===
In April 2024, it was announced that Laura would have a starring role in the ongoing series &quot;NYX&quot; (vol. 2), which began in July 2024 as part of the X-Men: From the Ashes relaunch. It was written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with art by Francesco Mortarino. The new ongoing series centers on Laura and several other mutant young adults – Kamala Khan, Anole, Prodigy and Sophie Cuckoo – attempting to adapt to life in New York City in the post-Krakoan Age. Laura&#x27;s updated Wolverine costume retains &quot;some elements of the usual Wolverine suit, including the yellow and black color scheme&quot;, however, it also includes &quot;a sharper cowl with more severe lines and edges&quot; and some streetwear-inspired aspects such as &quot;a cozy athletic jacket-type design on the top&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; highlighted that the &quot;new &quot;NYX&quot; look blends her classic Wolverine suit with the casual-wear she often sported in her early appearances&quot;. At SDCC 2024, it was announced that a solo ongoing series focusing on Laura will be spun out of events of &quot;NYX&quot;; Schultz will return to write &quot;Laura Kinney: Wolverine,&quot; with artist Giada Belviso, which is scheduled to release in December 2024.

==Fictional character biography==
===Innocence Lost===

A top-secret program is tasked to replicate the original Weapon X experiment that bonded adamantium to the skeleton of Wolverine. The project is taken in a new direction: Dr. Martin Sutter recruits renowned mutant geneticist Dr. Sarah Kinney to develop a clone of Wolverine. Also on the team is Sutter&#x27;s protege, Dr. Zander Rice, who was raised by Sutter after his father was killed by the original Weapon X.

Since the only genetic sample from Weapon X is damaged, Kinney is unable to salvage the Y chromosome. Kinney proposes the creation of a female genetic twin. Her request is denied; Rice is opposed to the idea. After 22 failed attempts at reconstituting the DNA using a duplicate X chromosome, the 23rd sample yields a viable sample to combine with an embryo. Although Kinney is allowed to proceed, Rice exacts revenge for her insubordination by forcing her to act as the surrogate mother of the specimen. For nine months, Kinney&#x27;s every move is monitored. Finally, she gives birth to &quot;X-23&quot;.

After seven years, Rice subjects X-23 to radiation poisoning to activate her mutant gene. He extracts her claws, coats them with adamantium, and reinserts them back into her hands and feeta procedure performed without affording the child any anesthetic. Rice creates a &quot;trigger scent&quot; that drives X-23 into a murderous rage when she detects it. X-23 is then trained to be a hired assassin, ordered to kill &quot;anyone ... everyone ... for a price.&quot;

Kinney&#x27;s niece Megan is abducted by a serial killer; she smuggles X-23 out of the facility to rescue her. X-23 tracks the abductor to his apartment, kills him, and frees Megan. Kinney is fired when she returns and is escorted off the base. Shortly thereafter, Rice assigns X-23 to eliminate Sutter and his family. He orders her to keep it secret. X-23 reveals to Sarah that Rice is responsible for the murders. Before Kinney leaves, Rice reveals a chamber containing the incubation pods for subjects X-24 through X-50.

Kinney drafts a letter to her daughter, assigning her a final mission: destroy the pods and kill Rice. X-23 succeeds and meets her mother, and they prepare to flee. However, prior to his death, Rice exposes Kinney to the trigger scent. X-23 goes into a murderous frenzy and kills her mother. As she lies dying, Kinney tells X-23 that her name is Laura and that she loves her, and hands her the letter and pictures of Charles Xavier, Wolverine, and the Xavier Institute.

===&quot;Target X&quot;===

After being arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Laura awakens bound and gagged in the company of Captain America and Matt Murdock, who proceed to interrogate her about her past. Laura describes how she traveled to San Francisco and tracked down Megan and Debbie (her mother&#x27;s sister). Introducing herself as Sarah&#x27;s daughter, she moves in with them. Although Megan experiences vivid nightmares of her abduction, her family believes these to be utter fantasies. Laura informs Megan that the man in her nightmares was indeed real and that she killed him.

Debbie&#x27;s boyfriend turns out to be an agent for the Facility who has been instructed to manipulate Laura into killing Megan and Debbie using the trigger scent to activate &quot;X-23&quot;. The agent fumbles the assignment by spilling the trigger scent on himself and is killed by Laura. Facility agents storm the house, led by the woman who served as Laura&#x27;s handler as X-23, Kimura, who had treated her harshly in the facility, punishing her even if the missions went according to plan.

Laura manages to get Megan and Debbie to safety by handcuffing Kimura to a radiator and then triggering an explosion in the house, buying some time. After Laura and Megan part, Laura decides to confront the man who made her creation possible, Wolverine. Laura tracks Wolverine to Xavier&#x27;s mansion and engages him in a battle, defeating him using tactics and maneuverability. She does not kill Wolverine, instead telling him why she came. Wolverine reveals that he is aware of Laura&#x27;s ordeal, having received a detailed letter from her mother. The talk is then interrupted when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Captain America come to arrest Laura.

Despite the mayhem in her past, Matt Murdock accepts Laura&#x27;s innocence. Captain America wants Laura to atone for the murders she has committed, but ultimately frees her both due to realizing the true situation of her brainwashing, and to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D. exploiting her as their own weapon. He takes Laura to a bus station and tells Laura to return to Logan. While on the bus, Laura pulls out letters from her mother and begins shedding tears as she reads them.

===&quot;NYX&quot;===

Laura surfaces in New York City and is again brainwashed, this time by a pimp named Zebra Daddy who exploits her as a prostitute catering to sadomasochistic patrons. In her spare time, Laura continues to cut herself with her own claws; unable to free herself from Zebra Daddy&#x27;s control, she becomes mute and withdrawn. Upon meeting Kiden Nixon, a young mutant with the ability to freeze time when in danger, and Tatiana Caban, a mutant who can take on the physical attributes of whoever and whatever she comes into contact with via their blood, X-23 starts to come to her senses. Although she runs away from Zebra Daddy, he tracks her down. With the aid of her new-found friends (and the mutant named Bobby Soul), Zebra Daddy and his thugs are defeated: Laura kills him to save the lives of her friends. Laura abandons her new friends, but years later would eventually bump into them one last time when on an investigation with Wolverine.

===X-Men===

Laura takes a job as a waitress at the mutant-themed &quot;Wannabee&#x27;s&quot; nightclub in the Mutant Town district of New York. She defends Jade Parisi, daughter of mob boss Don Parisi, against some thugs who berate her for having a mutant boyfriend. Laura kills some of the thugs and helps Jade escape and go into hiding. The deaths inadvertently implicate Wolverine, prompting his teammates to investigate. Laura attacks Wolverine on sight, but he eventually calms her down. She leads the X-Men to Parisi&#x27;s daughter. After aiding the X-Men against Parisi&#x27;s mutant enforcer Geech, Laura flees the scene. This encounter is later revealed to be partially arranged between Laura and Wolverine in order for her to encounter and ally with the X-Men without revealing her past.

She later returns to help the X-Men save victims of a car accident, after which she is enrolled at the Xavier Institute and assigned a room with Rachel Summers and Kitty Pryde. Laura behaves protectively towards Wolverine, observing him on the mansion&#x27;s security monitors and even attacking his teammate Bishop after he floors Wolverine during a training session.

During one of her sessions at the mansion&#x27;s monitors, an anomalous energy spike prompts Laura to investigate. She encounters Spider-Man at the source of the signal; mistaking him for an enemy, she attacks him. The pair ultimately team up to save the young mutant Paul Patterson from an alternate reality version of Iron Man known as Iron Maniac. The arrival of Captain America and the super-spy Black Widow help turn the tide, with Spider-Man and Laura destroying Iron Maniac&#x27;s equipment using their own version of the classic Fastball Special.

Laura secretly follows Wolverine on his investigation of strange activity in the Canadian Rockies. Ambushed by the Hauk&#x27;ka, evolved Saurians from the Savage Land, Laura manages to escape and alert the X-Men. Traveling to the Savage Land, Laura and the X-Men team-up with the Savage Land&#x27;s lord Ka-Zar and his allies, the Savage Land Mutates, to prevent the Hauk&#x27;ka from destroying human civilization by exerting control over the weather-manipulating X-Man, Storm.

===Captain Universe===
Laura is later empowered by the cosmic Uni-Power to become Captain Universe. She quickly learns that A.I.M. is seeking the Uni-Power in hopes of using it against their enemies. She agrees to help the Uni-Power, and travels with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent called the Scorpion to a secret A.I.M. hideout. There, they discover information on the Uni-Power that is being transferred to another facility. The Scorpion attempts to copy the information, but is stopped by Laura. The Scorpion is then ordered to take her into custody, but covers for her instead and allows Laura to escape. At the close of the issue, the Uni-Power bids farewell to Laura, and parts ways with her.

===Decimation===
After the events of &quot;House of M&quot; and &quot;Decimation&quot;, Laura was one of the few mutants to retain her powers. Having previously left the institute off-panel, she returns to the X-Mansion at Wolverine&#x27;s insistence. Laura develops an attraction towards Julian Keller, aka Hellion. Following a bombing at the school by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend William Stryker, Laura confronts Stryker at his compound, and kills three of his Purifiers, rescuing her comrades.

When Surge receives a distress call from Forge, Laura accompanies the New X-Men. Although the team disables the Nimrod unit, Laura is grievously wounded and is unable to heal herself. To save Laura, Hellion convinces Emma Frost to unlock his telekinetic potential, increasing his powers (and thus, his speed) to a level thought impossible by an O.N.E. sentinel guard. This allows them to fly back to the mansion in time for Laura to be healed by Elixir.

===Mercury Falling===
While Laura is bonding over coffee with Cessily, the cafe is attacked by Kimura and her minions, who in turn capture Cessily. After Laura returns to the school, she and Hellion go off to locate the Facility&#x27;s whereabouts. Laura interrogates a man at gun point, and upon securing the information, shoots him in the head. Hellion informs her that killing will no longer be a part of their interrogation technique.

Laura and Hellion infiltrate the Facility and after an encounter with Kimura, the two soon find Cessily in liquid form, barely able to compose herself. They are attacked by Predator X, who has absorbed Cessily&#x27;s liquid mercury skin. Laura and Hellion decide to fall back, but are pursued by the Predators. The group is once again ambushed, only to be rescued by the Astonishing X-Men and New X-Men. The two teams turn the tables on the attackers, and defeat the remaining facility troops. During the scuffle, the remaining Predator escapes.

Sometime later, Emma Frost finds Kimura trying to assassinate Laura, and confronts her, erasing the one happy moment in Kimura&#x27;s life from her memory, and psychically suggesting that Kimura&#x27;s assignment now is to hunt down the remaining members of the Facility and kill them.

===Messiah Complex===
Cyclops, assembles a new incarnation X-Force team that includes Laura, Wolverine, Wolfsbane, Caliban, Warpath, and Hepzibah. During the team&#x27;s confrontation with Lady Deathstrike, Laura nearly kills her in revenge for Deathstrike&#x27;s attack upon Hellion. Laura also saves Wolverine&#x27;s life by killing Scrambler just before he scrambled Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor.

Following the event of &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, Cyclops forms a black ops incarnation of X-Force to deal with threats preemptively. He drafts Laura Kinney for this team, though this puts him into conflict with Wolverine, whom he did not consult on this decision prior. Wolverine asks Laura to reconsider this, warning her of the life she is giving up should she continue on this path, but Laura ultimately decides to take her place on this team. Her conflict with Wolverine recurs over his observation that she is reckless with the lives of others.

===Messiah War===
The X-Men moved to San Francisco, where they are accepted as heroes by the mayor, having rejected the Fifty State Initiative. Laura is finally reunited with Kiden Nixon, who herself makes her first appearance outside the NYX series. This future version of Kiden is revealed to be a disruptor of time travel technology, which threatens to trap X-Force, Cable and Hope in this era. While Laura agonizes over whether to kill Kiden, Domino fatally shoots Kiden herself. In a subsequent storyline, Laura goes back in time to save Boom Boom when Domino and Proudstar are neutralized. During the course of this mission, Laura&#x27;s left arm is severed from her body. She is rescued by the X-Force, leading into the 2009 - 2010 &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline, which sees Laura reunited with her friends from the &quot;NYX&quot; series.

===&quot;Second Coming&quot;===
Laura is shown to be part of Cyclops&#x27; &quot;Alpha Roster&quot; in the course of the &quot;Second Coming&quot; story arc. Along with the most of X-Force, Laura accompanies Cable and Cypher to the future in an attempt to shut down the Nimrod invasion. Following Cypher successfully over-riding the programming, Laura attempts to return through the temporal portal, only to sustain horrific injuries. The portal prevents any organic matter traveling through it. This leads Cable to sacrifice himself, allowing his techno-organic virus to overwhelm him, forcing the portal open and making it possible for the team to return to Utopia.

In the fallout of &quot;Second Coming&quot;, Wolverine cuts Laura from the team, explaining to her that after a lifetime of following orders from others, she needs to learn to make her own choices and follow her own path. Laura subsequently tracks former Weapon X scientist Detlef Metzger, intending to capture him before he can perform experiments using a vial of Wolverine&#x27;s blood. Instead, Metzger is kidnapped by a group of US soldiers, while Laura notices that Daken has been watching her.

===&quot;X-23: Deadly Regenesis&quot;===
During the time of schism between Wolverine and Cyclops, Laura is separated from the division. Wondering where she truly belongs in life, Laura decides to leave the island of Utopia. However, she shortly finds herself dealing with Kimura, The Kingpin, and a new deadly enemy harboring a personal vendetta against her.

===&quot;X-23&quot; (Volume 3)===
Laura begins having horrible nightmares for mysterious reasons, then finds herself on a journey to self-discovery and begins a friendship with Gambit. They eventually travel to Madripoor to find clues to her nightmares. Laura continues having strange dreams once again, this time about a strange symbol, so she befriends the Fantastic Four and gets the job of babysitting Reed and Susan Storm&#x27;s children Franklin and Valeria.

===&quot;X-23: Girls Night Out&quot;===
Laura is asked by Wolverine to join his side. She replies by asking if there is any other choice. While she thinks about what choice she will make, Laura goes for a walk with Jubilee and asks her why she chose Cyclops&#x27; side. Jubilee tells her she chose to stay with Cyclops because, as a vampire, she can hear the heartbeat of everyone around her, and it makes her hungry and wants to eat them. Laura tells her that she will not hurt them but Jubilee tells her that the urge is there and that she needs to fight as much she needs blood. She cannot be with Wolverine because she is afraid to violate his new philosophy: if you are a kid you do not fight, and he sees her as a kid. Jubilee tells Laura that Logan sees her the same way, they both agree that it sucks. Laura&#x27;s phone rings as the others need an answer, but they ignore it and Jubilee tells Laura to go and have some fun and dance. Laura explains that she cannot dance, but Jubilee tells her it does not matter because she is hot. Laura tells her she is not hot. However, as they go, someone follows them. While Jubilee was dancing, Laura becomes distracted by looking at someone and recognized him as the person who took over Zebra Daddy&#x27;s operation. She and Jubilee attack him and his men and take the girl who was with him since she knew where the other girls were and how to free them. As they think about what to do with the girls, because they cannot just call the police, the Black Widow and some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents appear and take the girls to help them. Natasha offers Laura to come to the Avengers Academy and she accepts. The next day she tells Logan what happened, and Wolverine tells her he is going to miss her and he is sorry he could not do better by her. She tells him she is going to miss him too, then she takes a motorcycle and drives to the academy.

====&quot;Avengers Academy&quot;====
Following the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Laura appears as one of the students at the new Avengers Academy. The academy sees she does not need any combat training after she fought Tigra. After she introduced herself to the other students, she explained to Mettle the difference between killing an innocent and killing to protect an innocent, telling him that he is not a psycho killer, and that they can talk more about it another time. This makes Hazmat feel jealous. Finesse became friends with Laura due to their lack of emotion. Finesse also stood by Laura when she opposed the X-Men locking their students on the academy grounds during Avengers vs. X-Men. However, their friendship took a turn for the worse when Jeremy Briggs tried to release a superhuman cure. After Briggs took out Laura and tried to acid burn her, Finesse grabs Laura&#x27;s arms and fatally stabs Briggs in the radial and femoral arteries, making him bleed to death. Laura first thought she killed him, but when she finds out it was Finesse, she was furious. Laura agrees to keep Finesse&#x27;s secret, but declares they are no longer friends, upsetting Finesse.

====&quot;Avengers Arena&quot;====
After &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; and the conclusion of &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, Laura was part of the students abducted by Arcade in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;. Arcade turns them loose for 30 days in Murderworld to fight for survival. In a flash forward, it is shown that on the penultimate day, she attacks Hazmat and is badly burned, but the results are unknown as the flash forward then ends. The academy students set up camp and face off against the Runaways when Chase is framed, but Laura is soon separated from Reptil and Hazmat when Arcade covers the group in trigger scent and Reptil evacuates Hazmat. Laura then finds Justin and helps him strip down his Sentinel. When Apex kills Justin and takes his Sentinel, Laura goes to track them and get them back. After nearly being killed by Apex, Arcade unleashes trigger scent on all of Murderworld to send Laura in a berserker rage, at which point she injures Hazmat, as seen in the flash forward. Cullen turns into a giant monster and fights Laura, defeating her and powering her down from her rage. After that, Laura continues to injure Hazmat until Anachronism steps in, angry over Nara&#x27;s death and holding Laura responsible, attacking Laura and inadvertently saving Hazmat. By this point, most of Laura&#x27;s body is badly burned with radiation, and she is still in this state when the competition ends and Nico, Chase, Cammi, Deathlocket, and Anachronism call Hank Pym, Abigail Brand, Maria Hill, Captain Britain, and Wolverine to pick up the kids. Laura is loaded onto a SHIELD helicopter and is taken away to parts unknown, ending her affiliation with the Avengers Academy.

===&quot;All-New X-Men&quot;===

Unlike the other Arena survivors, Laura did not join the group in infiltrating the Masters of Evil. After the events of &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;, Laura is found by Kitty Pryde and the time-displaced original X-Men. She is amnesiac and being hunted by the Purifiers.

After being found by Kitty, Laura was taken to their base to recover. When Laura wakes up, with her memories now returning, at the former Weapon X facility she immediately tries to escape. Teen Cyclops goes to talk to her, while he&#x27;s gone Teen Jean mentions to the team that Teen Cyclops &quot;fancies&quot; Laura. As Laura makes it outside she&#x27;s met by Teen Cyclops, who was waiting for her. Teen Cyclops tries to calm her down but Laura only ceases hostility after getting Teen Cyclops scent and figuring out that Teen Cyclops is who he says he is.

The two talk, with Laura telling him that she does not want to talk about her past or what happened to her. Suddenly Teen Cyclops awkwardly hugs her, when she was distracted and looking sad, because he thought she needed a hug. Laura tells him that she does not do hugs, especially not with an audience as Kitty, Teen Jean, and Teen Beast were watching them. Teen Jean expressed a very conflicted look upon her face due to the hug and having read part of Laura&#x27;s mind, thus she knows what happened in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;. Laura thanks them for helping her and suggests they take the fight to the Purifiers, but in order for her to track them down, they will have to return her to where they found her.

Upon finding the Purifier base they immediately set out to attack them. However, the fight does not go well and the entire team is knocked unconscious by Stryker Jr. when Teen Jean learns too late that Stryker Jr. has powers of his own. Laura is also with the All-New X-Men when Teen Jean is abducted by the Shi&#x27;ar and the X-Men team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to save her. Later, she is attacked by Raze, who disguises himself as her to infiltrate Cyclops&#x27;s base. She subsequently begins to date the younger Angel, and meets Jimmy Hudson—the son of the Wolverine of the Ultimate Marvel universe—when the team are transferred into the Ultimate Universe by accident. She and the All-New X-Men team up again with the Guardians of the Galaxy in search of The Black Vortex, during which Angel submits himself to the Vortex and almost dies, but instead is granted golden light wings. She asks him why he endangered himself, and he tells her that he wanted to change himself so he will not turn into Archangel and that he can stay himself forever since he is in love with her.

===&quot;All-New Wolverine&quot;===
The series opens approximately eight months after &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, and reveals that her healing factor is working normally again after having been drained by Siphon in the Nexus of All Realities.

Laura later discovers that Robert Chandler of Alchemax Genetics had made three clones of her named Bellona, Gabby, and Zelda who did not manifest the same mutation as her. This led to a fight with Alchemax Genetics which led to Bellona escaping, Gabby being taken in by X-23, and Zelda being killed.

===&quot;The Hunt for Wolverine&quot;===
During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Laura attends a disguised black market auction in a submarine off the coast of Guam. After a disguised Tony Stark wins the genetic material of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones&#x27; daughter Danielle Cage in the auction, she advises Tony Stark to drop out of the auction afterwards. When the unidentified seller of the genetic material meets with Tony Stark, he is attacked by Mister Sinister for stealing the genetic material of the original Wolverine. Laura sheds her disguise and assists Iron Man in fighting Mister Sinister, slicing off Mister Sinister&#x27;s left hand. Iron Man finds information in Mister Sinister&#x27;s database which reveals that part of her genetic material was provided by Sarah Kinney, the scientist who created her and carried her to term. This makes her the .

===&quot;X-Men Red&quot;===
Laura and her sister Gabby Kinney appeared as members of Jean Grey&#x27;s X-Men Red team.

=== &quot;X-23&quot; (Volume 4) ===

Laura returns to the X-23 codename as she, her sister Gabby, and their pet Jonathan go on an adventure to prevent others from being experimented on.

===&quot;Krakoan Age&quot;===

Laura (back to her Wolverine moniker, now shared with her father figure) and Gabby moved to the mutant island-nation of Krakoa, starting a new chapter in their life alongside Logan and Akihiro. During the &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (vol. 2) storyline, Laura Kinney joins young Cable and Kwannon on a hunt to find the evil Japanese spirit Apoth that is attacking mutants.

Laura, alongside Synch and Darwin, were tasked to venture into The Vault, as their powers assures their chances of surviving the temporal disparity created by said place. As soon as the three entered the Vault, they lost contact with the X-Men, and because time moved much quicker inside the Vault, the trio were stuck within for centuries. Confirming their assumptions, the trio went on to survive as centuries went on, fighting different iterations of the Children of the Vault and growing close to Synch, until Darwin got captured and experimented upon by the Vault&#x27;s artificial intelligence in order to create an evolved batch of the Children, forcing Laura to sacrifice herself to give Synch enough time to escape and reach Xavier. With her status in doubt, Laura was revived by The Five without her memories of her time inside the Vault or the relationship developed between herself and Synch, who still had his memories intact. During the inaugural Hellfire Gala X-Men elections, both Laura and Synch were selected to join the team. There are some awkward encounters between the two because Laura is aware of the missing memories and relationship Synch had with the original version of her. At the next Hellfire Gala, Laura decides to leave the X-Men team.

It remained unknown to anyone that the newly-resurrected Laura was a duplicate, as the original Laura was not killed but instead captured and kept alive by the Children inside the Vault. Forge eventually discovered her on a rescue mission and took her back to Krakoa, where she was reunited with Synch. Afterwards, she moved with him into the X-Men&#x27;s Treehouse in New York City. After some spending some time together with Synch, they went for a talk with the younger Laura whom until then everyone presumed to be the original in order to set up some rules for their now shared existence: the younger Laura forfeited her resurrection rights to the older Laura but insisted that she would keep the name &quot;Wolverine&quot;. The older Laura agreed but warned that she wasn&#x27;t looking for future socializing or even encounters between them. She then adopted her old codename &quot;Talon&quot; and begun serving with the X-Men, while the younger Laura joined X-Force.

During the Fall of X storyline, Talon and Synch would go on to lead the X-Men while they were part of the mutant resistance following the attack on Krakoa by Orchis. Talon and Synch successfully steal technology to nullify Orchis&#x27; poisoned medicine from the High Evolutionary, however, he retaliates and disintegrates Talon&#x27;s body. Synch initially is able to support a psychic imprint of Talon&#x27;s mind that he can communicate with but without a way to download it into a new body, there is no way to bring Talon back to life. The Talon in Synch&#x27;s mind convinces him to let her go so that he has the power to fight Nimrod. Meanwhile, Wolverine has been similarly driven underground due to Orchis&#x27;s attack and reunites with Logan, Fang (formally Daken), Aurora, Northstar and others at X-Force&#x27;s new Arctic base. While outside of the base, Fang is ambushed and brutally killed by Sabretooth and multiversal variants which kicks off the Sabretooth War storyline. After the Sabretooth Army is driven away from the Arctic Base but manage to slaughter many of its inhabitants and abduct Laura, Logan falls into despair and Aurora mourns Fang&#x27;s death, which is rendered permanent as Krakoa&#x27;s Resurrection Protocols are no longer an option. Later in the conflict, during Sabretooth&#x27;s absence, Laura escapes and kills the Savage Sabretooth before sending a distress signal to X-Force. Fang&#x27;s death is avenged when Logan kills Sabretooth at the end of the conflict.

When Sync later teams up with Wolverine, they take a moment to grieve the loss of Talon.

=== From the Ashes ===
In the post-Krakoan Age, Laura (codename Wolverine) is now a hero in Brooklyn focused on &quot;saving mutants from harm on the streets of Bushwick&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Laura was apparently a female clone (later revealed as his biological daughter) created from Wolverine&#x27;s genetic material. Consequently, her mutant powers are similar to his. Like Wolverine, Laura&#x27;s primary mutant ability is an accelerated healing factor that allows her to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissues with far greater speed, efficiency, and finality than ordinary humans are capable of. Injuries such as gunshot wounds, slashes, and puncture wounds completely heal within a matter of seconds. She has also been shown to be able to reattach limbs; for example, she reattached her hand after she severed it to escape the restraints placed on her by Kimura. The effects of her accelerated healing powers extend to her body&#x27;s immune system, rendering her immune to disease and infection. She is also immune to most drugs and toxins, although she can be affected by certain drugs if given sufficient dosage. Given the regenerative nature of her cells, she is potentially-immortal, just like her father.

Laura&#x27;s mutant healing factor heightened her physical senses, speed, agility, reflexes/reactions, balance, and endurance to superhuman levels. Like Wolverine, Laura possesses retractable claws sheathed within her forearms. She releases the claws through the tissue of her knuckles, leaving small wounds which are healed by her healing factor. Unlike Wolverine, however, Laura has only two claws per hand which are her primary weapons of offence. She also has a single, retractable claw within each foot which she tends to use for defense. The claws were forcefully extracted by Zander Rice, sharpened, coated with adamantium, and reinserted into her body. Laura escaped before the procedure to fuse her entire skeleton with adamantium could be performed. Since the claws are laced with adamantium, they are virtually unbreakable and are capable of cutting almost any substance.

In addition to her own innate powers and skills, Laura has twice been the host of the Enigma Force, providing her with many special abilities particular to the entity. She is the first mutant to be chosen by the entity as its host, as well as being one of a handful of individuals to do so more than once. At the end of their second encounter, the Enigma Force named Laura as the heir to its power. This permanent association was first indicated by a mark appearing on the palm of her right hand at the conclusion of the &quot;Killing Dream&quot; arc of her solo series.

Born and raised in captivity, Laura has been trained to become a living weapon. She is highly trained in the use of long range weapons and explosives and is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with intensive training in numerous armed and unarmed martial arts techniques. She has also been subjected to conditioning in which a specific &quot;trigger scent&quot; has been used to send her into a berserker rage, killing anything in sight; Emma Frost is unsure if this will ever be fully suppressed. She has displayed fluency in French and Japanese, and Zander Rice once described her intellect as being &quot;off the charts&quot;.

==Relationships==
===Wolverine===
Laura and Logan talk and interact with each other in ways that are consistent with a father-daughter relationship (even though in &quot;New X-Men&quot;, Logan introduced her to the students as his sister). Logan acts protectively towards Laura and seems to have her well-being at heart, such as when he openly voiced his disapproval of Cyclops putting her on X-Force; he, however, did not force her to leave, though he told Gambit that he thinks he should have. When the pair first meet, Logan offers to help her start over at the Xavier Institute and says that he knows better than anyone what she is going through. Iron Man&#x27;s recent research confirmed that Logan is actually Laura&#x27;s biological father, rather than just being a female clone of Logan. After Logan&#x27;s death, Laura officially adopts his codename of &#x27;Wolverine&#x27; to honor his memory.

===Sarah Kinney===
Sarah was the first one to show Laura any sort of affection in spite of her orders from the Facility to not treat her like a child. Sarah would frequently read her &quot;Pinocchio&quot; as a child and showed concern when she noticed the cuts Laura inflicted on herself. It took Laura sparing the life of Henry Sutter for Sarah to realize that she was just as guilty of using Laura as the rest of the Facility was. Deciding to make things right, Sarah hatched a plan to escape with Laura, destroy the Facility&#x27;s work, and start over with her. However, thanks to Zander Rice lacing the trigger scent on her, Sarah was killed by Laura. With her dying breaths, Sarah tells &quot;X-23&quot; her name is Laura. Sarah&#x27;s final thoughts were left in a letter to Laura detailing her guilt, that she was Laura&#x27;s mother, and the realization that she had come to love her. Sarah&#x27;s death remains to this day the life that Laura regrets taking the most. Iron Man&#x27;s recent research confirmed that Sarah is actually Laura&#x27;s biological mother, rather than just being a surrogate. Writer Marjorie Liu has stated that she intended for Laura to be part Asian through her mother.

===Megan Kinney===
Laura&#x27;s cousin on her mother&#x27;s side. After escaping from the Facility Laura moved in with Sarah&#x27;s sister Debbie and her daughter Megan. For a time the two connected and Megan even admitted to Laura being her best friend. However, when Facility agents came to take Laura back, Laura helped them escape and make new identities so that they could hide. Laura and Megan then went their separate ways and have not heard from each other since, though Megan remains one of the people closest to Laura&#x27;s heart. In the 18th issue of &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot;, after killing Kimura by drowning her, Laura finds Megan&#x27;s hideout and says they (Megan and Debbie) do not have to hide anymore.

===Kiden Nixon===
Kiden, a homeless mutant from New York City, met Laura when she was a prostitute under the pimp Zebra Daddy. Kiden helped Laura to escape from her life as a prostitute and quickly befriended her though at this point Laura had difficulty speaking. Laura recounts in the &quot;X-23 One Shot&quot; that Kiden and her friends did not know or care that she was a weapon. To them, Laura was their friend and part of their gang. Laura parts ways with them at the end of the one shot, returning with Wolverine. They leave on good terms, and Kiden says that Laura will always have a place with them.

===Hellion===
The first boy that Laura formed a crush on. At first Hellion was hostile towards her, but during the &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; arc the two grew closer. Mercury managed to pick up on Laura&#x27;s feelings towards him though she did not get Laura to admit to it. Over time Hellion/Julian began to feel the same way, though their relationship never managed to get much further. When Julian lost his hands during &quot;Second Coming&quot;, Laura stayed by him, watching him recover. After the &quot;Misadventures in Babysitting&quot; arc Laura ended things between her and Julian saying that she no longer felt the same way towards him.

===Gambit===
Gambit traveled with Laura during the &quot;X-23&quot; solo series. The two became friends and looked out for one another as Gambit helped her to cope with the changes in her life as well as giving her helpful life advice. He affectionately referred to her as &quot;Petite&quot; and even managed to get her to calm down from a trigger scent-induced rage. Gambit scolded Logan for not protecting Laura the way he protected Jubilee, to which Logan admitted to his failings as Laura&#x27;s father. Gambit also went on to remark that Laura, while damaged, was far from being broken, contrary to everyone&#x27;s perceptions of her. If Laura was truly broken she would not be trying to change. Logan later on thanked Gambit for succeeding with Laura where he failed. When Laura left to join to the Avengers Academy, she and Gambit shared a goodbye hug and he told her wherever she went she was not alone.

===Jubilee===
During the &quot;Touching Darkness&quot; arc of the &quot;X-23&quot; series, Gambit had Wolverine come by to help Laura. Logan had brought Jubilee with him and Laura attacked her on sight due to her being a vampire. Though after getting some space between the two girls things managed to calm down. Laura had some jealousy towards Jubilee from the &quot;X-23&quot; one shot as Logan treated her more like a daughter than he did her. Laura tried to bait Jubilee into killing her by slicing her neck open and counting on her bloodlust, though Jubilee managed to stop herself after witnessing one of Laura&#x27;s memories. After talking things out, the two realized how much alike they were and became friends.

===Daken===
Logan/Wolverine&#x27;s son and the closest thing Laura has to a brother. Daken is to Laura what Sabretooth is to Wolverine, her opposite. Even though Laura admits that she and Daken are related by blood, the two do not initially see each other as family. Laura had fought with Daken when the Dark Avengers under Norman Osborn invaded Utopia. They did not truly meet until Laura and Gambit came to Madripoor looking to track down Malcolm Colcord. At first Daken does not believe that she is a clone of his father, until Laura reveals her claws. Daken berates her for coming to Madripoor and remarks that they are nothing alike. The two square off until Daken decides to offer his assistance, which Laura rejects. When Daken confronts Colcord about his plans to restart Weapon X, he reveals his subterfuge at leading Laura and Gambit to Colcord, though this turns out be a ruse as well, as he incapacitates Gambit and helps Colcord capture Laura. Daken learns about Laura&#x27;s past from Colcord and assists in her escape from her cell. He remarks that Laura is a construct, to which Laura retorts that he is just like her: Just like the Facility made Laura into a weapon, so did Romulus do to Daken, to which he responds that he owns his own fate. The two then enter a brief mutual alliance to destroy Colcord&#x27;s new project. Before they part ways, Daken asks Laura why she does not seek power when she could easily have it. Laura remarks that what she has to prove has nothing to do with power, and then asks Daken why he seeks more power when he already has it. Daken remarks that power is all he has. Laura&#x27;s encounter with Daken makes her realize that she owns her fate and can do with it what she wants. Daken does not seem to have the same hate towards Laura that he does with Logan, and by the time of later series such as &quot;Wolverines&quot;, he even begins to demonstrate affection towards her. In &quot;Reign of X&quot; and later stories, he actively refers to Laura as his sister along with Gabby.

===Angel===
Prior to the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Laura began a relationship with the time-displaced teenaged Warren Worthington III, which persisted after she took on the Wolverine codename. However, Warren clashed with her several times about her increasing recklessness. Following a brutal beating she received from Blob, he decided to end the relationship to make a point about the unnecessary risks she was taking. The two, however, reconciled after having come to understand each other&#x27;s feelings.

===Psylocke (Betsy Braddock)===
Laura and Psylocke became quite friendly with each other on their first meeting in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #456, shortly after Psylocke came back to life. Both girls seemed to share an enjoyment in fighting. In one instance, Laura was knocked out while Psylocke continued, upon awakening Laura saw all the enemies had disappeared and when she asked Psylocke what happened, Betsy joked that she ate them, to which Laura replied it was cool. Another shared moment was when Betsy and Laura discussed her coming back to life, which Laura did not see as unique since she herself had died repeatedly when she was experimented on to test her healing factor, but she always &quot;got better&quot;. When Psylocke asked how that made her feel, Laura smiled and said she killed them, and they did not get better. Betsy then smiled and wrapped her arm around Laura&#x27;s shoulder, saying she had some very definite possibilities. There have also been images of Laura imitating Betsy, including braiding her hair and mimicking her poses.

===Gabby Kinney===
In the first arc of &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; Laura learned that Alchemax genetics had created ten clones of her. All but four of the clones died in captivity, either during training or as a result of tests of a nanotech weapon that was slowly breaking down their bodies. Two others died during the escape; one who committed suicide after Laura foiled her attempt to assassinate Robert Chandler&#x27;s son, and a second killed by Chandler&#x27;s lead enforcer. The last two Sisters — Gabby and Bellona — survived. Laura took Gabby in and adopted her as her sister, taking it upon herself to give her the family Laura herself never had with Logan, in hopes of helping her find the right path. Much like Laura, Gabby possesses a regenerative healing factor and bone claws, however she only has a single claw in each hand. Additionally, as a result of the nanites in her blood Gabby does not feel pain. She eventually adopted a super-hero code name Honey Badger that was given by her brother Daken. She eventually gave the name up to become Scout.

=== Synch ===
During the Krakoan Age, Laura along with Synch and Darwin spent centuries in The Vault where Laura and Synch eventually developed a romantic relationship. Laura presumably dies after sacrificing herself to give Synch enough time to escape The Vault and reach Xavier. Laura was then revived by The Five without her memories of her time spent in The Vault with Synch. It is later revealed that the original Laura was kept alive by the Children of the Vault when Forge goes to rescue Darwin. Synch and Laura are reunited and move into the X-Men&#x27;s Treehouse in New York City together. They join the X-Men roster with Laura now going by the codename Talon while Laura&#x27;s younger duplicate, keeping the Wolverine codename, shifts to X-Force. When the High Evolutionary disintegrates Talon&#x27;s body, Synch is initially able to support and communicate with a psychic imprint of Talon&#x27;s mind. However, this occurs after the fall of Krakoa, so there is no way to physically resurrect this version of Laura. Laura convinces Synch to relinquish the strain on his powers and let her imprint go so that he can fight Nimrod. Alex Schlesinger, for &quot;Screen Rant&quot; in 2022, called their reunion &quot;a truly heartwarming one, with the intense and ancient love between Everett and Laura on full display, but because this is happening in an &quot;X-Men&quot; comic fans of the couple shouldn&#x27;t get too hopeful, as the future of this tragic romance is still yet to be revealed&quot;. Following the death of Talon&#x27;s body in &quot;X-Men&quot; #30 (January 2024), Robert Wood of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; commented that &quot;Synch and Laura&#x27;s relationship has been filled with heartache and tragedy, and this final twist of the knife confirms things will get worse before they get better – if they ever do&quot;. Jonathan Jones of &quot;AIPT&quot; highlighted the &quot;ominous&quot; use of The Lovers tarot card in the issue as Laura only remains alive as an imprint within Synch&#x27;s mind – &quot;The Lovers is a card of choice, sacrifices made for or at the cost of relationships; a test that impacts the partners&#x27; ability to remain in sync&quot;. Jones, in his review of &quot;X-Men&quot; #31 for &quot;AIPT&quot;, felt the &quot;emotional beats&quot; of Laura and Synch&#x27;s final conversation was a bit empty and that the creative team&#x27;s focus was on addressing the problem of Talon existence as a character. Jones opined that the arc of their relationship &quot;has ended for the time being, and in the end, it served no one, developed no one, and has not left a lasting impact on the story moving forward. On top of that, the majority of their romance before and after the Vault took place off-panel, making it even harder for readers to find a reason to care&quot;; however, Jones was more positive about artist Phil Noto&#x27;s portrayal of the characters in the issue as &quot;even if readers don’t especially care about Talon and Synch&#x27;s relationship, the emotional subtleties in their faces are worth a look through. Everett&#x27;s heartbreak hits even harder as he rises stone-faced against Nimrod while syncing Storm&#x27;s powers&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Critical reception ===
Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;X-23 is one a great handful of crossover characters who began in animation and were so well-liked by fans that they eventually made their way into comics. [...] Through the mentorship of Logan himself and the friendship of characters like Gambit, Jubilee, Angel, and her Laura&#x27;s own clone, Gabby, Laura has become a fully fleshed out character in control of her own destiny. When Logan died, X-23 mourned. When she was done mourning, she did what now seems like what she was alway destined to do. She became Wolverine, and she fills that role as well as her predecessor, if not better at times.&quot; David Harth of &quot;CBR.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Known for years as X-23, she proved herself on the hero scene before taking over as Wolverine after Logan&#x27;s death. She proved to be amazing at it and has since become Wolverine again, working with the X-Men. Fans have watched Wolverine grow for years, evolving from a lab created killing machine to a well-rounded human being. She&#x27;s gained a legion of fans since then and stepped onto the biggest mutant stage and impressed.&quot; Maddy Myers of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; said, &quot;The reason why X-23&#x27;s story is compelling to me is not because she&#x27;s a grim-dark teen killing machine, although that did speak to me when I was a depressed teenage girl. These days, her story resonates with me because it ends in self-acceptance and self-actualization. She gets to work with X-Men of various ages, decide which parental and authority figures are worth her trust, make new friends her own age, build a new family of her own with Logan and her &quot;sister&quot; clones, and – the cherry on top – she becomes the Wolverine! It&#x27;s a triumphant story that has been going on for about a decade, and it would be amazing to bring it to more audiences who aren&#x27;t as familiar with.&quot; Andy L. Kubai of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asserted, &quot;One of the most interesting characters to arrive since the original James Howlett is Laura Kinney, a.k.a. X-23. A female clone of Logan, she&#x27;s a Wolverine through and through, who first came to light via the short-lived animated series, &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; (2000). Creators Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle sought to capture younger viewers with a teenaged &quot;Wolverine&quot;, and they succeeded. Laura snowballed in popularity, transitioning into the comic book realm in 2004 and landing several limited series and team books (like &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;New X-Men&quot;), as well as a current ongoing series.&quot;

=== Volumes ===
=== &quot;X-23&quot; - 2005 ===
In 2005, Marvel Comics announced that &quot;X-23&quot; #1 sold out.

==== &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; - 2015 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; #1 was the 10th best selling comic book in November 2015.

Matt Little of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; #1 a &quot;fresh take on the legacy of &#x27;Wolverine&#x27; that fans will enjoy&quot;, asserting, &quot;&quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; #1 is a good Wolverine comic; it&#x27;s full of explosions and slashing and punching, the kind of stuff you want when you say to yourself, &quot;Hey, I want to read a Wolverine comic.&quot; Tom Taylor, who&#x27;s made a name for himself with mad violent stories like DC&#x27;s &quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot;, knows how to ratchet up tension and deliver a high caliber action sequence, which is what you get in the first issue. It&#x27;s a set piece that throws readers right into the middle of the action and catches them up as they go. David Lopez delivers more of his open, expressive art here, filling the issue with awesome choreography and rad character acting. [...] &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; is a worthy successor to the franchise. It blends the familiar and the fresh with style and keeps fans engaged the entire issue. Congratulations, Laura; you&#x27;re earning the codename &quot;Wolverine&quot;. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; #1 a grade of 8.5, saying, &quot;As much as this series is new in the sense that a completely different character is calling herself Wolverine, the book also reads like a return to basics. This issue is a solid start to a promising new series. [...] The Wolverine franchise has finally found its bearing, and all it took was a completely new character underneath that distinctive mask. This first issue is lean and fast-paced, tossing readers right into the heat of battle and proving the former X-23 worthy of inheriting the mantle of Wolverine.&quot; Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; included the &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; comic book series in their &quot;10 Best X-23 Comics&quot; list.

==== &quot;X-23&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-23&quot; #1 was the 9th best selling comic book in July 2018.

Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; stated, &quot;The comic has some good emotional beats to it as well, and, on the whole, it is an excellent continuation of the &quot;All-New Wolverine&quot; title. [...] &quot;X-23&quot; #1 was a promising and thoroughly entertaining new start to for Laura and Gabby Kinney. Their dialogue is wonderful, and this first arc seems like it will be an interesting dive into the characters and their ethos. This one earns a recommendation. Give it a read.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;X-23&quot; #1 a grade of 8.2 out of 10, writing, &quot;Of the many comics revealed as part of Marvel&#x27;s Fresh Start relaunch, X-23 seemed the least appealing at first glance. Not because of the character herself or the creative team, but the title and what it implies about the character&#x27;s future. These past few years have been a boon to Laura Kinney, allowing her to rise above her tragic origins and embrace the legacy of her &quot;father&quot;. [...] How well this new series can thrive with the return of Wolverine remains to be seen, but for now X-23 is off to a promising start. The series is hardly the departure from All-new Wolverine it seemed initially, and it thrives on the same keen visual style and strong dynamic between Laura and Gabby.&quot; Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; included the &quot;X-23&quot; comic book series in their &quot;10 Best X-23 Comics&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate universe variant of Laura Kinney named Kirika appears in &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot;. This version is the biological daughter of Weapon X (Wolverine) and Mariko Yashida who possesses three claws like her father. Having been captured by Mister Sinister and held prisoner in one of his labs, Kirika is later found by Magneto, who grafts adamantium to her claws at her request, before she is killed by Wolverine.

===Infinity Wars===
Weapon Hex, an amalgamation of X-23 and the Scarlet Witch, appears in &quot;Infinity Wars&quot;. This version was created by the Evolutionaries, an occult and scientific group that had been using and killing mutants in an attempt to find one to serve as a vessel for the demon Mephicton (a fusion of Mephisto and Chthon). Following a string of failures, the group&#x27;s leaders Sarah Kinney and Herbert Wyndham conceived a flawed child to act as the vessel. However, the former raised Laura with empathy and humanity in mind while the latter sought to weaponize her. After turning 17, Sarah&#x27;s death, and learning she had a younger sister named Gavrill (a fusion of Quicksilver and Honey Badger), Laura chose to escape with her. She would eventually succeed, killing Herbert in the process.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Laura Kinney / X-23 appears in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, voiced by Tara Strong. Introduced in the episode &quot;Stolen Lives&quot;, this version is mute and displays a desire to fight Wolverine. In a possible future depicted in the three-part series finale &quot;Foresight&quot;, Wolverine finds four clones frozen in a Weapon X facility and awakens them to help him and Professor X defeat a group of Sentinels.
* Laura Kinney / X-23 makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; episode &quot;Too Many Wolverines!&quot; as a creation of Egghead&#x27;s.

===Film===

* Laura Kinney / X-23 makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Hulk vs. Wolverine&quot; as an infant within a Weapon X research facility.
* Laura / X-23 appears in &quot;Logan&quot;, portrayed by Dafne Keen. In February 2017, producer Simon Kinberg stated that the post-credits scene of &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, in which the Essex Corporation acquires James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett / Wolverine&#x27;s blood, correlates with how the Alkali-Transigen corporation eventually acquires DNA and begins creating clones for use as weapons in &quot;Logan&quot;. This version is an 11-year-old girl created by Transigen from Logan&#x27;s DNA who inherited her genetic donor&#x27;s bone claws and advanced regenerative capabilities. Even at her tender age, she is already a very formidable fighter; on several occasions, she singlehandedly faced off a whole detachment of Reavers. She was one of several mutant children who had been slated for termination when Transigen created X-24, an adult clone of Wolverine loyal to them, until Transigen nurse Gabriela Lopez helped her escape. With Logan&#x27;s help, she and the children eventually escape across the border to Canada, though Logan is killed in battle against X-24 before Laura kills the latter in turn.
** &quot;Logan&quot; director James Mangold stated that he would like to see Laura appear in a future &quot;Logan&quot; follow-up, tentatively titled &quot;Laura&quot;, and that he would like to be involved in one way or another, should that happen. Kinberg also stated that 20th Century Fox&#x27;s plans for future movies did include the character. On October 24, 2017, Mangold confirmed in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that a script for a &quot;Laura&quot; spin-off film was in the works, stating: &quot;We&#x27;re just working on a script.&quot; He had also cited the success of Warner Bros. and DC Films&#x27; &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; as inspiration. It was subsequently announced that Laura Kinney creator Craig Kyle would be involved alongside Mangold. However, in March 2019, after Disney&#x27;s purchase of Fox, an executive from the latter Emma Watts described &quot;The New Mutants&quot; as the final film in the &quot;X-Men&quot; series, which has left the future of the &quot;Laura&quot; film in doubt.
** Laura appears in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; via archive footage from &quot;Logan&quot;.
** Laura appears in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, portrayed again by Dafne Keen. Having been sent to the Void by the Time Variance Authority following the events of &quot;Logan&quot;, she joins a resistance movement against the Void&#x27;s ruler Cassandra Nova and later teams up with Deadpool and an alternate universe variant of Logan to stop her from destroying the multiverse. Following Nova&#x27;s death, Laura joins Logan in leaving the Void and meeting Deadpool&#x27;s friends.

<text>Tengiz field (, &quot;Teñız mūnai ken orny&quot;) is an oil field located in Zhylyoi District, Atyrau Region, northwestern Kazakhstan.

==Geography==
The oil field is located in an area of low-lying wetlands along the northeast shores of the Caspian Sea. It covers a project license area which also includes a smaller Korolev field as well as several exploratory prospects.

Sizewise, Tengiz reservoir is wide and long. Discovered in 1979, Tengiz oil field is one of the largest discoveries in recent history. The city of Atyrau, north of Tengiz, is the main transport hub of Tengiz oil. Many nations are involved in a large geopolitical competition to secure access to this source of oil.

==History==
The Tengiz field, first discovered in 1979, has recoverable reserves estimated at between six billion and nine billion barrels. The field was jointly developed in 1993 as a 40-year venture between Chevron Texaco (50%), KazMunayGas (20%), US ExxonMobil (25%) and LukArco (5%). The joint venture company is known as Tengizchevroil (TCO). Chevron is the operator of the TCO field.
The Tengiz oil fields entered a new phase of production with the construction of its Second Generation Project (SGP) and the introduction of sour gas injection (SGI). This onshore development, which has been in the planning and approval stage since 2002, began in 2004 and required a total investment of $7.4bn. The integrated project was completed in the second half of 2008.

Prior to its expansion in 2008, the Tengiz oilfield had 53 wells, tapping a column of crude oil around 1.6km thick. When the field was first tapped its oil pressure was 12,000psi, but in 2004 the pressure came down to 10,000psi in most areas and 8,500psi in others. The SGI project used gas injection technology to boost the pressure and increase oil recovery, while the SGP increased the number of producers (wells) and improved and expanded the crude export infrastructure.

The Tengiz field’s production of crude in 2004 was 13 million tonnes per year but the SGI and SGP production increased this to over 25 million tonnes. TCO crude oil production capacity was increased by about 80% to 540,000 barrels of crude oil, 46,000 barrels of natural gas liquids and 760 million cubic feet of natural gas.

The two projects created over 7,000 jobs in Kazakhstan and aided the development of the economy. A total investment of $20bn is envisaged for the duration of the 40 years of the Tengiz oil field venture.

Tengizchevroil intends to export more of the Tengiz field’s additional capacity via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC)pipeline running the 1,500km from Tengiz to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk (thus solving the export problem from the remote Tengiz field).

Net daily production in 2019 (Chevron share) averaged 290,000 barrels of crude oil, 419 million cubic feet of natural gas and 21,000 barrels of natural gas liquid.

The integrated Future Growth Project-Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP-WPMP) is designed to further increase total daily production from the Tengiz reservoir and maximize the ultimate recovery of resources.

The FGP will use state-of-the-art sour gas injection technology, successfully developed and proven during TCO’s previous expansion in 2008, to increase daily crude oil production from Tengiz by approximately 260,000 barrels per day.

Kazakhstan finalized the consortium agreement with Chevron in 1993. In 1997, Lukoil purchased 5% in the Tengiz project from Chevron, and in 2000, Chevron built up its interest in the project to 50% by acquiring additional shares from Kazakhstan. In 2003, Fluor was awarded the rights to develop the Second Generation Plant (SGP) and Sour Gas Injection (SGI) project, which were expected to double production. In 2004, the Tengiz Consortium raised $1.1 billion in senior secured bonds to finance these two projects. These two projects were expected to finish in 2006, but were delayed. In October 2006, the Tengizchevroil joint venture experienced riots. Shortly after in 2007, the Republic of Kazakhstan invited Maksat Idenov as First Vice President of Kazmunaigas and Chairman of the Partnership Council of the Tengizchevroil Joint Venture. During Idenov&#x27;s tenure, the SGP and SGI expansion projects (worth over $6.9 billion) were completed in the second part of 2008, and stakeholder engagement began for the Future Growth Project (FGP) in 2009. In 2012, TengizChevroil began the Future Growth Project (FGP), whose aim is to continue to increase the field&#x27;s production.
In 2014, Chevron and its partners, KazMunaiGas, ExxonMobil and Lukoil began the process of selecting engineering companies to work on the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the Future Growth Project, which will further expand the TCO oil field.

===Conflict===

In 2006 during the SGP project an argument between Turkish and Kazakh workers led to an outbreak of violence. 115 Turkish citizens were evacuated for medical treatment. 

In 2019 during the 3GP project dozens of Arab expat workers were injured during violence sparked by a photograph shared on social media. Photos of the attacks on Arab expats were spread online throughout the Arab world, leading to a diplomatic dispute between Kazakhstan and several Arab countries including Jordan and Lebanon. 

==Reserves and production==
Estimated at up to of oil originally in place, Tengiz is the sixth largest oil field in the world; recoverable crude oil reserves from Tengiz and Korolev fields combined have been estimated at . Korolev field alone holds of oil making it one-sixth the size of Tengiz. Like many other oil fields, the Tengiz also contains large reserves of natural gas. The field is one of the world&#x27;s largest oil fields, rivaling the Gulf of Mexico in reserves of oil.

Since the oil from Tengiz contains a high amount of sulfur (up to 17%), an estimated 6 million tons of sulfur byproduct were stored in the form of large sulfur blocks as of December 2002. At the time, about 4,000 tonnes a day was being added. On 3 October 2007, the Kazakh environment ministry was reported to be considering imposing fines against TCO for alleged breaches in the way the sulfur is stored.

In 2002, TCO produced , or one third of Kazakhstan&#x27;s daily production. In January 2003, after contentious negotiations with the government of Kazakhstan, the TCO consortium members initiated a $3 billion expansion project designed to boost production to approximately by 2006. In September 2008, Chevron Corporation announced that the major expansion of Tengiz field was completed and it would boost the production capacity to . In 2012 Chevron announced the field will see its total daily production increase by 250,000-300,000 barrels, bringing production above 500,000 barrels per day.

An area of major geopolitical competition involves the routing of oil out of this oil field. Oil from the Tengiz field is primarily routed to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) project. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline is an alternative pipeline developed by U.S. and UK interests originating in the Southern Caspian which is the principal export route for crude from Azerbaijan and bypasses dependence on the Russian pipeline. In addition, Total S.A. is interested in developing a pipeline south through Iran, which is theoretically the cheapest route due to the geopolitical climate involving Iran, however, the United States does not favor this route.

==Environmental concerns==
The oil from Tengiz field comes out of the wells hot and at a very high pressure, believed to be the highest in the world. It also contains large proportion of gas which is rich in the compound hydrogen sulfide yielding poisonous sulfur.

=== 1985 explosion ===
On 23 June 1985 an explosion occurred after oil and gas violently made its way to the surface from a depth of 4 km, causing a -high, wide column of fire visible from , killing one man. The deadly gas made it impossible for Soviet firefighters to quickly extinguish the fire. The well was not extinguished until over a year later on 27 July 1986 and was finally capped. 

The fire caused severe environmental damage, with long lasting pollution in a radius of over 100 km, due to the release of 900,000 tons of soot, 3.4 million tons of oil, 1.7 billion m³ of gas and 850 tons of mercaptans. Illnesses in the Atyrau region increased by 50% and an estimated one million birds died.

=== Later developments ===
The government of the Kazakhstan imposed stricter guidelines for handling the sulfur. In 2006, Kazakh government threatened TengizChevroil with imposing fines. In 2007, the government imposed a $609 million (74.4 billion tenge) fine on TengizChevroil. The violations included a slow progress in dealing with vast sulfur stocks at Tengiz. The company had reportedly been fined $71 million in 2003 for open air sulfur storage as well, which was then reduced to $7 million on an appeal. According to the Environmental Protection Ministry, over 10 million tonnes of sulfur was accumulated near Tengiz oil field as a by-product of crude oil production.

Government had also set a requirement to relocate the village of Sarykamys which had 3,500 residents to new homes in the vicinity of Atyrau. The relocation program was funded by TengizChevroil and was done in 2004-2006. It cost the company $73 million.

In his book &quot;Poor People&quot;, published in 2007, William T. Vollmann dedicates a significant amount of his attention to the native peoples living in Sarykamys and Atyrau and the effects of TengizChevroil&#x27;s presence in these towns. Vollmann&#x27;s account suggests that serious and widespread health risks were imposed upon the people of Sarykamys. Vollmann also suggests that in the corporation&#x27;s efforts to displace the natives, many were not compensated fairly, so that upon being forced to move from their existing homes, they were unable to find or afford comparable housing in a new town.

==Geology==
The sedimentary section of the pre-Caspian basin varies between 5 km to 24 km and is dominated by the Permian Kungurian salt, which is overlain by the later (post-salt) deposits of Upper Permian, Mesozoic and Cenozoic all deformed by salt tectonics and earlier (pre-salt) Paleozoic and upper Proterozoic carbonates and terrigenous sediments. Reflection seismology in 1975 revealed the Karaton tectonic uplift, which was 400 km2 in area and 1 km in relief, at a depth of 4 km. An exploratory well was drilled in 1979, discovering &quot;significant oil flow&quot; from the middle Carboniferous carbonates overlain by Lower Permian clays and the massive Permian salt.

Stratigraphy starts with the Upper Devonian Famennian Stage consisting of homogeneous biogenic limestone and some thin dolomite interbedding, followed by Lower Carboniferous deposits consisting of Tournaisian, Visean and Namurian Stage limestones. Next comes the Middle Carboniferous Bashkirian Stage limestones, and then the Lower Permian Artinksian Stage argillaceous sediments. The carbonate buildup is up to 4 km thick and form an angular unconformity to the overlying Permian sediments.

==In pop culture==
The Tengiz oil field was mentioned in the film &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005) starring George Clooney.

<text>Robert Mezey (February 28, 1935 – April 25, 2020) was an American poet, critic and academic. He was also a noted translator, in particular from Spanish, having translated with Richard Barnes the collected poems of Borges.

He was born in Philadelphia, and attended Kenyon College as a contemporary of E. L. Doctorow and James Wright; after a time and serving in the army he finished in 1959 an undergraduate degree at the University of Iowa.
Having worked for a while, he became a graduate student at Stanford University.
Then he began teaching at Case Western Reserve University, in 1963.
During a year at Franklin and Marshall College he was for a time suspended after an accusation of inciting students to burn draft cards. After holding other positions, he settled in 1976 at Pomona College, until retiring in 2000.

He received numerous awards including the 2002 Poets&#x27; Prize for &quot;Collected Poems: 1952-1999&quot;.

<text>Hollywood Park was a thoroughbred race course located in Inglewood, California, about 3 miles (5 km) from Los Angeles International Airport and adjacent to the Forum indoor arena. In 1994, the original Hollywood Park Casino was added to the racetrack complex. Horse racing and training were shut down in December 2013 though the casino operations continued until the Hollywood Park Casino opened in October 2016.

The track was demolished in stages from 2014 until 2016 and the area is now the site of a master-planned neighborhood in development named Hollywood Park after the former track. The most prominent parts of the development are SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL), YouTube Theater, a 6,000-seat performance arts venue, Hollywood Park Casino, and the NFL Los Angeles building, which is home to the NFL Network, NFL RedZone, NFL.com, and the NFL app.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
The track was opened on June 10, 1938, by the Hollywood Turf Club the racetrack was designed by noted racetrack architect Arthur Froehlich. Its chairman was Jack L. Warner of the Warner Bros. film studio. Prominent shareholders included Jack Warner&#x27;s brother and fellow Warner Bros. executive Harry, Hollywood studio executives Walt Disney, Samuel Goldwyn, Darryl Zanuck, actors Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Joan Blondell, George Jessel, Ronald Colman and Ralph Bellamy. In addition to being shareholders film directors Raoul Walsh and Mervyn LeRoy were also founding members of the track&#x27;s Board of Directors with Jack and Harry Warner and Al Jolson.

===War closure and rebuilding===
Hollywood Park closed from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II, where it was used as a storage facility for North American Aviation. In 1944, the California Horse Racing Board permitted Hollywood Park to hold a new charitable season. The board approved an “extensive war relief program” for both 1944 and 1945 and Hollywood Park raised more than $1 million for charities and schools. In 1949, shortly after $1 million in upgrades were made, the grandstand and clubhouse were destroyed by fire. The rebuilt facility reopened in 1950. Both Thoroughbred racing and harness racing took place at the venue.

Marje Everett, who sold Arlington Park to Gulf &amp; Western in 1968, became part-owner of Hollywood Park.

Everett became director in 1972 and CEO in 1985. Circa 1979, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Hollywood Park was &quot;one of the West Coast’s largest and most popular racetracks.&quot; Thoroughbred racing took place until July (post time 2 p.m, Wednesday through Sunday), harness racing began in late August.

In 1984, the racetrack was extended from around to around prior to the first Breeders’ Cup race.

By the late 1980s the racetrack Hollywood Park, though frequented by celebrities, was near the point of bankruptcy. In 1989, a group of investors was working to buy Los Alamitos Racetrack in California for $68 million. Los Alamitos, owned by Hollywood Park, was still under its original ownership as of 1991, though a significant portion of the stock had been bought by external investors. RD Hubbard became CEO of Hollywood Park in April 1991, after having purchased a portion of the company&#x27;s stock in late 1990. He was assisted in the ouster of Marje Everett by company shareholder Tom Gamel and sports businessman Harry Ornest. In 1991, $20 million was spent improving the racetrack. That year the park earned its first profit in five years, and despite rioting in nearby Los Angeles in 1992, annual profits that year increased to $5.4 million. By 1993, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;shareholders at Hollywood Park... are enjoying substantial investment gains.&quot; A card club casino was added to the complex in 1994, as Hollywood Park underwent a $100 million expansion into Hollywood Park Casino, which opened in the summer of 1994. Also in 1994, Hollywood Park Inc. purchased the Arizona-based Turf Paradise Race Track for $34 million in stock.

In May 1995 after the departure of the Rams for St. Louis, the owners of the National Football League teams approved with a 27–1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, 65,000-seat, privately financed stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park for the Los Angeles Raiders. The deal was put together by Hubbard who envisioned a sports complex with the new stadium and the racetrack together. Raiders owner Al Davis later balked and refused the deal over a stipulation that he would have to accept a second team at the stadium. After the deal fell through the Raiders returned to Oakland, California. While the stadium plan was never realized, the site became a focus of plans by the National Football League to bring the league back to the Los Angeles Area.

Hollywood Park Inc. suffered losses in 1995, though at the end of 1996, Hollywood Park bought Boomtown, Inc. for $188 million. Boomtown was headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and operated and owned casinos in several other cities such as Las Vegas and New Orleans. Boomtown merged with the casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment in 1998. Hollywood Park was purchased by Churchill Downs Incorporated on September 10, 1999 for $140 million. Churchill Downs acquired Hollywood Park-Casino in the process, which was in turn leased by Hollywood Park Inc. (later named Pinnacle Entertainment). The previous owners of the track renamed their company Pinnacle Entertainment to concentrate on its gambling interests.

===Sale and later developments===
In July 2005, Churchill Downs Incorporated sold the track to the Bay Meadows Land Company which was owned by Stockbridge Capital Group for $260 million in cash. Under the terms of the deal, the company, which at the time also operated Bay Meadows in San Mateo, was to continue thoroughbred racing at Hollywood Park for at least three years. According to Bay Meadows officials, the continuation of Hollywood Park as a racing venue after that depended on California allowing more gambling, like slot machines, to the track.

Some of the Hollywood Park land was sold to real estate developers to build a new housing community called the Inglewood Renaissance. Development began in 2005.

New grass was planted on the turf course after Hollywood Park&#x27;s spring-summer meet in 2005. Due to safety concerns, however, turf racing was not conducted for that year&#x27;s autumn meet. As a result, several major stakes races that comprised Hollywood&#x27;s Autumn Turf Festival were cancelled that year.

After the conclusion of Hollywood&#x27;s spring-summer meet in 2006, it was announced that a second chute would be built inside the turf course to accommodate sprint races at six furlongs. This followed a similar move by Monmouth Park to build a turf chute for sprint races.

In 2010, Hollywood Park played host for the first time to Oak Tree.

====Betfair/Hollywood Park Agreement====
The Hollywood Park Racing Association and Betfair US, the Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Betfair that also owns TVG Network, completed a historic agreement March 13, 2012 intended to transform the customer experience for fans at the venue as well as online and on television. Under terms of the five-year deal, Hollywood Park was renamed &quot;Betfair Hollywood Park&quot; in what was the first naming rights agreement for a horse racing venue in the United States.

===Closure and redevelopment===

On May 9, 2013, in a letter to employees, Hollywood Park president F. Jack Liebau announced that the track would be closing at the end of their fall racing season in 2013. In the letter, Liebau stated that the on which the track sits &quot;now simply has a higher and better use&quot;, and that &quot;in the absence of a favorable change in racing&#x27;s business model, the ultimate development of the Hollywood property was inevitable&quot;. It was expected that the track would be demolished and replaced by housing units, park land and an entertainment complex, while the casino would be renovated.

On December 22, 2013, at 6:11pm the final race was run with Woodsman Luck taking first place, Depreciable in second place and Danderek in third place, concluding 75 years of near-continuous racing in Southern California. The complex was demolished in 2014 to make way for a new residential complex.

In 2014, Stan Kroenke, owner of the NFL&#x27;s St. Louis Rams, purchased a parcel of land adjacent to the track property and The Forum with the intentions of building a National Football League stadium on the land. Kroenke&#x27;s was not big enough for an NFL stadium and parking, but his announced partnership for the neighboring track land with Stockbridge Capital Group, would fold the stadium into the larger office/retail/residential project planned for the track site by master planner Hart Howerton.

On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved a plan to build a 70,000-seat football stadium on the site in anticipation of the St. Louis Rams moving back to Los Angeles (which was the team&#x27;s previous home from 1946 until 1994). On May 31, 2015, with Inglewood mayor James T. Butts Jr. on hand sporting a Rams cap, the grandstand was reduced to rubble in a flurry of timed explosions.

On January 12, 2016, the NFL voted to move the Rams back to Los Angeles by a vote of 30–2, a move of the Chargers would soon follow next year after a failed attempt at getting a new stadium built in downtown San Diego. In October 2016, the last part of the former track, the Casino, was demolished and a new Hollywood Park Casino was opened next door. Construction of the new stadium and redevelopment of the former track site began in earnest.

The graves of horses buried at the track such as Native Diver, Landaluce, and Great Communicator and their monuments were moved to other tracks in the area or to the horses&#x27; breeding grounds. The statue of Swaps and Bill Shoemaker that stood at the clubhouse entrance gardens was placed into storage and will be placed either at the new development or in a new location.

Several ficus trees were saved from the former track property and re-planted within the new development around SoFi Stadium.

===Notable events at the track===

==Physical attributes==

The track had a dirt oval, plus a 1-mile 145 foot (1.654 km) turf oval. The track regularly seated 10,000 people. A new Cushion Track racing surface was installed in September, 2006 to replace the existing dirt, making Hollywood Park the first track in California to meet the California Horse Racing Board&#x27;s guideline that all tracks in the state replace dirt surfaces with a safer artificial surface by the end of 2007.

==Racing==

These races were the graded stakes races run at Hollywood Park. Most of the races were moved to Santa Anita Park, Los Alamitos Race Course, and Del Mar Racetrack after Hollywood Park closed. (All turf stakes listed below were put on hiatus during the 2005 Autumn Meet.)

<doc id="1014309" wikidata="Q475219" url="?curid=1014309" title="Niutao">
<text>Niutao is a reef island in the northern part of Tuvalu. It is one of the nine districts (islands) of Tuvalu. It is also one of the three districts that consist of only one island — not counting the three islets inside the closed lagoon. Niutao has a population of 582 (2017 census).

==Geography==
There are two lakes (ponds or lagoons), which are brackish to saline. The larger has three islands and a dam. There are three wells in which fresher water sits in a &quot;lens&quot; above the salt water that leaches in through the coral. Older maps show the only village as Tuapa (with the neighbourhood of Angafoulua). The main village is Kulia; another village is Teava. There is a maneapa (community hall), Uepele Primary School, a church named &quot;Tineifale&quot; of the Church of Tuvalu, a post office, and three wells. A gravel road rings the island to connect the graveyard, half mile (800 m) counter clockwise from the village, and clockwise a quarter of a mile (400 m) to the hospital. The island is somewhat a horizontal oval which has a length of about one mile (1.6 km). Vegetation is abundant but of very limited variety. Main food staples are pulaka (Cyrtosperma merkusii) or &quot;swamp taro&quot; that is grown in the pits; breadfruit, coconut and pandanus is also cultivated. A fringing reef surrounds the whole island, which makes local fishing and transport into and out of the island difficult.

In March 2015 Niutao suffered damage to houses, crops and infrastructure as the result of storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Niutaoans believe that their ancestors came from Samoa in the 12th or 13th century. Niutaon mythology tells the story of the people who first inhabited Niutao: &quot;The first inhabitants of Niutao were half spirit and half human beings who lived at Mulitefao. Their leader was Kulu who took the form of a woman. The first human settlers came from Samoa in a canoe captained by a man called Mataika. He settled at Tamana on the eastern side of the island, where winds swept the spray of the surf over the reef.&quot;

In the 15th century warriors from Tonga were defeated in a battle on the reef of Niutao at a place known as &quot;Tāga A Kaupapa&quot;. Tongan warriors also invaded Niutao later in the 15th century and again were repelled. A third invasion of Tongan warriors occurred in the late 16th century; with a fourth following when the Tongans were defeated at a place called &quot;Tekamaitoga&quot;.

During the 17th century warriors invaded from the islands of Kiribati on two occasions. These battles were fought on the reef; the I-Kiribati stood at &quot;Tuteatua&quot; and the Niutaoan warriors stood at &quot;Agaia&quot;; the sacred place named &quot;Teititapalua&quot; identifies the site of these battles. In the late 17th century fighting occurred in Niutao between competing leaders, with the followers of the defeated leaders being forced off Niutao and were allowed to settle on Nanumea.

Niutao is part of a distinct linguistic area of Tuvalu, that includes the islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga as well.

===European contact and Christianization===
There has been some debate as to the first European (Palagi) to visit Niutao, Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) solved what Europeans described as &quot;The &#x27;Mystery&#x27; of Gran Cocal&quot; and identified Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa as sailing past Niutao on May 5, 1781. Laumua Kofe (1983) accepted Chambers and Munro&#x27;s conclusions, with Kofe describing Mourelle&#x27;s ship &quot;La Princesa&quot;, as waiting beyond the reef, with Nuitaoans coming out in canoes, bringing some coconuts with them. &quot;La Princesa&quot; was short of supplies but Mourelle was forced to sail on — naming Niutao, &quot;El Gran Cocal&quot; (&#x27;The Great Coconut Plantation&#x27;).

The next European recorded as sighting Niutao was Obed Starbuck, a whaling captain, who visited Niutao on the &quot;Loper&quot; in 1825, naming it &#x27;Loper Island&#x27;. Presumably this was on November 19 and or November 20, 1825.

Charlie Douglas was an early trader on Niutao in the 1850s. Christianization of Niutao began in 1861, with the first introduction by the traders Mr Tom and Mr Jack with the help of Mr Ah Fong and Mr Tong. Mose, from Vaitupu, helped persuade the chiefs and people of Niutao to accept Christianity. The first preachers were a Samoan missionary and a Niuean missionary. Tapumanaia Kitiona was the Samoan missionary on Niutao who arrived in 1865 after graduating from Malua Theological College in Samoa. The Reverend Archibald Wright Murray, of the London Missionary Society, visited in 1866. Murray reported that a blackbirder (a slave ship seeking to kidnap workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands in Peru) had called but no islanders were taken by the blackbirders because of the actions of McKenzie, the resident trader. In 1870, Tapu of Samoa and Sione of Niue, two teachers from the Samoa Fono Tele (General Assembly of Samoan Churches) were delivered to Niutao by the Reverend Samuel James Whitmee.

Navy ships known to have visited Niutao in the 19th century are: &quot;HMS Basilisk&quot;, Captain John Moresby (July 1872); &quot;HMS Emerald&quot;, Captain William Maxwell (1881); &quot;HMS Royalist&quot;, Captain Edward Davis (1892); and , Captain Herbert Gibson (1892). Captain Davis of the &quot;Royalist&quot;, reported Niutao as exporting about 50 tons of copra each year — in a good season.

Palagi copra traders known to have been resident on Niutao are: Charlie Douglas (1850s); Mr Tom, Mr Jack, Mr Ah Fong and Mr Tong (c. 1861); Mr McKenzie (c. 1866); George Winchcombe (c. 1876-1880); George Westbrook (1880s); Jack O&#x27;Brien (c. 1880s); Jack Buckland (c. 1892); and Fred Whibley (May/June 1898 to c. 1911).

===&quot;The Cruise of the Janet Nichol&quot;===
The &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot; was a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney, Auckland and into the central Pacific. Robert Louis Stevenson was in Sydney, Australia in April 1890, looking for a ship to travel into the central Pacific; he and his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson, and her son Lloyd Osbourne sailed on the &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot;. From 29 May to 2 June 1890 the &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot; anchored off Niutao to take on copra. An account of the voyage was written by Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and published under the title &quot;The Cruise of the Janet Nichol&quot;. A passenger on the ship was Jack Buckland, who later returned to Niutao to be the resident copra trader.
===20th century===
The Niutaons financed the building of a church which was designed and built by Mr Foster Wesley and his assistant Lifuka Falakai from Vaiputo, with skilled Niutaons also working on the church. Building began in April 1915 and was completed in about September 1919. The service of dedication was led by Pastor Panapa of Samoa and the church was named &quot;Tineifale&quot;. Ernest Tanumafili Allen, son of Captain Ernest Frederick Hughes Allen of the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, recalled in his memoir that his firm was involved in the building of the church. Part payment of $4,000 of the costs of the church was being delivered to the ship &quot;Dawn&quot; off Niutao. The money, mostly gold sovereigns, was in a small box, the lid secured by sinnet string; as the box was being passed from the canoe to the ship it was turned upside down and the coins fell into the sea. Immediately a further collection was carried out, which yielded $3,000.
Niutao Post Office opened around 1918. 

In 1919 a new &quot;Fale Kaupule&quot; (community hall) was built, which was named &quot;Fetu Afiafi&quot;. The anointing slab or stone of the Chiefs of Malaefono was moved into the &quot;Fale Kaupule&quot;; this stone was the symbol of authority, dignity, honour and peace. The &quot;paletua&quot; (seat) of the Chief Kaupule or &quot;Fogauli&quot; was made out of &quot;pukavai&quot; (Pisonia grandis) timber by Fred Whibley.

The construction of a primary school began in early 1951 and was opened on 21 July 1953. The school was named “Whibley Memorial School” by the Paramount Chiefs as Fred Whibley (trader resident on Niutao from 1898 to circa 1911) had encouraged education. The first teacher was Pulekai Alofa Sogivalu, with a class of 40 pupils.

In 1959 the &quot;Fale Kaupule&quot; (community hall) was reconstructed under the supervision of Fiatau Penitala Teo and the builder Pese Kaitu, and the building was renamed &quot;Fetu Afiafi 2&quot;.

In 1961 Gerd Koch, a German anthropologist, recorded songs and filmed life on Niutao. Koch returned to Niutao in 1996, where he met islanders who were children when he visited in 1961.

In 1964 the Island Councils of Tuvalu were restructured so as to consist of a President, Vice-President and three councillors elected by the people of each island. In 1979 the central government reformed the Council of Chiefs of each island. From the late 18th century the two Paramount Chiefs of Niutao were leaders of the districts of Teitieva and Malaefono. Following the changes to the role of the Council of Chiefs, the Paramount Chiefs of the districts of Teitieva and Malaefono unanimously agreed that: “There should be one Paramount Chief elected from the two domains. Each domain should then elect two other members. These five members would form the new Council of Chiefs.” The Council of Chiefs works with the &quot;Falekaupule&quot; on the management of communal activities. The Council of Chiefs maintains its right, in accordance with traditions and customs, to exercise power in matters affecting the social life of the community.

In 2016 Mauatu Teponga was elected chief.

==Demographics==
Newton (1967) estimated that the early 19th century population of Niutao was about 450 people, with these estimates derived from reports of European visitors to Niutao:
In 1949, people from overpopulated Niutao settled on Niulakita.

Official sources of the 2002 census of population, listed the village of Kulia (pop. 224) and the village of Teava (pop. 439).
The 2012 census, listed the village of Kulia (pop. 200) and the village of Teava (pop. 406).

Central Statistics Department (CSD) of Tuvalu recorded census results:
The Census Monograph on Migration, Urbanization and Youth provides an analysis of the 2012 census and reported: Niutao and other northern islands had relatively high net migration losses, with most being internal migrants to Funafuti.

==Politics==
Feleti Teo and Sa&#x27;aga Talu Teafa were elected in the 2024 general election.



==Notable people==
* Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo (1911–1986), Appointed Chief in the House of Chiefs of Niutao in 1945; appointed as the first Governor General of Tuvalu on independence from Great Britain on 1 October 1978; reappointed as a Chief on 29 June 1997.

<text>The Pauravas were an ancient tribe in the northern Indus valley, to which Raja Porus may have belonged.

==Origins==
The origins of the Pauravas are still disputed. The Pauravas may be related to the Puru tribe, due to the closeness of the names. However, the Pauravas referred to in Indic literature are a much older kingdom, and in a different region geographically. 

== Puru and Alexander story ==
At the time of Alexander&#x27;s invasion, the Pauravas were apparently situated on or near the Jhelum River, with territory extending to the Chenab River. This was not only the extent of Puru&#x27;s kingdom, but also became the eastern limit of the Macedonian Empire.

The Indus River was incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great in 535 BCE. In 518 BCE, Darius the Great invaded Punjab and conquered the Jhelum River region, designating it the Hindush satrapy. Records suggest that the Indus was under Achaemenid control at least until 338 BCE, which is less than ten years before the campaigns of Alexander. This would make Porus a king or chieftain of the recently independent Pauravas at the time of their confrontation with Alexander. The extent of Achaemenid territories is also affirmed by Strabo in his &quot;Geography&quot; (Book XV), describing the Persian holdings along the Indus:

The geographical position of the tribes is as follows: along the Indus are the Paropamisadae, above whom lies the Paropamisus mountain: then, towards the south, the Arachoti: then next, towards the south, the Gedroseni, with the other tribes that occupy the seaboard; and the Indus lies, latitudinally, alongside all these places; and of these places, in part, some that lie along the Indus are held by Indians, although they formerly belonged to the Persians.

— The Geography of Strabo, Book XV, Chapter 2, 9

Alexander and Porus fought each other at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Alexander was initially set on venturing into India, but the battle against Porus curbed his aspirations. His army mutinied when faced with opposing the Nanda Empire and their subordinate Gangaridai. According to the Greek historian Plutarch, the previous, costly conflict against Porus&#x27;s much smaller army contributed significantly to their unease.

Alexander died on his way back from India. The instability that ensued after Alexander&#x27;s death resulted in a power struggle and dramatic changes in governance. Porus was soon assassinated by the Macedonian general Eudemus. By 316 BCE, the Macedonian lands were conquered by Chandragupta Maurya, a young adventurer. After engaging in and winning the Seleucid–Mauryan war for supremacy over the Indus Valley, Chandragupta gained control of modern-day Punjab and Afghanistan. This was the foundation of the Maurya Empire, which would become the largest empire in the Indian subcontinent.

== Post-Mauryan Empire ==
It appears that the Pauravas were annexed by the militant Yaudheya Republic. Following the disintegration of the Mauryan Empire, many regional entities emerged. The Taleshwar copper plates, found in Almora, stated that Brahmapura Kingdom rulers belonged to the royal lineage of the Pauravas. The reinstated Paurava dynasty of Brahmapur was founded by Vishnuverman and flourished in the 7th century AD. It is stated that these kings were brahminical in habit and practices.

<text>The Aristos: A Self-Portrait in Ideas is a 1964 collection of several hundred philosophical aphorisms by English author John Fowles. A revised edition, without the subtitle, which was shorter but also incorporated new material, was published in hardcover in 1968 and in paperback in 1970. The principal theme in &quot;The Aristos&quot; is that most achievements, most great steps forward, have come from individuals.

In the book&#x27;s Appendix, Fowles included what he called the &quot;main fragments&quot; of Heraclitus&#x27;s doctrine.

<text>Matthew James Baker (born 23 December 1977) is a British television presenter. He co-presented the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 1999 until 2006, BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; since 2009 and &quot;The One Show&quot; from 2011 to 2020, with Alex Jones.

==Early life==
Baker was born on 23 December 1977 at Easington in County Durham where his father ran a newsagent&#x27;s shop, and his parents had a smallholding in the village. He has one sister and two half-sisters.

Matt attended Easington Village School, then, when he was aged 10, his parents bought a farm west of Durham, which they moved into and renovated. From the age of 5, Baker was a keen dancer and began competing as a gymnast whilst at school. He continued his education at Belmont Comprehensive School in Durham and was a budding gymnast, but was forced to give up after being diagnosed with anaemia aged 14. He took A-levels in Drama, Biology and Sports Science at Durham Sixth Form Centre. Baker moved to Edinburgh to train as an actor at Queen Margaret University School of Drama.

In the late 1990s, as a drama student at Queen Margaret University College, Baker worked as an entertainer, and with a 1970s comedy disco-dancing revival show called &quot;Disco Inferno&quot;, which toured the north of England.

==Career==

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot;===

Baker wanted to become a physiotherapist, but did not achieve the necessary academic standards. After an appearance in the school production of &quot;Grease&quot;, it was suggested that he attend drama school. Having just finished the second year of a three-year course at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, his future wife&#x27;s aunt spotted that &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was looking for a new presenter. After calling into the Editor&#x27;s office direct, Baker put together a showreel with footage in the farmyard; reading a story; and riding a unicycle. He was asked to come to London the next day for an interview, and made his first appearance on the show on 25 June 1999. His gymnastic background helped him in physical challenges, including training as a stuntman, and passing the recruitment courses for both the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment. In 2003, Baker learned to fly hang gliders and made a successful tandem world record-breaking flight with Airways Airsports instructor Judy Leden MBE.

During his seven years on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Matt&#x27;s colleagues were Katy Hill, Konnie Huq, Simon Thomas, Liz Barker, Zöe Salmon and Gethin Jones. He won two BAFTAs for Best Children&#x27;s Presenter two years in a row and a Royal Television Society award. Baker left &quot;Blue Peter&quot; at the end of its 2005–06 series; his last live show was broadcast on 26 June. Baker&#x27;s dog Meg, seen alongside him on the programme from 2000 onwards, left with him.

===&quot;Countryfile&quot;===
Baker co-presented &quot;Countryfile Summer Diaries&quot; on weekday mornings on BBC One, along with &quot;Open Country&quot; for Radio 4 and &quot;Animal Rescue Squad&quot; and &quot;Animal Rescue Squad International&quot; for Channel 5. From 2009, he has co-presented BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; on Sunday evenings. In August 2010, Baker co-presented the first series of &quot;Secret Britain&quot; with Julia Bradbury and presented &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot; with Kate Humble.

===&quot;The One Show&quot;===

From May to August 2010, Baker was a guest presenter on BBC One&#x27;s magazine programme &quot;The One Show&quot;, standing in for Jason Manford. Following Manford&#x27;s resignation on 18 November 2010, Baker acted as a guest co-host on the programme. He later took over as a permanent presenter on the show, co-hosting with Alex Jones from Monday to Thursday.

On 8 March 2011, Baker gained media attention by asking then-Prime Minister David Cameron, &quot;How on earth do you sleep at night?&quot;. Will Heaven, Deputy Editor of Telegraph Blogs, wrote: &quot;Was this the unearthing of a true Northern lefty? Or did Baker just misspeak?&quot;.

On 4 December 2019, Baker announced on &quot;The One Show&quot; that he would be leaving in the spring of 2020. He announced it in an emotional speech to camera where he thanked everyone for their support, especially for the money donated to The Rickshaw Challenges.

Matt&#x27;s last show on &quot;The One Show&quot; was on Tuesday 31 March 2020, where he was not on the couch with co-presenter Alex Jones, but was at home in self isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Other television work===
In 2003, Baker was a guest on &quot;A Song For Europe&quot; contest to decide the UK entry to the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, where he announced the scores for the North of England. He was one of three main presenters on the final series of the BBC One reality series &quot;City Hospital&quot;. In March 2007, and again in 2008, Baker co-presented coverage of &quot;Crufts&quot;. Also in 2007, he co-presented five episodes of &quot;Animal Rescue Live&quot; with Selina Scott. The episodes were shown across a week and were broadcast live from Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home in London.

As part of the celebration for London&#x27;s winning bid to host the 2012 Olympics, Baker co-hosted the London 2012 party with Claudia Winkleman on 24 August 2008, after the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. For the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Baker commentated on the gymnastics events. He provided commentary for the gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, as well as doing some presenting work. Matt Baker was also a Torch Bearer for the Olympic Flame as it was carried into Durham City as part of the flame&#x27;s tour of Great Britain. In 2016, Baker again provided the BBC commentary on the gymnastic events at the Rio Olympics. Matt continued his previous commentating work by providing commentary for the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 gymnastics events.

In October 2009, Baker took part in the reality programme &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; to raise money for Children in Need. He undertook the Kazakhstan to Mongolia leg with Julia Bradbury. For Children in Need, Baker rode a bicycle towing a rickshaw 484 miles from Edinburgh to London in 2011, which took about a week up to the fund raising night on 18 November. He averaged around 60 miles per day, raising well over £1.5 million for the charity. In the summer of 2006, Baker was a celebrity showjumper in the &quot;Sport Relief&quot; event &quot;Only Fools on Horses&quot;.

In 2015, Baker along with Mel Giedroyc co-hosted four-part BBC One series &quot;The Gift&quot;.

<doc id="1014322" wikidata="Q537098" url="?curid=1014322" title="Fiduciary">
<text>A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other assets for another person. One party, for example, a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to another party, who, for example, has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, financial advisers, financial planners, and asset managers, including managers of pension plans, endowments, and other tax-exempt assets, are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws. In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice, or protection is sought in some matter. In such a relation, good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole benefit and interest of the one who trusts.

Fiduciary duties in a financial sense exist to ensure that those who manage other people&#x27;s money act in their beneficiaries&#x27; interests, rather than serving their own interests. 

A fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care in equity or law. A fiduciary is expected to be extremely loyal to the person to whom he owes the duty (the &quot;principal&quot;) such that there must be no conflict of duty between fiduciary and principal, and the fiduciary must not profit from their position as a fiduciary, unless the principal consents. The nature of fiduciary obligations differs among jurisdictions. In Australia, only proscriptive or negative fiduciary obligations are recognised, whereas in Canada, fiduciaries can come under both proscriptive (negative) and prescriptive (positive) fiduciary obligations.

In English common law, the fiduciary relation is an important concept within a part of the legal system known as equity. In the United Kingdom, the Judicature Acts merged the courts of equity (historically based in England&#x27;s Court of Chancery) with the courts of common law, and as a result the concept of fiduciary duty also became applicable in common law courts.

When a fiduciary duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter standard of behavior than the comparable tortious duty of care in common law. The fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, not to be in a situation where their fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from their fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a conflict of interest. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves &quot;at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd&quot; and that &quot;[t]he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty&quot;.

==In different jurisdictions==
Different jurisdictions regard fiduciary duties in different lights. Canadian law, for example, has developed a more expansive view of fiduciary obligation than American law, while Australian law and British law have developed more conservative approaches than either the United States or Canada.
In Australia, it has been found that there is no comprehensive list of criteria by which to establish a fiduciary relationship. Courts have so far refused to define the concept of a fiduciary, instead preferring to develop the law on a case-by-case basis and by way of analogy. Fiduciary relationships are of different types and carry different obligations so that a test appropriate to determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists for one purpose might be inappropriate for another:

In 2014 the Law Commission (England and Wales) reviewed the fiduciary duties of investment intermediaries, looking particularly at the duties on pension trustees. They commented that the term &quot;fiduciary&quot; is used in many different ways. 
The question of who is a fiduciary is a &quot;notoriously intractable&quot; question and this was the first of many questions. In &quot;SEC v. Chenery Corporation&quot;, Frankfurter J said,


The law expressed here follows the general body of elementary fiduciary law found in most common law jurisdictions; for in-depth analysis of particular jurisdictional idiosyncrasies please consult primary authorities within the relevant jurisdiction.

This is especially true in the area of Labor and Employment law. In Canada a fiduciary has obligations to the employer even after the employment relationship is terminated, whereas in the United States the employment and fiduciary relationships terminate together.

==Fiduciary duties under Delaware corporate law==

The corporate law of Delaware is the most influential in the United States, as more than 50% of publicly traded companies in the United States, including 64% of the Fortune 500, have chosen to incorporate in that state. Under Delaware law, officers, directors and other control persons of corporations and other entities owe three primary fiduciary duties, (1) the duty of care, (2) the duty of loyalty and (3) the duty of good faith.

The duty of care requires control persons to act on an informed basis after due consideration of all information. The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers so long as they do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which presumes that control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.

The duty of loyalty requires control persons to look to the interests of the company and its other owners and not to their personal interests. In general, they cannot use their positions of trust, confidence and inside knowledge to further their own private interests or approve an action that will provide them with a personal benefit (such as continued employment) that does not primarily benefit the company or its other owners.

The duty of good faith requires control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions—that is, the care that a reasonably prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting in the best interest of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual&#x27;s particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (e.g., a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).

At one time, courts seemed to view the duty of good faith as an independent obligation. However, more recently, courts have treated the duty of good faith as a component of the duty of loyalty.
==Fiduciary duty in Canadian corporate law==

In Canada, directors of corporations owe a fiduciary duty. A debate exists as to the nature and extent of this duty following a controversial landmark judgment from the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders&quot;. Scholarly literature has defined this as a &quot;tripartite fiduciary duty&quot;, composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties — (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of &quot;fair treatment&quot; for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the &quot;best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen&quot;.

==Relationships==
The most common circumstance where a fiduciary duty will arise is between a trustee, whether real or juristic, and a beneficiary. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal—i.e., common law—owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no legal title to the trust; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress their own interests and administer the property only for the benefit of the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the use of property without being its technical owner.

Others, such as corporate directors, may be held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee. This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward&#x27;s property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of interest charges by setting up a &quot;blind trust&quot;, placing their financial affairs in the hands of a fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.

The fiduciary functions of trusts and agencies are commonly performed by a trust company, such as a commercial bank, organized for that purpose. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury, is the primary regulator of the fiduciary activities of federal savings associations.

When a court desires to hold the offending party to a transaction responsible so as to prevent unjust enrichment, the judge can declare that a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, as though the offender were in fact a trustee for the partner.

Relationships which routinely attract by law a fiduciary duty between certain classes of persons include these:

* Trustee/beneficiary;
* Conservators and legal guardians/wards
* Agents, attorney in fact usually from written grant of authority by principal, brokers and factors/principals;:
* Buyer agent (real estate broker)/buyer client
* Confidential advisor including financial adviser and investment advisor/advisee or client;
* Lawyer/client; A solicitor is presumed to have a fiduciary duty.
* Executors and administrators/legatees and heirs;
* Corporate partners, joint venturers, directors and officers/company and stockholders;
* Board of directors / Legal persons, including companies;
* Partner/partner;
* Senior employee/company;
* Retirement plan administrators (including 401(k) plans)/retirees and workers;
* Retirement account advisors;
* Promoters/company and related subscribers;
* Liquidator/company;
* Mutual savings banks and investment corporations/their depositors and investors;
* Receivers, trustees in bankruptcy and assignees in insolvency/creditors
* Governments / indigenous peoples; &quot;Seminole Nation v. United States&quot;
* Doctor/patient - in Canada, not in Australia;
* Guardian/ward;
* Teacher/student;
* Priest/parishioner seeking counseling;

In Australia, the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed.

Roman and civil law recognized a type of contract called &quot;fiducia&quot; (also &quot;contractus fiduciae&quot; or fiduciary contract),
involving essentially a sale to a person coupled with an agreement that the purchaser should sell the property back upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such contracts were used in the emancipation of children, in connection with testamentary gifts and in pledges. Under Roman law a woman could arrange a fictitious sale called a &quot;fiduciary coemption&quot; in order to change her guardian or gain legal capacity to make a will.

In Roman Dutch law, a &quot;fiduciary heir&quot; may receive property subject to passing it to another on fulfilment of certain conditions; the gift is called a &quot;fideicommissum&quot;. The fiduciary of a fideicommissum is a &quot;fideicommissioner&quot; and one that receives property from a fiduciary heir is a &quot;fideicommissary heir&quot;.

Fiduciary principles may be applied in a variety of legal contexts.

===Possible relationships===
Joint ventures, as opposed to business partnerships, are not &quot;presumed&quot; to carry a fiduciary duty; however, this is a matter of degree. If a joint venture is conducted at commercial arm&#x27;s length and both parties are on an equal footing then the courts will be reluctant to find a fiduciary duty, but if the joint venture is carried out more in the manner of a partnership then fiduciary relationships can and often will arise.

Husbands and wives are not &quot;presumed&quot; to be in a fiduciary relationship in many jurisdictions; however, this may be easily established. Similarly, ordinary commercial transactions in themselves are not &quot;presumed&quot; to but can give rise to fiduciary duties, should the appropriate circumstances arise. These are usually circumstances where the contract specifies a degree of trust and loyalty or it can be inferred by the court.

Australian courts also do not recognise parents and their children to be in fiduciary relationships. In contrast, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed a child to sue her father for damages for breach of his fiduciary duties, opening the door in Canada for allowing fiduciary obligations between parent and child to be recognised.

Australian courts have also not accepted doctor-patient relationships as fiduciary in nature. In &quot;Breen v Williams&quot;, the High Court viewed the doctor&#x27;s responsibilities over their patients as lacking the representative capacity of the trustee in fiduciary relationships. Moreover, the existence of remedies in contract and tort made the Court reluctant in recognising the fiduciary relationship.

In 2011, in an insider trading case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a boyfriend of a Disney intern, alleging he had a fiduciary duty to his girlfriend and breached it. The boyfriend, Toby Scammell, allegedly received and used insider information on Disney&#x27;s takeover of Marvel Comics.

Generally, the employment relationship is not regarded as fiduciary, but may be so if
... within a particular contractual relationship there are specific contractual obligations which the employee has undertaken which have placed him in a situation where equity imposes these rigorous duties in addition to the contractual obligations. Although terminologies like duty of good faith, or loyalty, or the mutual duty of trust and confidence are frequently used to describe employment relationships, such concepts usually denote situations where &quot;a party merely has to take into consideration the interests of another, but does not have to act in the interests of that other.

If fiduciary relationships are to arise between employers and employees, it is necessary to ascertain that the employee has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer. In the case of &quot;Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O&#x27;Malley&quot;, it was held that a senior employee is much more likely to be found to owe fiduciary duties towards his employer.

A protector of a trust may owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, although there is no case law establishing this to be the case.

In 2015, the United States Department of Labor issued a proposed rule that if finalized would extend the fiduciary duty relationship to investment advisors and some brokers including insurance brokers. In 2017, the first Trump administration planned to order a 180-delay of implementation of the rule, sometimes known as the &#x27;fiduciary rule&#x27;. The rule would require &quot;brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients&#x27; interest first&quot;. The Trump administration later rescinded the fiduciary rule on July 20, 2018. Prior to its repeal, the rule was also dealt blows by the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in March and June 2018.

===Examples===
For example, two members, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, of a band currently under contract with one another (or with some other tangible, existing relationship that creates a legal duty) record songs together. Let us imagine it is a serious, successful band and that a court would declare that the two members are equal partners in a business. One day, &quot;X&quot; takes some demos made cooperatively by the duo to a recording label, where an executive expresses interest. &quot;X&quot; pretends it is all his work and receives an exclusive contract and $50,000. &quot;Y&quot; is unaware of the encounter until reading it in the paper the next week.

This situation represents a conflict of interest and duty. Both &quot;X &quot;and &quot;Y&quot; hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo&#x27;s collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, &quot;X&quot; has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that &quot;X&quot; has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that &quot;X&quot; holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, &quot;X&quot; will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; will receive a half share in the contract and the money.

When T. Boone Pickens&#x27;s Mesa Petroleum attempted to take over Cities Service in 1982, Cities Service attempted to take over the smaller Mesa instead. Pickens was friends with Alan Habacht of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer, who supported Mesa&#x27;s attempt. Fiduciary duty, however, required Habacht to seek the maximum possible return on the investment he managed by offering Weiss&#x27;s Mesa shares to Cities&#x27;s tender offer.

==Elements of duty==
A fiduciary, such as the administrator, executor or guardian of an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a surety bond, called a fiduciary bond or probate bond, to guarantee faithful performance of his duties. One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an &quot;inventory&quot; of the tangible or intangible property of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.

A bank or other fiduciary having legal title to a mortgage may sell fractional shares to investors, thereby creating a &quot;participating mortgage&quot;.

== Accountability ==
A fiduciary will be liable to account if proven to have acquired a profit, benefit or gain from the relationship by one of three means:

* In circumstances of conflict of duty and interest;
* In circumstances of conflict of duty to one person and duty to another person;
* By taking advantage of the fiduciary position.

Therefore, it is said the fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent. A fiduciary cannot have a conflict of interest.

The state of Texas in the United States sets out the duties of a fiduciary in its Estates Code, chapter 751, as follows (the bracketed references to TPC refer to the Texas Probate Code superseded by the Estates Code, effective January 1, 2014):

;Sec. 751.101. Fiduciary Duties. [TPC §489B(a)]
:An attorney in fact or agent is a fiduciary and has a duty to inform and to account for actions taken under the power of attorney.
;Sec. 751.102. Duty to Timely Inform Principal. [TPC §489B(b)]
:(a) The attorney in fact or agent shall timely inform the principal of each action taken under the power of attorney.
:(b) Failure of an attorney in fact or agent to timely inform, as to third parties, does not invalidate any action of the attorney in fact or agent.
;Sec. 751.103. Maintenance of Records. [TPC §489B(c), (f)]
:(a) The attorney in fact or agent shall maintain records of each action taken or decision made by the attorney in fact or agent.
:(b) The attorney in fact or agent shall maintain all records until delivered to the principal, released by the principal, or discharged by a court.
;Sec. 751.104. Accounting. [TPC §489B(d), (e)]
:(a) The principal may demand an accounting by the attorney in fact or agent.
:(b) Unless otherwise directed by the principal, an accounting under Subsection (a) must include:
:(c) Unless directed otherwise by the principal, the attorney in fact or agent shall also provide to the principal all documentation regarding the principal’s property.

=== Conflict of duties ===
A fiduciary&#x27;s duty must not conflict with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when a lawyer or an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, and the interests of those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal&#x27;s interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.

=== No-profit rule ===
A fiduciary must not profit from the fiduciary position. This includes any benefits or profits which, although unrelated to the fiduciary position, came about because of an opportunity that the fiduciary position afforded. It is unnecessary that the principal would have been unable to make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal. If the principal provides fully informed consent, then the fiduciary may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of fiduciary duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the fiduciary on constructive trust for the principal.

Secret commissions, or bribes, also come under the no profit rule. The bribe shall be held in constructive trust for the principal. The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has committed a crime. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, in accordance with the equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.

Bribes were initially considered not to be held on constructive trust, but were considered to be held as a debt by the fiduciary to the principal. This approach has been overruled; the bribe is now classified as a constructive trust. The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a bankrupt fiduciary. If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to creditors and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a constructive trust then it will remain in the possession of the fiduciary, despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.

=== Avoiding these accountabilities ===
The landmark Australian decision &quot;ASIC v Citigroup&quot; noted that the &quot;informed consent&quot; on behalf of the beneficiary to breaches of either the no-profit and no-conflict rule will allow the fiduciary to get around these rules. Furthermore, it highlighted that a contract may include a clause that allows individuals to avoid all fiduciary obligations within the course of dealings, and thereby continue to make a personal profit or deal with other parties- tasks that may otherwise have been in conflict with what would have been a fiduciary duty had it not been for this clause. In the Australian case of &quot;Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd&quot;, however, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed that the sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the persons to whom the disclosure must be made.

However, in the English case of &quot;Armitage v Nurse&quot; an exception was noted to be the fiduciary&#x27;s obligation of good faith; liability for breach of fiduciary duty by way of fraud or dishonesty cannot be avoided through an exclusion clause in a contract. The decision in &quot;Armitage v Nurse&quot; has been applied in Australian .

== Breaches of duty and remedies ==
Conduct by a fiduciary may be deemed &quot;constructive fraud&quot; when it is based on acts, omissions or concealments considered fraudulent and that gives one an advantage against the other because such conduct—though not actually fraudulent, dishonest or deceitful—demands redress for reasons of public policy. Breach of fiduciary duty may occur in insider trading, when an insider or a related party makes trades in a corporation&#x27;s securities based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider&#x27;s duties at the corporation. Breach of fiduciary duty by a lawyer with regard to a client, if negligent, may be a form of legal malpractice; if intentional, it may be remedied in equity.
Where a principal can establish both a fiduciary duty and a breach of that duty, through violation of the above rules, the court will find that the benefit gained by the fiduciary should be returned to the principal because it would be unconscionable to allow the fiduciary to retain the benefit by employing his strict common law legal rights. This will be the case, unless the fiduciary can show there was full disclosure of the conflict of interest or profit and that the principal fully accepted and freely consented to the fiduciary&#x27;s course of action.

Remedies will differ according to the type of damage or benefit. They are usually distinguished between proprietary remedies, dealing with property, and personal remedies, dealing with pecuniary (monetary) compensation. Where concurrent contractual and fiduciary relationships exist, remedies available to the plaintiff beneficiary is dependent upon the duty of care owed by the defendant and the specific breach of duty allowing for remedy/damages. The courts will clearly distinguish the relationship and determine the nature in which the breach occurred.

=== Constructive trusts ===
Where the unconscionable gain by the fiduciary is in an easily identifiable form, such as the recording contract discussed above, the usual remedy will be the already discussed constructive trust.

Constructive trusts pop up in many aspects of equity, not just in a remedial sense, but, in this sense, what is meant by a constructive trust is that the court has created and imposed a duty on the fiduciary to hold the money in safekeeping until it can be rightfully transferred to the principal.

=== Account of profits ===
An account of profits is another potential remedy. It is usually used where the breach of duty was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably by virtue of the fiduciary position, so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It may sound like a constructive trust at first, but it is not.

An account of profits is the appropriate remedy when, for example, a senior employee has taken advantage of his fiduciary position by conducting his own company on the side and has run up quite a lot of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.

=== Compensatory damages ===
Compensatory damages are also available. Accounts of profits can be hard remedies to establish, therefore, a plaintiff will often seek compensation (damages) instead. Courts of equity initially had no power to award compensatory damages, which traditionally were a remedy at common law, but legislation and case law has changed the situation so compensatory damages may now be awarded for a purely equitable action.

== Fiduciary duty and pension governance ==
Some experts have argued that, in the context of pension governance, trustees have started to reassert their fiduciary prerogatives more strongly after 2008 – notably following the heavy losses or reduced returns incurred by many retirement schemes in the wake of the Great Recession and the progression of ESG and Responsible Investment ideas: &quot;Clearly, there is a mounting demand for CEOs (equity issuers) and governments (sovereign bond issuers) to be more &#x27;accountable&#x27; ... No longer ‘absentee landlords&#x27;, trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their governance prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups.&quot; However, in the United States, there are questions whether a pension&#x27;s decision to consider factors such as how investments impact contributors&#x27; continued employment violate a fiduciary duty to maximize the retirement fund&#x27;s returns.

Pension funds and other large institutional investors are increasingly making their voices heard to call out irresponsible practices in the businesses in which they invest 

The Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century Programme, led by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, the Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Generation Foundation, aims to end the debate on whether fiduciary duty is a legitimate barrier to the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in investment practice and decision-making. This followed the 2015 publication of &quot;Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century&quot; which concluded that &quot;failing to consider all long-term investment value drivers, including ESG issues, is a failure of fiduciary duty&quot;. Founded on the realization that there is a general lack of legal clarity globally about the relationship between sustainability and investors’ fiduciary duty, the programme engaged with and interviewed over 400 policymakers and investors to raise awareness of the importance of ESG issues to the fiduciary duties of investors. The programme also published roadmaps which set out recommendations to fully embed the consideration of ESG factors in the fiduciary duties of investors across more than eight capital markets. Drawing upon findings from Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century, the European Commission High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) recommended in its 2018 final report that the EU Commission clarify investor duties to better embrace long-term horizon and sustainability preferences.

<text>The Flood is a fictional parasitic alien lifeform and one of the primary antagonists in the &quot;Halo&quot; multimedia franchise. First introduced in the 2001 video game &quot;&quot;, it returns in later entries in the series such as &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Halo 3&quot;, and &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. The Flood is driven by a desire to infect any sentient life of sufficient size; Flood-infected creatures, also called Flood, in turn can infect other hosts. The parasite is depicted as such a threat that the ancient Forerunners constructed artificial ringworld superweapons known as Halos to contain it and, as a last resort, to kill all sentient life in the galaxy in an effort to stop the Flood&#x27;s spread by starving it.

The Flood&#x27;s design and fiction were led by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who started from unused concepts from earlier Bungie games and was inspired by personal experiences. The setting of the first game, the ringworld Halo, was stripped of many of its large creatures in order to make the Flood&#x27;s surprise appearance midway through the game more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood&#x27;s fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-infested spaceships for &quot;Halo 3&quot;.

The player&#x27;s discovery of the Flood in &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; is a major plot twist, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively. The Flood&#x27;s return in &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 3&quot; was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood itself has been positive, being consistently placed amongst the greatest video game villains by video game magazines.

==Development==

The Flood is depicted as a parasitic organism that infects any sentient life of sufficient size. Small, bulbous infection forms seek out suitable hosts, living or dead, burrowing into the target and bringing it under Flood control. Depending on the size or condition of the body, the infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food. Larger hosts are turned into forms for combat, growing long whip-like tentacles, while mangled and disused hosts are turned into incubators for more infection forms. The Flood also creates forms known as &quot;key minds&quot; to coordinate the Flood; these include the apex of Flood evolution, known as &quot;Graveminds&quot;.

The Flood was added early in Bungie&#x27;s development of the 2001 video game &quot;&quot;. A design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997. Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that &quot;the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi. Yeah, and bad sci-fi too.&quot; One inspiration was Christopher Rowley&#x27;s &quot;The Vang&quot; series. Early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself &quot;the architect&quot; of the Flood; the Flood&#x27;s roots are reflected in concept art of a &quot;fungal zombie&quot; that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot;. McLees also did all the early concept art for the Flood.

Based on the behavior of viruses and certain bacteria, the Flood was intended to be &quot;disgusting and nasty&quot;; McLees modeled one Flood form off the memory of his cousin&#x27;s infected thumb, while the silhouette of the skittering infection forms came from a more innocuous source—an airborne palm tree from one of the Little Golden Books McLees had read as a child. The larger creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants, so the artists had to make sure the Flood soldiers were recognizable while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected. Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints—initially, the Flood was intended to convert any species of the alien Covenant into soldiers. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have the resources to make it happen,&quot; McLees recalled, so they modified the game&#x27;s fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to serve as combat troops. The technical inability to create different Flood forms procedurally informed the game&#x27;s fiction that the Flood had optimized their host forms over years of trial and error, creating standardized templates that the developers used to obfuscate the repeated use of similar models. Likewise, the Flood enemy intelligence was intended to be as complicated as that of the other enemy faction in the game, but full implementation was cut for time. The dinosaur-like terrestrial wildlife that originally dwelled in Halo&#x27;s environments were dropped due to gameplay constraints and fear that their presence would reduce the surprise and impact of the Flood.

Bungie decided a new visual language for the Flood was needed for &quot;Halo 3&quot;. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, then Bungie&#x27;s Senior Environment Artist. Early concepts of what became new morphing Flood types in the game called &quot;pure forms&quot; featured the creatures wielding an array of weapons via tendrils, while forms like the Flood infector and Flood transport concepts never made it into the final game. The pure forms had to morph between three radically different looks, and it proved challenging to make plausible transformations that also looked good once it was developed and animated in 3D. Artist Shi Kai Wang suggested that in the end, they had simply tried to do too much and the results were less than they wanted.

Flood-infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance Flood biomass, as well as provide surfaces for the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence to exploit and move on. New additions were designed to be multi-purpose; exploding &quot;growth pods&quot; that spew Flood forms were added to the game to adjust pacing, provide instant action, and add to the visuals. Endoscopic pictures provided further inspiration. &quot;Halo 3&quot; added new capabilities to the Flood, including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time. Bungie used &quot;Halo 3&quot;″s improved capacity for graphics to make a host&#x27;s sudden transformation into Flood form more dramatic; two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real-time.
==Appearances==
===Games===
The Flood makes its first appearance more than halfway through &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, during the story mission &quot;343 Guilty Spark&quot;. A group of humans fleeing the enemy alien Covenant land on &quot;Halo&quot;, a ringworld built by the alien Forerunners. The artificial intelligence Cortana sends the supersoldier Master Chief to find their captain, Jacob Keyes, who disappeared in a swamp while searching for a weapons cache. The Master Chief discovers that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood. Keyes&#x27; squad is turned into soldiers for the parasite, while Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth and ultimately assimilated. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo&#x27;s caretaker artificial intelligence 343 Guilty Spark to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo&#x27;s defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak. When Master Chief learns that activating Halo would instead wipe the galaxy of sentient life to prevent the Flood&#x27;s spread, he and Cortana detonate the human ship &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot;″s engines, destroying the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.

The Flood returns in &quot;Halo 2&quot; (2004), appearing on another Halo ring called &quot;Delta Halo&quot;. The Flood on Delta Halo is led by the Gravemind, a massive Flood intelligence that dwells in the bowels of the ring. Gravemind brings together the Master Chief and the Covenant holy warrior known as the Arbiter and tasks them with stopping the Covenant leadership from activating the ring. In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship &quot;In Amber Clad&quot; and crashes it into the Covenant space station of &quot;High Charity&quot;. Once there, the Flood sweeps through the city, and the Gravemind captures Cortana. As the Flood spreads, the Covenant form a blockade in an effort to prevent the parasite from leaving its prison.

The Flood reappears in &quot;Halo 3&quot; (2007), on board a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo. While the infestation of Earth is prevented and Truth activating all the Halo rings, the Gravemind manipulates the Master Chief and Arbiter allied with the Flood to stop the activation of all the rings at the Forerunner installation known as the Ark. Although Arbiter kills Truth, the Gravemind betrays them. The Master Chief fights his way to the center of &quot;High Charity&quot;, freeing Cortana and destroying the city, but Gravemind attempts to rebuild itself on a Halo under construction at the Ark. Realizing that activating the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation due to the Ark&#x27;s location outside of the Milky Way, the Master Chief, Arbiter, and Cortana proceed to Halo&#x27;s control room, activate the ring and escape.

The Flood also makes an appearance in the video game spinoffs &quot;Halo Wars&quot; and &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot;. In &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, they are encountered infesting a Forerunner installation and ultimately annihilated by the actions of the human ship &quot;Spirit of Fire&quot;″s crew. In the &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot; expansion &quot;Awakening the Nightmare&quot;, the surviving Flood are accidentally released by the Banished while salvaging the remaining wreckage of &quot;High Charity&quot;. The expansion features new Flood types alongside those seen in previous games. The parasite also serves as an enemy in the cooperative &quot;Firefight&quot; mode of &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot; and &quot;The Master Chief Collection&quot;. The Flood also appear in cooperative play in &quot;&quot;.

With &quot;Halo 3&quot;, the developers added a multiplayer gametype called &quot;Infection&quot;, a last man standing mode based on a fan-created scenario where human players defend against enemy players, with each slain human adding to the infected&#x27;s ranks. The game mode returned in &quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;Halo 4&quot; (2012), where it was renamed &quot;Flood&quot;,&quot;The Master Chief Collection&quot; (2014), &quot;Halo 5&quot; (2015), and &quot;Halo Infinite&quot; (2021).

===Other appearances===
The 2006 anthology &quot;The Halo Graphic Novel&quot; expands upon the Flood&#x27;s release during the events of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; in two stories, &quot;Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor&quot; and &quot;Breaking Quarantine&quot;. Whereas the Flood is only hinted at being intelligent in the game, the &quot;Halo Graphic Novel&quot; shows the Flood has a hive mind, assimilating the knowledge of their hosts rapidly. Lee Hammock, writer of &quot;The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor&quot;, described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player encounters and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and &quot;hopefully euthanize the idea that they are just space zombies&quot;. The threat of the Flood is also highlighted in a short story from the &quot;Halo Evolutions&quot; anthology, &quot;The Mona Lisa,&quot; which was later adapted into a motion comic.

The Flood also features heavily in Greg Bear&#x27;s trilogy of novels, the &quot;Forerunner Saga&quot;, which takes place thousands of years before the events of the main games. The novel &quot;Halo: Silentium&quot; reveals that the Flood is what remains of the Precursors, an ancient race that was said to accelerate the evolution of a species and shape galaxies. The Forerunners overthrew the Precursors; on the verge of extinction, some Precursors reduced themselves to a biological powder that would regenerate into their past selves. Time rendered the powder defective, and it became mutagenic, reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into the Flood. The Flood would threaten ancient humanity and then the Forerunners, who ultimately build and activate the Halo Array to stop the parasite&#x27;s spread.

The Flood appear in the finale of the &quot;Halo&quot; live-action series&#x27; second season; a &quot;Polygon&quot; review noted that the show&#x27;s presentation is more akin to traditional zombies than that of the games.

==Analysis==

The name of the Flood is one of many names taken from religious stories in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise. The Flood and especially the Gravemind serve as demonic or satanic figures, and the Master Chief&#x27;s descent into the bowels of Halo to encounter the Flood can be likened to a journey to hell. Academic P.C. Paulissen notes that the name &#x27;Flood&#x27; suggests a reference to the biblical deluge, with the Forerunner Ark being shelter from the Flood&#x27;s destructive and cleansing power akin to the Bible.

The lifecycle and parasitic nature of the Flood has similarities to the behaviors of real-world parasites. The Flood&#x27;s induced physiological changes recall the modified eyestalks of hosts infected by &quot;Leucochloridium paradoxum&quot;, or malformed limbs of &quot;Ribeiroia&quot;-infected amphibians. The Flood&#x27;s habit of altering its surroundings has parallels to the parasitoid wasp &quot;Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga&quot;″s use of spider&#x27;s webs for protection.

==Cultural impact==
The surprise appearance of the Flood during &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; was seen as an important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playthroughs of the game. &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of &quot;Halo&quot;, but an example of how games are made more interesting by twists in the plot. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; credited the appearance of the Flood as an excellent way the game kept players on their toes, forcing them to adjust their strategies; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the twist as shocking &quot;as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; described Flood as one of their favorite video game monsters of all time, stating that &quot;We like the Flood, but we hate them so very much.&quot;

Despite the positive acclaim in &quot;Halo&quot;, the response to the presence of the Flood in &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 3&quot; was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in &quot;Halo 2&quot; for no obvious reasons, and was simply described as &quot;aggravating&quot; to play against. Daniel Weissenberger of Gamecritics.com noted in his review of &quot;Halo 3&quot; that even though the Flood looked better than ever, its single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time. GamesRadar&#x27;s Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the worst part of &quot;Halo&quot;, contrasting what he considered fun, vibrant and open levels before the Flood&#x27;s appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies.

The Flood has been recognized as one of the greatest game villains, making lists of greatest villains and enemies from &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot;, &quot;GameDaily&quot;, &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, &quot;PC World&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. MTV considered Flood possession in &quot;Halo 3&quot; as a &quot;great gaming moment&quot; of 2007, stating that &quot;with the power of the Xbox 360&#x27;s graphics, this reanimation comes to vivid, distressing life, more memorably than it had in the earlier games. Here are the zombies of gaming doing what they do worst. [...] It&#x27;s grisly and unforgettable.&quot; IGN listed the Flood as the 45th best video game villain, describing it as one of the most hated video game villains.

The Flood feature in &quot;Halo&quot; merchandise, including action figures produced by Joyride Studios for &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;; one review of the figures expressed the sentiment that Joyride&#x27;s models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood. Other Flood action figures and toys have been released by McFarlane Toys, Mega Bloks, and Jazwares. Other merchandise includes an Xbox 360 Avatar prop, and a limited edition silver-plated statue of Master Chief fighting a Flood form.

<doc id="1014346" wikidata="Q154573" url="?curid=1014346" title="Eastern Front (World War I)">
<text>The Eastern Front or Eastern Theater, of World War I, was a theater of operations that encompassed at its greatest extent the entire frontier between Russia and Romania on one side and Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and Germany on the other. It ranged from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, involved most of Eastern Europe, and stretched deep into Central Europe. The term contrasts with the Western Front, which was being fought in Belgium and France. Unlike the static warfare on the Western Front, the fighting on the geographically larger Eastern Front was more dynamic, often involving the flanking and encirclement of entire formations, and resulted in over 100,000 square miles of territory becoming occupied by a foreign power.

At the start of the war Russia launched offensives against both Germany and Austria-Hungary that were meant to achieve a rapid victory. The invasion of East Prussia was completely defeated while the advance into Austria-Hungary stalled in the Carpathians, and following successful offensives by the Central Powers in 1915 its gains were reversed. Germany and Austria-Hungary defeated Russian forces in Galicia and Poland, causing Russia to abandon the Polish salient, parts of Belarus and the Baltic region, and Galicia. However, the campaigns of 1914–15 also failed to achieve Germany&#x27;s objective of taking Russia out of the war, and by 1916 Germany prioritized its resources for winning in the West.

Russia went on the offensive to take pressure off of France at the Battle of Verdun: its attack near Lake Naroch in early 1916 was quickly defeated by Germany, but the Brusilov offensive that summer became the largest Entente victory in the war. Russia inflicted over one million casualties on Austria-Hungary and forced Germany to redeploy divisions from the Western Front, at the cost of its own heavy losses. In August 1916 Romania entered the war but was quickly overrun by Germany, though Russia helped prevent a total Romanian collapse. The events of the February Revolution in 1917, caused by food shortages in Russian cities, began a decline in discipline among the troops.

After the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II, the Russian Provisional Government chose to continue the war to fulfill its obligations to the Entente. In July 1917 Russia&#x27;s last offensive of the war ended in failure, and in September Germany captured Riga, bringing the German Army closer to the Russian capital. This was followed by a military coup attempt that weakened the Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks overthrew the Russian Republic in the October Revolution of 1917. Despite the political instability, the majority of the Russian Army was still intact and stayed at the front line until early 1918, though the Bolsheviks began taking steps to dissolve it in December 1917 while maintaining some forces against the Central Powers as their negotiations were ongoing.

The new Soviet government established by the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in March 1918 after Operation Faustschlag, taking Russia out of the war; leading to a Central Powers victory. However, the Western Entente soon defeated the Central Powers, with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk being annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Romania and the Central Powers signed a separate peace treaty on 7 May 1918, but it was canceled by Romania on 10 November 1918.

== Background ==

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand eventually led to Austria-Hungary&#x27;s ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July 1914 with German backing, and after the Serbian response to it was rejected, Austria-Hungary declared war against Serbia on 28 July. Russia had made a decision to support Serbia and defend its interests in the Balkans before that, and on 29 July Russian emperor Nicholas II ordered a partial mobilization of the Russian Army in the military districts that bordered Austria. The following day he was convinced by his advisors to order a full mobilization to follow the military&#x27;s existing mobilization schedule. Nicholas hoped Germany would see this as a regional conflict between Russia and Austria, but because their war plans depended on taking advantage of Russia&#x27;s slower mobilization speed, and due to the position of both countries, they felt pressure to go to war immediately. Austria-Hungary began full mobilization on 31 July, and Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914.

=== Russia ===

Russia&#x27;s plan at the outbreak of war was known as Schedule 19. Approved by Emperor Nicholas II in July 1910 and amended over the next two years, the plan concentrated Russia&#x27;s armies on its western border with Germany and Austria-Hungary and was initially defensive. The original Schedule 19 would have had the Russian Army mobilize its troops to locations that were a significant distance away from its western border and leave the entire Polish salient to be defended by local fortresses and the Warsaw garrison. Under this version Russia would not have taken any offensive action and would have waited to react to movements by Germany and Austria-Hungary. The defensive nature of Russian planning went back to the military reforms in the 1860s following the Crimean War and was also influenced by the limited capability of Russia&#x27;s railway network to facilitate the quick mobilization of troops, though that was gradually improving.

Russian strategy remained this way until developments that took place starting in 1911. That was the year that the French Army chief of staff visited Russia and asked the Russian high command to plan for an immediate offensive if war with Germany broke out to help prevent them from capturing Paris. This was also in accordance with Russia&#x27;s 1892 promise to attack Germany if France was invaded in order to open a second front. In 1912 the Russian chief of staff, Yakov Zhilinsky, told the French that Russia would go on the offensive against Germany fifteen days after the start of its mobilization. By this point, the improvements in Russia&#x27;s infrastructure made this a lot more feasible, and there was also domestic pressure for Russia to not abandon its borderlands to foreign occupation. In 1911 new proposals for modifying Schedule 19 were made by army officers, with the most notable among them being Quartermaster-General Yuri Danilov&#x27;s argument for going on the offensive against both Germany and Austria-Hungary.

In early 1912, the Russian high command decided on a variant of the plan known as Schedule 19A, in which two Russian armies would invade East Prussia while four armies would invade Galicia. This did not give Russia the decisive advantage in either location, but it tried to balance the need for Russia to support France by attacking Germany while also acknowledging that the main interest of Russian foreign policy was in the Balkans. The plan also meant that Russia would begin its offensive before its army was fully mobilized, but it was believed that this was a necessary risk, because there would be a limited amount of time to attack Germany in support of France. The adoption of Schedule 19A in 1912 marked the first time in decades that Russian war planning was primarily offensive.

=== Germany ===

Prior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based on the Schlieffen Plan. With the Franco-Russian Agreement in place from the early 1890s, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be a two-front war in both the west and the east. Therefore, the German General Staff, led by Alfred von Schlieffen from 1891 to 1906, developed a plan that called for German armies to pass through Belgium and then turn south to quickly capture Paris, while a smaller German force would pin down the French defenders along the Franco-German border. With France being defeated before Russia could fully mobilize, Germany could then turn its focus on Russia, which Schlieffen believed would not be taken out of the war as quickly because of its much larger territory. The Schlieffen Plan was actually a change from his predecessor in the 1880s, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, who believed that Germany should first be on the defensive in the west and should coordinate with Austria to defeat Russia.

Schlieffen&#x27;s successor at the General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, maintained the basic plan that Schlieffen put forward in 1905 of quickly knocking out France in the west before turning to focus on Russia, thereby avoiding a two-front war. This strategy was fully adopted by the German government in 1913. But the plan did not take into account that the growing military capabilities of Russia in the years since the Russo-Japanese War meant that the Russian mobilization would proceed faster than Schlieffen had originally thought. Another problem with the German strategy was the deliberate choice to not coordinate it with their allies in Austria-Hungary. Moltke the Younger wanted Austria to assist Germany by going on the offensive against Russia in the early stages of the war, and never told his Austrian counterpart, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, that Germany was not going have its own offensive in the east. Conrad, for his part, was also misleading the Germans by allowing them to think Austria would prioritize an attack against Russia, when he actually planned to focus the Austro-Hungarian offensive power against Serbia.

Conversely, the Imperial German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible.

=== Austria-Hungary ===
Austria-Hungary&#x27;s participation in the outbreak of World War I has been neglected by historians, as emphasis has traditionally been placed on Germany&#x27;s role as the prime instigator. However, the &quot;spark&quot; that ignited the First World War is attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, which took place on 28 June 1914. Approximately a month later, on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict.

The causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War. The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The movement towards South Slav unity was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe&#x27;s third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples.

Specifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it. With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by Conrad von Hötzendorf&#x27;s letter to Franz Ferdinand:

The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy – that is at the expense of Serbia&#x27;s independence – or under Serbia&#x27;s leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power.

The annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a &quot;rallying cry&quot; for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing. The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war.

The Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs&#x27; nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia&#x27;s war against Austria-Hungary as a &quot;war of liberation&quot; that would &quot;free South Slavs from tyranny.&quot; In his own words: &quot;If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.&quot;

=== Romania ===

In the immediate years preceding the First World War, the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the Second Balkan War on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on 10 August 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania&#x27;s territory. Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary (Transylvania and Bukovina) and in Russia (Bessarabia). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King Carol I, as a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol&#x27;s attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to Constanța on 14 June 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, King Ferdinand I of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary: Transylvania, Crișana and Maramureș, the whole Banat and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came.

== 1914 ==
In the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the Bosnian crisis stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities.

The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1,400,000 men. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them. Russian troops were satisfactorily supplied at the beginning of the war, there was more light artillery than France, and no less than Germany.

=== The empires clash ===

The first events were the capture of Kalish and Chenhostov by the Germans without fighting, and the first real clash was clashes at Wierzbołów.&lt;br&gt;The first full-scale operation was invasion of East Prussia on 17 August 1914 and the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. The Russian offensive in the Battle of Stallupönen, which was the opening battle of the Eastern Front, quickly turned to a disastrous defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914; even though the Russians were successfully defending at Gumbinnen a while before Tannenberg. After the Russian disaster, German troops under the command of Hindenburg inflicted another crushing defeat on the numerically superior Russian army in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. A second Russian incursion into Galicia was more successful, with the Russians controlling almost all of that region by the end of 1914, routing four Austrian armies in the process. Under the command of Nikolai Ivanov, Nikolai Ruzsky and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemyśl, the next fortress on the road towards Kraków.

This early Russian success in 1914 on the Austro-Russian border was a reason for concern to the Central Powers and caused considerable German forces to be transferred to the East to take pressure off the Austrians, leading to the creation of the new German Ninth Army. The Austro-Hungarian government accepted the Polish proposal of establishing the Supreme National Committee as the Polish central authority within the Empire, responsible for the formation of the Polish Legions, an auxiliary military formation within the Austro-Hungarian army. At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of Russian Poland, west of the river Vistula. The October Battle of the Vistula River, Augustow operation, and the November Battle of Łódź they brought the Germans only huge losses, and the strengthening of the Russians in the region. Germans&#x27; initial plans to destroy the Russians in Poland ended in desperate attempts to prevent their invasion of Silesia

At the same time, Austria-Hungary was trying to regain the territories lost in the summer, they attacked the Russians on the San River, and after a long period of fighting they were forced to retreat. The Russians went on the offensive, came close to Krakow and occupied Chernivtsi, but a counterattack by the Central Powers saved the situation.

The year ended with a bloody battle on the rivers Bzura, Ravka, Nida and Pilica, where the Central Powers planned to take Warsaw, but could not and were forced to withdraw from the battle.

== 1915 ==
===Central Powers victories, retreat of the Imperial Russian Army===
In 1915 the Chief of German Great General Staff, General of Infantry Erich von Falkenhayn decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. The year began with a successful German offensive in the area of the Masurian lakes. At the same time, a large battle for the city of Przasnysz took place on the Polish front. The city changed hands several times but eventually remained in Russian hands. As a result of the battle, the Germans lost from 38,000 to 60,000 soldiers and Russian losses amounted to about 40,000 men. In March, the Germans tried to take Poland again, the third Battle of Warsaw began, and like the previous two, ended with the defeat of Germany. In May 1915, to eliminate the Russian threat the Central Powers began the successful Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in Galicia.

After the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the German and Austro-Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a corresponding strategic retreat by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army, despite a significant numerical superiority over the German enemy, was not so many errors in the tactical sphere, as the deficiency in technical equipment, particularly in artillery and ammunition as well as the corruption and incompetence of the Russian officers. Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase the production of war material and improve the supply situation.

By mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from Russian Poland, The whole campaign cost the Russians about 400,000 men, however, the Germans and Austrians suffered setbacks, their attempt to break through to Lublin was repulsed with losses of 37,500 people, the Russians lost 9,524 people, and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany, although there was still slight Russian penetration into Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 the German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line Riga–Jakobstadt–Dünaburg–Baranovichi–Pinsk–Dubno–Tarnopol. The general outline of this front line did not change until the Russian collapse in 1917.

During the campaign of 1915, the Russian Empire lost the entire line of western fortresses, and more than 4,000 guns. The causes of heavy defeats and losses of personnel, weapons, and as a result - vast territories (the entire Kingdom of Poland, part of the Baltic states, Grodno, partly Volhynia and Podolia provinces - up to 300,000 square kilometers) were to a large extent systemic shortcomings in the management of the armed forces and the defense industry. The multi-stage placement of military orders, their slow passage in the depths of the War Ministry, the disunity of the front and rear played a negative role. Thus, until the autumn of 1915, the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief only coordinated the actions of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, distributed reinforcements, requesting them from the War Ministry. The Minister of War was responsible for organizing the production of weapons and ammunition, the implementation of the replenishment of troop personnel, military transportation outside the provinces declared a theater of military operations. The military districts in the theater of operations were subordinate to the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, but not to the Headquarters. Military production also lagged behind: until the end of autumn, the active army suffered from a shortage of rifles and ammunition, the consumption of which turned out to be incommensurable with the volume of production.

Contemporaries also noted the isolation of the Russian commanding staff from the soldiers, the lack of practical warfare skills among the top-level commanders. &quot;We did have courage to send people to mass slaughter, hiding behind the difficulty of tactical responsibility, to slaughter often without purpose. We sent them, being ourselves far away, not seeing either our own or the enemy, and therefore not conforming to reality. Instead of punishment, we reward such leaders, because as far as the leaders were far away, the same, but still more, the higher leaders kept even more distant. People ceased to be people, but turned into pawns. We went to the fight in a state of some kind of oblivion and stunnedness&quot;, wrote the representative of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Infantry General Fyodor Palitzin, in his diary.

Failures in the Russian system of command and control of troops and the organization of hostilities occurred at other levels. Thus, serious shortcomings in reconnaissance led to the absence of any analysis of the enemy&#x27;s plans and actions. With a general superiority in forces, almost every Central Powers&#x27;s operation in 1915 was &quot;unexpected&quot; for the command from the front to the regimental level. Passion for undercover intelligence in the highest Russian headquarters did not justify itself, and tactical intelligence was still based on barely reliable testimony of prisoners, in the absence of which the command up to the army, inclusive, was simply &quot;blind&quot;. The separation of artillery from infantry with subordination to the inspectors of the corps and ammunition supply units (park brigades and divisions) created difficulties in the operational replenishment of ammunition and shells in the combat units. At the same time, huge stockpiles of ammunition were created in the fortresses, which were then delivered to the enemy during the retreat or destroyed due to the impossibility of evacuation. Special units were not created for the construction of fortifications in the rear of the troops. Most often, such work was hastily carried out by militia squads and the mobilized local population, sometimes including women, and then brought to the necessary defensive state by the combat units retreating on them, already exhausted by battles and night marches.

Russian strategic expanses allowed the army to take a break from failures and start active resistance, the Germans could no longer use the lack of artillery supplies from the Russians and the first setbacks began, the breakthrough to Minsk and the offensive on Dvinsk completely failed with heavy losses for the Germans, the offensive in central Belarus also turned out to be unsuccessful, the Russians began to behave more actively on the southern front, where Austria-Hungary suffered a heavy defeat near Lutsk, the situation was saved by German reserves. The Russians also began to go on the offensive to ease the pressure on Serbia, although unsuccessfully, but there was a turning point in the war in favor of Russia, failing to finish the campaign in 1915, the Germans were deprived of the opportunity to win the war.

=== Russo-Turkish offensive, winter 1915–1916 ===
After the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russo-Turkish front quickly turned in favor of Russian forces. The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and also fighting the massive Allied armada that landed in Galipoli. Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front.

When the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff General Nikolai Yudenich believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria&#x27;s entry into the war as Germany&#x27;s ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks. A &quot;window of opportunity&quot; appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain&#x27;s efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. The resulting offensive began on 10 January 1916.

This offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the absences of Third Army&#x27;s commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse. Coupled with an imbalance of forces – the Russians had 325,000 troops while the Turks only 78,000 – the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers. After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Trabzon on 18 April 1916.

== 1916 ==
Allied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the Battle of Verdun. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the Lake Naroch Offensive in March–April 1916, the Germans repulsed the attacks, but the offensive achieved its main goal - the Germans stopped the attack on Verdun, giving the French a break.

=== Brusilov offensive ===
The Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinary result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere away from Austrian trenches.

Brusilov&#x27;s plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by Erwin Rommel were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance. The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing beyond the starting position. Over a million Austrians were lost, with over 500,000 men killed or taken prisoner by mid-June.

Although the Brusilov offensive was initially successful, it slowed down considerably. An inadequate number of troops and poorly maintained supply lines hindered Brusilov&#x27;s ability to follow up on the initial victories in June. The Brusilov offensive is considered to be the greatest Russian victory of the First World War. Although it cost the Russians half a million casualties during the first two months alone, the offensive successfully diverted substantial forces of the Central Powers from the Western front, and persuaded Romania to join the war, diverting even more Central Powers forces to the East.

=== Development of Russian industry ===
A series of failures in 1915 gave the Russians time to reconfigure industry for wartime, and they did it successfully, Russian industry began to overtake Austrian in terms of growth rates and eventually increased the productivity of ammunition several times. Here is what information was announced at the Duma meeting:
=== Romania enters the war ===

Up until 1916, the Romanians followed the course of the war with interest, while attempting to situate themselves in the most advantageous position. French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but their attempted persuasion gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive. Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania. Transylvanian demographics strongly favoured the Romanians. Romania succumbed to Allied enticement on 18 August 1916. Nine days later, on 27 August, Romanian troops marched into Transylvania.

Romania&#x27;s entry into the war provoked major strategic challenges for the Germans. In September 1916, German troops were mobilized to the Eastern Front. Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg. Von Hindenburg&#x27;s deputy, the more adept Erich Ludendorff, was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania. On 3 September, the first troops of the Central Powers marched into Romanian territory. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian Air Force commenced an incessant bombing of Bucharest. In an attempt to relieve some pressure, French and British forces launched a new offensive known as the Battle of the Somme, while the Brusilov offensive continued in the East.

The entrance of Romania into the war was disconcerting for von Hindenburg. On 15 September, Paul von Hindenburg issued the following order, stating that: &quot;The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.&quot; Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment.

The initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly thrown into reverse by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions instead of concentrating their forces. By the middle of November, German forces had passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties facing stiff Romanian resistance. By 5 December, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, Bucharest. At the same time as the Austro-Hungarian troops moved east, and as the Bulgarians marched north, the Turks had sent in two army divisions by sea to the Dobruja from the east. Romania now faced annihilation from three sides. The remaining Romanian forces were pushed back beyond the Siret in northern Moldavia. Romania received little direct help from the Allies despite previous assurances, with the French only dispatching a military mission of a thousand officers, health and support staff.

=== Proclamation to win over the Poles ===
The Act of 5 November 1916 was proclaimed then to the Poles jointly by the Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers. The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 ending the World War I, in spite of the previous initial total dependence of the kingdom on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions as the cornerstone proto state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter composed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be ceded to Poland.

=== Aftermath of 1916 ===
By January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital. Importantly, the Ploiești oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers.

== 1917 ==
=== The Russian Army in 1917 ===
Most modern people believe that the Russian army was destined to lose the war after 1916. However, Russian General Aleksei Brusilov held a different opinion and wrote in his memoirs: &quot;People mistakenly believe that after the retreat of 1915, the Russian army could not fight, by the end of 1916 it was well trained and accomplished an incredible feat... She defeated the superior forces of the enemy, and in such numbers that no other army in the world could have won.&quot; Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the war turned out to be a nightmare for the Western Allies. Even the entry of the United States into the war did not immediately help the Allies recover from the loss of strength and assistance that the Russian army had brought to the Allied war effort.

Winston Churchill also confirms the strength of the Russian army: &quot;History was not so merciless to any country as to Russia. Her ship was pulled when the harbor was already visible, the ship was wrecked when the storm passed. All the victims had already been transferred, the work was already over. Despair and change overcame the authorities when the task was already completed.” These words are also supported by Russian monogrophist Sergei Oldenburg, who wrote one of the largest works about the time of Tsar Nicholas II. Oldenburg believes that the Russian troops were in excellent condition by the beginning of 1917, he claims the army was well supplied and well fed, and there were 50 percent more Russians than Austro-Germans in terms of the number of armed men at the front, and the Russians had 10 percent more artillery in terms of the number of guns. The supply of new guns was also significant, allegedly almost as much as the total of Britain and France combined. In the army of the Central Powers, due to the war, there were declines in industrial opportunities, except for Austria, but the growth rate of Russian industry was still higher.

Even the armies of the Central Powers assessed the condition of the Russians and their combat strength, more than 72 percent of all infantry divisions were characterized by the information committee of the Austrian General Staff as: &quot;outstanding units&quot; and &quot;first-class troops&quot;. However, all these material successes came to naught after the February Revolution, which killed the moral composition of the army, causing an incredible wave of deserters. Also worth noting is the Russian Expeditionary Force, which continued to maintain a presence on both the Western Front and the Macedonian front, even after the October Revolution, remaining on those fronts until the Armistice on 11 November 1918. Even after the February Revolution, most of the Russian Army remained intact and the front, willing to fight defensively but ineffective on the offensive. The demands of the soldiers after the revolution were mainly about reducing certain powers that officers had, and many still supported fighting a defensive war. Units in the rear were most likely to demand immediate peace than front line units. Desertions on a significant scale only began after the October Revolution, and accelerated in February 1918 when peace negotiations between the Bolsheviks and Germans broke down.

=== Russia – the February Revolution ===
The Russian February Revolution aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today. Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did – let alone how it did.

On International Women&#x27;s Day, Thursday, 23 February 1917/8 March 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting &quot;Bread&quot;, &quot;Down with the autocracy!&quot; and &quot;Stop the War!&quot; These women were tired, hungry, and angry, after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day.

By Saturday, 25 February, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work. Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters. Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By 1 March, it was obvious to everyone except the Tsar himself, that his rule was over. On 2 March it was made official. From this point onwards Russia was administered by the Russian Provisional Government until the October Revolution.

=== Romania – the Summer Campaign ===
In early July 1917, on a relatively small area of the Romanian front, there began one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries; in total they numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. Between late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of Mărăști, Mărășești and Oituz, managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917. As a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting &quot;The Times&quot; to describe the Romanian front as &quot;The only point of light in the East&quot;.

=== Kerensky offensive ===

On 29 June 1917, Alexander Kerensky, the Minister of War in the Russian Provisional Government, launched the Kerensky offensive to end Austria-Hungary once and for all. The Russians made only 6 miles (9.7 km) of progress but the Austrians counterattacked and drove them almost entirely out of Austria-Hungary, and they retreated 150 miles (240 km), losing Tarnopol, Stanislau and Czernowitz. This defeat was accompanied by 60,000 casualties and contributed greatly to the October Revolution.

=== Russia – the October Revolution ===
Although the February Revolution had overthrown the Tsar, the Bolsheviks still were not satisfied. In their view, the new Provisional Government was merely a more deceptive continuation of the previous government; they still refused to withdraw from the war despite how badly it was going. The upper class still wielded considerable influence in Russian economics and politics, so by September 1917, Lenin began advocating for a second revolution - one that would allow the workers and peasants to gain total control over the country. The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party convened on 10 October, and after much heated debate, agreed that it was time to begin planning for an armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.

Petrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d&#x27;état. On 24 October, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of 7 November, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia. Lenin announced that the new Bolshevik government would immediately be seeking an end to the war, implementing a system of worker&#x27;s democracy, and establishing collective ownership of all farms and factories.

== 1918 ==

Lenin&#x27;s new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917 along lines agreed in November. At the same time, the Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: Ukraine and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between the Soviets and the Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time, the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events in 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a civil war. Finland declared itself independent on 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.
The Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic and were aided by Russian forces still in Finland.
The Whites of Finland were led by General C.G.E.Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsar&#x27;s service since he was 15 years old.
The Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.

=== Formation of the Red Army ===
Although the majority of the Russian army was still at the front lines in late 1917, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army controlled by the Bolsheviks. By a decree on 28 January 1918, the council created the Workers&#x27; and Peoples&#x27; Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. Several officers who had served in the Russian Imperial Army defected to the Red Army in support of the Bolshevik cause. Many of them were of an aristocratic background but became disillusioned with imperialism and monarchism, although the Red Army still mostly consisted of ordinary workers and peasants.

== Aftermath ==
In historiography, events are usually described as the defeat of the Entente. Despite the defeat of the eastern front, the failure of the German spring offensive is directly related to the fact that the Germans kept all their cavalry in the east. In modern historiography, however, new views are emerging on how the conflict ended. Historian Andrei Borisyuk believes that when describing the end of the war, one should appeal to the Versailles Peace Treaty rather than the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. According to him, &quot;Russia has lost the opportunity to win the war, but has not defeat.&quot;
=== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ===
With the German Army just from the Russian capital Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. In the treaty, Soviet Russia ceded 34% of the former empire&#x27;s population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railroads. The total losses in land amounted to 1 million square kilometers. Lenin bitterly called the settlement &quot;that abyss of defeat, dismemberment, enslavement and humiliation.&quot; While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of Ukraine. However, Estonia and Latvia were intended to become a United Baltic Duchy to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. A rump Polish state was also foreseen on the formerly Russian territories. Finland&#x27;s sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and Russia, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States.

=== Treaty of Bucharest (May 1918) ===

On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany. Although approved by Parliament, Ferdinand I refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an Allied victory; Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 ethnic Romanians served with the Austro-Hungarian army, of whom up to 150,000 were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary Romanian borders are estimated at 748,000.

The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around Ploiești and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.

=== End of war ===

With the end of major combat on the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an offensive in France in the spring of 1918.

This offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more American units in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war, attempting to run a short-lived addition to the German Empire in Europe.

In the end, the Central Powers had to relinquish all of their captured lands on the eastern front, with Germany even being forced to cede territory they held before the war, under various treaties (such as the Treaty of Versailles) signed after the armistice in 1918. Although the Allied Powers&#x27; victory led to the Central Powers being forced to cancel the treaty signed with Russia, the victors were at the time intervening in the Russian Civil War, causing bad relations between Russia and the Allied Powers.

For Versailles Peace Brest Peace was canceled, as well as reserved the rights of Russia to demand reparations.

=== New conflicts ===

After the central powers capitulated, the countries in the east took advantage of the situation: Soviet Russia immediately cancelled the peace treaty and launched an offensive against the Baltic States, Belarus and Ukraine. Romania formally rejoined the war a day before its end in the West, soon followed by conflict with newly independent Hungary.

== Role of women ==


In comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women&#x27;s share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.

Women also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia&#x27;s participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the Women&#x27;s Battalions, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women&#x27;s willingness to fight. In Romania, Ecaterina Teodoroiu actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.

British nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the &quot;Gray partridges&quot; in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of Elsie Inglis. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks. The &quot;Gray Partridges&quot; were well respected by Romanian, Serbian and Russian troops and as a result, the Romanian press went as far as to characterize them as &quot;healthy, masculine, and tanned women.&quot; As a testament to her abilities, Elsie Inglis and her volunteers were entrusted to turn an abandoned building in the city of Galați into an operational hospital, which they did in a little more than a day. Yvonne Fitzroy&#x27;s published journal, &quot;With the Scottish Nurses in Roumania,&quot; provides an excellent first hand account of Scottish nursing activities in the Eastern Front.

== Propaganda ==

Propaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was often shown through state-controlled media, and helped to bolster nationalism and patriotism within countries. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater, spectacle, war novels and graphic art. Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda.

In order for the Russians to legitimize their war efforts, the government constructed an image of the enemy through state-instituted propaganda. Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the &quot;invincible&quot; German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric &quot;inhuman&quot; traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian POWs who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of German POW camps that were perceived as inhumane.

An element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov, and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the Central Powers and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to &quot;take no prisoners.&quot; A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how &quot;inhumanly&quot; the Germans were treating prisoners of war.

Also, the Russians chose to discard the name Saint Petersburg to remove the German-sounding &quot;Saint&quot; and &quot;-burg&quot;, favouring the more Russian-sounding Petrograd.

== Prisoners of war in Russia ==
During World War I, approximately 200,000 German soldiers and 2.5 million soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian army entered Russian captivity. During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many POWs were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor. Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government&#x27;s inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others. The attitude towards Russian prisoners from the Central Powers was even worse, in some camps the mattress was for 4 people, and in others people were starved on purpose. At the beginning of 1915, a case was recorded of three prisoners being forced to run around the camp without stopping, in parallel they were stabbed with bayonets and beaten.

== Disease ==
Disease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West. Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German-occupied Ober Ost.

Ultimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named &quot;Sanititätswesen&quot; (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A &quot;sanitary police&quot; was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign. Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.

To avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease. Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of Kowno emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.

== Casualties ==
===Russian casualties===
The Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.

Cornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of &quot;over 1,500,000&quot; is not unlikely. He has over five million men &quot;passing into captivity&quot;, the majority during 1915. However, these figures on the number of prisoners are very contradictory, since the extreme reports on prisoners issued by the official commission of the USSR called the figure at 3.3 million. These data have been criticized by Imperial Russian Army general and military historian Golovin, who conducted a study together with German veterans in the archives of the central powers, and named a figure of 2,410,000 people.

When Russia withdrew from the war, ~2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of Britain, France and Germany combined. Only the Austro-Hungarian Army, with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close.

According to other data, the number of irretrievable losses in Russia ranges from 700,000 to 1,061,000. 
Golovin wrote a huge work dedicated to the losses of Russians in World Wat I, he based on the documents of the headquarters and the documents of the German archive, working there together with German veterans, correlated the losses and came to the conclusion that the total losses are 7,917,000, including 1,300,000 dead, 4,200,000 wounded and 2,410,000 prisoners.
Later estimates have adjusted this number to 2,420,000 people.
Per Alexei Oleynikov total losses for the 1914–1917 campaigns look like this: 
*1914: 1,000,000+
*1915: 3,000,000
*1916: 2,000,000
*1917: 400,000
The death toll of a maximum of ~1,000,000+ people is also shared by other authors.
There is also an estimate by Krivosheev, according to him, the Russians lost 2,254,000 dead, but this estimate does not at all match the number of wounded - 2,844,500.
According to the Russian historian , Russia&#x27;s losses amounted to 9,000,000.
The official website of the Russian archive published information that more than 622,000 people were killed, 3,750,000 were injured, and 2,410,000 were captured.

===Central Powers casualties===
At that time, the losses of the Austro-German troops were as great.
As General Günther Blumentritt wrote in his memoirs: «I will cite a little-known but significant fact, our losses on the eastern front were much higher than on the western.»
Historian Oleynikov estimated the total losses at 5,100,000 people, The maximum estimate was up to 6,000,000 casualties, this ratio is much better than on the western front.

Similarly, the losses of the central powers in the East in the period from 1914 to 1916 were greater than similar losses on all other fronts, the Russian army was able to inflict damage to the enemy, estimates range from 4,600,000 to 5,400,000 people from a total loss of 8,090,000. The Russians also took the most prisoners, as many as 2,130,000, and according to other data 1,961,000.
There is also an estimate of 2,200,000 prisoners, but the general trend remains to estimate about 2,000,000 people, which is six times more than all those prisoners who were captured by all the Entente countries combined.

== Territorial changes ==
=== Austria ===
The empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss, Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
Czechoslovakia was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state.
The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%. Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.
The state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again.

=== Hungary ===
After the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, and Banat.

=== Italy ===
Italy incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria.

=== Poland ===
The creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of Wilson&#x27;s fourteen points. At the end of the 18th century, the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Commission on Polish Affairs was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would separate East Prussia from the rest of Germany, as it was before the Partitions of Poland. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon proposed Poland&#x27;s eastern border with Russia. Neither the Soviet Russians nor the Polish were happy with the demarcation of the border.

=== Romania ===
The state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the Dobrudja and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the Little Entente was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration.

=== Yugoslavia ===
Initially Yugoslavia began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace conference after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state. Yugoslavia was divided on national, linguistic, economic, and religious lines.

<doc id="1014353" wikidata="Q71421" url="?curid=1014353" title="TeamSpeak">
<text>TeamSpeak (TS) is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application service for audio communication between users on a chat channel, much like a telephone conference call. The client software connects to a TeamSpeak server of the user&#x27;s choice, from which the user may join chat channels. Users typically use headphones with a microphone; the target audience for TeamSpeak is gamers, who can use the software to communicate with other players on the same team of a multiplayer video game.

== Server ==
The TeamSpeak server runs as a dedicated server on Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows and FreeBSD and uses a client based user interface or a command-line interface to control server administration and configuration. TeamSpeak clients are available for Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, and iOS — both 32-bit and 64-bit architecture.

The TeamSpeak 3 server can be used at no cost for up to 32 slots (simultaneous users). For non-commercial use, non-profit licenses were available, until September 2018, that allowed to use the server with up to 512 slots. With it, server admins can choose to split up the slots into multiple virtual server instances (up to 2).

Beginning from September 2018, the non-profit license was discontinued for the new license system.

It splits the licenses into three categories:

The commercial license is for &quot;Companies/Businesses, who look for an internal voice communication solution&quot;.

== TeamSpeak Client ==
On Monday, 14th October 2019, TeamSpeak announced a fully rebuilt version of their client software. Originally dubbed TeamSpeak 5 (with the name TeamSpeak 4 rumored to have been avoided due to Tetraphobia), their new client has been released without a version number, and is just called &quot;TeamSpeak&quot;.

The new client introduces a number of brand new additions to their services, including a modern global chat feature, a fully responsive user interface, free voice servers and many upgraded audio functions.

=== TeamSpeak 3 ===
TeamSpeak 3 has been in development since 2004.
It was a complete rewrite of TS2 with many new features, but has had infrequent updates on the development blog, and was first estimated to be released in mid-2006. The first public release of the TeamSpeak 3 SDK was on June 5, 2008, with the integrated solution in the MMO game &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;.
Open beta of TeamSpeak 3 was released on December 9, 2009. Open beta was closed on August 10, 2011 and replaced with TeamSpeak 3.0.0 Final, which was the first stable release of TeamSpeak 3.

TeamSpeak 3 introduced the use of &quot;unique IDs&quot;, maintained in the program as identities, that are randomly generated at the time of a client&#x27;s initial setup. An identity contains a nickname, which can be changed at any time, the Unique ID and an identity name, which is not visible to other users on the server. The unique id is used by the server to grant permissions to the user. Unique IDs replaced the need for a user to register with the server to keep their user group, be it a channel group or a server group.

=== Teamspeak 5 ===
Released as a beta in 2020, TeamSpeak 5 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, TeamSpeak 3, offering enhanced features, modernized design, and improved usability. 

=== Teamspeak 6 ===
TeamSpeak 6 was released as beta on January 21, 2025, introducing major new features like screen sharing and the ability to purchase hosted servers directly through the app. 

=== Permissions system ===

When TeamSpeak 3 was first introduced in the Open Beta release, the server administrators were confronted with a major change in granting administrative powers to users, in the way of a permissions system based on boolean and integer, which permitted better user control.

The permissions system has two types of integer-based permissions: Power and Needed Power. The Power is the power level in numbers that the group/user has for that permission. The Needed Power is the power level in numbers needed by the group/user to use that specific permission. If the Power level is lower than the Needed Power level then the permission cannot be used. If the Power level is equal to or higher than the Needed Power level then the group/user will be able to use it.

TeamSpeak 3 also has a 5-tier hierarchy within its permissions system: Server Group, Client Permissions, Channel Permissions, Channel Groups and Channel Client Permissions. The five are used to override another type, also known as inheriting. This allows for highly complex permissions for users, giving users more powers and uses in TeamSpeak without giving away complete control to the users of the server.

With the release of later versions the TeamSpeak developers created easier ways to set up permissions in the way of a &quot;Standard Permissions Display&quot; by default in the client. This placed the original permissions system display behind the &quot;Standard&quot; one calling it &quot;Advanced Permissions Display&quot;. This allowed beginners more ease of use when setting up a TeamSpeak 3 server. Some still prefer the Advanced system because it allows more control over which permissions get changed, whereas the Standard changes many permissions at the same time.

===Update mechanism===
TeamSpeak 3 uses an incremental update system that only downloads the files that need to be updated between releases, resulting in less bandwidth usage and faster installation.

===Audio quality===
It is possible to boost the microphone volume by applying software-based gain; however, this is at the loss of audio quality. Low THD hardware and dual-microphone noise suppression help clean up the noisefloor to allow software-base gain with less of an impact to audio quality.

== In popular culture ==
TeamSpeak was mentioned numerous times within &quot;South Park&quot;″s episode titled &quot;Make Love, Not Warcraft&quot; which aired on October 4, 2006 on Comedy Central.

<doc id="1014354" wikidata="Q289992" url="?curid=1014354" title="Uniporter">
<text>Uniporters, also known as solute carriers or facilitated transporters, are a type of membrane transport protein that passively transports solutes (small molecules, ions, or other substances) across a cell membrane. It uses facilitated diffusion for the movement of solutes down their concentration gradient from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Unlike active transport, it does not require energy in the form of ATP to function. Uniporters are specialized to carry one specific ion or molecule and can be categorized as either channels or carriers. Facilitated diffusion may occur through three mechanisms: uniport, symport, or antiport. The difference between each mechanism depends on the direction of transport, in which uniport is the only transport not coupled to the transport of another solute.

Uniporter carrier proteins work by binding to one molecule or substrate at a time. Uniporter channels open in response to a stimulus and allow the free flow of specific molecules.

There are several ways in which the opening of uniporter channels may be regulated:

# Voltage – Regulated by the difference in voltage across the membrane
# Stress – Regulated by physical pressure on the transporter (as in the cochlea of the ear)
# Ligand – Regulated by the binding of a ligand to either the intracellular or extracellular side of the cell
Uniporters are found in mitochondria, plasma membranes and neurons.The uniporter in the mitochondria is responsible for calcium uptake. The calcium channels are used for cell signaling and triggering apoptosis. The calcium uniporter transports calcium across the inner mitochondrial membrane and is activated when calcium rises above a certain concentration. The amino acid transporters function in transporting neutral amino acids for neurotransmitter production in brain cells. Voltage-gated potassium channels are also uniporters found in neurons and are essential for action potentials. This channel is activated by a voltage gradient created by sodium-potassium pumps. When the membrane reaches a certain voltage, the channels open, which depolarizes the membrane, leading to an action potential being sent down the membrane. Glucose transporters are found in the plasma membrane and play a role in transporting glucose. They help to bring glucose from the blood or extracellular space into cells usually to be utilized for metabolic processes in generating energy.

Uniporters are essential for certain physiological processes in cells, such as nutrient uptake, waste removal, and maintenance of ionic balance.

== Discovery ==

Early research in the 19th and 20th centuries on osmosis and diffusion provided the foundation for understanding the passive movement of molecules across cell membranes.

In 1855, the physiologist Adolf Fick was the first to define osmosis and simple diffusion as the tendency for solutes to move from a region of higher concentration to a lower concentration, also very well-known as Fick&#x27;s Laws of Diffusion. Through the work of Charles Overton in the 1890s, the concept that the biological membrane is semipermeable became important to understanding the regulation of substances in and out of the cells. The discovery of facilitated diffusion by Wittenberg and Scholander suggested that proteins in the cell membrane aid in the transport of molecules. In the 1960s - 1970s, studies on the transport of glucose and other nutrients highlighted the specificity and selectivity of membrane transport proteins.

Technological advancements in biochemistry helped isolate and characterize these proteins from cell membranes. Genetic studies on bacteria and yeast identified genes responsible for encoding transporters. This led to the discovery of glucose transporters (GLUT proteins), with GLUT1 being the first to be characterized. Identification of gene families encoding various transporters, such as solute carrier (SLC) families, also advanced knowledge on uniporters and its functions.

Newer research is focusing on techniques using recombinant DNA technology, electrophysiology and advanced imaging to understand uniporter functions. These experiments are designed to clone and express transporter genes in host cells to further analyze the three-dimensional structure of uniporters, as well as directly observe the movement of ions through proteins in real-time. The discovery of mutations in uniporters has been linked to diseases such as GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Hartnup disease, primary hyperoxaluria and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.

The glucose transporter (GLUTs) is a type of uniporter responsible for the facilitated diffusion of glucose molecules across cell membranes.Glucose is a vital energy source for most living cells, however, due to its large size, it cannot freely move through the cell membrane. The glucose transporter is specialized in transporting glucose specifically across the membrane. The GLUT proteins have several types of isoforms, each distributed in different tissues and exhibiting different kinetic properties.

GLUTs are integral membrane proteins composed of 12 α-helix membrane spanning regions. The GLUT proteins are encoded by the SLC2 genes and categorized into three classes based on amino acid sequence similarity. Humans have been found to express fourteen GLUT proteins. Class I GLUTs include GLUT1, one of the most studied isoforms, and GLUT2. GLUT1 is found in various tissues like the red blood cells, brain, and blood-brain barrier and is responsible for basal glucose uptake. GLUT2 is predominantly found in the liver, pancreas, and small intestines. It plays an important role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Class II includes the GLUT3 and GLUT4. GLUT3, primarily found in the brain, neurons and placenta, has a high affinity for glucose in facilitating glucose uptake into neurons. GLUT4 plays a role in insulin-regulated glucose uptake and is mainly found in insulin-sensitive tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue. Class III includes GLUT5, found in the small intestine, kidney, testes, and skeletal muscle. Unlike the other GLUTs, GLUT5 specifically transports fructose rather than glucose.

Glucose transporters allow glucose molecules to move down their concentration gradient from areas of high glucose concentration to areas of low concentration. This process often involves bringing glucose from the extracellular space or blood into the cell. The concentration gradient set up by glucose concentrations fuels the process without the need for ATP.

When glucose binds to the glucose transporter, the protein channels change shape and undergo a conformational change to transport the glucose across the membrane. Once the glucose unbinds, the protein returns to its original shape. The glucose transporter is essential for carrying out physiological processes that require high energy demands in the brain, muscles, and kidneys by providing an adequate amount of energy substrate for metabolism. Diabetes, an example of a condition that involves glucose metabolism, highlights the importance of the regulation of glucose uptake in disease management.

=== Mitochondrial uniporter (MCU) ===
The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a protein complex located in the inner mitochondrial matrix that functions to take up calcium ions (Ca2+) into the matrix from the cytoplasm. The transport of calcium ions is specifically used in cellular function for regulating energy production in the mitochondria, cytosolic calcium signaling, and cell death. The uniporter becomes activated when cytoplasmic levels of calcium rise above 1 uM.

The MCU complex comprises 4 parts: the port-forming subunits, regulatory subunits MICU1 and MICU2, and an auxiliary subunit, EMRE. These subunits work together to regulate the uptake of calcium in the mitochondria. Specifically, the EMRE subunit functions for the transport of calcium, and the MICU subunit functions in tightly regulating the activity of MCU to prevent the overload of calcium concentrations in the cytoplasm. Calcium is fundamental for signaling pathways in cells, as well as for cell death pathways. The function of the mitochondrial uniporter is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

The MICU1 and MICU2 subunits are a heterodimer connected by a disulfide bridge. When there are high levels of cytoplasmic calcium, the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer undergoes a conformational change. The heterodimer subunits have cooperative activation, which means binding to one MICU subunit in the heterodimer induces a conformational change on the other MICU subunits. The uptake of calcium is balanced by the sodium-calcium exchanger.

=== Large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1) ===

The L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) is a uniporter that mediates the transport of neutral amino acids like L-tryptophan, leucine, histidine, proline, alanine, etc. LAT1 favors the transport of amino acids with large branched or aromatic side chains. The amino acid transporter functions to move essential amino acids into the intestinal epithelium, placenta, and blood-brain barrier for cellular processes such as metabolism and cell signaling. The transporter is of particular significance in the central nervous system as it provides the necessary amino acids for protein synthesis and neurotransmitter production in brain cells. Aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine and tryptophan are precursors for neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.

LAT1 is a membrane protein of the SLC7 family of transporters and works in conjunction with the SLC3 family member 4F2hc to form a heterodimeric complex known as the 4F2hc complex. The heterodimer consists of a light chain and a heavy chain covalently bonded by a disulfide bond. The light chain is the one that carries out transport, while the heavy chain is needed to stabilize the dimer.

There is some controversy over whether LAT1 is an uniporter or an antiporter. The transporter has uniporter characteristics of transporting amino acids into cells in a unidirectional manner down the concentration gradient. However, recently it has been found that the transporter has antiporter characteristics of exchanging neutral amino acids for abundant intracellular amino acids. Over-expression of LAT1 has been found in human cancer and is associated with playing a role in cancer metabolism.

=== Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) ===
The nucleoside transporters, or equilibrative nucleoside transporters, are uniporters that transport nucleosides, nucleobases, and therapeutic drugs across the cell membrane. Nucleosides serve as building blocks for nucleic acid synthesis and are key components for energy metabolism in creating ATP/ GTP. They also act as ligands for purinergic receptors such as adenosine and inosine. ENTs allow the transport of nucleosides down their concentration gradient. They also have the ability to deliver nucleoside analogs to intracellular targets for the treatment of tumors and viral infections.

ENTs are part of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and are suggested to transport nucleosides using a clamp-and-switch model. In this model, the substrate first binds to the transporter, which leads to a conformational change that forms an occluded state (clamp). Then, the transporter switches to face the other side of the membrane and releases the bound substrate (switching).

ENTs have been found in protozoa and mammals. In humans, they have been discovered as ENT3 (hENT1-3) and ENT4 (hENT4) transporters. ENTs are expressed across all tissue types, but certain ENT proteins have been found to be more abundant in specific tissues. hENT1 is found mostly in the adrenal glands, ovary, stomach and small intestines. hENT2 is expressed mostly in neurological tissues and small parts of the skin, placenta, urinary bladder, heart muscle and gallbladder. hENT3 is expressed highly in the cerebral cortex, lateral ventricle, ovary and adrenal gland. hENT4 is more commonly known as the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), as it facilitates the movement of organic cations and biogenic amines across the membrane.

== Mechanism ==
Uniporters work to transport molecules or ions by passive transport across a cell membrane down its concentration gradient.

Upon binding and recognition of a specific substrate molecule on one side of the uniporter membrane, a conformational change is triggered in the transporter protein. This causes the transporter protein to change its three-dimensional shape, which ensures the substrate molecule is captured within the transporter proteins structure. The conformational change leads to the translocation of the substrate across the membrane onto the other side. On the other side of the membrane, the uniporter undergoes another conformational change in the release of the substrate molecule. The uniporter returns to its original conformation to bind another molecule for transport.

Unlike symporters and antiporters, uniporters transport one molecule/ion in a single direction based on the concentration gradient. The entire process depends on the substrate&#x27;s concentration difference across the membrane to be the driving force for the transport by uniporters. Cellular energy in the form of ATP is not required for this process.

== Physiological processes ==
Uniporters play an essential role in carrying out various cellular functions. Each uniporter is specialized to facilitate the transport of a specific molecule or ion across the cell membrane. Examples of a few of the physiological roles uniporters aid in include:
# Nutrient Uptake: Uniporters facilitate the transport of essential nutrients into the cell. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are uniporters that uptake glucose for energy production.
# Ion homeostasis: Uniporters facilitate in maintaining the balance of ions (i.e., , , ) within cells 
# Metabolism: Uniporters are involved in the transport of essential ions, amino acids and molecules required for the metabolic pathway, protein synthesis and energy production
# Cell signaling: Calcium uniporters help regulate intercellular calcium levels essential for signal transduction
# Waste removal: Uniporters aid in removing metabolic waste products and toxins from cells
# pH regulation: Transport of ions by uniporters also helps to maintain the overall acid-base balance within cells 

== Mutations ==
Mutations in genes encoding uniporters lead to dysfunctional transporter proteins being formed. This loss of function in uniporters causes disruption in cellular function which leads to various diseases and disorders.

<text>Rehab Doll is the only studio album by the American rock band Green River, released in 1988 through Sub Pop Records.

==Overview==
Almost immediately following the release of &quot;Dry As a Bone&quot;, the group re-entered the studio in August 1987 to begin production on its first full-length album, &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;. The band initially started work on the album with producer Jack Endino at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington, however the band switched to producer Bruce Calder and changed its recording location to Steve Lawson Studios in Seattle. Band in-fighting, though, took center stage over the music. A stylistic division developed between bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard on one side, and vocalist Mark Arm on the other. Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain independent, viewing the duo as being too careerist. On October 31, 1987, Ament, Gossard and guitarist Bruce Fairweather stated their desire to quit the band.

Although the band members agreed to complete production of &quot;Rehab Doll&quot; during the next three months, Green River had by late October 1987 ceased as a band. The recording sessions for the album were completed in January 1988. The song &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; originally appeared on the band&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Come on Down&quot;, and the song &quot;Together We&#x27;ll Never&quot; was previously released as a single through Tasque Force Records in 1986. Both songs were re-recorded for this album. The cassette version of &quot;Rehab Doll&quot; also contains a cover of the David Bowie song &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art was photographed by Charles Peterson and a small portion of the Frye Hotel in Seattle is seen in the background.

The album was released in June 1988 on Sub Pop Records. Ned Raggett of AllMusic called it &quot;a record that sounded caught somewhere between grunge mania and metal/corp rock folly.&quot; It was reissued in 1990 as part of the &quot;Dry as a Bone/Rehab Doll&quot; compilation album.

In 2019, the album was re-released with a new mix by original producer Jack Endino, and 10 bonus tracks.

<text>Mickey Lee Soule (June 6, 1946 in Cortland, New York) is an American musician. He was the keyboard player for New York hard rock band Elf and a founding member of Rainbow.

Soule had a band in the mid-1960s until he was drafted into the army. After his honorable discharge he joined The Elves after the band&#x27;s original keyboardist, Doug Thaler, was severely injured in a car accident that killed guitarist Nick Pantas. In the first years of the 1970s, The Elves (after 1972 known simply as Elf) enjoyed minor success as a consistent opening act for Deep Purple. That connection to Deep Purple opened up the opportunity for Soule (and vocalist Ronnie James Dio) to participate in Roger Glover&#x27;s 1974 concept album &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;. In addition to co-writing credits on two songs, Soule also sang the lead vocals on the song &quot;No Solution&quot;. Soule and Glover would work together sporadically in the years following.

In early 1975, Soule and the rest of Elf (minus guitarist Steve Edwards) transformed into Rainbow, featuring Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. During this time the third and final Elf album, &quot;Trying to Burn the Sun&quot;, was recorded when the former Elf were not in the studio recording Rainbow&#x27;s debut album. Elf had effectively dissolved by the time that album was released as the members hoped to continue with Blackmore. However, following the recording of the Rainbow album, Blackmore gradually fired the entire line up with the exception of Dio before Rainbow had begun to tour.

In 1976 Soule toured France with the Ian Gillan Band.

Soule continues to play locally in New York. In 1996, Mickey Lee Soule started working as a keyboard tech for Deep Purple&#x27;s Jon Lord, later he became bass tech for Roger Glover until he retired from touring in 2014. He began working for Roger Glover and Deep Purple again in 2016.

<doc id="1014366" wikidata="Q121874" url="?curid=1014366" title="Potassium iodide">
<text>Potassium iodide is a chemical compound, medication, and dietary supplement. It is a medication used for treating hyperthyroidism, in radiation emergencies, and for protecting the thyroid gland when certain types of radiopharmaceuticals are used. It is also used for treating skin sporotrichosis and phycomycosis. It is a supplement used by people with low dietary intake of iodine. It is administered orally.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, and swelling of the salivary glands. Other side effects include allergic reactions, headache, goitre, and depression. While use during pregnancy may harm the baby, its use is still recommended in radiation emergencies. Potassium iodide has the chemical formula KI. Commercially it is made by mixing potassium hydroxide with iodine.
Potassium iodide has been used medically since at least 1820. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Potassium iodide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Potassium iodide is also used for the iodization of salt.

==Medical uses==

===Dietary supplement===

Potassium iodide is a nutritional supplement in animal feeds and also in the human diet. In humans it is the most common additive used for iodizing table salt (a public health measure to prevent iodine deficiency in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from iodised salts that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates. Potassium iod&quot;ate&quot; (KIO3) is used to iodize some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. Dextrose or sodium thiosulfate are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.

===Thyroid protection in nuclear accidents===

Thyroid iodine uptake blockade with potassium iodide is used in nuclear medicine scintigraphy and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as iobenguane (MIBG), which is used to image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated fibrinogen, which is used in fibrinogen scans to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. Since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.

The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelines for potassium iodide use following a nuclear accident. The dosage of potassium iodide is age-dependent: neonates (&lt;1 month) require 16 mg/day; children aged 1 month to 3 years need 32 mg/day; those aged 3-12 years need 65 mg/day; and individuals over 12 years and adults require 130 mg/day. These dosages list mass of potassium iodide rather than elemental iodine. Potassium iodide can be administered as tablets or as Lugol&#x27;s iodine solution. The same dosage is recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration. A single daily dose is typically sufficient for 24-hour protection. However, in cases of prolonged or repeated exposure, health authorities may recommend multiple daily doses. Priority for prophylaxis is given to the most sensitive groups: pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, and children under 18 years. The recommended doses of potassium iodide, which contains a stable isotope of iodine, only protect the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine. It does not offer protection against other radioactive substances. Some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.

Not all sources are in agreement on the necessary &quot;duration&quot; of thyroid blockade, although agreement appears to have been reached about the &quot;necessity&quot; of blockade for both scintigraphic and therapeutic applications of iobenguane. Commercially available iobenguane is labeled with iodine-123, and product labeling recommends administration of potassium iodide 1 hour prior to administration of the radiopharmaceutical for all age groups, while the European Association of Nuclear Medicine recommends (for iobenguane labeled with either isotope), that potassium iodide administration begin one day prior to radiopharmaceutical administration, and continue until the day following the injection, with the exception of new-borns, who do not require potassium iodide doses following radiopharmaceutical injection.

Product labeling for diagnostic iodine-131 iobenguane recommends potassium iodide administration one day before injection and continuing 5 to 7 days following administration, in keeping with the much longer half-life of this isotope and its greater danger to the thyroid. Iodine-131 iobenguane used for therapeutic purposes requires a different pre-medication duration, beginning 24–48 hours prior to iobenguane injection and continuing 10–15 days following injection.
In 1982, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved potassium iodide to protect thyroid glands from radioactive iodine involving accidents or fission emergencies. In an accidental event or attack on a nuclear power plant, or in nuclear bomb fallout, volatile fission product radionuclides may be released. Of these products, (Iodine-131) is one of the most common and is particularly dangerous to the thyroid gland because it may lead to thyroid cancer. By saturating the body with a source of stable iodide prior to exposure, inhaled or ingested tends to be excreted, which prevents radioiodine uptake by the thyroid. According to one 2000 study &quot;KI administered up to 48 h before exposure can almost completely block thyroid uptake and therefore greatly reduce the thyroid absorbed dose. However, KI administration 96 h or more before exposure has no significant protective effect. In contrast, KI administration after exposure to radioiodine induces a smaller and rapidly decreasing blockade effect.&quot; According to the FDA, KI should not be taken as a preventative before radiation exposure. Since KI protects for approximately 24 hours, it must be dosed daily until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodine no longer exists.

Emergency 130 milligrams potassium iodide doses provide 100 mg iodide (the other 30 mg is the potassium in the compound), which is roughly 700 times larger than the normal nutritional need (see recommended dietary allowance) for iodine, which is 150 micrograms (0.15 mg) of iodine (as iodide) per day for an adult. A typical tablet weighs 160 mg, with 130 mg of potassium iodide and 30 mg of excipients, such as binding agents.

Potassium iodide cannot protect against any other mechanisms of radiation poisoning, nor can it provide any degree of protection against dirty bombs that produce radionuclides other than those of iodine.

The potassium iodide in iodized salt is insufficient for this use. A likely lethal dose of salt (more than a kilogram) would be needed to equal the potassium iodide in one tablet.

The World Health Organization does not recommend KI prophylaxis for adults over 40 years, unless the radiation dose from inhaled radioiodine is expected to threaten thyroid function, because the KI side effects increase with age and may exceed the KI protective effects; &quot;...unless doses to the thyroid from inhalation rise to levels threatening thyroid function, that is of the order of about 5 Gy. Such radiation doses will not occur far away from an accident site.&quot;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services restated these two years later as &quot;The downward KI (potassium iodide) dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard (daily) dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., &gt;70 kg [154 lbs]) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI.&quot;

==Side effects==
There is reason for caution with prescribing the ingestion of high doses of potassium iodide and iodate, because their unnecessary use can cause conditions such as the Jod-Basedow phenomena, trigger and/or worsen hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and then cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause sialadenitis (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended for people with dermatitis herpetiformis and hypocomplementemic vasculitis – conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.

There have been some reports of potassium iodide treatment causing swelling of the parotid gland (one of the three glands that secrete saliva), due to its stimulatory effects on saliva production.

A saturated solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses several times a day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be  mL) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an expectorant (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100  mg a day for an adult, to less than this for children (see table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150 μg per day (150 micrograms, not milligrams).

At maximal doses, and sometimes at much lower doses, side effects of iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects that require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.

In the event of a radioiodine release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as hypothyroidism. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine bioaccumulation in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

==Industrial uses==
KI is used with silver nitrate to make silver iodide (AgI), an important chemical in film photography. KI is a component in some disinfectants and hair treatment chemicals. KI is also used as a fluorescence quenching agent in biomedical research, an application that takes advantage of collisional quenching of fluorescent substances by the iodide ion. However, for several fluorophores addition of KI in μM-mM concentrations results in increase of fluorescence intensity, and iodide acts as fluorescence enhancer.

Potassium iodide is a component in the electrolyte of dye sensitised solar cells (DSSC) along with iodine.

Potassium iodide finds its most important applications in organic synthesis mainly in the preparation of aryl iodides in the Sandmeyer reaction, starting from aryl amines. Aryl iodides are in turn used to attach aryl groups to other organics by nucleophilic substitution, with iodide ion as the leaving group.

==Chemistry==
Potassium iodide is an ionic compound which is made of the following ions: . It crystallises in the sodium chloride structure. It is produced industrially by treating KOH with iodine.

It is a white salt, which is the most commercially significant iodide compound, with approximately 37,000 tons produced in 1985. It absorbs water less readily than sodium iodide, making it easier to work with.

Aged and impure samples are yellow because of the slow oxidation of the salt to potassium carbonate and elemental iodine.

===Inorganic chemistry===
Since the iodide ion is a mild reducing agent, is easily oxidised to iodine () by powerful oxidising agents such as chlorine:
This reaction is employed in the isolation of iodine from natural sources. Air will oxidize iodide, as evidenced by the observation of a purple extract when aged samples of KI are rinsed with dichloromethane. As formed under acidic conditions, hydriodic acid (HI) is a stronger reducing agent.

Like other iodide salts, KI forms triiodide () when combined with elemental iodine.
Unlike , salts can be highly water-soluble. Through this reaction, iodine is used in redox titrations. Aqueous (Lugol&#x27;s iodine) solution is used as a disinfectant and as an etchant for gold surfaces.

Potassium iodide and silver nitrate are used to make silver(I) iodide, which is used for high speed photographic film and for cloud seeding:

===Organic chemistry===
KI serves as a source of iodide in organic synthesis. A useful application is in the preparation of aryl iodides from arenediazonium salts.

KI, acting as a source of iodide, may also act as a nucleophilic catalyst for the alkylation of alkyl chlorides, bromides, or mesylates.

==History==
Potassium iodide has been used medically since at least 1820. Some of the earliest uses included cures for syphilis, lead and mercury poisoning.

===Chernobyl===
Potassium iodide&#x27;s (KI) value as a radiation protective (thyroid blocking) agent was demonstrated following the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in April 1986. A saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was administered to 10.5 million children and 7 million adults in Poland as a preventative measure against accumulation of radioactive in the thyroid gland.

Reports differ concerning whether people in the areas immediately surrounding Chernobyl itself were given the supplement. However the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reported, &quot;thousands of measurements of I-131 (radioactive iodine) activity...suggest that the observed levels were lower than would have been expected had this prophylactic measure not been taken. The use of KI...was credited with permissible iodine content in 97% of the evacuees tested.&quot;

With the passage of time, people living in irradiated areas where KI was not available have developed thyroid cancer at epidemic levels, which is why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported &quot;The data clearly demonstrate the risks of thyroid radiation... KI can be used [to] provide safe and effective protection against thyroid cancer caused by irradiation.&quot;

Chernobyl also demonstrated that the need to protect the thyroid from radiation was greater than expected. Within ten years of the accident, it became clear that thyroid damage caused by released radioactive iodine was virtually the only adverse health effect that could be measured. As reported by the NRC, studies after the accident showed that &quot;As of 1996, except for thyroid cancer, there has been no confirmed increase in the rates of other cancers, including leukemia, among the... public, that have been attributed to releases from the accident.&quot;

But equally important to the question of KI is the fact that radioactivity releases are not &quot;local&quot; events. Researchers at the World Health Organization accurately located and counted the residents with cancer from Chernobyl and were startled to find that &quot;the increase in incidence [of thyroid cancer] has been documented up to 500 km from the accident site... significant doses from radioactive iodine can occur hundreds of kilometers from the site, beyond emergency planning zones.&quot; Consequently, far more people than anticipated were affected by the radiation, which caused the United Nations to report in 2002 that &quot;The number of people with thyroid cancer... has exceeded expectations. Over 11,000 cases have already been reported.&quot;

===Hiroshima and Nagasaki===
The Chernobyl findings were consistent with studies of the effects of previous radioactivity releases. In 1945, several hundreds of thousands of people working and residing in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were exposed to high levels of radiation after atomic bombs were detonated over the two cities by the United States. Survivors of the A-bombings, also known as &quot;hibakusha&quot;, have markedly high rates of thyroid disease; a 2006 study of 4091 &quot;hibakusha&quot; found nearly half the participants (1833; 44.8%) had an identifiable thyroid disease.

An editorial in &quot;The Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; regarding thyroid diseases in both &quot;hibakusha&quot; and those affected by the Chernobyl disaster reports that &quot;[a] straight line adequately describes the relationship between radiation dose and thyroid cancer incidence&quot; and states &quot;it is remarkable that a biological effect from a single brief environmental exposure nearly 60 years in the past is still present and can be detected.&quot;

===Nuclear weapons testing===
The development of thyroid cancer among residents in the North Pacific from radioactive fallout following the United States&#x27; nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s (on islands nearly 200 miles downwind of the tests) were instrumental in the 1978 decision by the FDA to issue a request for the availability of KI for thyroid protection in the event of a release from a commercial nuclear power plant or weapons-related nuclear incident. Noting that KI&#x27;s effectiveness was &quot;virtually complete&quot; and finding that iodine in the form of KI was substantially superior to other forms including iodate (KIO3) in terms of safety, effectiveness, lack of side effects, and speed of onset, the FDA invited manufacturers to submit applications to produce and market KI.

===Fukushima===
It was reported on 16 March 2011, that potassium iodide tablets were given preventively to U.S. Naval air crew members flying within 70 nautical miles of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant damaged in the earthquake (8.9/9.0 magnitude) and ensuing tsunami on 11 March 2011. The measures were seen as precautions, and the Pentagon said no U.S. forces have shown signs of radiation poisoning. By 20 March, the US Navy instructed personnel coming within 100 miles of the reactor to take the pills.

===The Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, the central storage of iodine-pills is located in Zoetermeer, near The Hague. In 2017, the Dutch government distributed pills to hundreds of thousands of residents who lived within a certain distance of nuclear power plants and met some other criteria.

=== Belgium ===
By 2020, potassium iodide tablets are made available free of charge for all residents in all pharmacies throughout the country.

==Formulations==
Three companies (Anbex, Inc., Fleming Co, and Recipharm of Sweden) have met the strict FDA requirements for manufacturing and testing of KI, and they offer products (IOSAT, ThyroShield, and ThyroSafe, respectively) which are available for purchase. In 2012, Fleming Co. sold all its product rights and manufacturing facility to other companies and no longer exists. ThyroShield is currently not in production.

Tablets of potassium iodide are supplied for emergency purposes related to blockade of radioiodine uptake, a common form of radiation poisoning due to environmental contamination by the short-lived fission product . Potassium iodide may also be administered pharmaceutically for thyroid storm.

For reasons noted above, therapeutic drops of SSKI, or 130 mg tablets of KI as used for nuclear fission accidents, are not used as nutritional supplements, since an SSKI drop or nuclear-emergency tablet provides 300 to 700 times more iodine than the daily adult nutritional requirement. Dedicated nutritional iodide tablets containing 0.15 mg (150 micrograms (μg)) of iodide, from KI or from various other sources (such as kelp extract) are marketed as supplements, but they are not to be confused with the much higher pharmaceutical dose preparations.

Potassium iodide can be conveniently prepared in a saturated solution, abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide doesn&#x27;t require a method to weigh out the potassium iodide, thus allowing it to be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits at the bottom of the container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water thus SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148 grams per 100 grams of water. Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.00 gram (1000 mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of mass concentration) of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.67 g/mL. Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764 mg iodide per mL. This concentration of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51 mg per drop. It is conventionally rounded to 50 mg per drop.

The term SSKI is also used, especially by pharmacists, to refer to a U.S.P. pre-prepared solution formula, made by adding KI to water to prepare a solution containing 1000 mg KI per mL solution (100% wt/volume KI solution), to closely approximate the concentration of SSKI made by saturation. This is essentially interchangeable with SSKI made by saturation, and also contains about 50 mg iodide per drop.

*Saturated solutions of potassium iodide can be an emergency treatment for hyperthyroidism (so-called thyroid storm), as high amounts of iodide temporarily suppress secretion of thyroxine from the thyroid gland. The dose typically begins with a loading dose, then  mL SSKI (5 drops or 250 mg iodine as iodide), three times per day.
*Iodide solutions made from a few drops of SSKI added to drinks have also been used as expectorants to increase the water content of respiratory secretions and encourage effective coughing.
*SSKI has been proposed as a topical treatment for sporotrichosis, but no trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy or side effects of such treatment.
*Potassium iodide has been used for symptomatic treatment of erythema nodosum patients for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. It has been used in cases of erythema nodosum associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease.
*Due to its high potassium content, SSKI is extremely bitter, and if possible it is administered in a sugar cube or small ball of bread. It may also be mixed into much larger volumes of juices.
*Neither SSKI or KI tablets form nutritional supplements, since the nutritional requirement for iodine is only 150 micrograms (0.15 mg) of iodide per day. Thus, a drop of SSKI provides 50/0.15 = 333 times the daily iodine requirement, and a standard KI tablet provides twice this much.

<text>Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), as defined by IEEE standard 802.17, is a protocol designed for the transport of data traffic over optical fiber ring networks. The standard began development in November 2000 and has undergone several amendments since its initial standard was completed in June 2004. The amended standards are 802.17a through 802.17d, the last of which was adopted in May 2011. It is designed to provide the resilience found in SONET and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy networks (50 ms protection) but, instead of setting up circuit oriented connections, provides a packet based transmission, in order to increase the efficiency of Ethernet and IP services.

== Technical details ==
RPR works on a concept of dual counter rotating rings called ringlets. These ringlets are set up by creating RPR stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop, per flow (a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic). RPR uses Media Access Control protocol (MAC) messages to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and failed spans. The avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as &quot;steering&quot; and &quot;wrapping&quot;. Under steering, if a node or span is broken, all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic. In wrapping, the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station.

== Class of service and traffic queues ==
All traffic on the ring is assigned a Class of Service (CoS) and the standard specifies three classes. Class A (or High) traffic is a pure committed information rate (CIR) and is designed to support applications requiring low latency and jitter, such as voice and video. Class B (or Medium) traffic is a mix of both a CIR and an excess information rate (EIR; which is subject to fairness queuing). Class C (or Low) is best effort traffic, utilizing whatever bandwidth is available. This is primarily used to support Internet access traffic.

== Spatial reuse ==
Another concept within RPR is what is known as &quot;spatial reuse&quot;. Because RPR strips the signal once it reaches the destination (unlike a SONET UPSR/SDH SNCP ring, in which the bandwidth is consumed around the entire ring) it can reuse the freed space to carry additional traffic. The RPR standard also supports the use of learning bridges (IEEE 802.1D) to further enhance efficiency in point to multipoint applications and VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q).

One drawback of the first version of RPR was that it did not provide spatial reuse for frame transmission to/from MAC addresses not present in the ring topology. This was addressed by IEEE 802.17b, which defines an optional &quot;spatially aware sublayer&quot; (&quot;SAS&quot;). This allows spatial reuse for frame transmission to/from MAC address not present in the ring topology.

<text>The City of Denver was a streamlined passenger train operated by the Union Pacific Railroad between Chicago, Illinois, and Denver, Colorado. It operated between 1936 and 1971. From 1936–1955 the Chicago and North Western Railway handled the train east of Omaha, Nebraska; the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;) handled it thereafter. The train was the fastest long-distance train in the United States when it debuted in 1936, covering in 16 hours. For almost its entire career its principal competitor was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;. When Amtrak assumed operation of most intercity trains in the United States in 1971, it discontinued the &quot;City of Denver&quot;, preferring to use the Burlington&#x27;s route between Chicago and Denver.

On its launch in 1936 the &quot;City of Denver&quot; used a pair of articulated trainsets built by Pullman-Standard. The streamliners would remain in service until 1953, when conventional locomotive-hauled rolling stock replaced them. The &quot;City of Denver&quot; always carried both sleeping cars and coaches. A notable feature of the 1936 version of the train was the &quot;Frontier Shack&quot; tavern, which had the feel of a Western saloon.

==History==

The articulated streamliners of the 1930s consisted of power cars and passenger cars semi-permanently coupled together, with the cars sharing trucks. By the end of 1935 the Union Pacific Railroad already operated four such equipment sets, each on a different route: the M-10000 (&quot;City of Salina&quot;), M-10001 (&quot;City of Portland&quot;), M-10002 (&quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;), and M-10004 (&quot;City of San Francisco&quot;). While the M-10000 made the round-trip between Kansas City, Missouri, and Salina, Kansas, in a single day, the other three sets required multiple days to run from Chicago to their respective namesakes. The infrequent departure schedule led Union Pacific to advertise a train&#x27;s &quot;sailings&quot;, as though it were an ocean liner.

In December the Union Pacific and Chicago and North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) announced a new Chicago–Denver &quot;high-speed&quot; service, to be served by a pair of trainsets enabling daily service, the M-10005 and M-10006. The projected running time of 16 hours was a full nine hours faster than the best schedule at that time. The new trains had a maximum speed in excess of and averaged over the trip. This made it the fastest scheduled long-distance train in the United States. The Union Pacific emphasized that the improved schedule would &quot;save a business day.&quot;

At the same time the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, commonly known as the Burlington, had ordered two streamlined 10-car trainsets of its own: the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;, built by the Budd Company and modeled on the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot;, the first articulated streamliner in the United States. While the &quot;City of Denver&quot; beat the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; into service, making its first run between Chicago and Denver on June 18, 1936, on May 31 the Burlington had deployed two of its existing trainsets, the original &quot;Zephyr&quot; and the &quot;Mark Twain Zephyr&quot;, on its own route between Chicago and Denver as the Advance Denver Zephyr. While as fast as the &quot;City of Denver&quot;, the three-car sets in no way compared to amenities aboard the 12-car Union Pacific streamliners, which included the &quot;Frontier Shack&quot; tavern, a dining-cocktail lounge, and a sleeper-lounge-observation car. The Burlington&#x27;s new equipment would arrive in November. The two services operated on nearly-identical schedules. Fulfilling its early promise, the &quot;City of Denver&quot; traveled at an average speed of , the fastest of the Union Pacific&#x27;s streamliners.

The competition between the two trains remained unchanged for nearly twenty years. Even as it upgraded and replaced its other streamliners, Union Pacific kept the original trainsets on the route until 1953, finally introducing new lightweight equipment in 1953–1954. The following year, on October 30, 1955, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the &quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;) began handling the Union Pacific&#x27;s streamliners east of Omaha, replacing the C&amp;NW. The Burlington replaced the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;&#x27;s equipment in 1956. With both trains sporting new equipment competition intensified. The Burlington included &quot;Vista-Dome&quot; dome cars on the &quot;Zephyr&quot;; within a year the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Super Domes began making appearances on the &quot;City of Denver&quot;. The Burlington also began operating a slumbercoach, an innovative economy sleeping car. Having none of its own, the Union Pacific leased two all-roomette Pennsylvania Railroad sleeping cars and billed it as &quot;Slumbercoach service.&quot; Nevertheless, in the words of railroad historian Joe Welsh the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; &quot;made mincemeat of the UP&#x27;s &quot;City of Denver&quot;.&quot;

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s the Union Pacific gradually downgraded its passenger services and consolidated trains as losses mounted. The westbound &quot;City of Denver&quot; and &quot;City of Portland&quot; began joint operation in 1959. On September 7, 1969, the Union Pacific combined five of its Chicago–West Coast streamliners into a single massive train dubbed by critics the &quot;City of Everywhere.&quot; This train included the &quot;City of Denver&quot;, &quot;City of Kansas City&quot;, &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;City of Portland&quot;, and &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. Amtrak, which took over most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971, kept a Chicago–Denver train but preferred the Burlington&#x27;s route. The &quot;City of Denver&quot; made its last run on April 30, 1971.

== Route ==

Between 1936–1955 the &quot;City of Denver&quot; used the Chicago and North Western Railway between Chicago and Omaha. After 1955 it used the Milwaukee Road. The train&#x27;s Union Pacific route west of Omaha remained unchanged for the duration. The train followed the Overland Route from Omaha to Julesburg, where it diverged southwest for Denver. In March 1950 it made the following stops west of Omaha: Columbus, Grand Island, Kearney, and North Platte in Nebraska and Julesburg in Colorado. On the C&amp;NW it made the following stops west of Chicago, all in Iowa: Cedar Rapids, Ames, Boone, and Council Bluffs. The westbound train departed Chicago&#x27;s Chicago and North Western Terminal at 5:00 PM and arrived at Denver&#x27;s Union Station at 8:30 AM the following morning.

With the switch to the Milwaukee Road the train&#x27;s Chicago terminus shifted to Union Station. In June 1960 the &quot;City of Denver&quot; stopped in Davis Junction (for Rockford) and Savanna in Illinois, Marion (for Cedar Rapids) and Perry in Iowa. West of Omaha the station stops were unchanged. The new routing forced new timing; the westbound &quot;City of Denver&quot; departed Chicago at 3:45 PM and arrived in Denver at 7:35 AM the following morning. Although the new route took 20 minutes longer, by an odd coincidence it was exactly the same length as the previous one, at .

== Equipment ==

Pullman-Standard and the Electro-Motive Corporation collaborated on the M-10005 and M-10006 streamlined trainsets which served as the &quot;City of Denver&quot;&#x27;s original equipment. They were soon joined by the spare locomotive set M-10003 and the three (two plus backup) were used to provide daily service until they were replaced in 1953. The former M-10004 car set was also used while either of the two primary sets were down for refurbishing. Each set originally contained a two-car power set, with each unit developing . The power sets were upgraded with a second booster in mid-1939. Behind the power car was a baggage car with auxiliary power, a baggage-tavern car (containing the famed &quot;Frontier Shack&quot;), two 50-seat coaches, a dining-cocktail lounge, three sleeping cars in varying configurations, and a sleeper-lounge-observation car.

The 50-seat coaches featured 2x2 seating, with baggage racks in the vestibule end and separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.

The two trainsets remained in use until March 19, 1953, when the Union Pacific introduced conventional lightweight equipment powered by EMD locomotive sets. The Union Pacific finalized the consist on January 10, 1954. Each of the two new consists included the following: a baggage car, a coach-lounge (the &quot;Pub&quot;, replacing the &quot;Frontier Shack&quot;), two 44-seat coaches, a twin-unit dining car, four sleeping cars, and a buffet-lounge. The cars were drawn from both the Union Pacific and the Chicago and North Western. The sleeping cars included two 10-roomette 6-double bedroom Pacific-series cars, a 12-section car, and a 4-compartment 4-double bedroom 1-compartment car. For a brief period in the late 1950s two leased Pennsylvania Railroad 21-roomette sleeping cars operated on the &quot;City of Denver&quot; to compete with the slumbercoaches on the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;. After the discontinuance of the Chicago–Pacific Northwest &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; in 1961, the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Super Dome dome lounges could be found on the &quot;City of Denver&quot; as well.

<text>St Helens Fort is a sea fort in the Solent close to the Isle of Wight, one of the Palmerston Forts near Portsmouth. It was built as a result of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom of 1859, in order to protect the St Helens anchorage.

The fort was designed by Captain E. H. Stewart, overseen by Assistant Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1878, at a cost of £123,311. It suffered badly from subsidence which forced many changes to the plans, ending up with two 10-inch 18-ton rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns to landward and one 12.5-inch 38-ton RML gun to seaward.

The other sea forts, all larger, are Spitbank Fort, Horse Sand Fort and No Man&#x27;s Land Fort.
The Solent Forts - often known as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Follies&quot; - were built in response to a French invasion scare under Louis Napoleon III. This was due in part to the doctrines of the &quot;Jeune École&quot; of French naval thinking, which emphasised attacking ports with small craft, instead of fleet action, as well as the launch of the first ironclad warship, the &quot;Gloire&quot;. The threat of war with France receded after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71 ended in French defeat.

The forts were later used for defence in both World War I and WWII, although the heavier armaments proved unpopular with local householders due to the concussion breaking windows during firing practice. A National Trust report states that during WW II, it was &quot;used as a searchlight and anti-aircraft gun platform&quot;.

Subsequently their main useful role has been as navigational lighthouses. Periodically (often in August), on one of the lowest tides of the year, there is a mass walk from St Helens beach out to the fort and back. At this day the causeway appears from the sea upon which the original materials were carried out from the shore at St Helen&#x27;s Old Church, where there was formerly a quarry. Access is from this point, but also along the spit from Bembridge. It has become traditional to hold a barbecue on the beach thereafter. This event is entirely spontaneous but safety boat services are provided by local yacht clubs and the RNLI.

The fort is now in private hands and not open to the public. It was offered for sale in 2003. Any private resident would not have access to local authority services, although it has its own artesian well. As of 2020, Spitbank, No Man&#x27;s Land and Horse Sand Forts were also privately owned (by Clarenco); the first two had been converted into hotels after a major restoration.

<text>The European School Munich (ESM) is one of thirteen European Schools and one of three located in Germany. Founded in 1977, it moved to its current location in Neuperlach, a district in southeastern Munich. The ESM was principally established to serve the schooling needs of children of the staff of the European Patent Office (EPO) — the executive body of the European Patent Organisation. However, enrolment is open to other prospective students, albeit with a tuition fee. The school offers the European Baccalaureate as its secondary leaving qualification.

== Admission ==
For the purposes of admission, prospective students are divided into three different categories, depending on multiple factors, mainly their parent&#x27;s employment status.

=== Category I ===
* Includes children of employees of the European Patent Office in Munich, of European Union institutions, of teachers, and of administrative and ancillary staff of the school. These children are required to be admitted to the school, and parents are exempt from paying tuition fees.

=== Category II ===
* Includes children covered by individual agreements or decisions, each entailing specific rights and obligations for the children concerned, particularly regarding tuition fees.

=== Category III ===
* Includes children not belonging to categories I and II. These children are given the least priority and may be admitted to a limited extent per relevant policy.

== Tuition fees ==
The following table displays the tuition fees for the school year 2024/2025, p.a., required to be paid by category III students.
== Notable people ==

=== Former alumni ===
*Bas Kast, German author
*Christian Keysers, German neuroscientist
*Peter Pomerantsev, British journalist and TV producer

=== Former staff ===
* Tom Høyem, school Director (1994-2000)

<text>No Man&#x27;s Land Fort, also referred to as No Man&#x27;s Fort, is a sea fort in the Solent, near Portsmouth, England. It is one of the Palmerston Forts built between 1867 and 1880 after the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission. It is in diameter, and lies off the coast of the Isle of Wight.

==History==
The fort was designed by Captain E. H. Stewart, overseen by Assistant Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction work began in 1865, and the fort was completed in 1880, long after the threat of a seaborne invasion from France had passed, at a cost of £462,500.

A 2020 report stated that during the Second World War, &quot;the forts were used to defend the Portsmouth dockyards. Life on site was grim; those serving were deliberately chosen for their inability to swim, to avoid any attempt to escape&quot;.

No Man&#x27;s Land Fort is almost identical to Horse Sand Fort. It has been used as a luxury home/hospitality centre for high-paying guests – due to the privacy it offers – with an indoor swimming pool and two helipads. In July 2004, Legionella bacteria found in the hotel&#x27;s water system forced its closure. The Fort was put up for sale in 2005 and again in 2007, but the company collapsed. In March 2008, Harmesh Pooni, claiming to still be the owner, barricaded himself inside the fort in protest against the administrators KPMG.

The property was eventually sold by KPMG for £910,000 in March 2009. In March 2012, it was purchased by Clarenco LLP who also purchased Spitbank Fort and Horse Sand Fort, with the intention of refurbishing it as a hotel. The fort opened as a hotel in April 2015.

Other sea forts include Spitbank Fort, St Helens Fort and Horse Sand Fort.

An October 2018 report stated that &quot;the 22-suite No Man’s [was] open for business, whether overnight stays, corporate events or weddings&quot;.

In 2020, No Man&#x27;s Land Fort, Spitbank Fort and Horse Sand Fort were listed for sale. No Man&#x27;s Fort was described as a &quot;99,000 sq ft hotel, restaurant and leisure complex on four floors, including a helipad&quot;. It was sold at auction in 2024 for slightly over a £1million.

==In popular culture==
The 1972 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; used the fort as a filming location for several scenes.

<text>Jönssonligan får guldfeber (&quot;The Johnsson Gang gets Gold Fever&quot; - International: English title ) is a Swedish film about the gang Jönssonligan made in 1984.

The film includes a famous scene, where Jönssonligan&#x27;s leader, Sickan Jönsson, is tied to the hands of a giant clock on the tower of the Stockholm City Hall. The clock doesn&#x27;t exist in real life, but was created for the film. The reason for this is that the movie is a remake of the Danish film &quot;Olsen-bandens store kup&quot;, and the tower of Copenhagen City Hall does indeed have a clock.

<doc id="1014393" wikidata="Q4122379" url="?curid=1014393" title="Leucorchestris arenicola">
<text>Leucorchestris arenicola, commonly called the dancing white lady spider, is a huntsman spider in the family &quot;Sparassidae&quot; and genus &quot;Leucorchestris.&quot; It is commonly found in the Namib desert of Namibia. It is often mistaken with the similarly named &quot;Carparachne aureoflava,&quot; or more commonly known as the wheel spider from the same location. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; relies on seismic vibrations, called drumming, for communication. It taps its foremost legs on the sand to send messages to other white lady spiders. Male &quot;L. arenicola&quot; will travel over 50 m in one night searching for a mate. If they find a mate, they must be extremely careful, for drumming the wrong message can be deadly. One of the major features that characterizes its nocturnal behavior is its specialized vision, using eight eyes in different orientations to capture a panoramic view of the surroundings. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; spiders use temporal summation in order to be able to see dim lighting during night-time wanderings. The species was first described by Reginald Frederick Lawrence in 1962, who described all the species in the genus &quot;Leucorchestris&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; have a creamy, white shading. Their bodies can be up to long. Males may have leg spans up to . Males differ from females in that they are lighter in weight with longer leg spans.

=== Identifying between sexes ===
Leg spination is the most reliable way to differentiate between sexes among &quot;L. arenicola.&quot; Between 5 and 8 legs of males contain a median tibia dorsal spine. When this feature is found in females, it will only be seen on a maximum of 4 legs. However, females will rarely have this spine. Other characteristics, including eye arrangement, pedipalp structure, tibial claws, and prosoma dimensions, do not predict differences in sex.

== Habitat and distribution ==
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; are found primarily in desert regions of Namibia, particularly the dunes of the Namib Desert. The spiders reside in burrows with a territory that extend across an approximate 3 meter radius within bare dunes of the region. As exclusively nocturnal creatures, &quot;L. arenicola&quot; spiders remain hidden in their burrows to protect themselves from the heat of the desert sun.

=== Burrows ===
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; stay within their burrows throughout the day and then wander beyond their territory radius at night. Burrows are dug into the sand and are lined with silk. The burrows may be up to 40 cm long, 25 cm deep, and at about a 30 degree angle. The specificity of the burrow&#x27;s dimensions create cooler temperatures in which the spiders preferentially reside. Silk may also be used to hold loose sand in place. The burrow wall is stabilized using long spigots on their long spinnerets to interweave the sand as far as 3 millimeters deep. The burrows are usually occupied for a couple of months. Burrows are sometimes covered by a camouflaged covering.

== Diet ==
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; are considered polyphagous since they can feed on a large variety of foods that remain constant across seasons. This can vary from insects, to arachnids, and reptiles. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; prey on over 97 species within these categories. The majority of the prey are also nocturnal organisms and consist of beetles, moths, and weevils. However, this depends on the region and territory occupied by the spider, based on the surrounding fauna.

=== Foraging ===
Foraging usually occurs within a 3 m radius of the burrow, and rarely occurs during night wanderings beyond this radius. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; forage for food for several nights, followed by a period of rest. Most of the prey captured are two-thirds the size of the spider or smaller, but every few weeks, &quot;L. arenicola&quot; capture larger prey that can be greater than 3 mm. The foraging strategy used by &quot;L. arenicola&quot; is a sit-and-wait strategy, whereby they sit idly within their territory and wait until prey arrive. Some &quot;L. arenicola&quot;, especially the larger males, engage in cannibalism. This is often due to increased competition and food shortages in their territory.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; engage in reproductive patterns with consistent incubation periods of 15 days. This seasonality of reproduction is largely due to the male spiders, who spend the winter months molting to adulthood, while female spiders are present year-round. This is evidenced by the reduction in eggs found during winter months. Egg clutches are enclosed in a 5 mm thick cocoon, hidden about 12 cm deep in the burrow. There are about 76 eggs on an average per clutch. Spinning the cocoon takes up a significant amount of the female spider&#x27;s energy. She loses about 5 mg in weight upon completing it.

== Mating ==

=== Long-distance wandering ===
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; engage in long-distance wandering late at night in pursuit of mates before returning to their burrows. Male &quot;L. arenicola&quot; venture anywhere from 16 to 91 m outside of their radius, and walk approximately 42 to 314 m within that radius. During this time, males venture into female territories, mating with up to 50% of the female spiders they come across. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; is a promiscuous species, engaging in mating behaviors upon encountering a spider of the opposite sex. Female and spiderling &quot;L. arenicola&quot; also wander in the dark; however, they remain within their 3 m radius.

==== Mortality risk ====
During the long-distance wandering at night, male &quot;L. arenicola&quot; sometimes disappear. This may be due to predation by gerbils and other desert species. Female &quot;L. arenicole&quot; live approximately 6 months, while males live 1–2 months. This can be partially attributed to the increased risk of mortality upon nocturnal wandering beyond the 3 m territory radius. Furthermore, during vibrational signaling for mating, males risk getting attacked and killed by female &quot;L. arenicola&quot; if their signal is not distinguishable enough from prey.

==== Male-male interactions ====
During long-distance wandering, male &quot;L. arenicola&quot; may encounter up to five other male territories. Males compete for mates during long-distance wanderings and often display aggressive and warning signals to other males. Male &quot;L. arenicola&quot; may interfere with another male in the process of mating. This applies especially for larger males. Roughly 50% of the mating behavior is dominated by 8% of the males in a region, of which all are larger in size. For males that do not differ greatly in size, they must avoid any confrontation with larger males. These males will signal for other males to keep away via a sand drumming display. Drumming is seen mostly during wandering away from the burrow and has adapted as a method of signaling other adult &quot;L. arenicola&quot; of its presence, either for mating purposes or to keep away.

==== Female-male interactions ====
Male and female &quot;L. arenicola&quot; sometimes mate on successive nights. The frequency of mating is related to the male&#x27;s size, with larger males tending to mate more than smaller males. Mating is limited to a small group of females. Smaller females do not tend to mate as much due to reduced fecundity. When males encounter a female burrow, they use vibrational signaling through the sand to alert the female of its presence. However, the male must ensure that these seismic signals are distinguishable from those of other predators to prevent being attacked and killed by the female spider.

== Physiology ==

=== Vision ===
&quot;L. arenicola&quot; have eight eyes, with four eyes on the anterior side of the carapace and four on the posterior side. Based on their position, the eyes fall under the name anterior median eyes (AMEs), anterior lateral eyes (ALEs), posterior median eyes (PMEs), or the posterior lateral eyes (PLEs). AMEs are the main eyes, while the others are considered secondary eyes. AMEs are classified as principal eyes because they have a reversed retina with muscles that have control over the direction and magnitude of the receptive field, while ALEs, PMEs, and PLEs have no muscular retinal control and an inverse retina with a reflecting tapetum behind it which aids in night vision. 
==== Visual fields ====
The visual fields of the lateral eyes (ALEs and PLEs) are elongated along a horizontal plane and overlap. This allows the spiders to have an extensive receptive field across the horizontal plane. AMEs had circular visual fields that appear to be forward looking and also overlapped, while PMEs have overlapping visual fields that integrates upper planes of sight. Together these visual fields produce a full panoramic visualization of the spider&#x27;s surroundings. AMEs, PLEs, and ALEs are involved in nocturnal navigation, while PMEs are not.

==== Role of vision in nocturnal navigation ====
Although seismic communication via drumming and other vibrational mechanisms assist in navigation in the dark, vision is a major factor in nocturnal navigation. This differs from other spider species, in which vision does not play a significant role in nocturnal visualization. &quot;L. arenicola&quot; have visual fields that span an entire panoramic visualization of surroundings. The spider’s eight eyes assist in this ability to visualize one’s surroundings. Each eye is enabled to specialize and fine tune its function for specific visual tasks. In the case of &quot;L. arenicola&quot;, this specialization is in navigation. Eyes are composed of one photopigment that best captures light of about 550 nm. However, they have weak temporal resolution in dark conditions. In order to be able to see at night, &quot;L. arenicola&quot; use temporal summation for navigation across the dunes. Temporal summation of visual stimuli allows multiple stimuli to be integrated to capture visual information in dim lighting. The disadvantage to this adaptation is that quickly-moving object cannot be seen, since each temporal sum takes about 1 second.

<text>Kris Kross were an American hip hop duo, composed of rappers Chris &quot;Mac Daddy&quot; Kelly and Chris &quot;Daddy Mac&quot; Smith, formed by record producer Jermaine Dupri. They were the youngest hip-hop group to gain commercial success, with several charting releases by the ages of 12 and 13 years old, respectively. Smith and Kelly were discovered by Dupri in 1991, to whom they signed as the first act on his record label So So Def Recordings. 

The duo saw national recognition the following year with their 1992 debut single, &quot;Jump&quot;, which remained atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for eight weeks and received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). They went on to release three studio albums; their debut, &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot; (1992) peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while their second and third, &quot;Da Bomb&quot; (1993) and &quot;Young, Rich &amp; Dangerous&quot; (1996), both entered the top 20. The duo were also noted for their signature fashion style of backwards-clad attire.
Kelly died of a drug overdose on May 1, 2013.

==History==

The friendship of Atlanta, Georgia natives James Christopher Kelly (August 11, 1978 – May 1, 2013) and Christopher Smith (born January 10, 1979), began in first grade. The duo was discovered at Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta in 1990 by then-18-year-old Jermaine Dupri. According to Dupri, Kelly and Smith were not pursuing a record deal and were not rappers or musicians when he met them. He was impressed with their style, and Kris Kross became the first artists signed to Dupri&#x27;s So So Def label.

===1992: &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot;===
Along with Dupri, the two signed a deal with Ruffhouse Records and recorded their debut album &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot;. Entirely produced by Dupri, &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot; was released on March 31, 1992, and sold four million copies in the U.S. It included the hit single &quot;Jump&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and held that position for eight weeks.

The music videos from the album also experienced major success. The video for &quot;Jump&quot;, directed by filmmaker Rich Murray, went to No. 1 on MTV and sold over 100,000 copies as a VHS video single. The video for their follow-up single, &quot;Warm It Up&quot;, also directed by Murray, won a &quot;Billboard&quot; video award for &quot;Best New Artist&quot;, and got to No. 14 the same year as &quot;Jump&quot;. Writes &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;&#x27; Jim Farber: &quot;Together, that was enough to propel the duo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot;, to multi-platinum status.&quot;

===1992–1996: Michael Jackson tour and additional media projects===
The duo landed a spot on Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1992 European Dangerous World Tour as well as a cameo appearance on Jackson&#x27;s music video for his 1992 single &quot;Jam&quot;. Additionally, they made appearances in the music videos for Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s &quot;Down with the King&quot; (1993) and TLC&#x27;s &quot;Hat 2 da Back&quot; (1992), and they were featured in an episode of &quot;A Different World&quot; and as the closing musical act on the May 29, 1992, episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot;.

A video game starring the pair, titled &quot;Kris Kross: Make My Video&quot;, was released in 1992 on the Sega CD system. It consisted of the players editing together the group&#x27;s music videos for a few of their hit songs using portions of the original music videos, stock footage, and general video animation effects. Players were prompted before each editing session to make sure to have certain footage compiled into the video. It was ranked 18th on &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;20 Worst Games of All Time&quot;. Kris Kross made a cameo appearance in Ted Demme&#x27;s film &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot; (1993), which starred rapper Ed Lover and radio personality Doctor Dré of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; fame.

Kris Kross were also part of the promotional campaign for Sprite in 1993 of which they recorded an exclusive rap, a promotional photoshoot, and a commercial for the brand.

===1993: &quot;Da Bomb&quot;===
The duo&#x27;s second album, &quot;Da Bomb&quot; (1993), was certified platinum and spawned the hits &quot;Alright&quot; featuring Super Cat, &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot;, and &quot;Da Bomb&quot; featuring Da Brat, whom Smith had discovered. Most of their songs had been directed at rivals Da Youngstas, Illegal, and Another Bad Creation.

===1996: &quot;Young, Rich &amp; Dangerous&quot;===
A third album, &quot;Young, Rich &amp; Dangerous&quot;, was released in early 1996 and was certified gold. It spawned the two hits &quot;Tonite&#x27;s tha Night&quot; and &quot;Live and Die for Hip Hop&quot;.

===Education===
Both members of Kris Kross went to Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia. Kelly studied mix-engineering, and founded C Connection Records. Smith studied marketing and business management and founded One Life Entertainment, Inc.

===Final show===
Kris Kross&#x27; last performance was in their hometown at the Fox Theatre for So So Def&#x27;s 20th Anniversary concert on February 23, 2013.

==Death of Chris Kelly==
On April 29, 2013, Chris Kelly was found unconscious in his Atlanta home and taken to the hospital. Two days later, on May 1, he was pronounced dead around 5 p.m. on the south campus of the Atlanta Medical Center; he was 34 years old. Apparently one day before he was found unconscious, he filmed himself rapping in his home. According to the police report documents, Kelly had been brought home to recover from his drug use, as he had done several times in the past. His uncle told police that Kelly &quot;had an extensive history of drug abuse.&quot;

The following day, Producer Jermaine Dupri tweeted a &quot;letter to fans&quot;, in which he referred to Kelly as &quot;a son that I never had&quot;, and praised Kelly as an artist. Chris Smith wrote, &quot;Chris Kelly was my Best Friend. He was like a brother. I love him and will miss him dearly. Our friendship began as little boys in first grade. We grew up together. It was a blessing to achieve the success, travel the world and entertain Kris Kross fans all around the world with my best friend. It is what we wanted to do and what brought us happiness. I will always cherish the memories of the C-Connection.&quot;

Numerous other artists and fans publicly acknowledged Kelly&#x27;s death, some citing Kris Kross or Kelly as their inspiration or their reason for entering the music industry. On July 1, a toxicology report was released stating that Kelly died from a drug overdose. According to the Fulton County Medical Examiner Office, the toxicology screening showed that Kelly had a mixture of drugs in his system, including heroin and cocaine.

<text>The PERQ, also referred to as the Three Rivers PERQ or ICL PERQ, is a pioneering workstation computer produced in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. It is the first commercially-produced personal workstation with a graphical user interface (GUI). The design of the PERQ was heavily influenced by the original workstation computer, the Xerox Alto, which was never commercially produced. The workstation was conceived by six former Carnegie Mellon University alumni and employees: Brian S. Rosen, James R. Teter, William H. Broadley, J. Stanley Kriz, Raj Reddy and Paul G. Newbury, who formed the startup Three Rivers Computer Corporation (3RCC) in 1974.

The name &quot;PERQ&quot; was chosen both as an acronym of &quot;Pascal Engine that Runs Quicker,&quot; and to evoke the word &quot;perquisite&quot; commonly called a &quot;perk&quot;, that is an additional employee benefit.

In June 1979, the company took its very first order from the UK&#x27;s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the computer was officially launched in August 1979 at SIGGRAPH in Chicago. 3RCC later entered into a relationship with the British computer company International Computers Limited (ICL) in 1981 for European distribution, and later co-development and manufacturing, as a result of interest from the UK Science Research Council (later, the Science and Engineering Research Council).

The PERQ was used in a number of academic research projects in the UK during the 1980s. 3RCC was renamed PERQ System Corporation in 1984. It went out of business in 1986, largely due to competition from other workstation manufacturers such as Sun Microsystems, Apollo Computer and Silicon Graphics.

Brian Rosen, one of the founders of 3RCC, also worked at Xerox PARC on the Dolphin workstation.

==Hardware==
=== Processor ===
The PERQ CPU was a microcoded discrete logic design, rather than a microprocessor. It was based around 74S181 bit-slice ALUs and an Am2910 microcode sequencer. The PERQ CPU was unusual in having 20-bit wide registers and a writable control store (WCS), allowing the microcode to be redefined. The CPU had a microinstruction cycle period of 170 ns (5.88 MHz).

===PERQ 1===
The original PERQ (also known as the &quot;PERQ 1&quot;), launched in 1980, was housed in a pedestal-type cabinet with a brown fascia and an 8-inch floppy disk drive mounted horizontally at the top.

The PERQ 1 CPU had a WCS comprising 4k words of 48-bit microcode memory. The later &quot;PERQ 1A&quot; CPU extended the WCS to 16k words. The PERQ 1 could be configured with 256 KB, 1 or 2 MB of 64-bit-wide RAM (accessed via a 16-bit bus), a 12 or 24 MB, 14-inch Shugart SA-4000-series hard disk, and an 8-inch floppy disk drive. The internal layout of the PERQ 1 was dominated by the vertically mounted hard disk drive. It was largely this that determined the height and depth of the chassis.

A basic PERQ 1 system comprised a CPU board, a memory board (incorporating the framebuffer and monitor interface) and an I/O board (IOB, also called CIO). The IOB included a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, an IEEE-488 interface, an RS-232 serial port, hard and floppy disk interfaces and speech synthesis hardware. PERQ 1s also had a spare Optional I/O (OIO) board slot for additional interfaces such as Ethernet.

A graphics tablet was standard. Most PERQ 1s were supplied with an 8½ ×11-inch, 768×1024 pixel, portrait orientation, white phosphor monochrome monitor.

===PERQ 2===
The &quot;PERQ 2&quot; (codenamed &quot;Kristmas&quot; during development) was announced in 1983. The PERQ 2 could be distinguished from the PERQ 1 by its wider, ICL-designed cabinet, with a lighter-coloured fascia, vertical floppy disk drive and three-digit diagnostic display.

The PERQ 2 used the same 16k WCS CPU as the PERQ 1A and had a 3-button mouse in place of the graphics tablet. It was configured with a quieter 8-inch 35 MB Micropolis Corporation 1201 hard disk, 1 or 2 MB of RAM and had the option of the PERQ 1&#x27;s portrait monitor or a 19-inch, 1280×1024 landscape orientation monitor.

Due to manufacturing problems with the original 3RCC PERQ 2 (also known as the &quot;K1&quot;), ICL revised the hardware design, resulting in the &quot;PERQ 2 T1&quot; (or ICL 8222).

The later &quot;PERQ 2 T2&quot; (ICL 8223) and &quot;PERQ 2 T4&quot; models replaced the 8-inch hard disk with a 5¼-inch hard disk, which also allowed for a second disk to be installed internally.

The T4 model (of which only around 10 are thought to have been produced) had an extended 24-bit CPU and backplane bus, allowing the use of a 4MB RAM board.

The PERQ 2 retained the PERQ 1&#x27;s OIO slot, but replaced the IOB with either an EIO (Ethernet I/O) or NIO (Non-Ethernet I/O) boards. These were similar to the IOB, with the addition of a non-volatile real-time clock, a second RS-232 port, and (on the EIO board) an Ethernet interface.

=== PERQ 3 ===
The &quot;PERQ 3A&quot; (otherwise known as the ICL 3300 Advanced Graphics Workstation) was developed by ICL as a replacement for the PERQ 2. The PERQ 3A had an all-new hardware architecture based around a 12.5 MHz Motorola 68020 microprocessor, 68881 floating-point unit and 68450 Direct Memory Access Controller, plus two AMD 29116A 32-bit bit slice processors which acted as graphics co-processors. It also had up to 2 MB of RAM, a SCSI hard disk and was housed in a desktop &quot;mini-tower&quot;-style enclosure. The operating system was a port of UNIX System V Release 2 called PNX 300. Prototype units were produced in 1985, but the project was cancelled before full production commenced (the project had run late and ICL decided it was a solution provider - it would sell Sun workstations as part of the solution).

Another workstation design under development at the time of the company&#x27;s demise, the &quot;PERQ 3B&quot; was a colour model (sometimes referred to as the &quot;PERQ 5&quot;) was taken over by Crosfield Electronics for its Crosfield Studio 9500 page layout workstation. The workstation was also known internally as Python, was developed in 1986 jointly by MegaScan and Conner Scelza Associates (both in Gibsonia, PA, U.S.A.) and the Crosfield team (in Hemel Hempstead, England). MegaScan, led by Brian Rosen, developed the workstation electronics and Conner Scelza Associates (led by Jerry Conner and Don Scelza) ported UNIX and wrote all the other supporting software. Crosfield (led by Andrew Chapman) were the overall project managers and had embedded engineers in MegaScan (Simon Butler and Mark Somervail) and Conner Scelza (Roger Willcocks).

The Crosfield requirement was for a very high performance graphics system (known as Viper, developed by their subsidiary benchMark Technologies) and a large (at the time) amount of disk storage. The Crosfield team in Hemel Hempstead developed an early RAID solution that supported up to 8 SCSI controllers operating in parallel with data streaming from 5¼-inch full-height drives and a fast fibre-optic network known as GALAN. Prototypes were running in late 1986 in both the US and UK and volume production from Crosfield&#x27;s Peterborough factory started early 1987.

===Peripherals===
Various optional OIO boards were produced for the PERQ 1 and 2: 3RCC OIO boards provided a 16-bit parallel PERQlink interface (intended for downloading microcode from another PERQ at boot time) plus Ethernet or a Canon CX laser printer controller. Thus, a PERQ 2 could be configured with two Ethernet ports (EIO plus OIO). A dot-matrix printer could also be connected to the RS-232 or IEEE-488 ports. Other third-party OIO boards were produced to interface to other devices, such as QIC-02 tape drives or video cameras.

==Software==

The PERQ&#x27;s original p-Code-like instruction set (called &quot;Q-Code&quot;) was optimized for Pascal (specifically, an extended PERQ Pascal). Q-Code instructions could be executed at a rate of up to 1 million instructions per second. This gave rise to the alternative definition of the PERQ name: &quot;Pascal Evaluation Real Quick&quot;. In fact it was generally more efficient to use Pascal than to attempt to create &quot;assembly language&quot; programs directly with Q-Code.

===Operating systems===
A variety of operating systems were developed for the PERQ. These included:

;POS (PERQ Operating System): The initial single-task operating system for PERQ workstations, developed by 3RCC. POS and its utilities were written in PERQ Pascal.

;MPOS (Multitasking POS): A multitasking version of POS, not officially released by 3RCC.

;Accent: A multitasking research operating system developed at CMU, with a window manager called Sapphire. Accent was a predecessor of the Mach kernel which many later operating systems would use. A UNIX System V-compatible environment running under Accent in a Sapphire window, called &quot;QNIX&quot;, was developed by Spider Systems.

;PNX ( ): A port of Unix for the PERQ, based on Seventh Edition Unix and UNIX System III. This was developed by ICL at Bracknell, Dalkeith Palace and later Kidsgrove (Staffordshire) for the UK research community. PNX used its own microcode, more appropriate for the C programming language, called &quot;C-Code&quot;.

;FLEX: Developed by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, FLEX was implemented in microcode and similar to other early workstation systems such as Lisp machines, UCSD Pascal or Modula-2, except that the language of choice was ALGOL 68.

=== Compilers ===

ICL and 3RCC contracted with the Edinburgh Regional Computing Center (ERCC) over 1981-1982 to supply an optimised Fortran77 compiler. This also resulted in an Imp compiler being created, as the F77 compiler from the ERCC was written in Imp. The ERCC compilers generated Q-Code. By 1987, maintenance of the PERQ compiler suite had been taken over by a commercial spin-off group of ex-ERCC employees, Edinburgh Portable Compilers Ltd (EPCL).

===Applications===

The PERQ was a popular early graphical workstation; therefore, it helped spawn many early third-party applications that took advantage of the graphical user interface and bitmapped graphics. Intran (around 1982) produced a pioneering graphical program suite called MetaForm, which consisted of the separate Graphics Builder, Font Builder, Form Builder, and File Manager programs. The PERQ also served as a dedicated platform for several pioneering hypertext programs, such as ZOG, KMS, and Guide. DP (&quot;Drawing Program&quot;), a CAD system used for creating circuit diagrams on the PERQ, was written by Dario Giuse at CMU.
